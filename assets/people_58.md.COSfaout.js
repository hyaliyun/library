Since 2000, an opt-out of the main programme has also covered Oxfordshire, small parts of eastern Gloucestershire, western Buckinghamshire and southern Northamptonshire. Overview The BBC began broadcasting a regional TV news programme for the south of England (then known as South at Six, but changing to the current title in the mid 1960s) in January 1961, getting on air four months before the launch of Southern Television's rival magazine programme Day by Day. Originally, the BBC's Southampton operations were based in South Western House, the former Cunard shipping line headquarters near the city's docks. In 1991, the programme moved to purpose-built studios in Havelock Road. The original presenter was Martin Muncaster. Bruce Parker joined the programme in 1967 and remained as a regular presenter until 1989, continuing to provide holiday cover and present weekend bulletins until 2003. The current main presenter, Sally Taylor, started co-presenting the programme in 1987 (replacing Debbie Thrower), initially alongside Parker and then successively with Paddy Haycocks, Mark Longhurst, Harry Gration, Andrew Harvey and Roger Finn, but in recent years she has been the regular solo presenter of the main programme. Currently, South Today produces 11 bulletins each weekday: six bulletins in the morning during BBC Breakfast, a 15-minute programme at 13:30, the half-hour main programme at 18:30, a headlines update at 20:00 and a late night bulletin (Monday to Thursday at 22:30, running for 15 minutes and every Friday at 22:25, running for 10 minutes). Weekend news bulletins are also broadcast. These include early evening bulletins on Saturday and Sunday and a late night bulletin on Sundays, following the BBC News at Ten. The times of these bulletins usually vary. The programme is broadcast live from studios in Southampton. Prior to September 2001, South Today's region included areas served by the Heathfield transmitter and its relays which covered eastern Sussex and southern Kent. These areas are now covered by the BBC's South East Today. Following digital switchover on 7 March 2012, the Whitehawk Hill transmitter. Oxford opt-out Since 16 October 2000, BBC South has produced a distinct news service for the area served by the Oxford transmitter. Previously, the area was covered by Newsroom South East, which also served Greater London and the south east. As part of a three-tier restructure of regional coverage, the Oxford transmitter area was transferred to the BBC South region and began dedicated opt-out bulletins within South Today. A year later, London and the south east split into two distinct regions: BBC London and BBC South East. Originally, South Today Oxford was broadcast from BBC South's Studio B in Southampton. Studio production of the bulletins was transferred in 2004 to the reception area at Radio Oxford while a new television studio and production gallery was built. The programme has been produced and broadcast from Oxford since October 2005. On 21 April 2008, the South Today Oxford opt-out service was renamed as BBC Oxford News (referred to on-screen as BBC Oxford). New titles and graphics were introduced as part of an on-screen overhaul across the BBC's national, international and regional news services. From 29 October 2012, this has been re-branded back to South Today. =Weekday bulletins= The Oxford sub-opt covers the first 10‚Äì15 minutes of the main evening South Today at 18:30, before joining Sally Taylor for the latter part of the Southampton edition of the programme. Until April 2013, a full 30-minute Oxford edition was produced every Friday evening, but this has since been scaled back to 10‚Äì15 minutes. Special half-hour Oxford editions are still occasionally broadcast if there is a major news story in the sub-region. Viewers in these areas also receive dedicated bulletins after the BBC News at Ten, but see pan-regional bulletins from Southampton at breakfast and lunchtime and on weekends. The 30 second update at 8pm was produced and presented from Oxford for the entirety of its run. From 2007 there was also at 1520 (and later at 1500) a short regional update which was also produced and presented from Oxford until the bulletin was ended.

He was co-ruler from 1355, and became king after the death of his father in 1360.  Life  A fair and popular ruler, also known as a perfect soldier, he was dubbed ‚ÄúBagrat the Great‚Äù by his multi-ethnic subjects. The Trapezuntine chronicler Michael Panaretos, who knew the king personally, calls him a ‚Äúprominent and victorious general‚Äù. Caucasus after the collapse of the alt= Later he was an ally of the khan of the Golden Horde, Tokhtamysh, in his war with Timur (also known as Tamerlane). In late autumn 1386, a huge army of Timur attacked Georgia. Tbilisi was besieged and taken on 22 November 1386, after a fierce fight. The city was pillaged and Bagrat V and his family were imprisoned. Taking advantage of this disaster, the royal vassal Duke Alexander I of Imereti proclaimed himself an independent ruler and was crowned king of Imereti at the Gelati Monastery in 1387. In order to secure his release, Bagrat V agreed to convert from Orthodox Christianity and become Muslim.: At the Crossroads of Empires : 14th - 15th Century Eastern Anatolia. Timur agreed to free Bagrat and sent him with the troops of 20,000 Mongols back to Georgia. However, with secret aid from Bagrat, his son George completely destroyed a Mongol army and released the king. In the spring of 1387, Timur again invaded Georgia but could not force the Georgians to submission. News of a revolt in Persia and an invasion of Azerbaijan forced Timur to withdraw. In 1389, on the death of Alexander of Imereti, Bagrat was able to reduce his successor to a vassal duke again. He died in 1393, leaving the throne to his son George. Family and children George VII was Bagrat V's son with his first wife, Helena Megale Komnene, who died in 1366. In June 1367, Bagrat V married Anna Megale Komnene, daughter of Emperor Alexios III of Trebizond and Theodora Kantakouzene at Makriali Church in Lazia.

Definition Although one may legitimately plan affairs to avoid the incidence of obligations or liabilities imposed by the law, but no one may evade the operation of otherwise-mandatory provisions if duties and liabilities have been properly imposed or incurred. It is a standard doctrine in most jurisdictions: in France, it is termed, fraude √† la loi, in Spain, fraude de ley, in Italy, violazione di norme di legge, in Germany, Rechtswidrige Umgehung eines Gesetzes. It reflects the need for governments to prevent their citizens from intentionally and improperly manipulating their behaviour to prevent mandatory provisions in the law from applying to them. As the translated names necessarily imply, the key is an intention to displace the normal operation of the legal system. Sometimes, that intention is obvious. On other occasions, it is for the courts to decide whether a sufficient intention can be imputed. Once the intention is established, the evasive manoeuvre is void, and the normal legal provisions will apply to the parties. Taxation Almost all states operate a collection system for taxation revenues within a framework of law that is enforced by independent courts. Enabling statutes must be strictly applied, and it is generally against public policy to allow the tax administration to agree to reduce the amount of tax payable by any individual. Like criminal law in which agreements by the policing authorities to exempt a criminal are prohibited, tax law has a special status as being essential to an organised society in maintaining public trust through the policy of equal treatment in the legal system. Nevertheless, a taxpayer who organises affairs to exploit a loophole in the law to avoid the incidence of tax liability will usually be permitted to do so. It is not for the courts to legislate and plug the gaps left by the legislature. The test of avoidance is whether there is a legitimate purpose for the given behaviour. Many states adopt a \\"business purpose\\" test, by decomposing the transaction into its component steps to determine the true purpose of the transaction(s) (see tax avoidance). Family law In Family law, the citizens of any state may not be allowed to evade rules like those on marriage by blood relatives or by persons of the same biological sex only by travelling to and going through a ceremony in a state that allows them. The policies underpinning such laws are so fundamental to the culture of a state that they acquire mandatory status (see nullity). The same applies to divorce. An early case in France (under the civil law system), known as the Princess Bauffremont Affair decided by the Cour de cassation in 1878 [Civ. 18 mars 1878, S.78.1.193 (note Labb√©)] saw the princess obtain citizenship in Germany to obtain a divorce there and then remarry. She returned to France where she attempted to re-establish herself. Because the divorce was not recognised in France, her remarriage was declared null as a fraude √† la loi. Contract law In Contract law, as an exception to the principle of autonomy implicit in the policy of freedom of contract, the parties cannot agree to a voluntary agreement to evade obligations imposed by law or to prevent the courts from taking jurisdiction if a dispute arises. Also, the courts will examine the entire context for any series of transactions that seeks to avoid the operation of law. Hence, if it is illegal to export particular goods from X to A, such a law cannot be evaded by entering into back-to-back agreements to export the goods first to Y and then to A. Some laws are so fundamental that they can never be evaded. Thus, even though the contracts might be perfectly legal, they would be denied enforcement if the effect would be against public policy, such as the following: *protection from unreasonable restraints of trade, such as agreements not to compete after terminating employment or selling a business must allow individuals a reasonable opportunity to earn a living. *protection of family relationships: an agreement relating to the custody of a child and maintenance cannot exclude the power of a court to examine its terms and to judge whether it is in the best interests of the child. *Prevention of the enforcement of contracts: ::involving commission of a tort or crime; ::inducing breach of fiduciary duties; ::inducing a breach in a contract with a third party; ::disclaiming liability for harm caused intentionally, recklessly or negligently (including liability for any misrepresentation). Liability for personal injuries arising from the use of products can be disclaimed only in rare circumstances (for example, if two merchants fairly bargain for it, and the product is experimental). ::involving the waiver or release of entrenched rights: in the United States, the release of rights granted by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, 29 U.S.C. ¬ß 621 will not be effective even if supported by consideration, except under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Acta. Conflict of laws At either the characterisation or the choice of law stage, the most usual manipulation involves the way in which the connecting factors are pleaded as between the lex fori and the lex loci so that inconvenient local laws are evaded in favour of a \\"foreign\\" law. Detection Under US Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act, it is illegal to operate or embark in a submersible vessel or semi-submersible vessel without nationality on an international voyage, ¬ß101 with the intent to evade detection.(a) That is curious because one of the required proofs of nationality is the documents issued under the 1958 Convention on the High Seas,(d)(1) a convention, which Congress has never acknowledged by ratifyingRoger Rufe, President of the Ocean Conservancy.

Life He was the son of Prince George. Around 1455, he was granted the title of Eristavi (duke) of Samokalako (Kutaisi, western Imereti, and the surroundings) by the Georgian king George VIII. In the early 1460s, Bagrat supported the rebel prince Qvarqvare II Jaqeli, atabeg (prince) of Samtskhe, and the king deprived Bagrat of his duchy. In 1463, Bagrat led a coalition of western Georgian nobles who met and defeated George VIII at the Battle of Chikhori. Subsequently, Bagrat captured Kutaisi and was crowned king of Imereti. But in return for their aid, the new monarch was obliged to create a principality (samtavro) for each of his four allies. Henceforth the Gelovani clan in Svaneti, the Shervashidze (Sharvashidze) in Abkhazia, the Dadiani in Odishi (Mingrelia), and the Vardanidze in Guria ruled as semi-independent princes. = King of Georgia = In 1465, after the king George VIII was defeated and imprisoned by Qvarqvare of Samtskhe, Bagrat used the opportunity and crossed the borders of East Georgia (Inner Kartli), where he proclaimed himself King of all Georgia. In fact, he possessed only west Georgia and Inner Kartli and remained mostly in western Georgia. In his western possessions, he also established a separate church, Catholicosate of Abkhazia, independent from the Patriarchate of Mtskheta (i.e., Georgian Orthodox Church). To justify this step, he asked Michael IV, Patriarch of Antioch and Jerusalem, to compose a \\"Law of Faith\\" which stated that western and eastern Georgia had different history of conversion and, therefore, they should be independent from each other. Once freed from captivity, George VIII attempted to recover his throne, but was only able to establish himself in Kakheti, leaving the field in Kartli to his nephew, Constantine who seems to have consolidated his rule in the Lower Kartli in 1469. During this time of triarchy, Georgia was at least twice attacked by Uzun Hasan, the prince of the Ak Koyunlu clan (M√ºnejjim Bashi speaks of three invasions, in 1466, in summer of 1472, and after Uzun Hassan's defeat by the Ottoman Turks in 1476-7).Encyclopaedia of Islam article on Uzun Hasan Bagrat had to make peace with the invaders, abandoning Tbilisi to the enemy. It was only after Uzun Hasan's death (1478) when the Georgians were able to recover their capital. In 1477, Eristav of Odishi, Vameq II Dadiani opposed Bagrat's rule in Western Georgia, he then assembled the Abkhazians and Gurians and began the raids in Imereti. The reaction of the king of Georgia was immediate. Bagrat VI defeated and subdued Vameq II Dadiani. Bagrat died in 1478, and was succeeded by his son, Alexander II. Bagrat VI was buried at the Gelati Monastery near Kutaisi. Family and children He was married to Elene (died November 3, 1510), who bore him three sons: *Vakhtang (died very young) *Alexander II *David =In historical fiction= * Emanuele Rizzardi, L'ultimo Paleologo.

Precooling restores some or all of the performance degradation of the engine compressor (by preventing rotating stall/choking/reduced flow), as well as that of the complete gas generator (by maintaining a significant combustor temperature rise within a fixed turbine temperature limit), which would otherwise prevent flight with high ram temperatures. For higher flight speeds precooling may feature a cryogenic fuel-cooled heat exchanger before the air enters the compressor. After gaining heat and vapourising in the heat exchanger, the fuel (e.g. H2) burns in the combustor. Precooling using a heat exchanger has not been used in flight, but is predicted to have significantly high thrust and efficiency at speeds up to Mach 5.5. Precooled jet engine cycles were analyzed by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955. Pre-cooled engines avoid the need for an air condenser because, unlike liquid air cycle engines (LACE), pre-cooled engines cool the air without liquefying it. For lower flight speeds precooling can be done with mass injection, known as WIPCC (water injection precompressor cooling) This method has been used for short duration (due to limited coolant capacity) increases to an aircraft's normal maximum speed. \\"Operation Skyburner\\", which gained a world speed record with a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II,\\"F-4 Phantom Modern Combat Aircraft 1\\", Bill Gunston, Ian Allan Ltd. 1977, , page 19 and the Mikoyan Ye-266 (Mig 25). Both used a water/alcohol spray to cool the air ahead of the compressor. Precooling (as well as combustion chamber water injection) is used at the lowest flight speeds, i.e. during take off, to increase thrust at high ambient temperatures. Advantages and disadvantages of using precooler heat exchangers One main advantage of pre-cooling is (as predicted by the ideal gas law) for a given overall pressure ratio, there is a significant reduction in compressor delivery temperature (T3), which delays reaching the T3 limit to a higher Mach number. Consequently, sea-level conditions (corrected flow) can be maintained after the pre-cooler over a very wide range of flight speeds, thus maximizing net thrust even at high speeds. The compressor and ducting after the inlet is subject to much lower and more consistent temperatures, and hence may be made of light alloys. This reduces the weight of the engine, which further improves the thrust/weight ratio. Hydrogen is a suitable fuel because it is liquid at deeply cryogenic temperatures, and over its useful range has a very high total specific heat capacity, including the latent heat of vapourisation, higher than water. However, the low density of liquid hydrogen has negative effects on the rest of the vehicle, and the vehicle physically becomes very large, although the weight on the undercarriage and wing loading may remain low. Hydrogen causes structural weakening in many materials, known as hydrogen embrittlement. The weight of the precooler adds to the weight of the engine, thereby reducing its thrust to weight ratio. Passing the intake air through the precooler adds to the inlet drag, thereby reducing the engine net thrust, and so reducing the thrust to weight ratio. Depending on the amount of cooling required, despite its high thermal capacity, more hydrogen may be needed to cool the air than can be burnt with the cooled air. In some cases, part of the excess hydrogen can be burnt in a ramjet with uncooled air to reduce this inefficiency. Unlike a LACE engine, a precooled engine doesn't need to liquefy the oxygen, so the amount of cooling is reduced as there is no need to cover of fusion of the oxygen and a smaller total temperature drop is required. This in turn reduces the amount of hydrogen used as a heat-sink, but unable to be burnt. In addition a condenser isn't required, giving a weight saving. History of precooling using heat exchangers Robert P. Carmichael in 1955 devised several engine cycles that used liquid hydrogen to precool the inlet air to the engine before using it as fuel. Interest in precooled engines saw an emergence in the UK in 1982, when Alan Bond created a precooled air breathing rocket engine design he called SATAN. The idea was developed as part of the HOTOL SSTO spaceplane project, and became the Rolls-Royce RB545. In 1989, after the HOTOL project was discontinued, some of the RB545 engineers created a company, Reaction Engines Ltd, to develop the idea into the SABRE engine, and the associated Skylon spaceplane.

Early career Luigi Cadorna was born to General Raffaele Cadorna in Verbania Pallanza, Piedmont in 1850. In 1860 Cadorna became a student at the \\"Teuli√®\\" Military School in Milan. At fifteen he entered the Turin Military Academy. Upon graduation he was commissioned as a second lieutenant of artillery in 1868. In 1870, as an officer in the 2nd Regiment of Artillery, Cadorna participated in the occupation of Rome as part of a force commanded by his father. As major he was appointed to the staff of General Pianell, afterwards taking the post of Chief of Staff of the Verona Divisional Command. As Colonel commanding the 10th Regiment of Bersaglieri from 1892 Cadorna acquired a reputation for strict discipline and harsh punishment. He wrote a manual of infantry tactics which laid stress on the doctrine of the offensive. Promoted to lieutenant general in 1898 Cadorna subsequently held a number of senior staff and divisional/corps command positions. On the eve of Italy's entry into World War (1915) he was close to peace-time retirement age and had a history of differences with his political and military superiors. Cadorna had been offered the post of Chief of Staff for the first time in 1908, which he had rejected over the issue of political control during wartime. He was again offered the position in July 1914, as the Triple Entente and Central Powers girded for war. When Italy entered the war in May 1915 on the side of the Entente, Cadorna fielded thirty-six infantry divisions composed of 875,000 men, but with only 120 modern artillery pieces.Marshall, 108. Keegan claims 25 divisions. See Keegan, 227. First World War General Cadorna visiting British batteries during World War I. General Cadorna visiting Italian troops before the Second Battle of the Isonzo. Cadorna inherited a difficult political and military situation. The government of Premier Antonio Salandra favored initial neutrality over Italy's treaty commitments under the Triple Alliance. Cadorna was accordingly obliged to reverse long established strategic plans while discovering that the army was ill-prepared for war against Austria-Hungary and Germany. In particular large numbers of men and quantities of equipment had been deployed to Tripolitania leaving the home army disorganized. Cadorna launched four offensives in 1915, all along the Isonzo River. The goal of these offensives was the fortress of Gorizia, the capture of which would permit the Italian armies to pivot south and march on Trieste, or continue on to the Ljubljana Gap. All four offensives failed, resulting in some 250,000 Italian casualties for little material gain. Cadorna would ultimately fight eleven battles on the Isonzo between 1915 and 1917. Additional forces were arrayed along the Trentino salient, attacking towards Rovereto, Trento, and Bolzano. These attacks also failed. The terrain along the Isonzo and Trentino was completely unsuited for offensive warfare- mountainous and broken, with no room for maneuver.Marshall, 108-110. On 24 October 1917 a combined Austro-Hungarian/German army struck across the Isonzo at Kobarid (called Caporetto in Italian) and by 12 November had advanced all the way to the Piave River. Cadorna's disposition of most of his troops far forward, with little defense in depth, contributed greatly to the Defeat at Caporetto;Keegan, 347. but graver still were the responsibilities of other officers, notably Pietro Badoglio, then corps commander in a sector overrun by the Austro-German attack. Cadorna himself had been on leave for most of October and his immediate subordinate was seriously ill. The Italian Army fled in disarray and seemed on the verge of total collapse; 275,000 soldiers were captured. Italy's allies Britain and France insisted on the dismissal of Cadorna (the General was relieved of command on 9 November 1917 ) and sent eleven divisions to reinforce the Italian front. However, these troops played no role in stemming the advancing Germans and Austro-Hungarians, because they were deployed on the Mincio River, some 97 kilometres (60 mi) behind the Piave, as the British and French strategists did not believe the Piave line could be held. The king appointed the respected General Armando Diaz as Chief of General Staff,Marshall, 215. with Badoglio named as his second-in-command. Cadorna was reassigned as the Italian representative to the Allied Supreme War Council set up in Versailles. The restored Italian defensive line was held during the subsequent Battle of the Piave River and later served as springboard for the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, where the Austro-Hungarian army was finally defeated, after eleven days of resistance, by 51 Italian divisions, 3 British divisions, 2 French divisions, 1 Czechoslovak Division, 1 U.S. Infantry Regiment. The Italians and their allies captured 426,000 enemy soldiers. Post-war After the war, the Italian government held an inquiry to investigate the defeat at Caporetto. It was published in 1919 and was highly critical of Cadorna, at that time a bitter man busy with writing his memoirs who claimed that he had no responsibility for the defeat, despite fleeing to Padua during the battle and abandoning the entire Italian Second Army to its fate. Nevertheless, he was made a Field Marshal (Maresciallo d'Italia) in 1924 after Benito Mussolini seized power. Cadorna died in Bordighera in 1928. Personal reputation Historians record Cadorna as an unimaginative martinet who was ruthless with his troops and dismissive of his country's political authorities. David Stevenson, Professor of International History at the London School of Economics, describes him as earning \\"opprobrium as one of the most callous and incompetent of First World War commanders.\\" In manner he appeared a reserved and aristocratic officer of the old-fashioned Piedmontese school. During the course of the war Cadorna dismissed 217 officers, and during the Battle of Caporetto, he ordered the summary execution of officers whose units retreated.Keegan, 227. Six percent of Italian soldiers under his leadership faced a disciplinary charge during the war and 61 percent of them were found guilty. About 750 were executed, the highest number in any army in World War I.Hew Strachan (2003) The First World War Claims have been made that he also reintroduced the ancient Roman practice of decimation‚Äîthe killing of every tenth man‚Äîfor units which failed to perform in battle. However, the military historian John Keegan records that his \\"judicial savagery\\" took the form of the summary executions of individual stragglers rather than the formalized winnowing of entire detachments.In May 1916, one specific instance of actual decimation occurred in the Italian Army, involving the execution of one in ten soldiers of a 120 strong company of the 141¬∫ Catanzaro Infantry Brigade which had mutinied, killing officers, carabinieri and other soldiers. Two days later Cadorna endorsed the shooting of the 12 mutineers in a telegram sent to senior officers, but it is not clear whether he had been responsible for initiating this draconian measure. Family He was the father of Raffaele Cadorna, Jr, an Italian general who fought during World War I and World War II, who was famous as one of the commanders of the Italian Resistance against German occupying forces in north Italy after 1943.

The official Red Army Day of February 23, 1918 marked the day of the first mass draft of the Red Army in Petrograd and Moscow, and of the first combat action against the rapidly advancing Imperial German Army. February 23 became an important national holiday in the Soviet Union, later celebrated as \\"Soviet Army Day\\", and it continues as a day of celebration in Russia as Defenders of the Motherland Day. Credit as the founder of the Red Army generally goes to Leon Trotsky, the People's Commissar for War from 1918 to 1924. At the beginning of its existence, the Red Army functioned as a voluntary formation, without ranks or insignia. Democratic elections selected the officers. However, a decree of May 29, 1918 imposed obligatory military service for men of ages 18 to 40. To service the massive draft, the Bolsheviks formed regional military commissariats (–≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç, –≤–æ–µ–Ω–∫–æ–º–∞—Ç (voenkomat)), which still exist in Russia in this function and under this name. (Note: do not confuse military commissariats with the institution of military political commissars.) Democratic election of officers was also abolished by decree, while separate quarters for officers, special forms of address, saluting, and higher pay were all reinstated. After General Aleksei Brusilov offered the Bolsheviks his professional services in 1920, they decided to permit the conscription of former officers of the Imperial Russian Army. The Bolshevik authorities set up a special commission under the chair of Lev Glezarov (–õ–µ–≤ –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∏—á –ì–ª–µ–∑–∞—Ä–æ–≤), and by August 1920 had drafted about 315,000 ex-officers. Most often they held the position of military advisor (voyenspets: \\"–≤–æ–µ–Ω—Å–ø–µ—Ü\\" an abbreviation of \\"–≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç\\", i.e., \\"military specialist\\"). A number of prominent Soviet Army commanders had previously served as Imperial Russian generals. In fact, a number of former Imperial military men, notably a member of the Supreme Military Council, Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich, had joined the Bolsheviks earlier. The Bolshevik authorities assigned to every unit of the Red Army a political commissar, or politruk, who had the authority to override unit commanders' decisions if they ran counter to the principles of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Although this sometimes resulted in inefficient command, the Party leadership considered political control over the military necessary, as the Army relied more and more on experienced officers from the pre- revolutionary Tsarist period. =Civil War= =Polish‚ÄìSoviet War= The Polish‚ÄìSoviet War represented the first foreign campaign of the Red Army. The Soviet counter-offensive following the 1920 Polish invasion of Ukraine at first met with success, but Polish forces halted it at the disastrous (for the Soviets) Battle of Warsaw (1920). =Far East= A soldier of the Red Army, 1926, wearing the budenovka In 1934, Mongolia and the USSR, recognising the threat from the mounting Japanese military presence in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, agreed to co-operate in the field of defence. On March 12, 1936, the co-operation increased with the ten-year Mongolian-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, which included a mutual defence protocol. In May 1939, a Mongolian cavalry unit clashed with Manchukuoan cavalry in the disputed territory east of the Halha River (also known in Russian as –•–∞–ª—Ö–∏–Ω-–ì–æ–ª, Halhin Gol). There followed a clash with a Japanese detachment, which drove the Mongolians over the river. The Soviet troops quartered there in accordance with the mutual defence protocol intervened and obliterated the detachment. Escalation of the conflict appeared imminent, and both sides spent June amassing forces. On July 1 the Japanese force numbered 38,000 troops. The combined Soviet-Mongol force had 12,500 troops. The Japanese crossed the river, but after a three-day battle their opponents threw them back over the river. The Japanese kept probing the Soviet defences throughout July, without success. On August 20 Georgy Zhukov opened a major offensive with heavy air attack and three hours of artillery bombardment, after which three infantry divisions and five armoured brigades, supported by a fighter regiment and masses of artillery (57 thousand troops in total), stormed the 75,000 Japanese force deeply entrenched in the area. On August 23 the entire Japanese force found itself encircled, and on August 31 largely destroyed. Artillery and air attacks wiped out those Japanese who refused to surrender. Japan requested a cease-fire, and the conflict concluded with an agreement between the USSR, Mongolia and Japan signed on September 15 in Moscow. In the conflict, the Red Army losses were 9,703 killed in action (KIA) and missing in action (MIA) and 15,952 wounded. The Japanese lost 25,000 KIA; the grand total was 61,000 killed, missing, wounded and taken prisoner. Shortly after the cease-fire, the Japanese negotiated access to the battlefields to collect their dead. Finding thousands upon thousands of dead bodies came as a further shock to the already shaken morale of the Japanese soldiers. The scale of the defeat probably became a major factor in discouraging a Japanese attack on the USSR during World War II, which allowed the Red Army to switch a large number of its Far Eastern troops into the European Theatre in the desperate autumn of 1941. =Second World War= A colorized photo of Red Army soldiers during WWII The Polish Campaign On September 17, 1939 the Red Army marched its troops into the eastern territories of Poland (now part of Belarus and Ukraine), using the official pretext of coming to the aid of the Ukrainians and the Belarusians threatened by Germany,Telegram from the German Ambassador in the Soviet Union, (Schulenburg) to the German Foreign Office , 10 September 1939, at Yale Law School's Avalon Project: Nazi-Soviet Relations 1939-1941. which had attacked Poland on September 1, 1939. The Soviet invasion opened a second front for the Poles and forced them to abandon plans for defence in the Romanian bridgehead area, thus hastening the Polish defeat. The Soviet and German advance halted roughly at the Curzon Line. The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which had included a secret protocol delimiting the \\"spheres of interest\\" of each party, set the scene for the remarkably smooth partition of Poland between Germany and the USSR. The defined Soviet sphere of interest matched the territory subsequently captured in the campaign. The territory became part of the Ukrainian and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republics. Even though water barriers separated most of the spheres of interest, the Soviet and German troops met each other on a number of occasions. The most remarkable event of this kind happened in Brest-Litovsk on 22 September 1939. The German 19th Panzer Corps under the command of Heinz Guderian had occupied Brest-Litovsk, which lay within the Soviet sphere of interest. When the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade under the command of S. M. Krivoshein approached Brest-Litovsk, the commanders negotiated that the German troops would withdraw and the Soviet troops enter the city saluting each other.–ö—Ä–∏–≤–æ—à–µ–∏–Ω –°.–ú. –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–±—É—Ä—å–µ. –í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è. –í–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–∂, 1964.

According to Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century edited by Colonel-General Krivosheev, the Red Army force in Poland numbered 466,516.Krivosheev, Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century, .

The new PWN article is significantly shorter. The Red Army troops faced little resistance, mainly due to the entanglement of the majority of the Polish forces in fighting Germans along the Western border, but partly due to an official order by the Polish Supreme Command not to engage in combat with the Soviet troops, and also partly because many Polish citizens in the Kresy region‚ÄîUkrainians and Belarusians‚Äîviewed the advancing troops as liberators. Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists rose against the Poles, and communist partisans organised local revolts, e.g. in Skidel, robbing and murdering Poles.For example, see events as described in: Bronis≈Çaw Konieczny, M√≥j wrzesie≈Ñ 1939.

Because the attack was judged as illegal, the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations on 14 December. The Continuation War (, , was the second of two wars fought between Finland and the Soviet Union during World War II. At the time Finns used the name to make clear its perceived relationship to the preceding Winter War of 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940, the first of two wars fought between Finland and the Soviet Union during World War II. The Soviet Union, however, perceived the war merely as one of the fronts of the German‚ÄìSoviet War against Nazi Germany and its allies.Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Finland, Moscow, 1974, Similarly, Germany saw its own operations in the region as a part of its overall war efforts of World War II. Finland was a co-belligerent with Germany against the Soviet Union rather than an ally for the duration of the Continuation War. Barbarossa, 1941‚Äì1945 (Great Patriotic War) Politruk) urges Soviet troops forward against German positions (12 July 1942) Soviet ski troops during WWII By the autumn of 1940 a new world order had emerged. Nazi Germany and its allies dominated most of the European continent. Only the United Kingdom (in the West) was actively challenging national socialist and fascist hegemony. Nazi Germany and Britain had no common land border, but a state of war existed between them; the Germans had an extensive land border with the Soviet Union, but the latter remained neutral, adhering to a non-aggression pact and by numerous trade agreements. For Adolf Hitler, no dilemma ever existed in this situation. Drang nach Osten (German for \\"Drive towards the East\\") remained the order of the day. This culminated, on December 18, in the issuing of 'Directive No. 21 ‚Äì Case Barbarossa', which opened by saying \\"the German Armed Forces must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign before the end of the war against England\\". Even before the issuing of the directive, the German General Staff had developed detailed plans for a Soviet campaign. On February 3, 1941, the final plan of Operation Barbarossa gained approval, and the attack was scheduled for the middle of May, 1941. However, the events in Greece and Yugoslavia necessitated a delay ‚Äî to the second half of June. At the time of the Nazi assault on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Red Army had 303 divisions and 22 brigades (4.8 million troops), including 166 divisions and 9 brigades (2.9 million troops) stationed in the western military districts. Their Axis opponents deployed on the Eastern Front 181 divisions and 18 brigades (3.8 million troops). The first weeks of the war saw the annihilation of virtually the entire Soviet Air Force on the ground, the loss of major equipment, tanks, artillery, and major Soviet defeats as German forces trapped hundreds of thousands of Red Army soldiers in vast pockets. Soviet forces suffered heavy damage in the field as a result of poor levels of preparedness, which was primarily caused by a reluctant, half-hearted and ultimately belated decision by the Soviet Government and High Command to mobilize the army. Equally important was a general tactical superiority of the German army, which was conducting the kind of warfare that it had been combat-testing and fine- tuning for two years. The hasty pre-war growth and over-promotion of the Red Army cadres as well as the removal of experienced officers caused by the Purges offset the balance even more favourably for the Germans. Finally, the sheer numeric superiority of the Axis cannot be underestimated. A generation of brilliant Soviet commanders (most notably Georgy Zhukov) learned from the defeats, and Soviet victories in the Battle of Moscow, at Stalingrad, Kursk and later in Operation Bagration proved decisive in what became known to the Soviets as the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet government adopted a number of measures to improve the state and morale of the retreating Red Army in 1941. Soviet propaganda turned away from political notions of class struggle, and instead invoked the deeper-rooted patriotic feelings of the population, embracing Tsarist Russian history. Propagandists proclaimed the War against the German aggressors as the \\"Great Patriotic War\\", in allusion to the Patriotic War of 1812 against Napoleon. References to ancient Russian military heroes such as Alexander Nevski and Mikhail Kutuzov appeared. Repressions against the Russian Orthodox Church stopped, and priests revived the tradition of blessing arms before battle. The Communist Party abolished the institution of political commissars‚Äîalthough it soon restored them. The Red Army re- introduced military ranks and adopted many additional individual distinctions such as medals and orders. The concept of a Guard re-appeared: units which had shown exceptional heroism in combat gained the names of \\"Guards Regiment\\", \\"Guards Army\\", etc. During the German‚ÄìSoviet War, the Red Army drafted a staggering 29,574,900 in addition to the 4,826,907 in service at the beginning of the war. Of these it lost 6,329,600 KIA, 555,400 deaths by disease and 4,559,000 MIA (most captured). Of these 11,444,100, however, 939,700 re-joined the ranks in the subsequently re-took Soviet territory, and a further 1,836,000 returned from German captivity. Thus the grand total of losses amounted to 8,668,400. The majority of the losses comprised ethnic Russians (5,756,000), followed by ethnic Ukrainians (1,377,400).See –ì. –§. –ö—Ä–∏–≤–æ—à–µ–µ–≤, –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è –∏ –°–°–°–† –≤ –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞—Ö XX –≤–µ–∫–∞: –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–∏ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∏–ª. –°—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ (G. F. Krivosheev, Russia and the USSR in the wars of the 20th century: losses of the Armed Forces. A Statistical Study, in Russian) The German losses on the Eastern Front comprised an estimated 3,604,800 KIA/MIA (most killed) and 3,576,300 captured (total 7,181,100); the losses of the German Axis allies on the Eastern Front approximated 668,163 KIA/MIA and 799,982 captured (total 1,468,145). Of these 8,649,300, the Soviets released 3,572,600 from captivity after the war, thus the grand total of the Axis losses came to an estimated 5,076,700. A U.S. government poster showing a friendly Soviet soldier as portrayed by the Allies during World War II In the first part of the war, the Red Army fielded weaponry of mixed quality. It had excellent artillery, but it did not have enough trucks to manoeuvre and supply it; as a result the Wehrmacht (which rated it highly) captured much of it. Red Army T-34 tanks outclassed any other tanks the Germans had when they appeared in 1941, yet most of the Soviet armoured units were less advanced models; likewise, the same supply problem handicapped even the formations equipped with the most modern tanks. The Soviet Air Force initially performed poorly against the Germans. The quick advance of the Germans into the Soviet territory made reinforcement difficult, if not impossible, since much of the Soviet Union's military industry lay in the west of the country. WWII Victory parade  The Manchurian Campaign  After the end of the war in Europe, the Red Army attacked Japan and Manchukuo (Japan's puppet state in Manchuria) on 9 August 1945, and in combination with Mongolian and Chinese Communist forces rapidly overwhelmed the outnumbered Kwantung Army. Soviet forces also attacked in Sakhalin, in the Kuril Islands and in northern Korea. Japan surrendered unconditionally on 2 September 1945. =The Cold War= The Soviet Union only had Ground Forces, Air Forces, and the Navy in 1945.Scott and Scott, 1979, p.131 The two Narkomats, one supervising the Ground Forces and Air Forces, and the other directing the Navy, were combined into the Ministry of the Armed Forces in March 1946. A fourth service, the Troops of National Air Defence, was formed in 1948. The Ministry was briefly divided into two again from 1950 to 1953, but then was amalgamated again as the Ministry of Defence. Six years later the Strategic Rocket Forces were formed. The VDV, the Airborne Forces, were also active by this time as a Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Also falling within the Soviet Armed Forces were the Tyl, or Rear Services, of the Armed Forces, the Troops of Civil Defence, and the Border and Internal Troops, neither of which came under command of the Ministry of Defence. Men within the Soviet Army dropped from around 13 million to approximately 2.8 million in 1948. In order to control this demobilisation process, the number of military districts was temporarily increased to thirty- three, dropping to twenty-one in 1946.Scott and Scott, The Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Westview Press, Boulder, CO., 1979, p.176 The size of the Army throughout most time of the Cold War remained between 4 million and 5 million, according to Western estimates. Soviet law required all able-bodied males of age to serve a minimum of 2 years. As a result, the Soviet Army remained the largest active army in the world from 1945 to 1991. Soviet Army units which had taken over the countries of Eastern Europe from German rule remained in some of them to secure the r√©gimes in what became satellite states of the Soviet Union and to deter and to fend off pro-independence resistance and later NATO forces. The greatest Soviet military presence was in East Germany, in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, but there were also smaller forces elsewhere, including the Northern Group of Forces in Poland, the Central Group of Forces in Czechoslovakia, and the Southern Group of Forces in Hungary. In the Soviet Union itself, forces were divided by the 1950s among fifteen military districts, including the Moscow, Leningrad, and Baltic Military Districts. The trauma of the devastating German invasion of 1941 influenced the Soviet Cold War military doctrine of fighting enemies on their own territory, or in a buffer zone under Soviet hegemony, but in any case preventing any war from reaching Soviet soil. In order to secure Soviet interests in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Army moved in to quell anti-Soviet uprisings in the German Democratic Republic (1953), Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968). As a result of the Sino-Soviet border conflict, a sixteenth military district was created in 1969, the Central Asian Military District, with headquarters at Alma-Ata.Scott and Scott, 1979, p.176 To improve capabilities for war at a theatre level, in the late 1970s and early 1980s four high commands were established, grouping the military districts, groups of forces, and fleets.William E Odom, The Collapse of the Soviet Military, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1998, p.29 The Far Eastern High Command was established first, followed by the Western and South- Western High Commands towards Europe, and the Southern High Command at Baku, oriented toward the Middle East. Confrontation with the US and NATO during the Cold War mainly took the form of threatened mutual deterrence with nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union invested heavily in the Army's nuclear capacity, especially in the production of ballistic missiles and of nuclear submarines to deliver them. Open hostilities took the form of wars by proxy, with the Soviet Union and the US supporting loyal client r√©gimes or rebel movements in Third World countries. Military doctrine The Soviet meaning of military doctrine was much different from U.S. military usage of the term. Soviet Minister of Defence Marshal Grechko defined it in 1975 as 'a system of views on the nature of war and methods of waging it, and on the preparation of the country and army for war, officially adopted in a given state and its armed forces.' Soviet theorists emphasised both the political and 'military- technical' sides of military doctrine, while from the Soviet point of view, Westerners ignored the political side. According to Harriet F Scott and William Scott, the political side of Soviet military doctrine, best explained the international moves that the Soviet Union undertook during the cold war.Scott and Scott, 1979, p.37,59 The limited contingent in Afghanistan Soviet soldier in Afghanistan, 1988 In 1979, however, the Soviet Army intervened in a civil war raging in Afghanistan. The Soviet Army came to back a Soviet-friendly communist government threatened by a multinational, mainly afghan, insurgent groups called the mujahideen. The insurgents received military training in neighboring Pakistan, China, and billions of dollars from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Technically superior, the Soviets did not have enough troops to establish control over the countryside and to secure the border. This resulted from hesitancy in the Politburo, which allowed only a \\"limited contingent\\", averaging between 80,000 and 100,000 troops. Consequently, local insurgents could effectively employ hit-and-run tactics, using easy escape-routes and good supply-channels. This made the Soviet situation hopeless from the military point of view (short of using \\"scorched earth\\" tactics, which the Soviets did not practise except in World War II in their own territory). The understanding of this made the war highly unpopular within the Army. With the coming of glasnost, Soviet media started to report heavy losses, which made the war very unpopular in the USSR in general, even though actual losses remained modest, averaging 1670 per year. The war also became a sensitive issue internationally, which finally led General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to withdraw the Soviet forces from Afghanistan. The \\"Afghan Syndrome\\" suffered by the Army parallels the American Vietnam Syndrome trauma over their own unsuccessful war in Vietnam. Tactically, both sides concentrated on attacking supply lines, but Afghan mujahideen were well dug-in with tunnels and defensive positions, holding out against artillery and air attacks. The decade long war resulted in millions of Afghans fleeing their country, mostly to Pakistan and Iran. At least half a million Afghan civilians were killed in addition to the rebels in the war. = The end of the Soviet Union = Monument to the Red Army in Berlin From around 1985 to 1991, the new leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to reduce the strain the Army placed on economic demands. His government slowly reduced the size of the army. By 1989 Soviet troops were leaving their Warsaw Pact neighbors to fend for themselves. That same year Soviet forces left Afghanistan. By the end of 1990, the entire Eastern Bloc had collapsed in the wake of democratic revolutions. As a result, Soviet citizens quickly began to turn against the Communist government as well. As the Soviet Union moved towards disintegration, the reduced military was rendered feeble and ineffective and could no longer prop up the ailing Soviet government. The military got involved in trying to suppress conflicts and unrest in Central Asia and the Caucasus but it often proved incapable of restoring peace and order. On April 9, 1989, the army, together with MVD units, massacred about 190 demonstrators in Tbilisi in Georgia. The next major crisis occurred in Azerbaijan, when the Soviet army forcibly entered Baku on January 19‚Äì20, 1990, removing the rebellious republic government and allegedly killing hundreds of civilians in the process. On January 13, 1991 Soviet forces stormed the State Radio and Television Building and the television retranslation tower in Vilnius, Lithuania, both under opposition control, killing 14 people and injuring 700. This action was perceived by many as heavy-handed and achieved little. By mid-1991, the Soviet Union had reached a state of emergency. According to the official commission (the Soviet Academy of Sciences) appointed by the Supreme Soviet (the higher chamber of the Russian parliament) immediately after the events of August 1991, the Army did not play a significant role in what some describe as coup d'√©tat of old-guard communists. Commanders sent tanks into the streets of Moscow, but (according to all the commanders and soldiers) only with orders to ensure the safety of the people. It remains unclear why exactly the military forces entered the city, but they clearly did not have the goal of overthrowing Gorbachev (absent on the Black Sea coast at the time) or the government. The coup failed primarily because the participants did not take any decisive action, and after several days of their inaction the coup simply stopped. Only one confrontation took place between civilians and the tank crews during the coup, which led to the deaths of three civilians. Although the victims became proclaimed heroes, the authorities acquitted the tank crew of all charges. Nobody issued orders to shoot at anyone. Following the coup attempt of August 1991, the leadership of the Soviet Union retained practically no authority over the component republics. Nearly every Soviet Republic declared its intention to secede and began passing laws defying the Supreme Soviet. On December 8, 1991, the Presidents of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine declared the Soviet Union dissolved and signed the document setting up the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Gorbachev finally resigned on December 25, 1991, and the following day the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body, dissolved itself, officially ending the Soviet Union's existence. For the next year and a half various attempts to keep its unity and transform it into the military of the CIS failed. Steadily, the units stationed in Ukraine and some other breakaway republics swore loyalty to their new national governments, while a series of treaties between the newly independent states divided up the military's assets. Following dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Army dissolved and the USSR's successor states shared out its assets among themselves. The share out mostly occurred on a regional basis, with Soviet soldiers from Russia becoming part of the new Russian Army, while Soviet soldiers originating from Kazakhstan became part of the new Kazakh Army. Soviet and Russian military expenditures in billions of 2015 US dollars In mid-March 1992, Yeltsin appointed himself as the new Russian Minister of Defence, marking a crucial step in the creation of the new Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, comprising the bulk of what was still left of the military. The last vestiges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993. In the next few years, the former Soviet forces withdrew from central and Eastern Europe (including the Baltic states), as well as from the newly independent post-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia (partially), Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan. Now-Russian forces remained in Tajikistan, and at isolated outposts including the Gabala space tracking station in Azerbaijan, the Baikonur Cosmodrome and other space facilities in Kazakhstan, and a naval test centre at Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan. While in many places the withdrawal and division took place without any problems, the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet remained in the Crimea, Ukraine, with the fleet division and a Russian leasehold for fleet facilities in Crimea finally achieved in 1997. A Russian military presence also remained in Transnistria and Georgia. The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) became successful members of NATO since 2004. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine maintain cooperation with NATO as well. Structure and leadership The Soviet Armed Forces were controlled by the Ministry of Defence. At its head was the Minister of Defence, generally a full member of the Politburo (the Politburo, in turn, was chaired by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, generally the de facto leader of the Soviet Union) and from 1934 onwards, a Marshal of the Soviet Union. Both civilians and career military professionals served as Minister of Defence. Between 1934 and 1946, 1950 and 1953, a separate Ministry of the Navy existed and the Ministry of Defence was responsible only for land and air forces. In practice, the Navy Minister was a far more junior official and the Defence Ministry continued to dominate policymaking. Beneath the Minister of Defence were two First Deputy Ministers of Defence; the Chief of the General Staff, who was responsible for operations and planning, and the First Deputy Minister of Defence for General Affairs, who was responsible for administration. From 1955 the Supreme Commander of the Warsaw Pact also held the title of First Deputy Minister of Defence. By the 1980s there was another eleven Deputy Minister of Defence; including the commanders-in-chief of the five service branches. Personnel Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and soldiers of the Red Army in Petrograd, 1921 =Ranks and titles= The early Red Army abandoned the institution of a professional officer corps as a \\"heritage of tsarism\\" in the course of the Revolution. In particular, the Bolsheviks condemned the use of the word \\"officer\\" and used the word \\"commander\\" instead. The Red Army abandoned epaulettes and ranks, using purely functional titles such as \\"Division Commander\\", \\"Corps Commander\\", and similar titles. In 1924 it supplemented this system with \\"service categories\\", from K-1 (lowest) to K-14 (highest). The service categories essentially operated as ranks in disguise: they indicated the experience and qualifications of a commander. The insignia now denoted the category, not the position of a commander. However, one still had to use functional titles to address commanders, which could become as awkward as \\"comrade deputy head-of-staff of corps\\". If one did not know a commander's position, one used one of the possible positions - for example: \\"Regiment Commander\\" for K-9. On September 22, 1935 the Red Army abandoned service categories and introduced personal ranks. These ranks, however, used a unique mix of functional titles and traditional ranks. For example, the ranks included \\"Lieutenant\\" and \\"Komdiv\\" (–ö–æ–º–¥–∏–≤, Division Commander). Further complications ensued from the functional and categorical ranks for political officers (e.g., \\"Brigade Commissar\\", \\"Army Commissar 2nd Rank\\"), for technical corps (e.g., \\"Engineer 3rd Rank\\", \\"Division Engineer\\"), for administrative, medical and other non-combatant branches. The year before (1934), the revival of personal ranks began with the Marshal of the Soviet Union rank bestowed upon 5 Army Commanders. There were further modifications to the system. 1937 saw the Junior Lieutenant and Junior Military Technician ranks being added. On May 7, 1940, the ranks of \\"General\\" or \\"Admiral\\" replaced the senior functional ranks of Kombrig, Komdiv, Komkor, Komandarm; the other senior functional ranks (\\"Division Commissar\\", \\"Division Engineer\\", etc.) remained unaffected. On November 2, 1940, the system underwent further modification with the abolition of functional ranks for non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and the introduction of the Podpolkovnik (Lieutenant Colonel) rank. In early 1942 all the functional ranks in technical and administrative corps became regularised ranks (e.g., \\"Engineer Major\\", \\"Engineer Colonel\\", \\"Captain of the Intendant Service\\", etc.). On October 9, 1942, the authorities abolished the system of military commissars, together with the commissar ranks. The functional ranks remained only in medical, veterinary and legislative corps. By then the Naval rank of Midshipman was revived in the Soviet Navy as an NCO rank, a role lasting until the 1970s. In early 1943 a unification of the system saw the abolition of all the remaining functional ranks. The word \\"officer\\" became officially endorsed, together with the epaulettes that superseded the previous rank insignia. The ranks and insignia of 1943 did not change much until the last days of the USSR; the contemporary Russian Army uses largely the same system. The old functional ranks of Kombat (Battalion or Battery Commander), Kombrig (Brigade Commander) and Komdiv (Division Commander) continue in informal use. By the end of the Second World War, the Admiral of the Fleet rank (which, from 1945 was already equivalent to Marshal) was later renamed Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union in 1955. In the 1960s however, it became a rank of its own when new regulations revived the Fleet Admiral rank in the Soviet Navy, thus becoming the naval equivalent to General of the Army. By 1972, the final transformation of military ranks began as the rank of Praporshchik (Warrant officer) ranks being added in the Army and Air Force for contract NCOs since the rank of Starshina (Sergeant Major) was from now on for conscripts. But in the Soviet Navy, it meant that the Naval rank of Midshipman became a rank for Naval warrant officers since the Navy created the new rank of Ship Chief Sergeant Major for its NCOs in naval service. The year of 1974 saw the rank insignia changed for Army Generals and Navy Fleet Admirals in their parade dress and working and combat dress uniforms. =General Staff= On September 22, 1935, the authorities renamed the RKKA Staff as the General Staff, which essentially reincarnated the General Staff of the Russian Empire. Many of the former RKKA Staff officers had served as General Staff officers in the Russian Empire and became General Staff officers in the USSR. General Staff officers typically had extensive combat experience and solid academic training. =Military education= During the Civil War the commander cadres received training at the General Staff Academy of the RKKA (–ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —à—Ç–∞–±–∞ –†–ö–ö–ê), an alias of the Nicholas General Staff Academy (–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —à—Ç–∞–±–∞) of the Russian Empire. On August 5, 1921 the Academy became the Military Academy of the RKKA (–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –†–ö–ö–ê), and in 1925 the Frunze (–ú.–í. –§—Ä—É–Ω–∑–µ) Military Academy of the RKKA. The senior and supreme commanders received training at the Higher Military Academic Courses (–í—ã—Å—à–∏–µ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫—É—Ä—Å—ã), renamed in 1925 as the Advanced Courses for Supreme Command (–ö—É—Ä—Å—ã —É—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤—ã—Å—à–µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–µ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞); in 1931, the establishment of an Operations Faculty at the Frunze Military Academy supplemented these courses. On April 2, 1936, the General Staff Academy was re-instated; it became a principal school for the senior and supreme commanders of the Red Army and a centre for advanced military studies. One should note that Red Army (and later Soviet Army) educational facilities called \\"academies\\" do not correspond to the military academies in Western countries. Those Soviet Academies were the post-graduate schools, mandatory for officers applying for senior ranks (e.g., the rank of Colonel since the 1950s). While a basic officer education in the Red Army was provided by the facilities named –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞ or –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —É—á–∏–ª–∏—â–µ - which may be generally translated as \\"school\\" and compared to Western \\"academies\\" like West Point or Sandhurst. =Manpower and enlisted men= The Soviet Armed Forces were manned through conscription, which had been reduced in 1967 from three to two years (with remaining 3 years service in naval forces). This system was administered through the thousands of military commissariats (–≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç, –≤–æ–µ–Ω–∫–æ–º–∞—Ç (voyenkomat)) located throughout the Soviet Union. Between January and May of every year, every young Soviet male citizen was required to report to the local voyenkomat for assessment for military service, following a summons based on lists from every school and employer in the area. The voyenkomat worked to quotas sent out by a department of the General Staff, listing how young men are required by each service and branch of the Armed Forces.Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, London, 1991, p.67-70 The new conscripts were then picked up by an officer from their future unit and usually sent by train across the country. On arrival, they would begin the Young Soldiers' course, and become part of the system of hazing and domination by an older class of draftees, known as dedovshchina, literally \\"rule by the grandfathers.\\" There were only a very small number of professional non-commissioned officers (NCOs), as most NCOs were conscripts sent on short coursesViktor Suvorov, Inside the Soviet Army, Hamish Hamilton, London, 1982, gives the figure of six months with a training division to prepare them for section commanders' and platoon sergeants' positions. These conscript NCOs were supplemented by praporshchik warrant officers, positions created in the 1960s to support the increased variety of skills required for modern weapons.William E Odom, The Collapse of the Soviet Military, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1998, p.43 According to a 1980 Time magazine article citing an analyst from the RAND Corporation, Soviet non-Slavs were generally barred from joining elite or strategic positions (like the Strategic Rocket Forces, Soviet Air Force and the Soviet Navy) of the late- Cold War military because of suspicions of loyalty of ethnic minorities to the Kremlin.The U.S.S.R.: Moscow's Military Machine The U.S.S.R.: Moscow's Military Machine\\". Time (magazine), June 23, 1980 =Purge= The late 1930s saw the \\"Purges of the Red Army cadres\\", occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of \\"politically unreliable elements\\", mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch-hunt. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications for the effectiveness of the Army in the coming war against Germany. In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of the 5 marshals, 13 of 15 generals of the army, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars. Party control of the Armed Forces Military ticket conscript military service of the Soviet army USSR. Item No. 3 Member of the Communist party of the Soviet Union, Item No. 4 of the member of the Komsomol. The Communist Party had a number of mechanisms of control over the country's armed forces. First, starting from a certain rank, only a Party member could be a military commander, and was thus subject to Party discipline. Second, the top military leaders had been systematically integrated into the highest echelons of the party. Third, the party placed a network of political officers throughout the armed forces to influence the activities of the military. A political commander (zampolit) served as a political commissar of the armed forces. A zampolit supervised party organizations and conducted party political work within a military unit. He lectured troops on Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, the Soviet view of international affairs, and the party's tasks for the armed forces. During World War II the zampolit lost veto authority over the commander's decisions but retained the power to report to the next highest political officer or organization on the political attitudes and performance of the unit's commander. In 1989 over 20% of all armed forces personnel were party members or Komsomol members. Over 90% of all officers in the armed forces were party or Komsomol members. Weapons and equipment The Soviet Union established an indigenous arms industry as part of Stalin's industrialization program in the 1920s and 1930s. The five-round, stripper clip-fed, bolt-action Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle remained the primary shoulder firearm of the Red Army through World War II. Over 17 million model 91/30 Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifles were manufactured from 1930 to 1945 by various Soviet arsenals. In 1943 design started on the M44, designed to replace the M91/30. Full production began in 1944, and remained in production until 1948, when it was replaced by the SKS semiautomatic rifle.Terence W. Lapin, The Mosin-Nagant Rifle (3rd Ed., North Cape 2003) The Red Army suffered from a shortage of adequate machine guns and semiautomatic firearms throughout World War II. The semiautomatic Tokarev SVT Model 38 and Model 40 were chambered for the same 7.62√ó54mmR cartridge used by the Mosin‚ÄìNagants. The rifle, though of sound design, was never manufactured in the same numbers as the Mosin‚ÄìNagants and did not replace them. Soviet experimentation with small-arms began during the Second World War. In 1945 the Red Army adopted the Simonov SKS, a semi-automatic 7.62√ó39mm carbine. In 1949 production of the 7.62√ó39mm Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle began: planners envisaged troops using it in conjunction with the SKS, but it soon replaced the SKS completely. In 1959 the AKM came out as a modernised version of the AK-47, this was created to ease manufacture and improve aspects of the AK-47. In 1978 the 5.45√ó39mm AK-74 assault rifle replaced the AKM: it utilized no less than 51% of the AKM's parts. Designers put together the new weapon as a counterpart to the American 5.56√ó45mm cartridge used in the M-16 assault rifle, and the Russian army to use it today.

Significant Aboriginal People in Sydney . Sydney City Council He is also significant in that he was the first person to be recorded in print as an Australian, and the first Australian to circumnavigate the continent. Biography When Bungaree moved to the growing settlement of Sydney in the 1790s, Bungaree established himself as a well- known identity, as one able to move between his own people and the newcomers. He joined the crew of on a trip to Norfolk Island in 1798, during which he impressed Matthew Flinders. In 1798 he accompanied Flinders (and his brother, Samuel Ward Flinders, a midshipman from the Reliance) on the sloop on a coastal survey as an interpreter, guide and negotiator with local indigenous groups. Despite the lack of a common language, the indigenous people persistently sought Bungaree out to speak to instead of Flinders. And his mediation skills were greatly appreciated by the Europeans with whom he shared the ship. In 1799, to reach an agreement with local people in one particular situation, Bungaree gave them a spear and a spear thrower as gifts, showing them how to use them. It is referred to by Bronwen Douglas as a \\"cross- cultural act, signifying a reciprocal rather than a hierarchical relationship and challenging the reified notion of 'cross-cultural' as contact between opposed, homogenized 'cultures'‚Äù, adding that \\"the Moreton Bay people probably took Bungaree for the leader of the expedition and the white men for his followers\\". He was recruited by Flinders on his circumnavigation of Australia between 1801 and 1803 in . Flinders was the cartographer of the first complete map of Australia, filling in the gaps from previous cartographic expeditions, and was the most prominent advocate for naming the continent \\"Australia\\". Flinders noted that Bungaree was \\"a worthy and brave fellow\\" who, on multiple occasions, saved the expedition.Matthew Flinders, A Voyage to Terra Australis, 1814. Bungaree was the only indigenous Australian on the ship ‚Äì and as such, played a vital diplomatic role as they made their way around the coast, overcoming not inconsiderable language barriers in places. According to historian Keith Vincent, Bungaree chose the role as a go-between, and was often able to mollify indigenous people who were about to attack the sailors, by taking off his clothes and speaking to people, despite being in territory unknown to himself. Flinders later wrote in his memoirs of Bungaree's \\"good disposition and open and manly conduct\\" and his kindness to the ship's cat, Trim. In 1815, Governor Lachlan Macquarie dubbed Bungaree \\"Chief of the Broken Bay Tribe\\" and presented him with of land on George's Head as well as a breastplate inscribed \\"BOONGAREE ‚Äì Chief of the Broken Bay Tribe ‚Äì 1815\\". Bungaree was also known by the titles \\"King of Port Jackson\\" and \\"King of the Blacks\\", with his principal wife, Cora Gooseberry, known as his queen. Bungaree continued his association with exploratory voyages when he accompanied Captain Phillip Parker King to north-western Australia in 1817 in the , amongst other things giving advice on which plants were safe to eat. Captain Faddei Bellingshausen referred to Bungaree's welcoming visit to the Russian exploration ship Vostok in 1820. Bungaree spent the rest of his life ceremonially welcoming visitors to Australia, educating people about Aboriginal culture (especially boomerang throwing), and soliciting tribute, especially from ships visiting Sydney. He was also influential within his own community, taking part in corroborees, trading in fish and helping to keep the peace. In 1828, he and his clan moved to the Governor's Domain, and were given rations, with Bungaree described as 'in the last stages of human infirmity'. He died at Garden Island on 24 November 1830 and was buried in Rose Bay. Obituaries of him were carried in the Sydney Gazette and The Australian.Smith, pp. 144‚Äì145. By the end of his life, he had become a familiar sight in colonial Sydney, dressed in a succession of military and naval uniforms that had been given to him.McCarthy, F.D. [1966] (2006). \\"Bungaree ( ‚Äì 1830)\\" , Australian Dictionary of Biography. Australian National University. ISSN 1833-7538.Pollon, pp. 225‚Äì226. His distinctive outfits and notoriety within colonial society, as well as his gift for humour and mimicry, especially his impressions of past and present governors, made him a popular subject for portrait painters, with eighteen portraits and half a dozen incidental appearances in wider landscapes or groupings of figures. His were among the first full-length oil portraits to be painted in the colony, and the first to be published as a lithograph. Legacy *Boongaree Island, located off the Kimberley coast of Western Australia, was named after him by Captain King in 1820. *The suburb of Bongaree, Queensland, is named after him.Smith, p.32. *HMAS Bungaree, originally built in Dundee as a cargo vessel in 1937 for the Adelaide Steamship Company, but commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy after conversion into a minelayer in June 1941 at Garden Island, Sydney, was named after him. *In 2017, a Sydney Ferries Emerald-class ferry was named Bungaree. However Bungaree's important role in the exploration of Australia appears to have been almost forgotten. There are statues to Flinders and even the cat Trim, but as at January 2019, not a single statue to Bungaree recognising his achievements. Sources * Pollon, F. (ed.) [1988] (1996).

It was named after Juan Jos√© Flores, the first president of Ecuador, during whose administration the government of Ecuador took possession of the archipelago. It was previously called Charles Island (after King Charles II of England), and Santa Mar√≠a after one of the caravels of Columbus. The island has an area of . It was formed by volcanic eruption. The island's highest point is Cerro Pajas at , which is also the highest point of the volcano like most of the smaller islands of Gal√°pagos. History Since the 19th century, whalers kept a wooden barrel at Post Office Bay, so that mail could be picked up and delivered to their destination by ships on their way home, mainly to Europe and the United States. Cards and letters are still placed in the barrel without any postage. Visitors sift through the letters and cards in order to deliver them by hand. Due to its relatively flat surface, supply of fresh water as well as plants and animals, Floreana was a favorite stop for whalers and other visitors to the Gal√°pagos. When still known as Charles Island in 1820, the island was set alight as a result of a prank gone wrong by helmsman Thomas Chappel from the Nantucket whaling ship the Essex. Being at the height of the dry season, Chappel's fire soon burned out of control and swept the island. The next day saw the island still burning as the ship sailed for the offshore grounds and after a full day of sailing the fire was still visible on the horizon. Many years later Thomas Nickerson, who had been a cabin boy on the Essex, returned to Charles Island and found a black wasteland: \\"neither trees, shrubbery, nor grass have since appeared.\\" It is believed the fire contributed to the extinction of some species originally on the island. In September 1835 the second voyage of HMS Beagle brought Charles Darwin to Charles Island. The ship's crew was greeted by Nicholas Lawson, acting for the Governor of Gal√°pagos, and at the prison colony Darwin was told that tortoises differed in the shape of the shells from island to island, but this was not obvious on the islands he visited and he did not bother collecting their shells. He industriously collected all the animals and plants, and speculated about finding \\"from future comparison to what district or 'centre of creation' the organized beings of this archipelago must be attached.\\"Keynes, R. D. ed. 2001. Charles Darwin's Beagle Diary. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 356. On 8 April 1888 , a Navy-manned research vessel assigned to the United States Fish Commission, visited Floreana Island during a 2-week survey of the islands. In 1929, Friedrich Ritter and Dore Strauch arrived in Guayaquil from Berlin to settle on Floreana, and sent letters back that were widely reported in the press, encouraging others to follow. In 1932 Heinz and Margret Wittmer arrived with their son Harry, and shortly afterwards their son Rolf was born there, the first citizen of the island known to have been born in the Gal√°pagos. Later in 1932, the self-described \\"Baroness\\" von Wagner Bosquet arrived with companions, but a series of strange disappearances and deaths (including possible murders) and the departure of Strauch left the Wittmers as the sole remaining inhabitants of the group who had settled there. They set up a hotel which is still managed by their descendants, and Mrs. Wittmer wrote an account of her experiences in her book Floreana: A Woman's Pilgrimage to the Gal√°pagos. A documentary film recounting these events, The Galapagos Affair, was released in 2013. The demands of these visitors, early settlers, and introduced species devastated much of the local wildlife with the endemic Floreana tortoise being declared extinctFitter, Julian; Fitter, Daniel; and Hosking, David. (2000) Wildlife of the Gal√°pagos. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, p.83. and the endemic Floreana mockingbird becoming extirpated on the island (the few remaining are found on the nearby islands of Gardiner and Champion).Fitter, Julian; Fitter, Daniel; and Hosking, David. (2000) Wildlife of the Gal√°pagos. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, p.68. When Charles Darwin visited the island in 1835, he found no sign of its native tortoise and assumed that whalers, pirates, and human settlers had wiped them out. Since about 1850, no tortoises have been found on the island (except for one or two introduced animals kept as pets by the locals), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified the Floreana tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus sometimes called Chelonoidis nigra) as extinct. However, it may be that there are pure Floreana tortoises living on other islands in the archipelago. Geology Isla Floreana is a shield volcano, which has erupted alkaline basalts since 1.5 Ma. It is the southernmost island in the Galapagos Archipelago, and a 3,400 m submarine escarpment 10 km south of the island forms the southern boundary of the Galapagos Platform. There are over 50 scoria cones onshore and 6 tuff cones offshore. Mostly composed of tephra, these cones are the origin of the A'a lava flows. The oldest flows are on the northern end of the island, while the youngest (26 ka) are on the southern end. Cerro Pajas, the tallest inactive volcano on the island, is the origin of the largest lava flow (272 ka). Points of interest * A favorite dive and snorkeling site, ‚ÄúDevil's Crown‚Äù, located off the northeast point of the island, is an underwater volcanic cone, offering the opportunity to snorkel with schools of fish, sea turtles, sharks and sea lions, which are abundant amongst the many coral formations found here. * At Punta Cormorant, there is a green olivine beach to see sea lions and a short walk past a lagoon to see flamingos, rays, sea turtles, and Grapsus grapsus (Sally Lightfoot) crabs. Pink flamingos and green sea turtles nest from December to May on this island. The \\"joint footed\\" petrel is found here, a nocturnal sea bird which spends most of its life away from land. * Post Office Bay provides visitors the opportunity to send post cards home without a stamp via the over 200-year-old post barrel and other travelers. * A miniature football (soccer) field, complete with goals, at the end of Post Office Bay, is used by tour boat crews and their tourists.

Brennan, Elizabeth C. Clarage. Who's Who of Pulitzer Prize Winners, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999. pg. 70  Biography  Stowe was born in Southbury, Connecticut. After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1921, where he was a member of a fraternity that later became a chapter of The Kappa Alpha Society, he started working as a journalist and became a foreign correspondent in Paris in 1926 for the New York Tribune. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1930 for his coverage of the Paris Reparations Conference. Stowe was a runner-up for a second Pulitzer Prize in 1940 for his work as a war correspondent in World War II and his coverage of the Russo-Finnish War. In the summer of 1933, Stowe visited Nazi Germany. Shocked by its militarism, he wrote a series of critical articles that were not published as the articles were seen as too alarmist. Stowe published the articles in a book, Nazi Germany Means War; it was, however, not a success.\\"A Clairvoyant in Connecticut: How Leland Stowe Forecasted a Second World War\\", article from The Wesleyan Argus, 17 April 2018 When World War II started in Europe in 1939, he worked as a war correspondent for the Chicago Daily News and the New York Post. He happened to be in Oslo on April 9, 1940 and therefore witnessed the German invasion, as well as the general confusion within the Norwegian forces, administration, and Allied Expeditionary Forces. Stowe \\"revealed the collaboration of Norwegian Vidkun Quisling in helping the Nazis seize Oslo without a shot.\\"Obituary from the University of Michigan In 1942 Stowe as a war correspondent visited Moscow and traveled to the front lines of the still retreating troops of USSR. His travel companion and guide was Ilya Ehrenburg, a Russian-Jewish-Soviet war journalist. Stowe's book They Shall Not Sleep gives a rare insider view of an American journalist on the Soviet Army, and the events of the war from the Soviet side of the front. Stowe's critical reportage was claimed to be one of the influences that helped bring down Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in the United Kingdom.\\"Orbituary\\", University of Michigan, \\"Reporting for the Chicago Daily News, and later ABC, he covered the Russian invasion of Finland; revealed the collaboration of Norwegian Vidkun Quisling in helping the Nazis seize Oslo without a shot; recounted the British debacle at Trondheim, Norway, which helped to weaken the government of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain\\" His writings also gave the Norwegian government-in-exile considerable bad media coverage.

January 1994 In 1955, he became a professor of journalism at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. During his tenure, he alternated between teaching one semester each academic year and working as an editor and staff writer for Reader's Digest. During this time he heard about a pioneering settler in British Columbia named Ralph Edwards and spent 12 days in his remote cabin interviewing him for the book Crusoe of Lonesome Lake (1957) which became one of Stowe's most popular books. He taught at the university until he retired in 1970, after which he was a professor emeritus of journalism. He remained in Ann Arbor until his death. In addition to the Pulitzer Prize, Stowe also received the L√©gion d'honneur, the War Cross (Greece), and honorary degrees from Harvard University, Wesleyan, and Hobart College, amongst other honors.

It is a small community of about 200 houses but local amenities include a park, church, chapel, pub, village hall, clubhouse and (Ofsted 'Outstanding') primary school. The Pennine Way runs through it. Christ Church, Lothersdale Raygill, Lothersdale The Parish Council has five elected members and meets on the second Thursday of each month (except for August) at 7.30 p.m. It decides on the amount of local taxes (the precept), planning applications, and numerous other issues pertaining to local life. No house in the village is connected to mains gas or water and it has very limited mobile and broadband connection. This has had the effect of limiting the amount of development that has taken place and gives the village an unspoilt atmosphere. It has also caused conflict for more than 25 years over the ownership rights of water from various springs. The village boasts a recreation ground which includes woodland walks, the village beck, bird-hide, picnic areas, a football pitch, a multi-use games area and a new children's playground. The village pub is the Hare and Hounds. It serves hot food and real ales. The village hall is a popular venue for parties, concerts, dances, whist drives and other social events. In recent years the village has held an annual 'Party in the Park' in the recreation ground. On the site of a former lime and baryte quarry is Raygill Lakes, which was the first site studied by the Yorkshire Geological Society in 1875. Mammalian and marine fossils were discovered here. The village has good rail connections (two miles away in Cononley) to Leeds, Bradford and London, about three hours by rail from Skipton. Access to Manchester is via the M65 motorway at Colne.

It is one of a number of towns situated immediately to the south of the Ochil Hills, collectively referred to as the Hillfoots Villages or simply The Hillfoots. It is located between Tillicoultry and Menstrie. Alva had a resident population of 5,181 at the 2001 census but this has since been revised to 4,600 in 2016. It boasts many features such as a park with an event hall and a newly opened outdoor gym, and is the home of Alva Academy.  History  During the Industrial Revolution, Alva developed as a textile manufacturing centre; the woollen mills, originally water-powered, provided employment for locals and migrants to the area. The Mill Trail Centre is next to the Cochrane Park, housed in the old Glentana Mill built in 1887. It houses permanent exhibitions about the history of the old woollen industry and the experiences of the many people employed in the industry. The Dalmore Works was built in 1874 for Wilson Brothers, who produced textile products including tweed, woollen novelty fabrics and mohair and woollen rugs. The works were operated by Wilsons until 1964, when the failure of Wilson Bros (Alva) Ltd, set up jointly with McBean and Bishop Ltd, caused the firm to lose the works. Alva was historically in an exclave of Stirlingshire, but it was transferred to Clackmannanshire in 1891.  Geography  Alva lies right at the foot of the Ochil Hills. The Ochil Fault, movement of which gave rise to the steep southern scarp of the Ochil Hills, coincides approximately with the old road along the base of the hills. The rock beneath the carse in this area is of Carboniferous age. The town is situated on slightly higher ground than the surrounding carse, being on two overlapping alluvial fans, made up of material deposited by the Carnaughton Glen and Alva Glen burns. The spectacular Alva Glen cuts into the Ochils immediately north of the town. Alva Burn flows from the glen, through Alva, and into the River Devon. To the east of Alva Glen, and parallel to it, is the Silver Glen, where silver was mined at one time. A more recent attempt about 1 km to the south of Alva, the Glenochil Colliery, was not a success, and the site is now the site of HM Prison Glenochil. Facilities Alva has many shops, three Christian places of worship: a small but growing Baptist fellowship, a well established Church of Scotland and St. John Vianney's Roman Catholic Church ; a few pubs, a small library and a medical practice. There are two large parks - Johnstone Park and Cochrane Park, which contains the local hall (Cochrane Hall). Every second Saturday in July, Johnstone Park is host to the Alva Games, the last remaining Highland Games show in Clackmannanshire. The McArthur Braes, at the foot of Alva Glen, was once a formal park that has fallen into neglect; it is now being regenerated. Map of Alva from 1945 The town has both a primary school and a secondary school. Alva Academy takes pupils from several primary schools in the Hillfoots area. The school was relocated on a new campus early in 2009. The new Alva Academy has been built at the end of Greenhead, a street on the south-east side of the town. Transport Alva is on the main A91 Stirling to St Andrews road. Bus services run to Stirling and to Alloa (via Tillicoultry), and (less frequently) to St Andrews. There was once a railway station that served the town from 1863 to 1954. Recreation For more than 150 years, the annual Alva Games have been held in the town. Between 1937 and 1954, Alva Glen was famed for its annual Illuminations, which drew visitors from across Scotland. In 2004 the Illuminations were revived. Economy and industry A bottle of Old Engine Oil =Harviestoun Brewery= Harviestoun is a small Scottish brewery founded in 1983 by Ken Brooker in a 200-year-old stone barn on a farm on the Harviestoun estate near Dollar. It moved in 2004 to Alva Industrial Estate in Alva, before being bought by Caledonian Brewery in 2006. It became independent again in 2008 - when Caledonian was bought by Scottish & Newcastle, Sandy Orr & Donald MacDonald saw Harviestoun as a valuable asset and decided to purchase the brewery and run it independently. Harviestoun Brewery produces a variety of beers in keg, cask, bottle and can. The most notable brews include Schiehallion Craft Lager, Bitter & Twisted Golden Ale, Old Engine Oil Black Ale, Ola Dubh Whisky Barrel Aged Ale. Architecture The most prominent building in Alva is Strude Mill, a former woollen mill that has been restored and converted to flats. It stands above the town at the base of the hills, and is clearly visible from some distance away.

He is also known under the name of Shah Nawaz, which he assumed on being obliged outwardly to conform to Islam. Life The son of Teimuraz I, Prince of Mukhrani, Vakhtang was the first Georgian ruler of the Mukhranian branch of the House of Bagrationi, and succeeded his cousin, David, as the Lord of Mukhrani (Mukhranbatoni) in 1629. He was adopted, in 1653, by the childless ruler of Kartli, Rostom Khan, as his heir and successor to the throne. Vakhtang went to Persia, in 1654, to be confirmed by Abbas II, accepted Islam and took the name Shah Nawaz. He lived for some time in Persia at the court of Abbas, with whom he enjoyed great favour. As regent, he actually ran the government in the last years of Rostom, succeeding him as wali/king of Kartli in 1658. Vakhtang V (Shahnawaz) followed the policy of his predecessor, managing to maintain a peaceful relationship with his Persian suzerains and to revive the economy of Kartli. Upon his accession, he made efforts to bring other Georgian polities under his control. In 1659, he had Zaal of the Aragvi, an anti-Persian rebel lord and virtual ruler of neighbouring Kakheti, assassinated and confiscated a large portion of his estates. Shahnawaz then intervened in bitter power struggles in western Georgia; he allied himself with the princes of Mingrelia, Guria, and Abkhazia, and put his son, Archil, on the throne of Imereti in 1661, but after the intervention of the Ottomans was to recall his son and to place him, with the shah‚Äôs permission, on the throne of Kakheti in 1664. In 1674, Erekle I, a grandson of the late king Teimuraz I of Kakheti, returned from exile in Russia to claim his succession. He was soon summoned to Iran by Shah Suleiman I. Archil thought that the shah would install Erekle as King of Kakheti and therefore attempted, though vainly, to seize the throne of Imereti. Unsuccessful in his efforts, he then fled, together with his brother, Luarsab, to Ahiska (Akhaltsikhe) in Ottoman territory. The shah reacted to this by ordering Shahnawaz to Isfahan. Shahnawaz left his son, George, to rule Kartli and himself began his journey to Persia. He died, however, on the road at Khoskaro, Ganja, in September 1675, and was buried in Qum, Iran. Family and children Vakhtang was married twice. His first wife as Rodam Kaplanishvili- Orbeliani, daughter of Prince Kaplan Baratashvili and founder of the Orbeliani family. At the insistence of the shah of Iran, Vakhtang had to divorce, with great reluctance, Rodam on his accession to the throne of Kartli, to marry Mariam Dadiani, (died 1682), widow of his adopted father Rostom. Rodam became a nun under the name of Catherine and died at Tbilisi in 1691. All of Vakhtang's children were mothered by Rodam. These were: * Archil (1647‚Äì1713), sometime king of Kakheti and of Imereti. * George XI (Gurgin Khan; 1651‚Äì1709), king of Kartli. * Levan (Shah-Quli Khan) (c. 1653‚Äì1709), regent of Kartli. * Alexander (Iskander Mirza; fl. 1666 ‚Äì 1697), a darogha (prefect) of the Persian capital Isfahan in 1667. Married Mehr Sharf Begum, a daughter of Izz- i-Sharf and Mirza Abdollah al-Husayni al-Marashi. * Luarsab (died 1698), whose natural son, Alexander (died 1711), was a Safavid commander in Afghanistan. * Solomon (Suleiman Mirza; died 1703), who was married to Tamar, daughter of Shalva, Duke of Ksani, and had a son, Oman; * An anonymous daughter, who married, in 1655, Zurab, Duke of Aragvi (died 1661). * Anuka (died 1697), who was sent in the harem of Shah Abbas II in 1660. After Abbas's death, his successor Shah Suleiman I gave Anuka in marriage to Shah Verdi Khan of Luristan to the chagrin of Anuka's brother George XI of Kartli. * Tamar (died 1694), who married, in 1661, Prince Givi Amilakhvari (c. 1634 ‚Äì 1700) and had five children.

Torop claims that on 18 August 1990, when he was 29, he had a revelation that he was the reincarnation of Christ. He first spoke publicly about his claim in Minusinsk on 18 August 1991.

His religion combines elements of the Russian Orthodox Church with Buddhism, apocalypticism, collectivism, and ecological values. Torop founded the Church of the Last Testament in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia in 1991 just before the fall of the USSR. He predicted the imminent end of the world with only his followers being saved.

It has some four thousand inhabitants, largely living autochthonously and following ecological principles. The central settlement, also called The Town and The Mountain, has a three-tiered structure: the Town itself (Abode of Dawn), the Heavenly Abode, and the Temple Peak.  Interpretation  Since 1992, biographer Vadim Redkin has published an annual volume detailing Vissarion's activities. Vissarion has attracted followers from Germany's esoteric subculture, and seven volumes of Vadim's account have been translated into German.Vissarion In May 2012, the Vice YouTube channel released \\"Cult Leader Thinks He's Jesus (Documentary Exclusive)\\", containing a report by Rocco Castoro, a reporter for Vice in Petropavlovka, and his interview with Vissarion.Cult Leader Thinks He‚Äôs Jesus The video depicts the settlement and the people as a very nice place with good people, but the ideas of the group as very cultish.

Information Lou was born Louwrens Voorthuijzen in Breezand. He had a strong religious interest from an early age, probably under the influence of his devout father. He chose the profession of fisherman. After a failed marriage he met Mien WiertzWilhelmina Wiertz, *14-08-1914 in Baarn and began to believe under her influence that he must save the world from the devil. Voorthuijzen sold his boat and took up employment as an eel vendor at the Dappermarkt in Amsterdam, where he became known as Lou de Palingboer (Lou the eel vendor). From his market stall, he preached to his customers that he was \\"the resurrected body of Jesus Christ\\". He would elaborate further in a nearby caf√©. A circle of followers formed around him. In 1954, he began holding weekly meetings in the Frascati and De Brakke Grond theatres, where he captivated his audience with a mix of mystical language and down-to-earth humour. In 1957, a rich supporter bought a large house in Muiderberg in the municipality Muiden. They called it the \\"White House\\", and lived in it communally. His followers believed him to be a God. According to Harry Mulisch's Voer voor psychologen (Fodder for Psychologists), he claimed to be the author of the Bible. Some members of his group rejected medicine in favour of his blessing as a cure for ailments. Lou himself claimed to be immortal. Around this time, Dutch society began to see them as a cult. Tensions frequently arose when one partner of a couple was not \\"in Lou\\" and the other one was. This resulted in a number of divorces in which Lou was summoned to testify, which he disliked. Lou moved to Agimont in the French-speaking part of Belgium to avoid summons of this kind. After his death in Belgium in 1968, the movement seems to have dissipated. Wiertz, who moved to Spain, continues to have faith in him and there are a few other elderly believers left.

A Viking grave, attributed to Harold, has been found on the nearby Setter's Hill, overlooking the landing point. Geography It is a small bay in a crescent moon shape with a hill on either side, with steep cliffs and rough waters with good mackerel fishing grounds underneath. The beach is rocky until it comes to an old ruin of a pier, then it has huge boulders blocking traveller's way. Lining the beach are little cottages with their only barrier against the winds from the sea being a small wall on the other side of the road.

Collins contributed several songs to the band including \\"Walking Out On Love,\\" \\"Let Me Into Your Life\\" and one song, \\"Working Too Hard\\", to the group's only release, a 1976 self-titled four-song EP distributed by independent Bomp! Records. The Nerves are most famous for Lee's \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\" later popularized by Blondie on their breakthrough album Parallel Lines. After The Nerves' demise Collins and Case formed The Breakaways which went through several guitarists until Case and Collins both moved to guitar and recruited Mike Ruiz (drums - Milk 'N' Cookies) and Steven Huff (bass and backing vocals - The Apollo Stars). Case left the group after a few months of rehearsals to pursue a solo career which led to the eventual formation of The Plimsouls. Collins, Huff and Ruiz officially became \\"The Beat\\" when pressed for a group name prior to an interview to promote the release of The Breakaways recording of \\"Walking Out On Love\\" (credited as Paul Collins) on Bomp's Waves Vol. 1. Transition years The LA power pop scene was beginning to garner national attention and with the help of Collins' friend from The Nerves days in San Francisco, Eddie Money and his Producer Bruce Botnick, Collins was able to ink a deal with Columbia/CBS and Bill Graham Management. CBS released their self-titled debut in October 1979. All 12 songs were Collins originals; Peter Case, Steven Huff and Eddie Money had one co-writing credit each, all on different songs. Continuing in The Nerves' vein, the album consisted of harmony-laden, driving guitar pop songs, including a re-recorded version of \\"Working Too Hard\\". The album was critically acclaimed and is today remembered as a classic of the power pop genre (see [ this] 4.5-star review in Allmusic). The group appeared on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, (March 8, 1980), The Merv Griffin Show and that same year contributed a song to the soundtrack LP of the popular comedy movie Caddyshack. Despite promotion, respectable airplay on commercial and College radio, diligent touring alongside such popular artists as Ian Gomm, The Jam and a tour of Europe, The Beat found little commercial success. The band's second CBS LP, The Kids Are The Same was released two years later in 1982 with drummer Ruiz now replaced by Dennis Conway, who played for both Elton John and Alice Cooper. The group was now billed worldwide as \\"Paul Collins' Beat\\". The British ska group of the same name were first to establish themselves as \\"The Beat\\" in Europe, prompting a voluntary decision for the U.S. group to be billed as \\"Paul Collins' Beat\\" in Europe. In the U.S., Collins' \\"The Beat\\" was first to release an album in turn forcing the British group to use the name \\"The English Beat\\" in the U.S., albeit only after the British group was threatened with a lawsuit by Columbia, Collins' record label. Not as critically successful as its predecessor, The Kids Are The Same was also a commercial flop. A two-year lag between releases, a name change and this \\"sophomore slump\\" resulted in the group being dropped from CBS-Columbia. Undaunted, the group self-financed the production of 3 videos featuring songs from the LP now abandoned by their former label. One of these videos \\"On The Highway\\", which had been modestly promoted to AOR radio by CBS, was put on medium rotation for several months on the then fledgling MTV network. With an overhauled New York City line-up (Conway and Whitman were replaced by Patti Smith drummer Jay Dee Daugherty and Television/Tom Verlaine guitarist Jimmy Ripp), the group reclaimed the name \\"The Beat\\" and released the 5 song 12\\" Mini-Album To Beat or Not To Beat in 1983 on the independent Jem/Passport label in the U.S.. One song from the album, \\"Dance, Dance\\", was made into a music video in 1984 and received limited exposure on MTV. To Beat or Not To Beat, with an additional song, was released in Europe where the group relocated (and would remain for the next several years) to promote the release and tour, this time featuring Paul's brother Patrick Collins on guitar & Fabian Jolivet on drums during that year of extensive Spanish & French tours, TV shows, etc... In 1985 another 6 song 12\\" Mini-Album \\"Longtime Gone\\" was produced by former Mot√∂rhead drummer Lucas Fox and recorded in London with UK musicians, including Jim Barber on Guitar (The Rolling Stones & Mick Jagger solo album), being released only in Europe. A live album recorded in Madrid, Spain with Spanish members (featuring Manolo Iglesias on drums) titled Live At The Universal followed in 1986. Collins relocated to San Francisco, releasing the album One Night, with yet another incarnation of an all American Beat, this time credited as \\"Paul Collins + The Beat\\", through Sony in 1989 (again only in Europe). One Night was their first album to feature acoustic instruments such as mandolin and acoustic guitar. This was their final studio album before disbanding. Collins would go on to record several solo albums before later re-forming a new version of The Beat. Later years Collins embarked on a solo career in the 1990s, releasing \\"Paul Collins\\" in 1992, featuring numerous guest appearances by S.F. Bay Area notables. Collins then returned to his \\"hometown\\" of New York City. Focusing his songwriting on Country, Folk and Americana he formed \\"The Paul Collins Band\\" which produced the 1993 release \\"From Town To Town\\". Collins continues to tour, while retaining a cult following; he is particularly popular in Spain. The Paul Collins' Beat music videos \\"On The Highway\\" and \\"Dance, Dance\\" are occasionally aired on the VH1 Classic and MTV2 television networks. In 2006 Collins resurrected \\"Paul Collins' Beat\\" with the help of bassist Juancho Bummer and a slightly younger Spanish lineup and recorded a live album entitled Live In Europe, released as a free MP3 CD album download on their official website followed by a CD of all new original material, \\"Flying High\\", recorded in Madrid, Spain. That was followed in March 2008 with Ribbon Of Gold. This album contains several songs the band performs live in concert, including Falling In Love With Her, I Still Want You, Big Pop Song and She Doesn't Want To Hang Around With You. Paul Collins' Beat latest release is a split 7\\" with the Italian powerpop band Radio Days (band), released by the Italian label Surfin Ki Records. In 2009, Bill Graham catalog released Live At Berkely Theatre with Eddie Money through Wolfgang's Vault. Collins continues to tour and record new material. Comeback albums In 2010, Collins Paul Collins' Beat signed a record deal with Alive Naturalsound and recorded an album of new material with Jim Diamond at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit, Michigan. Diamond is a respected Record producer, who is best known for his work with The White Stripes. The studio was chosen because it relies on vintage recording and Diamond is said to use a 2\\" 24-track tape machine among other mixing boards and various pieces of equipment. The album was entitled \\"King Of Powerpop,\\" which included artwork by famed artist Bill Stout in addition to a guest performance by Wally Palmar, vocalist and harmonica player from The Romantics and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2014, Alive Records released Collins' second comeback album, entitled \\"Feel The Noise.\\" In support of the new album, Collins embarked on a world tour and released a music video for the single 'I Need My Rock N' Roll.' Green Day Broadway Musical In 2011, the American punk rock band Green Day launched the American Idiot Broadway Musical Production. Each night included a live rendition of the song \\"Walking Out On Love,\\" which was written by Paul Collins. The song was previously recorded by Collins' groups The Beat, The Nerves and The Breakaways. Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong is an outspoken fan of the song, which may appear on a future studio album by Green Day. To celebrate the success of the musical, The Paul Collins Beat joined Green Day onstage for live performances in New York. Collins and Case reunion tribute to the Nerves In 2012, longtime friends and musical partners, Paul Collins and Peter Case embarked on a reunion tour paying tribute to their respective bands The Nerves, The Breakaways, The Beat and The Plimsouls. The touring band lineup for the Collins and Case tour was augmented by members of The Paul Collins Beat (Timm Buechler, bass, and Amos Pitsch, drums), offering audiences with full-band electric showcases. The tour included a date in Austin, Texas, where actor Bill Murray made a surprise appearance at the concert to introduce the band to the audience. The Beat had previously appeared on the Caddyshack original motion picture soundtrack alongside Murray in 1979. According to the L.A. Times Music Blog of March 22, 2012, the tour \\"fell apart\\" early due to \\"musical differences\\". Collins' guitarist is Tim Schweiger, a veteran musician who also tours with Tommy Stinson of The Replacements. The Beat Army During 2005, Collins launched a new music program and partner-based booking agency that was recently renamed as The Beat Army. Collins created a forum where fans, bands, clubs, radio stations, blogs and record stores can network. The interaction between Paul Collins' Beat and other bands has enabled him to cross-promote his new projects, book shows on several continents and establish a worldwide network of industry friends, fans, musicians and artists from the genres of rock, punk rock, power pop, new wave, alternative rock, ska, garage rock, hardcore punk, classic rock and roll, skate punk, emo, melodic hardcore, Grindcore, crust punk, grunge, skacore, heavy metal, thrash metal, crossover thrash, metalcore, rapcore, post-hardcore and speed metal. The business model for The Beat Army is a simple process in which a band or artist agrees to book a club or festival gig for both themselves and Paul Collins' Beat, who agree to perform the show as a headlining act. Once Collins and his management approve the contract, the band serves as a booking agent and the venue is chosen based upon its style of music and the type of people it attracts. After the performance, Collins divides the proceeds evenly between his band, himself and the members of the opening act. With Collins' solo albums heavily rooted in the genres of alt-country, Americana, folk and country music, he continues to maintain a diversified fanbase. The Beat Army has enabled Collins to book shows with country bands, singer-songwriters, folk artists, and rockabilly bands.

The Paul Collins Beat tour with The English Beat In Fall 2012, The Paul Collins Beat joined a package tour \\"The Two Beats Hearting As One Tour,\\" co- headlining with Two-tone Ska group The Beat. The English Beat and The Paul Collins Beat were both part of the \\"new wave\\" of bands to emerge from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The styles of music they play are very different. The tour package included dates at large music halls, casinos, auditoriums and clubs. According to a September 2012 interview with Collins, \\"Contrary to what the internet fabricates, there never was and is no animosity toward The English Beat. I am still a big fan of The English Beat. Ska is really cool music. Dave is a good friend. He's always so nice and always upbeat. He's just as supportive of my music as I am of his. Both of our fanbases are enjoying hearing each other's music.\\" According to an October 2012 press release, Dave Wakeling stated, ‚ÄúPaul and I originally met back in '83 and have been in touch occasionally over the years, but recently we've been in closer Facebook contact, which led to this idea becoming a reality....Two beats, hearting as one!‚Äù China tour In Spring 2014, The Paul Collins Beat embarked on a groundbreaking tour of China, performing full-band electric concerts in nine cities, in addition to in-store performances at record shops and televised news programs. Supporting the Paul Collins Beat were Shanghai based punk group Round Eye who also organized the tour of the mainland. Neither Collins nor his earlier groups The Nerves, The Breakaways or The Beat had previously performed in China, although each project retains a sizeable following due to the resurgence of vinyl LP records and recent worldwide reissues. The tour provided The Paul Collins Beat the opportunity to perform in large cities, small working class towns and student centers based around Chinese colleges. Collins also performed a special acoustic concert at Shanghai Experimental School, which attracted the attention of Chinese media outlets and was aired on television. Other information Original Beat lead guitarist Larry Whitman (September 27, 1955 ‚Äì July 26, 1997), a devoted fan of Phil Spector, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Before joining The Beat, Whitman was producer, songwriter and member of L.A. pop group Needles & Pins, whose only release was the Spector influenced 45 RPM single \\"Don't You Worry\\". A poster of The Beat's self-titled first album can be seen in the opening credits of some episodes of \\"WKRP In Cincinnati\\". Portions of the album The Kids Are The Same were recorded in 1980 at Twentieth Century Fox Music Scoring Stage during a Musician's Union strike against the motion-picture and television industries. Although The Beat's song \\"There She Goes\\" is included on the soundtrack album of the film, Caddyshack, and listed in the closing credits, it was not used in the final cut of the film.

Guadalc√°zar landfill Metalclad bought a landfill site in Mexico's city of Guadalc√°zar from a Mexican company Coterin in 1993. Coterin had planned to develop a hazardous waste landfill on the site but were unable to secure the necessary permits from the local government. Metalclad were able to obtain land use permits from the Mexican federal government, but local governments did not respond to their application for a building permit, neither allowing nor denying the site.Compensation for Regulatory Expropriation Under NAFTA: Mexico and the Metalclad Case - International Environmental Law Committee Newsletter - Vol. 2, No. 3 - April 2000 The mayor of the city was opposed to the landfill because of the amount of toxic waste in it and the threat to the local water supply. In 1992, before Metalclad purchased the site, a review by Mexican environmental officials found that over twenty thousand tons of hazardous waste had been improperly dumped. The officials agreed to allow the dump to continue processing and to issue permits on the condition that Metalclad clean up the improperly dumped materials. In 1993, Metalclad purchased the landfill. Locals complained that they were getting sick, developing aggressive diseases, and that their water was polluted. The main water well was about 60 yards from the stream flowing through the location where Metalclad was dumping its material. A 1994 environmental study by commissioned by the new governor found that the dump was appropriately sited (located) and could continue operations. In 1995, the Mexican Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources authorized the operations of the landfill with the condition that Metalclad agree to clean up the improperly disposed hazardous materials. Local authorities then denied the building permit. A court case determined that the permit denial meant that Metalclad was required to cease operating the site. In 1997, Metalclad sued the Mexican Government for damages under Chapter 11 of NAFTA for $90 million and was awarded by an ICSID arbitration panel $16.7 million.ICID-Award in Metalclad Corp v The United Mexican States, CASE No. ARB(AF)/97/1, August 30, 2000 This award was later reduced by $1.1 million to $15.6 million, by review in the courts of British Columbia (the jurisdiction where the NAFTA hearing was held) due to a recalculation of the applicable interest period.

Jesus and his disciples travel to the country of the Gerasenes (some manuscripts have \\"Gadarenes\\" to harmonize with ) across the Sea of Galilee by boat, a region that is in modern Jordan. A possessed man comes to meet them. Mark relates the story \\"with a wealth of circumstantial detail\\":Tuckett, C. M., Mark in Barton, J. and Muddiman, J.

Jesus asks him what his name is and he replies \\"My name is Legion, ... for we are many\\". Legion may be a reference to the Roman army.Miller, Robert J., editor, The Complete Gospels, Polebridge Press 1994, p. 24 Proper names are ‚Äúsaturated with meaning,‚Äù Baruch Hochman, Character in Literature (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985), 37. and Legion‚Äôs name is no exception: He is completely possessed by a foreign occupying power, demons.James L.

They see some nearby pigs and the demons ask if they can be put in the pigs, to which Jesus consents. The pigs then rush into the lake and drown. The people tending the pigs run off to town telling everyone what has happened, and some townspeople come to see for themselves. When they arrive the man is sitting dressed and sane. They are disturbed and ask Jesus to leave the area, and he complies. Out of \\"grateful love\\", the man asks Jesus to let him be with him (, hina met autou e), translated as \\"stay with him\\" in the Jerusalem Bible,Jerusalem Bible (1966), Mark 5:18 but Jesus tells him to go home to his \\"family\\" (Amplified Bible) or to his \\"people\\" (New International Version) and tell them what God has done for him. The man then travels over the Decapolis telling people the story. Protestant theologian Heinrich Meyer suggests that \\"he was to abide in his native place as a witness and proclaimer of the marvellous deliverance, that he had experienced from God through Jesus, and in this way to serve the work of Christ\\". Anglican biblical scholar Christopher Tuckett argues that \\"a number of details and inconsistencies within the present narrative suggest that Mark may be combining more than one tradition here into a single story\\": *verse 2 has the man \\"immediately\\" meet him as Jesus has come out of the boat, whereas verse 6 says that \\"when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him\\" *verse 8 interrupts a dialogue which otherwise appears to flow from verse 7 to verse 9 *verse 15 seems odd after verse 14, since the latter presupposes a considerable time lapse. This story also occurs in Matthew , where there are two possessed men, and in Luke .  Jairus' daughter and the woman who touched Jesus' garment  Illustration from the Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter of Jesus healing the bleeding woman. On the other side of the lake Jesus is met by a man named Jairus, a Synagogue Ruler (a rich patron of the local house of worship), who begs Jesus to heal his sick, twelve-year-old daughter. Jesus takes only Peter, James, and John. This story does not occur in the Gospel of John. On the way there, a woman who suffers from chronic \\"bleeding\\", perhaps menorrhagia or bleeding from fibroids.Brown et al. 608 She sneaks up to Jesus and touches his garment, according to and (see also , Mark 6#Healing of the sick of Gennesaret) the \\"fringe of his cloak\\"Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus: \\"Jesus wore the ·∫íi·∫ìit (Matt. ix. 20)\\"; Strong's Concordance G2899; Walter Bauer's Greek-English Lexicon of the NT, 3rd ed., 1979: \\": 1. edge, border, hem of a garment - But meaning 2 is also possible for these passages, dependending on how strictly Jesus followed Mosaic law, and also upon the way in which was understood by the authors and first readers of the gospels. 2. tassel (◊¶◊ô◊¶◊™), which the Israelite was obligated to wear on the four corners of his outer garment, according to Num 15:38f; Dt 22:12. ...

( - NRSV), by which she is healed. He turns to see who and she fearfully confesses. He says \\"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\\" Men arrive and tell Jairus that his daughter is dead. Jesus brushes them off and says \\"Don't be afraid; just believe.\\" They arrive at the house and everyone is crying loudly. Jesus assures everyone she is not dead, just asleep, goes inside and says to her Talitha kum, telling her to get up, and she does. Unlike the demon possessed man, he tells them not to tell people of these events. This account also appears in Matthew 9:18-26 and Luke 8:40-56. Luke keeps the stories of the possessed man and the two women together, but Matthew inserts the story of the paralyzed man, the calling of Matthew, and the parable of the wineskins found in Mark 2 between these two stories.

Life Staudinger was born in Gro√ü W√ºstenfelde, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, from a Bavarian family on his father's side. His grandfather was born near Ansbach and came to Holstein at the end of the 18th century where Staudinger's father was born in Gro√ü Flottbeck in 1799. His mother, a born Schroeder, was from Mecklenburg, born in Putzar at the Count of Schwerin's estate in 1794. At the time of Otto Staudinger's birth in 1830 his father was the tenant of the Rittergut Gro√ü W√ºstenfelde. At the age of six or seven Otto was introduced into entomology by his private tutor Wagner who collected beetles. In the summer of 1843 his father purchased the Rittergut L√ºbsee near G√ºstrow where Otto ‚Äì now under the instruction of tutor Hermann ‚Äì began to collect Lepidoptera. From October 1845 he attended the Gymnasium (grammar school) in Parchim and in summer 1849 received his Abitur (diploma qualifying for university admission). In October 1849 Staudinger took up the study of medicine at the University of Berlin. In his second semester he changed to natural history under the impression of Dr. Stein's inspiring zoology lectures. From June 1850 to autumn 1851 he undertook entomological excursions and on the very first of these the capture of a series of freshly emerged Synanthedon tipuliformis in the cemetery of Stralau established his predilection for the clearwing moths (Sesiidae). He became friends with fellow students Theodor Johannes Kr√ºper (later director of the natural history museum in Athens) and Carl Eduard Adolph Gerstaecker (later professor in Greifswald) and met many of the Berlin entomologists of the era, especially Grabow, Simon, Scherffling, Libbach, Glasbrenner, M√ºtzel, Streckfu√ü, Walther, the Kricheldorff brothers, Ribbe and Kalisch. Their collecting grounds were mainly the Grunewald, the Jungfernheide (where at that time Staurophora celsia still occurred), the Wuhlheide, the Kalkberge near Strau√überg and the lonely Finkenkrug, then situated deep inside the forest. In autumn 1851 Staudinger seems to have fallen ill (though the biographical sources are silent about the nature of his ailment) and after a prolonged illness he was advised to go on a recovery trip. Accordingly, Staudinger spent May to August 1852 at Lake Geneva and in the Mont Blanc area, then he travelled across the Simplon Pass to Genoa and thence ‚Äì always on foot ‚Äì along the Riviera to Nice, Marseilles, and Montpellier where he stayed until late November, everywhere socialising with local entomologists. After a visit at home he travelled to Paris in January 1853 to perfect his French and to learn Italian and English. At Easter 1853 he took up his studies in Berlin again and collected intensively ‚Äì mainly Sesiidae ‚Äì together with Kalisch, Ribbe and the Kricheldorff brothers. In March 1854 he received his Dr. phil. degree for the thesis \\"De Sesiis agro Berolinensis\\". Otto Staudinger From April to October 1854 Staudinger collected in Sardinia with the intention to discover the larvae of Papilio hospiton in which he succeeded after many failures. In 1855 he collected in the Alps (Carinthia, Glockner area). In April 1856 he started on a voyage to Iceland together with C. Kalisch. On his return in the autumn of 1856 he became engaged to entomologist Grabow's daughter and married her on 21 January 1857. The same night the couple departed and travelled via Paris, Lyon, Marseilles ‚Äì where they stopped and learned Spanish within ten days ‚Äì Barcelona, Valencia and Almer√≠a to M√°laga, where they stayed for a month. Then they spent nine months in Granada (living in the Alhambra) where Staudinger collected extensively and where their daughter was born on 2 November. In December they went via M√°laga to Chiclana near Cadiz, spent the first half of 1858 there and finally returned to Berlin in July. Because of the costs of his travels Staudinger founded a business and, with the help of his father-in-law, began to sell parts of his collections. Over the years this grew into a substantial and successful naturalist business with worldwide connections. In 1859 the Staudinger family moved to Dresden where his son Paul was born the same year. In Dresden Staudinger built the Diana-Bad (Diana Baths) in 1864, a large facility with bath tubs, steam baths, and Irish-Roman baths which Staudinger loved since this type of bath had helped him when he had a bad cold on a journey. When his city dwelling became too small in 1874 he moved to the \\"Villa Diana\\" in Blasewitz near Dresden. In 1879 the Danish-born entomologist Andreas Bang-Haas (1846‚Äì1925) entered into the business, married Staudinger's daughter in 1880 and became co-owner of the firm, now \\"Staudinger & Bang- Haas\\", in 1884 or 1887. In 1884 the growing company moved to the larger \\"Villa Sphinx\\" and ten years later a two-story wing had to be added. From the mid-1880s onward Staudinger entrusted the company business more and more to Bang-Haas and concentrated on his work in Lepidoptera taxonomy. Staudinger died on 13 October 1900 during a recovery trip in Lucerne, Switzerland. =Further important collecting trips= * 1860 Norway, Finnmarken (with M. F.

Achievements and impact One of Staudinger's most valuable and durable achievements was the publication of three catalogues of the Lepidoptera of Europe and eventually of the entire palaearctic region. These \\"Check-lists\\" as they would be called today were immediately accepted by lepidopterists, used as a basis of faunal lists and stimulated further taxonomic studies. As early as 1861 Staudinger together with Max Ferdinand Wocke published a Catalog der Lepidopteren Europa's und der angrenzenden L√§nder [Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of Europe and adjacent countries], himself treating the so-called Macrolepidoptera, and Wocke the Microlepidoptera. The next edition, bilingual in German and French, appeared in 1871 (Catalog der Lepidopteren des Europaeischen Faunengebiets [Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the European Faunal Region]) and found wide distribution. The 1901 edition became a standard work of reference; it was edited after Staudinger's death by Hans Rebel who wrote the Microlepidoptera part while Staudinger had treated the Macrolepidoptera: Catalog der Lepidopteren des palaearctischen Faunengebietes [Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Palaearctic Faunal Region]. Staudinger also played a key role as an initiator of entomological and biological exploration in many parts of the globe. He not only bought collections from the eastern Palaearctic and many tropical areas but he often sent collectors and naturalists to specific areas of interest: * Amur and Ussuri regions (Vladivostok, Suifun, Sutschan, Isle of Askold: F. D√∂rries and brothers, 1877‚Äì1898, Jablonovoi-Mountains [\\"Apfelgebirge\\"], 1896), * NE Siberia (Vitim: O. Herz, 1888), * Tarbagatai (near Zaysan: J. Haberhauer, 1877), * Altai (near Ongadai, Bashkam, Tshuja valley: Henry John Elwes and Borezowsky, 1898), * Mongolia (Uliastai: a cossack collecting for H. Leder, 1893; Kentei mountains: F. D√∂rries, 1889, 1893; around Urga: J. Haberhauer, 1895; Changai: H. Leder, 1899), * Tibet (between Lop Nur and Qinghai Lake, E. R√ºckbeil for R. Tancr√©, 1893-1893), * Chinese Turkestan (near Korla: J. Haberhauer, 1897), * eastern Tien Shan (Chamyl and elsewhere: J. Haberhauer, 1896), * Tien Shan (between Issyk-Kul and Kuldja: E. R√ºckbeil, 1895?), * Asia minor (Mardin, Gaziantep, Merzifon, Malatya, Hadjin, Kayseri, Tokat, Antakya, Marasch and elsewhere: J. Manisadjian, 1875‚Äì1897), * Taurus (near Zeitun: Haradjian, 1897), * Syria (F. Zach), * Palestine (Bacher, 1896‚Äì1899; J. Paulus, 1890‚Äì1898), * Sierra Leone and Cameroon (Dr. Preuss, 1866), * Indo-Australian archipelago (Waigeu, Moluccas [Ambon, Batjan, Ceram, Halmahera], Celebes [Minahassa], Sangir, Philippines [Jolo, East Mindanao, Mindoro], Timor, Palawan, Sarawak: Dr. K. K. Platen, 1880‚Äì1895), * Ceylon, Penang, Borneo (Brunei, Labuan, Kinabalu) (J. Waterstradt, 1888‚Äì1904), * Panama and Chiriqui (H. Ribbe, 1878), * Amazon (Dr. Hahnel, 1879‚Äì1884, 1885‚Äì1887, later also O. Michael and the Garlepp brothers, these also in Peru und Bolivia), * Peru (Chanchamayo: F. Thamm, around 1870-1873). In this way Staudinger succeeded in publishing whole faunal lists of districts some of which had been entomological terra incognita before. Examples are the Lepidopteren-Fauna Kleinasiens (1881), Die Macrolepidopteren des Amurgebietes (1892) and the Lepidopteren des Kentei-Gebirges (1892). The taxonomic work on these collections was Staudinger's life work. He described hundreds if not thousands of taxa, mainly from the families of the so-called Macrolepidoptera. All scientifically important specimens, especially the types ‚Äì which Staudinger labelled \\"Origin.\\" (for \\"original specimen\\") ‚Äì remained in his private collection. A bibliography of Staudinger's entomological works lists 137 publications (Anonymus 1901). Numerous taxa have been named for Staudinger. After Staudinger's death the firm \\"Staudinger & Bang-Haas\\" was led by Andreas Bang-Haas. In 1913 his son Otto Bang-Haas (1882‚Äì1948) became the sole owner and continued to run the firm until his death. After that it was dissolved on 30 September 1948. Collection Staudinger's private collection (with the types of the taxa described by him) went to the Zoologisches Museum der Humboldt-Universit√§t in Berlin in 1907, his collection of palaearctic Microlepidoptera and larvae of palaearctic Macrolepidoptera went to the same institution in 1937. The business collection of palaearctic Lepidoptera went to Hans Kotzsch after Otto Bang-Haas' death and finally came to the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Tierkunde Dresden in 1961.

A negawatt market is a theoretical energy market where the commodity traded is a negawatt-hour, a unit of energy saved as a direct result of energy conservation measures. An assortment of LED lamps commercially available as of 2010 as replacements for screw-in bulbs, including floodlight fixtures (left), reading light (center), household lamps (center right and bottom), and low-power accent light (right) applications Origin and development A negawatt-hour is a unit of energy saved as a direct result of energy conservation measures, such as reducing the use of heat or electricity. The concept was developed after Amory Lovins authored an article published in the March 21, 1985 issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly arguing that utility companies will sell less electricity and more efficiency by marketing 'negawatts'. In Lovins' opinion, utility customers don‚Äôt want kilowatt-hours of electricity; they want energy services such as hot showers, cold beer, lit rooms, and spinning shafts, which can come more cheaply if electricity is used more efficiently. Negawatts are a form of encouragement to motivate consumers to conserve energy.Bartram, Rodgers, & Muise (2010). Lovins considers the concept of conservation \\"a change in behavior based on the attitude 'Do Less to Use Less.'\\" He makes a distinction between conservation and efficiency by defining efficiency as \\"the application of technologies and best practices to eliminate waste based on the attitude, 'Do the same or more with less.'\\"Knickerbocker. (2001). Cost for negawatt power can be calculated using cost-effectiveness analysis or CEA. For energy efficiency investments a CEA calculation produces the value of saved energy or negawatts in $/kWh. Such a valuation allows comparing the price of negawatts with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative. Specifically, Tuominen et al. have suggested using the dynamic generation cost type of CEA for energy efficiency investments as it includes the best accounting for the time value among the various CEA methods available. According to Lovins, energy efficiency represents a profitable global market and American companies have at their disposal the technical innovations to lead the way. Not only should they \\"upgrade their plants and office buildings, but they should encourage the formation of negawatt markets\\". Lovins sees negawatt markets as a win-win solution to many environmental problems. Because it is \\"now generally cheaper to save fuel than to burn it, global warming, acid rain, and urban smog can be reduced not at a cost but at a profit\\". Lovins explains that many companies are already enjoying the financial and other rewards that come from saving electricity. Yet progress in converting to electricity saving technologies has been slowed by the indifference or outright opposition of some utilities. A second obstacle to efficiency is that many electricity-using devices are purchased by people who won‚Äôt be paying their running costs and thus have little incentive to consider efficiency. Lovins also believes that many customers \\"don't know what the best efficiency buys are, where to get them, or how to shop for them\\". In 2003 in France under the guide of Thierry Salomon 23 scientists wrote \\"Le manifeste N√©gawatt.\\" Megawatt and negawatt seem to be reminiscent to the larger concept of ecological footprint, handprint handprint, and by following this line of thought toward compatibility and comparability a second frame of concept seems appropriate: mindprint -- the impact in another frame or setting where units or numbers can not be compared (see paradigm shift). See association n√©gaWatt. Market Lovins has advocated a \\"negawatt revolution\\", arguing that utility customers don‚Äôt want kilowatt-hours of electricity; they want energy services such as hot showers, cold beer, lit rooms, and spinning shafts, which can come more cheaply if electricity is used more efficiently. Lovins defines the negawatt market as a way to reduce the gap between the cost of making and saving electricity. The negawatt market can be thought of as a secondary market where electricity is allocated from areas of less use to areas of greater use. This would be a secondary market, due to the fact that it would reallocate electricity from one consumer to another within the already existing energy market. Some feel that to establish a viable market, legislation and cooperation between primary producers, distributors, traders and consumers, may be required. This proposal would encourage the market to have legislative regulations, while still allowing the market to work within itself to set prices and allocate resources.Fotopoulos, (2007). A negawatt market would allow \\"demand side resources\\" to participate in wholesale energy markets. These markets are commonly referred to as a demand response. Demand response can be defined as \\"enrolling large users of energy in programs to lower their usage in return for compensation, which helps take pressure off the grid\\" Gulyas, (2008). This market would help take pressure off the grid because electricity could \\"be treated as a commodity just like copper or sowbellies,\\" and therefore traded to areas that need it more than others.{ As any commodity, negawatts would have to be \\"tradable across time and space\\" to be an effective market.Lovins, (1989). \\"The negawatt revolution-solving the co2 problem.\\" Being able to trade negawatts across time and space would allow for an international trading system. To create a market for negawatts, energy companies will need to put more focus toward energy efficiency.(2010, May). Generating \\"negawatts\\". This shift in focus would require a new \\"business structure that will thrive in the 'negawatt market'\\", which has not yet been developed. Market possibilities are being implemented internationally, implying that one day an official negawatt market will become a reality.Weinberg, (2001). Implementation =Government implementation= Negawatt power is being implemented in many states in the U.S. and is emerging as an international strategy to reduce energy consumption. \\"Test negawatt auctions began in 1999 in Connecticut and Georgia and more than a dozen utility exchanges were in existence\\" in 2000. In an effort to move toward energy efficiency, New York has created programs \\"supported through Energy $mart, which is run by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), with money from a small surcharge on utility bills.\\"Alliance for clean energy, New York. (2008). Energy Efficiency Negawatt power is implemented in California as well as Texas. \\"Some Texas congressmen and energy companies are trying to help California avert blackouts and utility price shocks this summer with [...] 'negawatts'. On January 1, 2009, the states of South Australia and Victoria (Australia) became the first in Australia to offer \\"householders energy efficiency incentives programs delivered via local electricity retailers.\\"Energy Matters. (2008, December 31). The UK has implemented the Electricity Demand Reduction pilot scheme in 2012, and second phase in 2016. This is backed by the Electricity Capacity Regulations 2014. =Private implementation= The negawatt market is being used by governments and companies. Aluminum manufacturers in the Pacific Northwest shut down their power plants and sold the unused energy because selling the negawatts was more profitable for the company than selling the aluminum product. This was possible because \\"The smelters hold power contracts with the federal Bonneville Power Administration that contain clauses allowing them to market the electricity.\\" The Associated Electric company in rural Missouri is implementing the usage and spreading the knowledge of negawatts by performing energy audits at their customer's homes to show them where they could be saving electricity. Rebates are being given to help customers pay for more energy-efficient, Energy Star appliances. Keith Hartner, the CEO of Associated Electric Cooperative Inc., feels that negawatts are generating savings for their customers and for the company as well: ‚ÄúThe goal of this program is to save money not only at the generator but also at the meter for the members.‚ÄùMcCarty, (2008).\\"\\" Individual households can practice negawatts through using energy-efficient lighting and Energy Star appliances as well as simply reducing standby power. The resulting savings sometimes offset the investment in new high efficient light bulbs and appliances. These efficiencies can offset a portion of the cost of a residential photovoltaic system. Negawatts reduces the overall size of the photovoltaic system required for the household, because they are consuming less electricity. This results in a faster payback period for the photovoltaic system. The City of San Diego has created a negawatts initiative called \\"Reduce then Produce\\" to promote this idea.CCSE Press Releases (2011), \\" \\" Advantages =Cost= The most noteworthy advantage in creating a negawatt market is the cost incentive. As many will say, \\"The cheapest watt is the one that's never created.\\"Bartram, Rodgers, & Muise, (2010). P. 8-14. In this market, the consumers who increase their home efficiency, or decrease their energy consumption, can earn money by selling the saved electricity. This is similar to an emissions trading or a cap-and-trade system, in which the energy that is not used can be bought from the consumers who saved the energy and sold to those who need to purchase the extra energy. Providers of electricity can encourage consumers to sell back their unused energy, or negawatthours, especially during peak hours. A major question that electric companies need to ask themselves is whether it is less expensive to pay consumers to reduce consumption for a few instances a year or to build and maintain a side-supply resource that would only be used a few times a year. Many argue that the \\"cost of foregone consumption is less than the cost of increasing the supply of electricity.\\" If a consumer conserves a substantial amount of energy then there can even be an allowance for a tax deduction. According to the Negawatt Power Solutions Group, a \\"building that achieved a 50% energy cost reduction may be eligible for tax deduction up to $1.80 per square foot.\\"NegaWatt Power Solutions Group. (2009). \\"\\" Negawatts can help alleviate some of the costs of constructing new, efficient buildings. \\"The negawatt revolution now provides a way to cut construction costs, capture big returns on capital in renovations, [and] dramatically cut operating expenses.\\"Lovins, & Browning, (1992) \\"Negawatts for buildings\\" Existing buildings can be made more efficient by renovating the insulation to cut back on electricity used for heating, installing more efficient light fixtures, and an upgraded HVAC design. Renovating a building to be more energy efficient will cost less than creating entirely new, more efficient buildings. =Reduction of national energy dependency= The reduction of the amount of energy that a region emits can slowly separate a nation from a high energy consumption of oil. The desire to become a less energy-dependent country may promote behavioral changes and a different societal outlook on energy usage. These potential societal perspective changes could lead to an overall more sustainable country. The reduced consumption of energy would also produce less greenhouse gases, which could have positive outcomes on the economy, political parties, and interest groups, such as environmentalists. According to Lovins, improvements in energy efficiency and conservation, due to a change in behavioral attitudes, have a huge potential to reduce a country's \\"long-term energy needs,\\" such as the United States. =Local deregulation= Some conservatives claim that the negawatt market could help nations or states have a deregulated electricity system. This would allow a nation or a state to experiment with \\"electricity deregulation,\\" in which \\"demand reductions could be purchased with a minimum of disruption to businesses, workers and the economy.\\" In the United States, for instance, the negawatt market could assist California with rolling blackouts by making more power available from consumers who choose to conserve energy or increase their negawatts. California could achieve the goal of deregulation by allowing a deficit area to \\"purchase an emergency supply from anywhere within with West\\" in which \\"the ultimate purpose of deregulation was to allow competition in the electricity market and consumer choice of electricity providers.\\"\\"\\". Negawatt power would allow the consumers in a country's economy to decide how the energy will be distributed: essentially benefiting regions that hope to have a deregulated electricity system. Drawbacks =Difficulty in creating a negawatt market= Currently, there is no way to precisely measure the amount of energy saved in negawatts; it can only be theoretically determined based on the consumer‚Äôs history of energy use. Visualizing has a very important role in ‚Äúenabling residents to understand and manage their energy use,‚Äù which serves as a form of encouragement for consumers to conserve energy. Without the visualization of the energy use, it is difficult to conceptualize negawatts because the consumer cannot see a precise value of the amount of saved energy. Smart meters are becoming a more developed technology to measure energy usage, but \\"consumers are calling on state regulators to move cautiously on smart meters, citing complaints in some states that the meters are raising electric bills rather than lowering them.\\"Peters, (2010). \\"Consumers wary of smart meters.\\" Some municipally owned utilities and cooperatives argue that negawatt power \\"lets consumers treat electricity as a property right rather than a service [...giving them] legal entitlement to power [that they] don't consume.‚ÄùJim, (2001). This would indicate that consumers would treat electricity as a property, not a service. Some people, including the senior vice president Joe Nipper from the American Public Power Association, oppose the idea that people would receive money for power that they did not even spend. Electricity price caps may also need to be implemented in order for the emerging negawatts market to function correctly.Jim, (2001). To some, government limitations on markets are unfavorable. There is a current view that negawatts are worth pursuing, but that they are unlikely to satisfy the world's thirst for energy to the extent their advocates assume. =Expense of efficiency= Saving energy by the negawatt and creating a negawatt market can present several drawbacks for manufacturers and electricity providers. Manufacturers are less inclined to make energy-efficient devices which meet a specific standard, such as Energy star's standard, because of increased time and cost, while receiving minimal profit. Overall, electricity providers may not want customers to use less energy due to the loss of profit. Some even argue that producing energy-efficient products, such as light bulbs, actually simulate more demand, ‚Äúresulting in more energy being purchased for conversion into light.\\"The Economist, (2010). \\"Energy Conservation: Not Such a Bright Idea.\\" Customers may also be less inclined to buy products that are more energy efficient due to the increase in cost and time spent. \\"Even when the information is known and, despite the overall long-term cost-saving potential, the price of energy is too low...for individuals to justify the initial cost of energy efficiency measures.\\"(2010). \\"Generating \\"negawatts\\".\\" Not only are energy efficient devices more expensive, but \\"consumers are poorly informed about the savings on offer. Even when they can do the sums, the transaction costs are high: it is a time-consuming chore for someone to identify the best energy-saving equipment, buy it and get it installed.\\"Economist, (2008). P. 78. The technology used to measure the amount of energy that a consumer uses and saves, known as smart meters, grid systems, or energy dashboards, require time for the consumer to understand. Some argue that people need to have access to ‚Äúsimple yet effective information systems to help users understand their energy without having to become technology experts.‚Äù The current visual energy measuring devices could be made simpler and less expensive, which may encourage customers to save more energy, thus increasing their negawatts. The capital cost of energy-efficiency is erroneously argued by some to exceed the energy savings (energy required for raw materials, manufacture and transport to point of sale versus running costs). For instance they argue that the capital cost of buying a new energy efficient car will not be recouped unless the car runs for more than ten years. However increased energy efficiency leads to less usage and longer life.

In 1992 at Barcelona, the 19-year-old Sadovyi revealed as the strongest swimmer of the Olympic games, winning three gold medals and setting two world records in the 400 m freestyle and 4√ó200 m freestyle relay for his team. He missed the Giorgio Lamberti's world record in the 200 m freestyle race by a 0.01 second, but cut 1.47 seconds off Kieren Perkins' record in the 400 m, beating the same Australian swimmer. In 1993, Sadovyi was second in the 200 m freestyle at the European Championship in Sheffield, plus two other golds in freestyle relays. He retired in September 1996 to work as a swimming coach, first in his native Volgograd, then in Moscow, with the national team, and later in Libya.

Career =Portsmouth= Lovell started his career in 1998 when he joined Bournemouth, but then surprisingly signed for Portsmouth for ¬£250,000Steve Lovell's career record, Soccerbase, 19 May 2009 despite only making a few brief appearances. He then went on loan to Exeter City, Sheffield United (where he scored once against Watford) and Queens Park Rangers. =Dundee= Lovell signed for Scottish Premier League club Dundee in the summer of 2002. He spent three seasons at Dens Park, scoring 35 goals in 98 competitive appearances. =Aberdeen= In the summer of 2005, following Dundee's relegation from the SPL, Lovell signed for Aberdeen. He made his Aberdeen d√©but against Kilmarnock on 8 August and scored his first goal against Rangers the following week. Lovell went on to score a further nine times that season. Lovell formed the habit of scoring late goals for Aberdeen, becoming something of a \\"supersub\\". These late goals included two in separate matches against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, which maintained Aberdeen's unbeaten record against that opponent. Lovell also scored a consolation goal in the second leg of Aberdeen's UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena. In April 2008, he was told by Jimmy Calderwood that he would not be offered a new contract by Aberdeen and would be free to leave in the summer. It was reported on 18 July that Hibernian, Kilmarnock and Falkirk were all interested in signing him.Three SPL clubs pursuing Lovell, BBC Sport, 18 July 2008 =Falkirk= In August 2008, Lovell signed for Falkirk on a one- year deal with the option of a further one. He scored his first goal in a League Cup match against Queen of the South and netted his first league goal against Hamilton Academical the following Saturday. Despite a disappointing season for Falkirk in the league, Lovell ended up with a Scottish Cup runners- up medal, after playing the full match in the final against Rangers. In May 2009, it was reported that Lovell had undertaken a medical at Tannadice Park ahead of a proposed move to Dundee United, although United manager Craig Levein later refuted the story and Lovell admitted he knew \\"absolutely nothing about it\\". On 27 June 2009, he left Falkirk despite finishing the season as their top league goal scorer after new manager Eddie May refused to renew his contract.\\"Lovell and Aafjes leave Falkirk\\" BBC Sport website (27 June 2009) Lovell attempted to sue the club the following year for compensation as he claimed he had been entitled to a contract extension. =Partick Thistle= After leaving Falkirk, Lovell signed for Partick Thistle where he played seventeen games, scoring 3 goals, before leaving on 24 March 2010 to have surgery on a niggling ankle injury. =Bournemouth= In June 2010, Lovell joined his half-brother, Eddie Howe at AFC Bournemouth, his second spell at the club. After spending a period of pre-season with the club in 2009 he finally signed following the lifting of the club's transfer embargo. Lovell's contract came to an end after the 2010‚Äì11 campaign, but was offered a further year plus one-year option by Cherries boss, Lee Bradbury, and put pen to paper on 25 May 2011 keeping him at Bournemouth until at least May 2012. Lovell had struggled to overcome an ankle injury and only returned to the squad in April 2011 but showed enough quality to merit a new deal. On 1 September 2011, Lovell announced his retirement from professional football with immediate effect after struggling with injuries for the past two seasons. Lovell scored four goals during his second spell at Bournemouth. His first goal came against Hartlepool in the league, a game in which Bournemouth confirmed their spot in the 2010-11 play offs despite conceding an injury time goal scored by Hartlepool goalkeeper Scott Flinders. However, his two goals against Huddersfield in the play off semi final second leg were unable to prevent them from losing on penalties. At the start of the following season, Lovell scored a goal against West Bromwich Albion in the League Cup as they lost 4‚Äì1. On 2 September 2011 Lovell retired from football because of injury. Personal life In 2008, Lovell became engaged to Scottish singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald but the two have now separated.Dingwall, John.

While other video games may use in-game advertising (such as an advertisement on a virtual billboard or branding on an in-game object), an advergame is differentiated by the Interactive Advertising Bureau as a \\"game specifically designed around [the] product or service being advertised\\". An advergame is considered a type of advertainment. Advergames are commonly targeted to minors, who tend to be more responsive to persuasive messages that can be embedded in such games. Concerns have been raised by parents and advocates for children that such advergames can influence children's habits, particularly food-based products. History Advergames (a portmanteau of \\"advertisement\\" and \\"video games\\") appeared early in the history of the video game industry. One of the first known attempts was a polo sport game tied into the brand Polo clothing label that Carol Shaw had been developing for the Atari 2600 around 1978 but which was cancelled before release. The first known released advergame was Tapper, a 1983 arcade game. The game had been originally sponsored by brewer Anheuser-Busch, and predominately featured the brand's logo and with gameplay based on serving beer. Its release was targeted for bars or other establishments for adults, but the game proved popular, and a non-branded version Root Beer Tapper was released for general arcades, with beer replaced by root beer. Numerous advergames were developed through the 1980s and 1990s for home video game consoles and personal computers, but with the introduction of wide-spread availability of the Internet, browser games became a popular route for advergames. Such games were cheaper to produce compared to previous advergames as well as to other traditional advertising routes such as television advertising. A Kaiser Family Foundation report in 2006 found that 73% of 96 food product companies had established dedicated sections of their websites with advergames that were targeted at children, with many of these offering multiple advergames. Advergames moved into mobile games by around 2014, due to the proliferation of mobile devices and their common use by children. =Other examples= Other examples of advergames that have achieved widespread awareness include: * Chex Quest, a non-violent first-person shooter developed for personal computers in 1996 for the Chex cereal brand. While the game was a total conversion of Doom, it is considered one of the few advergames that was enjoyable to play. * Sneak King, PocketBike Racer, and Big Bumpin', a series of Xbox 360 video games paid for by Burger King in 2006, and available through meal purchase at most Burger King restaurants. Of the three, Sneak King became popular and sold more than 2 million copies that year. * America's Army, released for personal computers in 2002, was developed by the United States Army as a recruiting tool for teenaged players. Legal concerns =Protection for children= Because video games generally draw significant interest from minors, there are ethical and legal concerns around advergames. Whereas adults generally can recognize and resist persuasive advertising in games, younger children may not recognize that an advergame is a form of advertising and can be drawn in by statements made by the game. One key market area of concern was food product-based advergames. The increased used of browser and mobile advergames in the mid-2000s led to concerns that such games would lead to an increase in the childhood obesity rate. In particular, many food-based advergames promote less nutritious products like snack foods. However, research has shown that the influence of advergames is not limited to foods with poor nutrition, as a study using advergames designed around healthy food choices led to the monitored children to select a healthier snack when presented a variety of choices. =False advertising= Advergames can run afoul of laws established related to truth in advertising. Making false claims, even if in language not intended to be advertising, in advergames can result in penalties and fines by the national or regional consumer protection agencies. In a notable case, the Gatorade company, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, had published a free mobile game Bolt! which featured Usain Bolt and challenged the player to \\"keep your performance high by avoiding water\\". The state of California asserted this claim was false, as Gatorade had been shown to be more harmful to the human body than water, and with the game targeted to youth, send the wrong message. The state sued Gatorade, and the case was ultimately settled with Gatorade paying a fine to the state, part of which the state used to promote health-conscious water-drinking habits for children. =National regulations and oversight= In the United States, attempts have been made by the United States Congress to give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) authority to oversee online advertising aimed at children, including advergames, but had been challenged by lobbies representing the food industry and effectively shut down such attempts. Nevertheless, the propagation of online games and advertising aimed at children led to passage of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in 2000, which set strict standards for what type of private information websites could collect from minors, with the FTC overseeing any such fines. In the United Kingdom, advergames regulation was brought into coverage by the CAP Code or the Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing in 2016. The CAP code, updated frequently, provides specific guidance on what advergames (among other types of advertising) can and cannot do, with specific attention to how such games may influence children. CAP code violations are monitored and penalized by the Advertising Standards Authority. Other concerns Messaging in advergames may backfire and impact the reputation of the brand the game promotes. A notable example from Intel, which had published in 2004 The Intel IT Manager Game, a browser-based game that attempted to give insight into the job opportunities of an information technology manager, including simulating the hires of new employees. However, the game only allowed male employees to be higher by design, and Intel received criticism for discounting female hires. The game was taken offline and later replaced with a new version that had equal gender representation. While the situation could be compared to a similar problem around the game Fable which also forced players to male avatars, the real-world setting of Intel's game was seen as a more serious flaw, and at the time, gender representation in the information technology industry was a serious concern.

S√ºdtirol is an Italian association football club, based in the city of Bolzano, in the autonomous province South Tyrol. The club was formerly known as its bilingual name F.C. S√ºdtirol ‚Äì Alto Adige. The club currently plays in Serie C. History In the early 90s came the idea to bring professional football back to South Tyrol, because since the 80s with FC Bolzano no South Tyrolean team played more in a professional league. The negotiations for the takeover of FC Bolzano failed. A South Tyrolean entrepreneurial group then took over the SV Milland, which was in financial difficulties. The SV Milland (based in a district of Brixen) played before the acquisition in the season 1994/95 in the regional Eccellenza, but relegated after the season into the Promozione. =1995-2000: In the amateur leagues= The team was renamed to FC S√ºdtirol‚ÄìAlto Adige in 1995; Alto Adige is the Italian name of the province while S√ºdtirol its German native name. The club started its first season in 1995 in the regional Promozione (then still the seventh highest league in Italy). The immediate promotion to the Eccellenza has been achieved. Also in this league the team immediately reaches the first place. From the 1997/98 season the club played in the national league Serie D (V). Each season, the FC S√ºdtirol was able to improve and achieved in 2000, then under coach Giuseppe Sannino, the promotion to Serie C2 (IV), the lowest professional league. =2000‚Äì2010: FC S√ºdtirol in Serie C2 (IV)= In 2000 the company incorporated as Fu√üballclub S√ºdtirol S.r.l., thus becoming F.C. S√ºdtirol and relocating to Bolzano (though it was legally based in Brixen until 2011). The club was able to establish itself quickly in the professional league. The aim of the club was to realize the promotion into Serie C1 as soon as possible. The team failed in the following seasons each time in the play-offs. The FC S√ºdtirol got into financial difficulties and then put more on the youth work. Just before the end of the season 2008/09, the youth coach Alfredo Sebastiani took over the first team. With him, the club could avoid the relegation in the play-outs against Valenzana Calcio. Under Sebastiani, the team reached in 2009/10 for the first time the promotion to Serie C1 (III), by finishing the season on the first place. =2010 to today: the third league of Italy= In the 2010‚Äì11 Lega Pro Prima Divisione season, S√ºdtirol was relegated to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione after the relegation \\"play-out\\", but on 4 August 2011 was readmitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione to fill the vacancies. In the next season, the club hired Giovanni Stroppa, who was at that time youth coach of Milan. The team was able to establish itself in the third tier and narrowly missed the promotion play-offs. With good performances, players like Manuel Fischnaller and Alessandro Iacobucci moved to the Serie B. After the season Stroppa became Coach of the Serie A club Pescara. In the 2012‚Äì13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione season, the team was coached by Stefano Vecchi. With him the team was able to reach the promotion playoffs of the Italian third tier for the first time in club history. In the play-off semi-final the team was eliminated by Carpi, which the latter eventually won the promotion. In the following season, Vecchi was hired by Carpi. The 2013‚Äì14 season started with Lorenzo D'Anna as coach, who was previously youth coach of Chievo. Under him, the team could score five points in the first five matches, which was not enough for the promotion ambitions of the club. They changed coaches and hired Claudio Rastelli to Bolzano. During the championship, the team was able to prevail better and in the end reached the third place of the table. That means the best result of the club's history and the repeated achievement of the play-offs. In the quarterfinals the team could prevail against Como on penalties. In the semi-final, Cremonese was defeated after two legs. The final round for the promotion to Serie B was lost against Pro Vercelli. Colors and badge =Colors= The team's colors are white and red. With these colors, the club shows its closeness to the Province of South Tyrol and the city of Bolzano, which also have the colors white and red in their coats of arms. Traditionally, the home jerseys of the club are in white. Most of the time the team play away with red jerseys, but they can also be black in other seasons. =Badge= The current logo of the association is a slightly different form of the badge used since the club was founded in 1995 to 2016. Among other things, the lettering \\"Alto Adige\\" was removed. The logo of the association is a circular badge with a white-red diamond pattern and a football inside. The logo is circled with the words \\"FC S√ºdtirol\\" (German term for \\"FC South Tyrol\\") and \\"Bolzano - Bozen\\". Compared to the previous badge, the diamond pattern was renewed and the red color darkened slightly. Infrastructures =Stadium= Drusus stadium in Bolzano The home games of FC S√ºdtirol will be played in the Drusus stadium in Bolzano. The home of the club was named after Nero Drusus, a Roman general. It was built in 1936. The stadium has a capacity of 3,000 spectators. It was renovated in 2000 for professional gaming. The Drusus Stadium has a main and opposite tribune. It is planned to modernize the stadium and increase the capacity to 5,400 spectators to meet the standards of the Serie C. In the case of a promotion to Serie B, the expansion of the stadium to 10,000 spectators is also included. In addition, VIP boxes, a restaurant, several bars and a fan shop are planned. The stadium will be rebuilt into a pure football stadium and thus also the athlete field will be removed. =FCS Center= The FCS Center in Eppan, near Bolzano. The FCS Center is the training center of the team in Eppan, near Bolzano. In 2015, the training areas were completed and include two natural turf pitches, two artificial turf pitches and another small artificial turf pitch. The service center was opened in 2018 and offers the club changing rooms, offices, a gym with a medical department, meeting rooms, a restaurant and a fan shop. In the training center also the championship games of the national youth teams of FC S√ºdtirol are held. In 2010, the training center was the training camp of the German national football team for the preparation of the World Cup in South Africa. In 2018, the German national team uses again the center for the preparation of the World Cup in Russia.

Until his death, Levins was a university professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a long-time political activist. He was best known for his work on evolution and complexity in changing environments and on metapopulations. right Levins also had written on philosophical issues in biology and modelling. One of his influential articles is \\"The Strategy of Model Building in Population Biology\\". He has influenced a number of contemporary philosophers of biology. Levins often boasted publicly that he was a 'fourth generation Marxist' and often had said that the methodology in his Evolution in Changing Environments was based upon the introduction to Marx's Grundrisse, the rough draft of Das Kapital. With the evolutionary geneticist Richard Lewontin, Levins had written a number of articles on methodology, philosophy, and social implications of biology. Many of these are collected in The Dialectical Biologist. In 2007, the duo published a second thematic collection of essays titled Biology Under the Influence: Dialectical Essays on Ecology, Agriculture, and Health.Lewontin, R., and Levins, R. 2007 (November 1). Biology Under the Influence: Dialectical Essays on Ecology, Agriculture, and Health, Monthly Review Press; First Edition (US), First Printing edition (November 1, 2007) Also with Lewontin, Levins had co-authored a number of satirical articles criticizing sociobiology, systems modeling in ecology, and other topics under the pseudonym Isadore Nabi. Levins and Lewontin managed to place a ridiculous biography of Nabi and his achievements in American Men of Science, thereby showing how little editorial care and fact-checking work went on in that respected reference work. Biography Richard Levins was of Ukrainian Jewish heritage and was born on June 1, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York.Aurora Levins Morales Blog: http://www.AuroraLevinsMorales.com/blog.html He recorded reminiscences of his politically and scientifically precocious childhood in an article in Red Diapers. He reportedly had read Paul de Kruif's Microbe Hunters (1926) at age 8 (in 1938) and his first of Charles Darwin's books at age 12 (in 1942). At the age of 10, Levins had been inspired by the essays of the Marxist biological polymath J. B. S. Haldane, whom Levins considers to be the equal of Albert Einstein in scientific importance. Levins studied agriculture and mathematics at Cornell. He married Puerto Rican writer Rosario Morales in 1950. Blacklisted on his graduation from Cornell, he and Rosario moved to Puerto Rico, where they farmed and did rural organizing. They returned to New York in 1956, where he earned his PhD at Columbia University (awarded 1965). Levins taught at the University of Puerto Rico from 1961 to 1967 and was a prominent member of the Puerto Rican independence movement. He visited Cuba for the first time in 1964, beginning a lifelong scientific and political collaboration with Cuban biologists. His active participation in the independence and anti-war movements in Puerto Rico led to his being denied tenure at the University of Puerto Rico, and in 1967 he and Rosario and their three children - Aurora, Ricardo, and Alejandro \\\\- moved to Chicago, where he taught at the University of Chicago and constantly interacted with Lewontin. Both Richard and Rosario later moved to Harvard with the sponsorship of E. O. Wilson, with whom they had later disputes over sociobiology. Levins was elected member of the US National Academy of Sciences but resigned because of the Academy's role in advising the US military during the war. He had been a member of the US and Puerto Rican Communist Parties, the Movimiento Pro Independencia (the Independence movement in Puerto Rico), and the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, and he was on an FBI surveillance list. Until his death, Levins was John Rock Professor of Population Sciences and head of the Human Ecology programHuman Ecology, Course #: GHP253-01, basic course in the HSPH Program in Human Ecology in the Department of Global Health and Population of the Harvard School of Public Health. In the early 1990s, Levins and others formed the Harvard Working Group on New and Resurgent Diseases. Their work showed that alarming new infections had sprung from changes in the environment, either natural or caused by humans (Wilson et al. 1994).Wilson, M.E., Levins, R., Spielman, A. (eds). 1994. Disease in Evolution: Global Changes and Emergence of Infectious Diseases. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Series. Volume 740. New York Academy of Sciences, New York, NY. Accessed 1/22/2016 During his final two decades, Levins had concentrated on application of ecology to agriculture, particularly in the economically less- well-developed nations of this planet. As a member of the OXFAM-America Board of Directors and former chair of their subcommittee on Latin America and the Caribbean, Richard Levins worked from a critique of the industrial-commercial pathway of development and promoted alternative development pathways which focused attention upon (a) economic viability with (b) population equity, (c) ecological and social sustainability, and (d) empowerment of the dispossessed. When his wife Rosario died in 2011, his daughter Aurora moved in with her father in his Cambridge, Massachusetts home.

Evolution in changing environments A Map of the Loop Current Prior to Levins' work, population genetics had assumed the environment to be constant, while mathematical ecology assumed the genetic makeup of the species involved to be constant. Levins modelled the situation in which evolution is taking place while the environment changes. One of the surprising consequences of his model is that selection need not maximize adaptation, and that species can select themselves to extinction. He encapsulated his major early results in Evolution in Changing Environments, a book based on lectures he delivered in Cuba in the early 1960s. Levins made extensive use of mathematics, some of which he invented himself, although it had been previously developed in other areas of pure mathematics or economics without his awareness of it. For instance, Levins makes extensive use of convex set theory for fitness sets, (resembling the economic formulations of J. R. Hicks) and extends Sewall Wright's path analysis to the analysis of causal feedback loops. Metapopulation theory right The term metapopulation was coined by Levins in 1969 to describe a \\"population of populations\\". Populations inhabit a landscape of suitable habitat patches, each capable of hosting a local sub-population. Local populations may become extinct and be subsequently recolonized by immigration from patches; the fate of such a system of local populations (i.e., the metapopulation) depends on the balance between extinctions and colonizations. Levins introduced a model consisting of a single differential equation, nowadays known as the Levins model, to describe the dynamics of average patch occupancy in such systems. Metapopulation theory has since become an important area of spatial ecology, with applications in conservation biology, population management, and pest control.

As a devout churchman, organizer, public speaker and an editor of numerous publications for over 40 years, Bliss became a central figure for the entire Christian socialist movement. Early life William Dwight Porter Bliss was born in Constantinople, Turkey, on August 20, 1856, the son of Edwin Elisha Bliss and Isabella Holmes (Porter) Bliss, who were Christian missionaries there. He was educated at Phillips Academy, Andover, Amherst College, and the Hartford Theological Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut. Religious and social influences Hartford Theological Seminary was where Bliss first learned about religion in relation to social problems. The most notable influencers during his time of theological study being Henry George and articles in the Christian Union. His immediate work after seminary also greatly impacted the trajectory of his future career as a socialist preacher who engaged in activism. Following his graduation from Hartford Theological Seminary in 1882, Bliss was ordained a Congregationalist minister where he was forced to deal with, first hand, the serious labor problems that faced working-class people in America. After witnessing the effects that working unbearably long hours had on family life, the limited amount of food, and the harsh conditions working-class people faced in Boston, Bliss was convinced that the church had a direct duty to improve such terrible conditions. According to Bliss, every person was a part of the kingdom of God regardless of religion and therefore should be treated as such. During this same time, Bliss also become interested in the writings of people such as Charles Kingsley, Frederick Denison Maurice, Edward Bellamy, the English Christian socialist, and most notably George E. McNeil. While all these writers were important to Bliss‚Äôs foundational understanding of Christianity's role in social and economic life, it was George E. McNeil who had the greatest impact. According to Bliss ‚ÄúMcNeil was the one man living from whom in spirit as well as economic wisdom he had learned the most‚Äù. These thinkers along with Bliss‚Äôs experiences helping working-class folk eventually led him to christian socialism, a movement which sought to apply socialism principles to the teachings of Christ in order to address modern social difficulties, caused, by industrialization and urbanization. His radical views on Christianity eventually pushed him to leave Congregationalism to join the Episcopal Church on October 25, 1885. On June 16, 1886, he was ordained a deacon in the Episcopal Church, and became a priest on June 8, 1887. He then served at Grace Church in Boston from 1887 until 1890, and finally, he helped organize an inner-city ministry, the Church of the Carpenter, where he served for four years.  Bliss‚Äôs thoughts on Christian Socialism  Once Bliss adopted the ideas of Christian Socialism he began to create a very clear distinct understanding of what it meant. While Bliss recognized that the label Christian Socialism on its surface seemed to be a paradox, he believed that \\"christianity and socialism were not only compatible, but that socialism was the natural economic expression of christian life.\\" He sought to rid socialism of its philosophical materialism because he believed Christianity was the most effective way to bring socialism to fruition in America. As Bliss mentioned in a speech, his socialist radicalism was grounded not in Marx but in the teachings of Jesus Christ more than anything else. Despite this understanding of Christianity, Bliss originally believed that Christians did not necessarily have to pick a particular political party or organization in order to be genuine socialist. He did argue ,however, that if Christians were to truly live according to the Gospel and the words of Jesus, they would intuitively advocate for a socialist society in America. Moreover, the socialist aspect of Christian Socialism for Bliss was not hampered by the word Christian preceding it. He defined socialism as ‚Äúthat mode of social life which, based upon the recognition of the natural brotherhood and unity of mankind would have land and capital owned by the community collectively, and operated cooperatively for the good of all. He was not interested in merely implementing more state intervention or cooperatives. He, like the scientific socialist, believed that in order to create a just society, where the children of God were all treated with dignity and respect, it would require a complete overhaul of the economic system. Reform was merely a halfway measure for Bliss. Therefore for Bliss, Christian socialism was a fundamentally socialist ideology rooted in Christian principles. He hated the idea that people who tried to apply Christianity to social problems would even try to apply the label Christian Socialism to their work.  Scholarly dispute  Bliss‚Äôs understanding of Christian Socialism and its fit with ‚Äúgenuine political socialism‚Äù is a point of contention, however, for many radical Marxist historians. Although his ideas were distinctively separate from and more radical than the popular social gospel thinkers who merely wanted progressive reform, many scholars still do not want to label Bliss‚Äôs ideology to be socialist because it lacked real radicalism. Despite condemning capitalism as a dangerous plutocracy founded on economic individualism and his demands for an entirely new political economic order, many historians still find Bliss to be too moderate for socialist standards because of his wiliness to work with progressive reform centered institutions. These scholars argue that Bliss and other Christian socialists of the day offered watered-down versions of socialism due to their practical goals, respect for unions and the insentience on gradualism. Bliss‚Äôs willingness to work with the Knights of labor, the populist and other less radical political affiliations push critics to assert that Bliss was not only comfortable with simply achieving small piecemeal reform but that he thought this was the most effective way to achieve a socialist society. There has been some push back on the idea that Bliss was too moderate to be classified within the socialist movement of the Gilded Age. Richard Dressner, in particular, argues that scholars who have labeled Bliss as a moderate have limited the scope of their analysis to the first few decades of his work and have not considered the entire trajectory of his work as a preacher and activist. Most notably, his years with the Christian Socialist Fellowship. According to Dressner, not only was Bliss pushing socialist principles from the pulpit, he was also trying to destigmatize the anti-religious nature of the socialist party itself. During his time with the Fellowship, Bliss along with many of the other Christian socialists moved away from their gradualist perspective and pushed for more immediate political change by writing approvingly not just of workers demanding improved conditions, but of labor strikes that became violent in order to achieve their radical ends. Furthermore, once elected to the executive committee of the Christian Socialist Fellowship, Bliss approved of the fellowship's full endorsement of the socialist party and even advocated Christians to vote the socialist party ticket. Dresser argues that to suggest that Bliss was merely lukewarm to socialism is to not understand the complexity of Bliss. Although early on he frequently worked with moderate progressive reformers, as the times and circumstances changed, Bliss saw his view of Christian socialism directly in line with even the most radical socialist of the day. Political career Bliss had a lengthy and diverse political career while serving as a minister in the Episcopal church. For one his first political projects, Bliss helped found the American branch of the leftist-leaning Christian Social Union to condemn capitalism and push christianity to take on a socialist agenda (1884 to 1887).Armentrout & Slocum 2000, p. 92. Bliss also served as member of the Knights of Labor, beginning in 1886, advocating more moderate reform he believed would be a necessary foundation in order to achieve his socialist vision for America. In 1887 Bliss ran for Lieutenant Governorship of Massachusetts as a candidate of the Labor Party, but lost the election. Shortly after his political campaign for lieutenant Governor, Bliss founded the Society of Christian Socialists (SCS) in 1889. During that same time he also helped to create a Christian socialist newspaper called The Dawn, which he later bought in 1891 in order to bring a more socialist message to the paper. Much like his more general philosophy in regards to Christian Socialism, the goal of these projects were to the show that ‚Äúthe aim of socialism is embraced in the aim of christianity‚Äù and that the‚Äù teachings of Jesus Christ lead directly to some specific form of socialism‚Äù. During these years Bliss also edited and compiled many publications, including the Encyclopedia of Social Reform beginning in 1897. This was the definitive reference work on social movements published during the Progressive Era. Not only did it describe social movements, The Encyclopedia of Social Reform further articulated Bliss‚Äôs belief that the church and organized religion were viable vehicles of social and economic revolution in America. Following his time with the Society of Christian Socialists and The Dawn, Bliss took on a job as an investigator for the Bureau of Labor from 1907 to 1909 to highlight and eventually improve working conditions for laborers. = Bliss and the Christian Socialist Fellowship = Bliss played an integral role within the Christian Socialist Fellowship. As the Fellowship convention, Bliss was elected to the Committee on Constitution, and his entire speech was included in the Christian Socialist Report of the conference. After 1910 he accepted a position within the Committee on Literature to write a series of Sunday school lessons through a socialist lens. That same year he also became one of the contributing editors to the newspaper of the fellowship called the Christian Socialist and eventually was elected as the General Treasurer of the fellowship in 1911. = Final public service years = In 1914, Bliss traveled to Switzerland to work with the YMCA, and served as a pastor and YMCA worker in that country until 1921. During the First World War, Bliss ministered to French and Belgian soldiers interned in Switzerland. Death and legacy After the war, Bliss returned to the United States and preached in New York City until his death in that city on October 8, 1926.

Single track is usually found on lesser-used rail lines, often branch lines, where the level of traffic is not high enough to justify the cost of constructing a second track.  Advantages and disadvantages  Single track is significantly cheaper to build and maintain, but has operational and safety disadvantages. For example, a single-track line that takes 15 minutes to travel through would have capacity for only two trains per hour in each direction. By contrast, a double track with signal boxes four minutes apart can allow up to 15 trains per hour in each direction, provided all the trains travel at the same speed. This hindrance on the capacity of a single track may be partly overcome by making the track one-way on alternate days, if the single track is not used for public passenger transit. Long freight trains are a problem if the passing stretches are not long enough. Other disadvantages include the propagation of delays, since one delayed train on a single track will also delay any train waiting for it to pass. Also, a single track does not have a \\"reserve\\" track that can allow a reduced capacity service to continue if one track is closed. Single-track operations =Passing loops= If a single-track line is designed to be used by more than one train at a time, it must have passing loops (also called passing sidings or crossing loops) at intervals along the line to allow trains running in different directions to pass each other. These consist of short stretches of double track, usually long enough to hold one train. The capacity of a single-track line is determined by the number of passing loops. Passing loops may also be used to allow trains heading in the same direction at different speeds to overtake. In some circumstances on some isolated branch lines with a simple shuttle service (such as the Abbey Line in Great Britain) a single-track line may work under the \\"one train working\\" principle without passing loops, where only one train is allowed on the line at a time. =Safety operations= On single-track lines with passing loops, measures must be taken to ensure that only one train in one direction can use a stretch of single track at a time, as head-on collisions are a particular risk. Some form of signalling system is required. In traditional British practice (and countries using British practice), single-track lines were operated using a token system where the train driver had to be in possession of a token in order to enter a stretch of single track. Because there was only one unique token issued at any one time for each stretch of single track, it was impossible for more than one train to be on it at a time. This method is still used on some minor lines but in the longest single-track lines in Britain (e.g. the Highlands of Scotland) this has been superseded by radio communication, known as Radio Electronic Token Block. In the early days of railways in North America it was common to rely upon simple timetable operation where operators knew where a train was scheduled to be at a particular time, and so would not enter a single-track stretch when they were not scheduled to. This generally worked but was inflexible and inefficient. It was improved with the invention of the telegraph and the ability to issue train orders. Doubling and singling Kirkby railway station single-track railway interchange (former double track railway Converting a single-track railway to double track is called duplication or doubling; converting double track to single track is known as singling. A double-track railway operating only a single track is known as single-line working. Kirkby railway station (until 1977) and Ormskirk railway station (until 1970) were double-track railway, when they were converted into single track railway with cross- platform interchange. New bike paths and railway corridors Building bike trails on rail corridors has occurred in limited examples, however developing rail right of ways for a bike trail can restrict a train corridor to a single track. Also reclaiming a railway corridor to use trains again, that have become bike paths, limits the use of double tracks. The bike path is usually where the second track would be. An example of a bike, single-track corridor is the E&N; Railway in Victoria, Canada.

The Kubrawiya order is named after its 13th-century founder Najmuddin Kubra, who lived in Konye-Urgench under the Khwarazmian dynasty (present day Turkmenistan).The Kubravi order The Mongols captured Konye-Urgench in 1221 and killed much of the population including Sheikh Najmuddin Kubra. The Kubrawiya order places emphasis on being a universal approach, applicable to both Sunnis and Shiites. It is popular in eastern India, Bangladesh and Mauritius.  Branches of Kubrawiya order  Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani was the second founder of the Kubrawiyyah order and expanded in parts of today's India, Pakistan,Kashmir, Bangaladesh, China, and Central Asian countries in the 14th century. In Iran the Kubrawiya order was split into branches after Khwaja Ishaq Khatlani succeed the founder. Eventually, differences within the order had arisen between the two claimants to succeed the leadership in which one group called themselves the Nurbakshia group comprising the supporters of Nurbaksh while the other group supported Barzish Abadi who was based in Mashhad. = The Noorbakshia Order = The Noorbakhshiya has emerged in the 15th century in Iran as a splinter group of the Kubrawiya Sufi order. A similar controversy has later developed about the religious affiliation of Syed Muhammad Noorbakhsh who had been a disciple of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani's principal successor Khwaja Ishaq Khatlani and who is being regarded as the founder of the Kubrawiya. = The Dahabiyya Order = This order has been attributed to Syed Abdullah Barzish Abadi and it spread during first years of Safavid dynasty first in Khorasan, then in Shiraz.Sufism, Sufis, and Sufi Orders: Sufism's Many Paths References External links *http://www.noorbakhshia.com/en/ *The Kubravi order * The Kubrawi order * Information from the website of Dr. Alan Godlas * Maktab Tarighat Oveyssi Shahmaghsoudi (Nurbakhshi Kubrawi) * Iranica Category:Sufi orders ","title":"Kubrawiya"},{"id":"3010932","text":"Vinasat-1 is the first Vietnamese satellite to be placed in orbit.

VINASAT is the national satellite program of Vietnam. The project aims to bring independence in satellite communications for Vietnam, besides other benefits such as enhancing national security, opening new economic opportunities, etc. Vietnam hopes for some economic benefits from the telecommunications links that the satellite will provide. It is expected that the satellite will save several million dollars per year in fees presently paid for leasing of transponders on satellites from other countries.

It is known as a hotspot of the city's underground nightlife and famous for its brothels. The street is also known for its inexpensive lodging. Rue d'Aerschot is close to Brussels' city centre, and is adjacent to the financial and business district, where the Brussels World Trade Center is located. The street is located on the edge of the Turkish Quarter, and next to Brussels-North Station, one of the three main train stations in Brussels. The station's buildings and tracks occupy the whole western side of the street. The rear entrance of the neoclassical Church of Saints John and Nicholas is also located on the street. History Rue d'Aerschot was built around 1839 when the North Station was constructed and the surrounding streets developed. The station was originally called Gare de Cologne, and the street Rue de Cologne. After World War I, due to strong anti- German feelings in Belgium, many streets which were named after German towns or cities were renamed. The street was renamed Rue d'Aerschot after the town in Brabant which had suffered heavily in the conflict. The station was rebuilt in 1953 and renamed Gare du Nord. Following the Brussels World's Fair in 1958, a major plan was devised to rebuild the Northern Quarter ‚Äì the so-called \\"Manhattan Project\\". Work started to the west of the station, including the World Trade Center, in the 1960s. Bankruptcy in the early 1970s prevented the implementation of the scheme to the east of the station, including Rue d'Aerschot. Prostitution red lights and prostitutes visible. Prostitution in the Rue d'Aerschot is known to have existed before World War I. In modern times, it has become the main red-light district in Brussels and has many \\"windows\\" that scantily dressed prostitutes sit in trying to attract trade. Most of the girls are Romanian or Bulgarian. In the 1990s, the area was controlled by Albanian pimps. There was often violence between rival pimps and girls complained to the police that the pimps were abusing and exploiting them. There was a crackdown and the criminal networks were broken down. The area is now controlled by Romanian and Bulgarian pimps. Each window has a madam who controls the prostitutes that work there. The madam takes 50% of the prostitute's earnings. Madams were traditionally older Belgium prostitutes but these have been replaced with mainly Bulgarian women who work for the pimps. This allows the pimps to stay out of the area and away from police attention. Often they remain in their home country. Although widely tolerated by police and local authorities, this neighbourhood has at times been a target of joint government/police efforts to track down human trafficking operatives, mostly aimed at breaking up criminal networks that lure young women from central and eastern European countries with the promise of a better life in Western Europe. Non-profit associations also operate in the area, mainly women's groups providing support and counseling to prostitutes.

Brodie Holland is also known for his media profile, particularly due to some notable on-field and off-field incidents involving him. Early life From Tasmania, where he attended St Virgil's College, Brodie was drafted to Fremantle in the 1997 AFL Draft at no.26 overall. AFL career He made his debut mid-way through 1998 as a small-forward and played most games since making his first appearance. He spent a further 2 seasons at the Dockers before being traded to Collingwood in 2000. Holland quickly adapted as a good player with the Magpies and became a fan favourite in his first season, kicking 28 goals in 21 matches. In 2002 he started off with a 3-goal haul against Richmond and then produced an 8-goal haul a week later against the West Coast Eagles, to be the leading goalkicker for the season after round 2. He then was quiet for the rest of the season. He injured his back, causing a month out of the game, but could not get back in the side until late season. He was dropped after round 22 and missed the Magpies first finals campaign since 1994, which included playing in the 2002 AFL Grand Final. 2003 saw him change to a tagging role in the midfield rather than the inconsistent goal-kicking small forward. He had a clash with Scott Camporeale of Carlton leaving him with a bloodied nose, while late in the year, he was suspended for punching Paul Williams of Sydney in the stomach. He missed the first final but managed to get back in for the Preliminary and Grand Final sides. He continued as a tagging midfielder, despite some problems at the tribunal during years 2004 and 2005, and his good form bought him very close to winning the Copeland Trophy, coming second to James Clement in 2005. While he could not retain his 2005 form, he continued to be a fan favourite in 2006, showing grit and determination to win the ball, highlighted in a match against the Geelong Football Club, in which he bravely laid a huge tackle on Geelong big man Cameron Mooney. In the Elimination Final against the Western Bulldogs, Holland was suspended for 6 weeks for rough conduct against Brett Montgomery. After playing just 1 game in 2008 due to injury, Holland was delisted by Collingwood. He was hopeful of continuing his career at another AFL club but was not picked up, he then retired. Suburban football After being delisted by Collingwood he took up a suburban football in the Essendon District Football League with the Maribyrnong Park Football Club where he had become captain-coach, however he was banned after striking a young opponent from the Doutta Stars. Holland has been deregistered from the Essendon league when it was found that on a technicality, Holland is not eligible to play in the league. The regulations of AFL Victoria, the sport's governing body, say that a player who has served more than 16 weeks' suspension in one competition cannot transfer to another. Holland was outed for more than 16 games during his 11 year career at the top level with Fremantle and Collingwood. Despite not being able to play, he has been allowed to continue to coach if he chooses. Holland appealed this decision and was allowed to continue as playing coach. On 13 Sep 2009 the Maribyrnong Park Lions won the EDFL A Grade Grand Final ‚Äì Maribyrnong Park 102 def Greenvale 84. In 2010, Maribyrnong Park finished 4th at the end of the home and away season. They went on to defeat 3rd placed Oak Park then 2nd placed Keilor to advance to the Grand Final against Greenvale. On 12 Sep 2010, in a back to back as playing coach, Holland led the Maribyrnong Park A Grade Seniors team to victory - Maribyrnong Park 90 def Greenvale 73. In 2015, Holland left heading north to play for the Broadford Football Netball Club in the Riddel District Football League. Holland was a pivotal player in Broadford making the finals for the first time since rejoining the RDFL. Media profile In 2005, Holland participated in the Seven Network's television show Dancing with the Stars with dance partner Alana. Holland made it to the top four before being voted off the show. In 2006, Holland appeared in several advertisements on television for a lottery advertisement along with the NRL's Matthew Johns. He also made a cameo appearance as himself in the soap opera Neighbours. Holland also made several appearances as a panellist on the AFL Footy Show.

Between 1939 and 1966 he recorded almost 600 songs, many of which are classics of Finnish popular music, and appeared in many films and theatrical productions. Of his most acclaimed tangos are Punatukkaiselle tyt√∂lleni (\\"For My Red Haired Girl\\"), Ennen kuolemaa (\\"Before Death\\"; French: Avant de Mourir) and T√§ysikuu (\\"Full Moon\\"), while standouts from his other popular songs are Poika varjoisalta kujalta (\\"Boy From a Shady Alley\\"; Italian: Guaglione), Hopeinen kuu (\\"Silver Moon\\"; Italian: Guarda Che Luna), Eva and Kultainen nuoruus (\\"The Golden Youth\\"). He was also the second tenor of the quartet Kipparikvartetti in the early 1950s. At the beginning of his career he received three gold records for the songs Ennen kuolemaa, Tulisuudelma (El Choclo) and La Cumparsita. Virta also acted in sixteen different Finnish films, including ones of the then-popular Pekka Puup√§√§ series. When he began his career in 1939, he was marketed as the \\"Bing Crosby of Finland.\\" He has also been compared to the American singer-actor Frank Sinatra. Virta was very much popular in the 1950s in Finland, however, around 1959 is when his life began to go into a bit of a sour direction. His wife Irene, whom he had three children with, left him and moved to Sweden in that year, he also began having health issues from an ever augmenting problem with alcoholism, diabetes, and a stroke. His career was officially off the ropes when it was cut short one night in 1962 when he was scandalously arrested for drunken driving in Ilomantsi, after which the press mockingly called him \\"The Singing Meatball.\\" Ten years later he succumbed to alcoholism, living his final years in poverty. His influence in contemporary Finnish music has not been forgotten, and today a number of Finnish Schlager singers cite him as a particular role model or influence when it comes to the realm of music. At least one movie, debuting in October 2018 and simply called, \\"Olavi Virta\\" has been produced about his life, as well as one documentary by Finnish film director and historian, Peter von Bagh. He was one of the ten people to be chosen by the upcoming Finnish Music Hall of Fame museum due to be opened in Helsinki.

He is best known for his work in the power pop groups The Nerves, The Breakaways and The Beat. Biography Paul Collins has released several solo projects with his alternative country group The Paul Collins Band, who play Americana music inspired by country rock and folk rock. Collins also continues to tour with his The Beat, an ever- changing lineup rock group which combines power pop with alternative rock and punk rock. Paul Collins began his career as the drummer (and sometime singer & songwriter) in an influential Los Angeles power pop trio The Nerves, alongside Jack Lee and future Plimsouls frontman Peter Case. The band are best remembered for \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\", a song later made famous by Blondie. Hanging on the Telephone was written by Jack Lee. After Jack Lee left the Nerves, Paul Collins and Peter Case continued practicing and recording with a variety of guitarists as the Breakaways; their best known song is \\"Walking out on Love\\", a song frequently performed by the Nerves in concert but never recorded by them. Tapes of their sessions surfaced in the late 2000s and were released on a compilation album in 2009. Next, Paul Collins formed his own group as singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter for The Beat, sometimes called The Paul Collins Beat to avoid confusion with the British ska group also called The Beat (or The English Beat in the US). The Beat also known as The English Beat, were sued by Sony/Columbia in 1979. The same year, Sony/Columbia released Paul Collins' self-titled debut in 1979. Renamed the Paul Collins' Beat in the early 1980s, the band became icons in the genre of indie rock Paul Collins' Beat were in a constant state of touring and recording around the world. They appeared on Dick Clark's American Bandstand and contributed a song to the Caddyshack soundtrack, alongside Journey and Kenny Loggins. The band broke up in 1989, following the release of their sixth album, One Night. Paul Collins continues to perform to this day with ever- changing versions of Paul Collins' Beat, in addition to his solo project, country-rock band called the Paul Collins Band. Since the early 1980s, Collins has been living on and off in Spain, where he has a particularly strong following, and spends most of his time performing in Europe and Japan, although he still holds citizenship in the United States. In fact, his two former wives are from Spain. During this time, he produced several Spanish pop bands, including La Granja, Los Limones and Los Protones. In 2005, Collins released his first solo album of the decade, Flying High. The music received strong reviews and is reminiscent of the catchy power pop of The Beat, particularly in the opening song, Rock and Roll Shoes. Additionally, Flying High showcases Paul Collins' alt-country, roots-rock and Americana styles, with the singles Will You Be A Woman and Afton Place, which were released worldwide as music videos. In March 2008, Paul Collins released Ribbon of Gold as the follow-up to 2005's critically acclaimed Flying High. This album contains several songs the band performs live in concert, including Falling in Love With Her, I Still Want You, Big Pop Song and She Doesn't Want To Hang Around With You. In 2009, Paul Collins released a fictional autobiography, entitled Mi madre, mi mentor y yo, in addition to writing a humour filled fictional autobiography 8 Million Stories: Pete The Fly.

The split will be released by the Italian label Surfin Ki Records in March 2010, followed by a full-length album released by Alive Naturalsound in Fall 2010.

Green Day and Broadway musical cover a Paul Collins song In 2011, the American punk rock band Green Day launched the American Idiot Broadway Musical Production. Each night included a live rendition of the song \\"Walking Out on Love,\\" which was written by Paul Collins. The song was previously recorded by Collins' groups The Beat, The Nerves and The Breakaways. Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong is a fan of the song, which may appear on a future studio album by Green Day. To celebrate the success of the musical, The Paul Collins Beat joined Green Day onstage for live performances in New York. Paul Collins and Peter Case reunion tribute to the Nerves In 2012, longtime friends and musical partners, Paul Collins and Peter Case announced a reunion tour paying tribute to their bands The Nerves, The Breakaways, The Beat and The Plimsouls. The touring band lineup for the Collins and Case tour was augmented by members of The Paul Collins Beat, Timm Buechler on bass and Amos Pitsch on drums, offering audiences with a full-band electric showcase. The tour included a date in Austin, Texas, where actor Bill Murray made a surprise appearance at the concert to introduce the band. Collins' group The Beat had previously appeared on the Caddyshack original motion picture soundtrack alongside Murray in 1979. Due to personality issues, Paul Collins was dismissed from the tour which continued without him. The Paul Collins Beat tour with The English Beat In Fall 2012, The Paul Collins Beat joined a package tour \\"The Two Beats Hearting As One Tour,\\" co-headlining with Two-tone Ska group The Beat. The English Beat and The Paul Collins Beat were both part of the \\"new wave\\" of bands to emerge from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Ironically, the styles of music they play are very different. Both bands helped to define their respective genres, making them legends. The tour package will include dates at large music halls, casinos, auditoriums and clubs. According to a September 2012 interview with Collins, \\"Contrary to what the internet fabricates, there never was and is no animosity toward The English Beat. I am still a big fan of The English Beat. Ska is really cool music. Dave is a good friend. He's always so nice and always upbeat. He's just as supportive of my music as I am of his. Both of our fanbases are enjoying hearing each other's music.\\" According to an October 2012 press release, Dave Wakeling stated, \\"Paul and I originally met back in '83 and have been in touch occasionally over the years, but recently we've been in closer Facebook contact, which led to this idea becoming a reality....Two beats, hearting as one!‚Äù The Beat Army During 2005, Collins launched a new music program and partner-based booking agency that was recently renamed as The Beat Army. Collins created a forum where fans, bands, clubs, venues, radio stations, music festivals, blogs and record stores can network. Groups have the opportunity to swap shows, while Collins cross- promotes his various musical projects and tours. The interaction between Paul Collins' Beat and other bands has enabled him to book shows on several continents and establish a worldwide network of industry friends, fans, musicians and artists from the genres of rock, punk rock, power pop, new wave, alternative rock, ska, garage rock, hardcore punk, classic rock and roll, skate punk, emo, melodic hardcore, grindcore, crust punk, grunge, skacore, heavy metal, Thrash metal, crossover thrash, metalcore, rapcore, post-hardcore and speed metal, alternative country, Americana, country rock, folk rock, rock and roll and rockabilly. The business model for The Beat Army is a simple process in which Paul Collins' Beat and regional bands join forces to book small tours on their own DIY style. The bands share equipment and transportation, lodgings are supplied by local bands and or fans who welcome the musicians into their homes. After hundreds of successful shows, with countless new and upcoming bands, The Beat Army has proven that you can tour today and avoid all the high costs associated with touring and still show a profit. All the bands participate in the financial reward on Beat Army Tours, making it a model for the new millennium of DIY touring. With Collins' solo albums distinctly different from his rock material and heavily rooted in the genres of American roots music, he continues to maintain a diversified fanbase. The Beat Army has enabled Collins to book shows with bands and artists in genres such as singer-songwriter, alternative country, Americana music, country rock, folk rock, and rockabilly.

This is part of a handful of water-bound regions toward the south-west of the mainland Kochi, and collectively known as Old Kochi or West Kochi. Adjacent to this is Mattancherry. In 1967, these three municipalities, along with a few adjoining areas, were amalgamated to form the Corporation of Cochin. Scientific theory In the BC period, the region that is today known as Kerala was covered by mangrove woods. Turf and sand banks were created with the rise in sea-level which formed the shape of the coastal area as we see it today. The name Cochin implies \\"co-chin\\", meaning \\"like-China\\". It looked like China when the Chinese came to the region during the 14th century and installed Chinese nets. Mattancherry is the nerve town of old historic Cochin. In old Malayalam it is Maadan-cheri, from cheri meaning town. Maad or cow was the stamp of Old Royal Fort of Rajah of Cochin, who built his palace after the fall of Kodungallur or Muziris port due to a gigantic tsunami in 1341 AD. The Perumpadappu Swaroopam or the Fort of Rajah had its palace on the banks of the Calvathy River. Due to frequent wars between King Zamorin of Kozhikode and the western colonial forces, the Rajah left the place for Tripunithura. The king had his vaishnav leanings and the cow or maadu was his symbol.  Connectivity  Fort Kochi can be accessed from Ernakulam through roadways and water ways. Private buses and government transport buses travel from different parts of the city to Fort Kochi. Due to the high volume of tourists visiting the place dedicated low floor Volvo buses were introduced to this route by the government. Such buses are in use on the popular routes such as Cochin International Airport (CIAL), Vytila Mobility Hub and Kakanad Info Park.  History  St. George Orthodox Koonan Kurish Old Syrian Church - The Koonan Kurish Sathyam took place at this Church in AD 1653 is the first attempt to resist colonialism and western invasion in India Fort Kochi was a fishing village in the Kingdom of Kochi in the pre-colonial Kerala. The territory that would be later known as Fort Kochi was granted to the Portuguese in 1503 by the Rajah of Kochi, after the forces of Afonso de Albuquerque helped him fighting the forces of Saamoothiri of Kozhikode. The Rajah also gave them permission to build Fort Emmanuel near the waterfront to protect their commercial interests. The first part of the name Fort Kochi comes from this fort, which the Dutch later destroyed. The Portuguese built their settlement behind the fort, including a wooden church, which was rebuilt in 1516 as a permanent structure, today known as the St Francis Church. Fort Kochi remained in Portuguese possession for 160 years. In 1683 the Dutch captured the territory from the Portuguese, destroyed many Portuguese institutions, particularly Catholic including convents. The Dutch held Fort Kochi in their possession for 112 years until 1795, when the British took control by defeating the Dutch. Foreign control of Fort Kochi ended in 1947 with the Indian independence.St Francis Church where Vasco da Gama was buried Common scene of Kochi Crab structure made with discarded plastic bottles and save the beach from garbage, at Fort Kochi Jain temple in Fort Kochi A mix of old houses built by the Portuguese, Dutch and British in these colonial periods line the streets of Fort Kochi. St Francis Church was built in 1503 by the Portuguese as a Catholic church. Vasco da Gama was once buried in this church which now falls under the Church of South India and is one of the national monuments. Santa Cruz Basilica, also built by the Portuguese in the 16th century, was later destroyed by the British and rebuilt near the end of 19th century. The landmark that causes more public and visitor interest is a series of precolonial Chinese fishing nets on the waterfront, believed to have been introduced by Chinese traders in the early 14th century. =First sources= Since the beginning of the Common Era, Arabian and Chinese traders sourced spices, especially pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, sandal wood, etc. from the Kochi region. Cultivation and trade of these valuable goods shaped the history of the region. Even today, Kochi is an important centre of spice export. The Arabian traders were the first to know about these spices, and they carried the highly wanted merchandise to Europe. Centuries later, they were followed by the Portuguese, then the Dutch, and afterwards the British. =Around 600 AD= Written documents about the Malabar Coast show that this region had Hindus, Christians, and a Jewish minority.The Jews of India: A Story of Three Communities by Orpa Slapak. The Israel Museum, Jerusalem. 2003. p. 27. . =Around 1341= The natural harbour of Kochi was created by a flood that also destroyed the harbour of the town Kodungallur. Thereafter, the town developed into one of the most important harbours on the West Coast of India. It concentrated on the spice trade with China and the Middle East. =Around 1500= During this period, Calicut was ruled by king Zamorin and Kochi was ruled by the Maharaja of Cochin. This was the time when the first Portuguese ships berthed at the Malabar Coast: Vasco da Gama in Calicut and Pedro √Ålvares Cabral in Kochi. The Maharaja of Kochi felt threatened by the Zamorin of Calicut, and he hoped that the Portuguese would help him in his defense from the neighbouring king of Calicut. The Maharaja welcomed the Portuguese, and they founded their first trading center in Kochi. However, the Maharaja of Cochin was largely deprived of his power, and Kochi became the first European colony in India. The Portuguese put pressure upon the small Jewish community, and even the Syrian Christians as they were practising Nestorianism. The Portuguese tried to merge the Syrian Christian Church with the Latin Church. This created conflict as most of the Syrian Christians were associated with various churches of the East and rejected the authority of the Pope and the Latin Church. Most of the Christians of pre-Portuguese period were from upper castes. Nambudhiris and Nairs did not become Latin Christians because they did not want to lose their caste privileges guaranteed in Hinduism. Like the low caste Muslim converts of Malabar who lost their original caste and became Moplahs, lower caste Christian converts also lost their caste and like Moplahs those Christians formed a separate caste with Latin as their liturgy. The Portuguese called the local Christians who converted from upper castes as Syrian Christians. Francis Xavier also converted several thousands, mostly fishermen. But intermarriage between Syriac liturgy Christians and Latin liturgy Christians was common and widespread, because they were all local converts. Thus the Christian population increased in Kochi. =Around 1663= At the invitation of a deposed prince of Cochin Royal Family and the hereditary Prime Minister of Cochin, namely the Paliath Achan, with the active and open support of the local Syrian Christians the Dutch came to Cochin and conquered Kochi in 1663. The town became the capital of Dutch Malabar and belonged to the worldwide trading network of the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch also destroyed many Catholic institutions in Cochin. =Around 1760= There came uneasy times for Kochi because of trouble between the regional powers. Kochi was devastated by Hyder Ali, then later by his son Tipu Sultan. Tipu Sultan subordinated the town temporarily to the kingdom of Mysore. =Around 1790= Kochi came under the influence of the British around this period. In 1814, Kochi became a part of the Madras Presidency becoming a part of the British colonial empire. The British shaped the country until the 20th century, and Kochi has always been an important harbour and trade center. =1947= Kochi was made the capital of the Union State Cochin after India gained independence. =1956= The Union State of Kerala was created with respect to the Malayalam speaking regions with Trivandrum as the capital. In 1956 the first free elections were held and the Communist Party formed the first government of Kerala, the first freely elected communist government in the world.

She later wrote of her experience and claimed to have been captured by Aboriginal people.Larissa Behrendt, Finding Eliza,Barbara Blackman, 'Barbara's Eliza,' in Ian J. McNiven, Lynette Russell, Kay Schaffer (eds.) Constructions of Colonialism, Leicester University Press, 1998 pp.151-156 p.154. Fraser Island is named after her. Home of Eliza Fraser and detail of attached commemorative plaque, in Stromness, Orkney Life She was the wife of Captain James Fraser, master of the Stirling Castle. There were 18 people aboard the ship and a cargo mainly of spirits, which may have been involved in the accident. They struck a reef hundreds of kilometres north of K'gari. They then launched a longboat and a pinnace, the latter of which landed on the northern side of Waddy Point on K'gari. The 11 survivors split up into two groups, Eliza and her husband in the second group, and attempted to trek south, surviving on pandanus and berries until they reached Hook Point. Eliza later claimed she was captured by the Badtjala; her husband either died from starvation or from his injuries. Many other survivors of the same ship wreck later disputed Eliza's claims of capture and ill treatment. Other white people had previously been taken in by the Badtjala people and had been treated extremely well. Eliza Fraser's claim eventually led to the massacre and dispossession of the island's tribe. Eliza was found by John Graham, an escaped Irish convict who had lived for six years with the natives of Wide Bay and had mastered their language. Whether John Graham acted alone in rescuing Eliza is a matter of some conjecture. For many years her rescuer was thought to have been another escaped convict, David Bracewell (though sometimes reported as Bracefell or Bracefield). Bracewell became the rescuer in later accounts, enhanced by the fictional tale that Bracewell had led Eliza overland to the outskirts of present-day Brisbane where, rather than as promised, seeking his pardon in return for his assistance, she threatened to betray him for having taken advantage of her. Official records show, to the contrary, that it was the convict John Graham who walked with her from Fig Tree Point, a corroboree ground near Lake Cootharaba north of present-day Noosa onto the ocean beach near present-day Teewah. Here they met the waiting Lieutenant Otter and his small band of soldiers and convict volunteers. They proceeded north along the beach to the main rescue party waiting at Double Island Point from where Eliza was taken by longboat to the penal settlement at Moreton Bay. Eliza later secretly married another sea captain (Captain Alexander Greene) in Sydney and they both returned to England aboard his ship, the Mediterranean Packet. Controversy followed when she appeared before the Lord Mayor of London to request that a charity appeal be set up for her three children as she was left penniless after her husband had died, not mentioning her marriage to Captain Greene or the ¬£400 received in Sydney by a fund set up to help her. Sensationalised accounts of her experience were published in London. Cultural references Patrick White wrote a fictionalised account of the incident in the 1976 novel A Fringe of Leaves. Others who wrote her story include Andr√© Brink, Kenneth Cook and Michael Ondaatje. Sidney Nolan painted a wide range of personal interpretations of historical and legendary figures, including Eliza Fraser. The Eliza Fraser story was a theme to which painter Sidney Nolan returned over the years. His first Mrs. Fraser painting was in 1947 when he visited K'gari. The crouching, bedraggled form with downcast head obscured by matted hair is one of his best known images. Over the years Nolan emphasised the Bracefell (as he called Bracewell) betrayal story, and his iconic Fraser image has become emblematic of what he saw as his betrayal by Sunday Reed. In 1976 a drama film titled Eliza Fraser (The Adventures of Eliza Fraser was an alternate title) was made about her. Susannah York played the title role, and the film was directed by Tim Burstall. It was the first Australian film with a seven-figure budget, costing $1.2 million to make.

Its unusual feature is akin to that of Crazy Quilt: the cards in the reserve are built either on the foundations or on a waste pile. Rules There are 8 foundation piles. Four of these start with Aces and build up in suit, while the other four start with Kings and build down in suit. There are also 8 reserve piles containing four cards each. The top cards of the reserve piles are available only to be built on the foundation or onto the waste pile if they match the suit and are one rank higher or lower than the top card; there is no building on the reserve. The deck deals out 1 card at a time, and if that card cannot be used, it will go to the waste pile, where it is available to be built onto the foundations. When the stock is exhausted, the waste pile (which by then already includes cards from the reserve) is picked up and turned over to become the new stock. This can be done twice in the entire game. The game finishes soon after the stock is exhausted the third time. The game is won when all cards are built into the foundations.

The Latin \\"argentum\\" has its origin from the ancient Greek-Hellenic word \\"argyro(s)\\", Œ¨œÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒø(œÇ) meaning silver. The first use of the name \\"Argentina\\" can be traced back to the first voyages made by the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors to the R√≠o de la Plata (meaning \\"River of Silver\\"), in the first years of the 16th century. Colonization Aleixo Garcia, one of the survivors of the shipwrecked expedition mounted by Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s in 1516, heard notices about a powerful White King in a country very rich in silver, at the mountains called \\"Sierra de la Plata\\". Garcia then organized an expedition and reached Potos√≠'s area, gaining several silver objects and gifts. He was killed by the Payagu√°s, returning to Santa Catarina (Brazil), but the Guaran√≠ people who were part of the expedition took the silver objects back and spread the Sierra de Plata legend, and explained that it was possible to reach that fabulous land through the wide river to the south. While the exact origin of the name \\"Rio de la Plata\\" is unknown, Sebastian Cabot's exploration between 1526 and 1529 is widely credited to have inspired such name due to his obtaining and collecting a variety of silver objects from the Guaran√≠ tribes along the Paraguay river.Rio de la Plata - Britannica Online Encyclopedia The river received other names, such as \\"Mar Dulce\\", \\"R√≠o de Sol√≠s\\", \\"R√≠o de Santa Mar√≠a\\", and \\"R√≠o Jord√°n\\", but \\"R√≠o de La Plata\\" was the one that prevailed.Instituto Geografico Nacional The Portuguese cartographer Lopo Homem made reference to the place as \\"Terra Argentea\\" in a 1554 map. The first mention of the name \\"Argentina\\" was in Mart√≠n del Barco Centenera's poem Argentina y conquista del R√≠o de la Plata, con otros acaecimientos de los reinos del Per√∫, Tucum√°n y estado del Brasil, published in Spain in 1602. Ten years later, in 1612, Ruy D√≠az de Guzm√°n published the book Historia del descubrimiento, poblaci√≥n, y conquista del R√≠o de la Plata (History of the discovery, population, and conquest of the R√≠o de la Plata), naming the territory discovered by Sol√≠s \\"Tierra Argentina\\" (\\"Land of Silver\\", \\"Silvery Land\\"). In 1776 the \\"Virreinato del R√≠o de la Plata\\" (Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata) was created, named after the river; it included present-day Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Independence of Argentina The Spanish viceroy was ousted during the May Revolution, starting the Argentine War of Independence. The new government removed the \\"Viceroyalty\\" word from the name, renaming the territory the \\"Provincias Unidas del R√≠o de la Plata\\" (United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata). This denomination was ratified years later by the Assembly of Year XIII. The Congress of Tucum√°n, seeking a higher Latin American integration, used instead the name \\"Provincias Unidas de Sud Am√©rica\\" (United Provinces of South America). The name \\"Argentina\\" was mainly used among the high society, and in limited cases. The use became popular with the sanction of the second Argentine National Anthem, written by Vicente L√≥pez y Planes. However, it was not widely used because it was not associated to the whole territory, but just to the Buenos Aires province. The Constitution of 1826 was sanctioned as the Constituci√≥n de la Rep√∫blica Argentina. The other provinces rejected its high centralism, and the president Bernardino Rivadavia was deposed shortly after. During the second government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, Confederaci√≥n Argentina (Argentine Confederation) was the main name used for the young country, but others were also used, including Rep√∫blica de la Confederaci√≥n Argentina (Republic of the Argentine Confederation) and Federaci√≥n Argentina (Argentine Federation). Justo Jos√© de Urquiza deposed Rosas in the battle of Caseros and called for a Constituent Assembly that would write the Constitution of Argentina of 1853. Buenos Aires did not accept it, and seceded from the Confederation as the State of Buenos Aires. For a decade, Buenos Aires and the Confederation existed as distinct administrative divisions. Buenos Aires rejoined the Confederation in 1860, after an amendment to the 1853 Constitution. The name was changed to Naci√≥n Argentina, though including a paragraph with the historical names as \\"equivalent and valid\\" denominations. Then on October 8, 1860, President Santiago Derqui decreed the official name to be Rep√∫blica Argentina. In common speech, the country is referred to as \\"la Argentina\\" (the Argentine) in Spanish, bypassing the noun in any of the above expressions (\\"the Argentine [land]\\", \\"the Argentine [Republic]\\", etc.).

The other was built in the southeast of High Island, connecting it with the Sai Kung Peninsula near Po Pin Chau, a stack island. Three smaller dams were also constructed in valleys around the reservoir. Aqueducts totalling 5 miles in length were also constructed to transfer water from streams around Sai Kung Peninsula to the reservoir. Construction spanned 10 years from 1969 to 1979. Two roads were created as part of the scheme, crossing over the dams. This enabled visitors to access a very remote and unspoilt area for recreation. Many of the techniques and technology used, like grouting, was cutting edge at the time. The site of the former High Island Detention Centre is now abundant of grass.

Nomikai are a part of the culture of most places of employment, from schools to nightclubs. They are most often held in restaurants or izakaya, usually with everyone seated at one large table or occupying a separated section of the venue. Employees are usually expected to participate to some extent in various nomikai, as it is considered a social aspect of work, although it is not expressly required. Such parties focus on the bond between coworkers as a group, and are not considered private or somehow non-work related (see Japanese values). Attendance does not necessarily imply that a person will drink any alcohol, however, and attendees generally pay a set amount for the food, drink, and venue regardless of consumption. Any leftover money may be put toward organizing the next nomikai. The student version of the nomikai is called a konpa and contains some distinguishing characteristics. Procedure Nomikai are held to mark a wide range of events, including completion of major projects, attainment of set goals, foundation anniversaries, school sporting events, entry of new coworkers, and retirement of senior employees. There is always at least one responsible for the preparation of the venue. This is usually not the same person or persons for whom the nomikai takes place. With the exception of the end of year , most nomikai consist of workers in one section or department of the workplace. In the case of the b≈çnenkai, everyone in the entire company may be present. In large companies, however, separate b≈çnenkais are often the norm for each department. Additionally, there may be both kinds of b≈çnenkai on separate dates. For example, there may be a math department b≈çnenkai on one day, with a school-wide b≈çnenkai for all teachers the following week. At onset of the nomikai, the organizers give a brief welcome speech, followed by the manager, president, or principal, who offers words of reflection and encouragement. The monologue is punctuated by a toast after which everyone begins eating and drinking. If there are new employees or guests at the nomikai, it is customary for them also to give a self-introduction and salutation to the other members. Nomikai are nearly always concluded after a few hours by everyone standing, clapping in unison. There are two main styles of clapping: ippon-jime and sanbon-jime. These translate roughly to \\"one-clap ending\\" and \\"three-clap ending\\", respectively. A three-clap ending is actually three series of three claps, followed by a single clap. Often this is repeated three times, leaving the total number of claps at thirty. Sometimes the shime (ending) may happen in conjunction with a verbose salute to the organizer or honored participant, or the singing of the company or school song. The is the afterparty. After the main nomikai is concluded, the attendees often break into smaller groups and move to different bars. As attendance is not at all mandatory for nijikai, they usually are groups of friends or people interested in doing a lot of drinking, including bar-hopping. Drinking that comes after a nijikai is referred to as . Nomikai etiquette During nomikai there are rules of etiquette which are generally followed. Generally, one tries to avoid filling one's own glass, but instead offers to fill others' for them. This is especially true of senpai-k≈çhai relationships, where the participant of lower rank or age will first offer to serve his superior. This relationship is often reciprocal, and the superior will offer to fill the junior's glass in return. This is not perceived so much as currying favor as it is seen as acting in a manner conducive to workplace harmony (see Wa). Another point of etiquette which differs from Western business culture is that it is considered acceptable to become drunk at nomikai. In the same vein, things said and done under such circumstances are not taken seriously, but are forgiven or ignored upon return to the workplace. Consequently, there are sometimes frank and emotional displays between coworkers, regardless of rank, which may not occur in a normal workplace context. This phenomenon is called in Japanese. On the other hand, it is generally regarded as unacceptable to pressure people into drinking alcohol or consuming more of it than they want. Participants may drink non-alcoholic beverages or leave a glass full to signal that they are not willing to drink any (more) alcohol.

Biography Alongside Paul Collins (later of The Beat) and Peter Case (later of The Plimsouls), Lee formed the seminal, yet short- lived Los Angeles power pop trio The Nerves. Lee played guitar for the group - favouring a thin, unembellished, almost rhythmic playing style - along with composing and singing most of the group's songs. The band, originally based in San Francisco, made the move to Los Angeles in 1976, and began putting on a series of self-promoted and self-financed concerts, providing a focal gathering point for many members of L.A.'s nascent punk scene, as well as giving many of L.A.'s early punk bands their initial shows (The Weirdos, The Screamers and The Dils, among others). This 'Do It Yourself' aesthetic (although not usually associated with music extant pre-punk) was also reflected in The Nerves' self-financed and self-released 1976 EP - the four songs from which (two of them Lee compositions) all receiving attention, if not mainstream recognition, amongst punk and power-pop circles. Though in hindsight influential, this self-contained recording and gigging strategy most likely placed undue stress upon the relationship between the three band members. The Nerves' existence, always tenuous, finally disintegrated in the aftermath of another self-financed venture - this time a cross-country tour in the summer of 1977, with the band covering almost twenty-five thousand miles in a single 1969 Ford LTD Wagon and playing with such notables as The Ramones, The Diodes and Mink DeVille. Though the press surrounding the band was nearly always positive and newer material sounded strong, it was not enough to hold the band together. The Nerves finally tore apart in 1978, less than a year before Blondie would turn one of Jack Lee and The Nerves' songs into a new wave classic and bonafide chart hit. \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\", Lee's most famous and enduring composition, originally the lead track on The Nerves' lone 1976 EP, found its way to the ears of the members of Blondie during the recording sessions for what would become the group's widely successful third album, Parallel Lines. The original song was written in 1973 while Lee was living in San Francisco and references the contentious relationship with his future mother-in-law. The song was originally recorded in 1975 at the Different Fur studio in San Francisco with local musicians and later the song exploded as the lead-off track on Parallel Lines, going on to become a UK Top Five hit. Lee's signature song remains a popular cover choice of bands today (most recently revived by indie singer/songwriter Cat Power), even if most groups are unfamiliar with any version predating Blondie and also contributed a further number to Parallel Lines, entitled \\"Will Anything Happen?\\", as well as the song \\"You Are My Lover\\" for Suzi Quatro, which appeared on her album Suzi...and Other Four Letter Words (like most of Suzi Quatro's records, the album was produced by Mike Chapman, who also produced Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\" in the same year). Ann P Munday Senior Vice President and General Manager of Rare Blue Music signed Jack Lee to a publishing contract and later sent three songs to British singer Paul Young in 1983, all of which Paul Young recorded and released on the album No Parlez, which sold more than three million copies worldwide. Following Parallel Lines' success, Lee slowly put together and released a solo album entitled Jack Lee's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 in 1981, which featured re-worked recordings of Nerves songs, as well as new material. However, with the exception of this LP, and a self-titled album released in 1985, little since has been heard from Lee, who seemed content to largely withdraw from the commercial music world. Nevertheless, the strength of Jack Lee's songwriting and interest surrounding his first group remained fervent, so much so that in 2001, Spain's Penniman Records re-released The Nerves' EP as a deluxe 25th Anniversary ten-inch record with extra demo and live material culled from their whirlwind 1977 tour. In 2008 Alive Records released Nerves compilation One Way Ticket, which includes the Jack Lee solo track \\"It's Hot Outside.\\" Jack Lee's group, Jack Lee Inferno, made an appearance on April 1, 2007 at The Radio Heartbeat Powerpop Festival in Brooklyn, New York.

Opening in 1899, it was the third pier to be constructed in Brighton after the Royal Suspension Chain Pier and the West Pier, but is now the only one still in operation. It is managed and operated by the Eclectic Bar Group. The Palace Pier was intended as a replacement for the Chain Pier, which collapsed in 1896 during construction. It quickly became popular, and had become a frequently-visited theatre and entertainment venue by 1911. Aside from closures owing to war, it continued to hold regular entertainment up to the 1970s. The theatre was damaged in 1973 and following a buy-out was demolished in 1986, changing the pier's character from seaside entertainment to an amusement park, with various fairground rides and roller coasters. The pier remains popular with the public, with over four million visitors in 2016, and has been featured in many works of British culture, including the gangster thriller Brighton Rock, the comedy Carry On at Your Convenience and the Who's concept album and film Quadrophenia. Location The pier entrance is opposite the southern end of the Old Steine (the A23 to London) where it meets the Marine Parade and Grand Junction Road which run along the seafront. It is long and contains of planking. Because of the pier's length, repainting it takes three months every year. At night, it is illuminated by 67,000 bulbs. No. 14 and No. 27 buses run directly from Brighton railway station to the pier. History =1891‚Äì1970= Inaugural Ceremony of Brighton Marine Palace and Pier, 1891 The pier was designed and constructed by R. St George Moore. It was the third in Brighton, following the Royal Suspension Chain Pier in 1823 and the West Pier in 1866. The inaugural ceremony for laying of the first pile was held on 7 November 1891, overseen by Mayor Samuel Henry Soper. A condition to be met by its builders, in exchange for permission to build, was that the Chain Pier was to be demolished as it had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1896, a storm destroyed the remains of the Chain Pier, which narrowly avoided colliding with the new pier during its collapse. Some of its remaining parts, including the toll houses, were re- used for the new pier. A tram along the pier was in operation during construction, but it was dismantled two years after opening. Work was mostly completed in 1899 and the pier was officially opened on 20 May by the Mayoress of Brighton. It was named the Brighton Marine Palace and Pier, whose name was inscribed into the pier's metalwork. It cost a record ¬£27,000 (¬£ in ) to build, including 3,000 lights to illuminate the pier. Part of the cost was repairs to the West Pier and the nearby Volk's Electric Railway caused by damage in the 1896 storm from the Chain Pier's debris. The pier was not fully complete on the opening date; some work on the pavilion was completed shortly afterwards. It was designed to resemble kursaals, which were entertainment buildings found near spas on the Continent, and included reading and dining rooms. The pier was an immediate success and quickly became one of the most popular landmarks in Brighton. By 1911, the reading rooms had been converted into a theatre. Both Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin performed at the pier to hone their comic skills early in their career, before migrating to the US and finding major commercial success in Hollywood. During World War I, the sea surrounding the pier was extensively mined to prevent enemy attacks. In the 1920s, the pier was widened, and a distinctive clock tower was added. During World War II, the pier was closed as a security precaution. A section of decking was removed in order to prevent access from an enemy landing. The pier regained its popularity after the war, and continued to run regular summer shows, including Tommy Trinder, Doris and Elsie Waters and Dick Emery. =1970‚Äì2000= Brighton Pier arcade The pier was listed at Grade II* on 20 August 1971. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. During a storm in 1973, a barge moored at the pier's landing stage broke loose and began to damage the pier head, particularly the theatre. Despite fears that the pier would be destroyed, the storm eased and the barge was removed. The landing pier was demolished in 1975, and the damaged theatre was never used again, despite protests from the Theatres Trust. The pier was sold to the Noble Organisation in 1984. The theatre was removed two years later, on the understanding that it would be replaced; however a domed amusement arcade was put in place instead. Consequently, the seaward end of the pier was filled with fairground rides, including thrill rides, children's rides and roller coasters. Entertainment continued to be popular at the pier; the Spice Girls made an early live performance there in 1996 and returned the following year after achieving commercial success. On 13 August 1994, a bomb planted by the IRA near the pier was defused by a controlled explosion. A similar bomb by the same perpetrators had exploded in Bognor Regis on the same day. The bombing was intended to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of The Troubles. The pier was closed for several days owing to police investigation. =2000‚Äìpresent= The Turbo roller coaster at the end of Brighton Palace Pier The pier was renamed as \\"Brighton Pier\\" in 2000, although this legal change was not recognised by the National Piers Society nor some residents of Brighton and Hove. The local newspaper, The Argus, continued to refer to the structure as the Palace Pier. The Palace Pier caught fire on 4 February 2003 but damage was limited and most of the pier was able to reopen the next day. Police suspected arson. In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), admitted an offence of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act and had to pay fines and costs of ¬£37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were to blame for the fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high. In 2011, the Noble Organisation put the pier for sale, with an expected price of ¬£30 million. It was rumoured that the council wanted to buy the pier, but this was quickly ruled out. It was taken off the market the following year, due to lack of interest in suitable buyers. In 2016, it was sold to the Eclectic Bar Group, headed by former PizzaExpress owner Luke Johnson, who renamed the pier back to Brighton Palace Pier in July. The Palace Pier remains a popular tourist attraction into the 21st century, particularly with day visitors to the city. In contrast to the redevelopment and liberal culture in Brighton generally, it has retained a traditional down-market \\"bucket and spade\\" seaside atmosphere. In 2016, the Brighton Fringe festival director Julian Caddy criticised the pier as \\"a massive public relations problem\\". Cultural references The pier has featured regularly in British popular culture. It is shown prominently in the 1971 film, Carry on at Your Convenience, and it is shown to represent Brighton in several film and television features, including MirrorMask, The Persuaders, the Doctor Who serial The Leisure Hive (1980), the 1986 film Mona Lisa, and the 2007 film, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The Graham Greene novel Brighton Rock featured the Palace Pier. John Boulting's 1947 film adaptation helped established \\"low life\\" subculture in Brighton, and the climax of the film is set on it, where gangleader Pinkie Brown (played by Richard Attenborough) falls to his death. The 1953 B movie Girl on a Pier is set around the Palace Pier and also features the clash between holidaymakers and gangsters in Brighton. The Who's 1973 concept album Quadrophenia was inspired in part by band leader Pete Townshend spending a night underneath the pier in March 1964. It is a pivotal part of the album's plot, and features in the 1979 film. Townshend later said that the rest of the band understood this element of the story, as it related to their mod roots. The 2014 novel The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell includes passages that take place on the pier. The 2015 British TV series, Cuffs, which takes place in Brighton features the pier, both in the opening theme as well as in parts of the story lines. In 2015, Martyn Ware, founding member of pop group The Human League, made a series of field recordings on the pier as part of a project with the National Trust and British Library project to capture the sounds of Britain. Accolades The pier was awarded the National Piers Society's Pier of the Year award in 1998. In 2017, it was listed as the fourth most popular free attraction in Britain in a National Express survey. In 2017, the pier was said to be the most visited tourist attraction outside London, with over 4.5 million visitors the previous year.

Produced until Wayne Corporation declared bankruptcy and was liquidated in late 1992, the Lifeguard was also produced by successor Wayne Wheeled Vehicles until their closure in 1995. The Lifeguard introduced new methods of design and construction for school buses to improve their collision. Overview =Structural Integrity Issues in School Buses= In the late 1960s, a weak point and location of structural failure in catastrophic school bus crashes was considered to be body joints, the points where panels and pieces were fastened together. Longitudinal steel guard rails had been in use since the 1930s to protect the sides of buses, but behind them on the sides and on the roofs, manufacturers used many individual panels to construct a bus body. Around 1967, safety engineers at Ward Body Works of Conway, Arkansas subjected one of their school bus bodies to a multiple roll test, and noted the separation at the joints. http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/w/wayne/wayne2.htmWard engineers noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets. This resulted in new attention by all body manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners. To Wayne engineers, simply increasing the number of fasteners (rivets, screws, and huckbolts) was not satisfactory. In their own tests, the joints were always the weak point under high stress loads regardless of the number of fasteners. They also noted how the continuous guard rails used on the sides tended to spread the stress away from the point of impact, allowing it to be shared and dissipated at portions of the body structure further away. Instead of trying to figure out how to make the fasteners do a better job, the engineers stood back and wondered how the design features of the guard rails could be expanded. The result was a revolutionary new design in school bus construction: continuous longitudinal interior and exterior panels for the sides and roofs. =Lifeguard: A Paradigm Shift= Branded the Lifeguard, Wayne's new conventional-style school bus design used the company's roll- forming presses to make single steel stampings that extended the entire length of the bus body. The concept was that by reducing the number of joints, the number of places where the body could be anticipated to separate in a catastrophic impact was reduced in a like amount. The \\"Lifeguard\\" design reduced overall body weight, the number of fasteners used, and man-hours required for assembly. However, the roll-form presses were very large, requiring special equipment to handle the finished panels. A more practical problem was the panels had to be cut to exact length for each bus body order, which varied with seating capacities and from state-to-state specifications. This created a marketing disadvantage as the Wayne factory required greater manufacturing lead time than in the past whereas the previous technology allowed for more interchangeability and customization in orders. Shortly after the Lifeguard was introduced, Wayne held a nationwide contest soliciting ideas to improve school bus safety, with a new Lifeguard school bus as the grand prize. The winning entry was submitted by a school bus driver in Goochland County, Virginia, whose district received the new school bus. Her idea was to incorporate sound baffles in the ceiling of school bus bodies to help reduce driver distraction. Compact forms of such equipment were later developed used by Wayne and other school bus manufacturers when diesel engines (and their greater noise) became more widely available in conventional-style school buses (like the Lifeguard) in the 1980s. Real-world Crash Testing The benefits of the Lifeguard design were proved in several potentially catastrophic collisions. For example, in 1982, at Petersburg, Virginia, a 1973 Wayne Lifeguard school bus transporting 41 elementary school children was struck broad-side at an intersection by a fire truck that had gone through a red traffic signal without stopping while responding to an alarm. The school bus was rocked violently, but after the fire truck literally bounced off of it (rather than penetrating the body); the bus driver was able to regain control and stop safely. The fire truck was spun 180¬∞ and its front was demolished; all 3 firefighters were hospitalized. The bus driver and all children were transported to the hospital as well. One child on the bus suffered a broken arm; the rest were mostly scared but uninjured. Further investigation of the collision revealed that the impact of the fire truck had failed to overcome the strength of the longitudinal panels and the guard rails. Investigators discovered that despite a bulge of several inches on the longitudinal interior panel, there had been no all-the way through penetration of the passenger compartment whatsoever, no joint separation, and no sharp edges created. Instead, they found the substantial impact stress had been shared over a widespread area along the entire structure of the passenger compartment \\"box\\", protecting the occupants as intended by the design. Influence of Lifeguard design In the years following the Lifeguard's introduction, competing body manufacturers began using fewer, larger body panels to reduce body joints. However, none had become as progressive as Wayne's use of the full-length panels when the focus on structural integrity resulted in the upgraded requirements of the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for school buses (#220 and #221), which became applicable on April 1, 1977. After that date, most manufacturers (including Wayne) added special structural adhesives to other fasteners at body joints Chassis Suppliers { class=\\"wikitable collapsible\\" border=\\"1\\" - !colspan=5 style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" Wayne Lifeguard Chassis Suppliers - !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" Manufacturer !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" Chrysler Corporation !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" Ford Motor Company !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" General Motors !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" International Harvester Navistar International - !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" Model Name style=\\"text-align:center\\"Dodge S-Series style=\\"text-align:center\\"Ford B600/B700/B800 style=\\"text-align:center\\"Chevrolet/GMC B-series  *Loadstar *S-Series \\"Schoolmaster\\" *3800 - !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" Years Available style=\\"text-align:center\\"1973‚Äì1977 style=\\"text-align:center\\"1973‚Äì1995 style=\\"text-align:center\\"1973‚Äì1992  *1973-1978 (Loadstar) *1979-1989 (S-Series) *1989-1995 (3800) - !style=\\"background:#FFD800\\" Notes Dodge ended production of school bus chassis after 1977  After 1992, GM B-Series supplied only to Blue Bird  } Manufacturing Retired 1990s Lifeguard in use in the Netherlands The Lifeguard was produced in Wayne's Richmond, Indiana production facility.

Charlie opportunistically happens upon a man in a rowboat who is preparing for a swim. Charlie steals the man's swimsuit and heads to shore. He hears cries for help as a woman (Edna Purviance), her mother, and the woman's suitor (Eric Campbell) have all fallen into the water and are poor swimmers. Charlie rescues them all, but carelessly allows the enormous suitor to fall back into the water while he is attempting to carry him on a stretcher. Charlie rescues him once again, but the angry suitor kicks Charlie senseless into the water. Charlie wakes up in a bedroom in the lavish home of the grateful girl and her mother. He is wearing striped pajamas and for a moment he believes he is back in prison. He identifies himself as a yachtsman and is given a set of evening clothes to wear to a party. Charlie's luck begins to run out, however. The girl's father turns out to be the judge who sentenced Charlie to a prison term. Charlie looks vaguely familiar to the judge, but he cannot quite place him. The suitor, now especially miffed at Charlie because of the attention the girl is giving him, sees Charlie's photo in a newspaper as a prison escapee. Meanwhile, a house employee is feeding her beau a meal in the kitchen; the beau happens to be one of the guards who was chasing Charlie on the beach. The suitor summons the authorities who pursue Charlie on a merry chase up and down the two-story house where Charlie's acrobatic skills save him from arrest several times. Just as it looks like Charlie will finally be apprehended, he cleverly escapes again and the chase is renewed. The film also stars Henry Bergman and Albert Austin, and marked the final film of his co-star Eric Campbell who died on December 20, 1917 in a drunk driving accident. Campbell, who was 37 at the time of his death, had appeared in 11 comedies with Chaplin in 1916 and 1917. Toraichi Kono, who was Chaplin's personal chauffeur for many years, plays a small part in the film. He was aptly cast as the chauffeur of the girl and her mother.

These ethnic groups inhabit an area across Uganda and Kenya. Itung'a (a vernacular term meaning \\"people of one language\\") and Teso have been used among ethnographers, while the term Teso-Turkana is sometimes used for the languages, which are of Eastern Nilotic stock. Ateker means 'clan' or 'tribe' in the Teso language. In the Lango language, the word for clan is atekere. In the Turkana language, Ateker means a distinct group with related customs, laws and lifestyle and who share a common ancestry. Members of one Ateker have a common character of mutual respect for each other in their diversity. Each member group of Ateker occupies its own territory and exercises authority over its own land and people independent of each other. The word Ateker is a generic term for \\"related peoples\\" or \\"relatives\\" (the term also refers to clan). It is derived from the root ker, which has two root meanings: fear and respect. Ateker, in its true sense, is a union of free people with mutual recognition and respect for each other. In the context of ethnic identity and nationhood, the Turkana language classifies different people with common characteristics as belonging to distinct ateker. The Maa people belong to Ateker a Ngi Maasa Maasai and so on. The Turkana and the Karamojong and related people belong to one Ateker. History =Origins= The ancestral cradeland of the Ateker communities is thought to lie in Longiro, 'the place of engiro' in the Sudan. =Early 18th century= According to Turkana traditions recorded by Emley (1927); the Turkana were originally members of a tribe called 'Dung'iru' (i.e Longiro), which was said to live between Turkana and the Nile river. The traditions state that the Turkana came east, as a sub- section of the Ngie (i.e Jie) tribe, where there stayed for some time. This country was \\"occupied by that tribe to this day\\". Tradition indicates that the Karamojong ancestral territory was in eastern Acholi, a sub-region located in the north of Uganda. From here, movements in a southern direction then east and finally northwards brought them to present Matheniko, located south of what was then Maliri territory. These movements appear to have displaced some Oropom whose territory then stretched into these areas, however traditions suggest that the Oropom were at this time numerically superior and peaceful relations generally prevailed. While at Matheniko, the people now known as Dodoth separated from the rest of the Karamojong. They moved north to the vicinity of Loyoro which was on the fringe of Maliri held territory and here established themselves. Tradition relates that the encounter was peaceful and this appears to be borne out by relations between these communities in later times when they had by then moved away from each other. Turkana It would appear that Lwoo expansion into Acholi had caused disruption in the period following the Karamojong movement. This led to the breakaway of a group initially known as the Jie, who came from the vicinity of Gulu (western Acholi), among whom were a group who came from the vicinity of Got Turkan (i.e Hill of Turkan). According to traditions recorded by Wilson (1970), the Jie advanced eastward and entered the present Karimoja territory at Adilang, an area that was at this time occupied by the Maliri. The nature of contact seems to have been hostile for the Maliri retreated eastwards toward the region of Koten Mountain where they stayed for a while. This state of affairs did not hold for long, for the people from the hill of Turkan, now calling themselves Turkana, broke away from the Jie at Kotido and started advancing eastward. This brought extreme pressure to bear on the Maliri at Koten, causing this group to break in two. One group of Maliri, still known as such to the Karamojong but as Merille elsewhere, moved further eastward settling on the east of the Turkana escarpment. The other group, calling themselves Pokotozek moved south and arrived at Nakiloro, which lies on the Turkana escarpment just north of the Moroto mountain. =Fragmentation= According to Turkana traditions noted by Lamphear (1988) concerning the early Turkana community, the developing community \\"formed itself into two 'major parts', the Curo and the Monia\\". He also recorded traditions regarding an assimilation. Lamphear records population groupings that emerged from this assimilation and of population dispersal. He notes that the two major groups took on a common name 'Turkana' while some settlers abandoned the Tarash to move south to the area beyond Mount Elgon. He also notes that about the same time some far-ranging contingents of Bantu-speaking Meru were absorbed by several Turkana clans. =Interactions= Turkana landscape In pushing eastward the Turkana had arrived at a dramatic ecological and cultural frontier. All the way to the shores of Lake Turkana lay arid land peppered with the occasional cultivatable oasis. Hard country inhabited by communities that were radically different from any the Turkana had encountered before. There were three communities living in close association and herding a variety of livestock that included exotic creatures with long necks and humps on their backs - the first camels the Ateker had encountered. Of the three societies, one appears to have made the most impact on the Turkana, they kept sheep, goats and camels like their associates but specialized in cattle. They had lighter-colored skin compared to the Turkana and they liberally smeared themselves with ochre - the Turkana called them the 'red people' and named them Kor. The Kor's kin were known to the Turkana as Rantalle and Poran. Together these allies controlled all the land stretching out before the Turkana to the east. There were three Turkana 'adakari' (i.e ateker) during the early 20th century. Turkana tradition states that the expansion to Turkwel had been carried out by two of these ateker, the 'Nithir' and the 'Ngamatak'. At Turkwel, the Nithir split in two, one section retaining the original name while the other was known as 'Nibelai'. As of 1888, Ngamtak was the name of the south-western frontier of Turkana territory. The Nithir name was said to derive from 'ithiger' (i.e Siger), an 'ornament' and the Nithir were said to be so called for their love of decoration. =Later 18th century= Turkana folklore records that as their early settlements expanded north, they reached a hill which came to be known as Moru Ang'issiger where they met another group of 'red people' who herded a distinctive type of long-horned black cattle. It was said that this community once held most of the surrounding country until the Kor and their allies came up from the south and took it from them. Most of the women of this community had an adornment of a single cowrie shell attached to a forelock. This dangling cowrie shell was referred to as esigirait, pl. ngisigira (Karamoja). The Turkana called them Siger and their home Moru Ang'issiger, (later Mt. Siger/Mt. Sekker). As the end of the 18th century approached, demographic pressure started being felt by the Turkana. All the available grazing lands to west - the direction the Turkana had come from, was occupied by other Ateker societies of the Karamojong and to the east lay the lands of the formidable confederacy of the Kor, Rantalle and Poran. The Turkana thus turned their gaze north to the territory of the weakened Siger and coveting their highland pastures, began to encroach on the Siger just as much of the Rift Valley region was seized by a terrible drought. Common characteristics = Language = Member of one Ateker speak one language or distinct languages which developed from one common language. = Laws and customs = Each Ateker has distinct laws and customs. The laws and customs of people of one Ateker are similar. = Lifestyle = Members of each Ateker live their lives in a similar lifestyle. Diversified groups within one Ateker usually have traces of laws and customs that can be traced to the original group. = Land = Land is one characteristic that helps in determining membership in an Ateker. Members of one Ateker usually occupy adjoining areas. Land adjudication forms the basis for laws and customs. In the Turkana Ateker, land is subdivided into regions or territorial sections, ≈ãiTela. Each Ekitela institutes its own common laws which are derived from the general laws of the whole nation or kingdom. = Religion = Religious beliefs of one Ateker are similar. The supreme deity worshiped has one common name. = Common ancestry = Members of one Ateker have a common ancestral origin. Members of Ateker have different ancestral origin. within the Ateker sub divisions of the Turkana/Ngiturukana and the Karimojong/Ngikarimojong, the Karimojong/ngikarimojong subscribe to Nakadanya which is believed to be the holly ground for Ngimatheniko/Ngikori (Moroto District), Ngipian/Ngimuriai (nabilatuk and Nakapiripirit Districts), Ngibokora (Napak District) and the Dodoth/ngikaleeso of Kaabong and Karenga Districts. the Turkana/Ngiturkana of Nrthwestern Kenya are subscribed to Moru- anayiece as their holly and Ancestral ground. However, they speak related languages and can hear eah other. Ateker laws Among members of the Turkana-Karimojong Ateker, it is prohibited to kill members of the same Ateker. Killing members of the same Ateker is like killing one's own brother. Other laws govern marriage Akuuta, divorce elakit or akilak, grazing Achok or akitwar etc.  References  Category:Ethnic groups in Uganda Category:Ethnic groups in Kenya ","title":"Ateker peoples"},{"id":"3011124","text":"Conrad Martens (London 1801 - 21 August 1878) was an English-born landscape painter active on HMS Beagle from 1833 to 1834. He arrived in Australia in 1835 and painted there until his death in 1878. Life and work Conrad Martens' father, J. C. H. Martens, was an Austrian-born merchant who originally came to London as Austrian Consul. Conrad was born in 1801 at \\"Crutched Friars\\" near Tower Hill and after his father's death in 1816 determined to pursue a career as an artist studying landscape painting under the prominent watercolourist Copley Fielding. His two brothers, John William and Henry were also artists. In 1832 Captain Blackwood of HMS Hyacinth (1829) asked him join his three-year cruise to India as a topographical artist. In Montevideo near the end of 1833 he heard Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, who was employed in surveying the Straits of Magellan, wanted to engage an artist to replace the ship's artist Augustus Earle who had fallen ill. In this way he joined the second voyage of HMS Beagle and stayed on board for some two years, until the schooner which accompanied them was paid off and the officer who had command of her returned to HMS Beagle, meaning there was no longer room for Martens. While on board Martens struck up a lifelong friendship with Charles Darwin who was taking part in the expedition as a self-financing gentleman naturalist and companion to the captain. A watercolor of a native from Tierra del Fuego, painted by Martens when he and Charles Darwin visited the area during the Voyage of the Beagle (1832/34). Martens left the Beagle at Valparaiso in the second half of 1834 and took passage to Tahiti, and many of the South Sea islands, including New Zealand, before arriving in Sydney 1835. Martens arrived in the colony with a valuable collection of sketches which he at first intended to take back to his friend Blackwood in India, but finding his pictures were appreciated in Sydney he found constant employment and decided to remain. He went on to become one of the most proficient, prominent and prolific landscape artist in the colony. Beagle arrived in 1836, and Darwin and Captain Fitzroy commissioned a number of paintings from Beagles voyages in Tierra Del Fuego and the Pacific. Other large commissions followed, and in 1837 some of Martens' Australian watercolours were exhibited at the Royal Society in London. In 1839, however, a drought triggered an economic recession which was to last until the 1850s, and commissions became increasingly difficult to acquire. In the 1840s he turned to lithographs, which allowed him to sell the same work many times over - his 'View of Sydney from the North Shore' was especially popular. Conrad Martens married Jane Carter, of Welsh heritage and the only child of William and Jane Carter at St James Church, Sydney, on 9 March 1837. Jane's father, a private barrister and First Master in Chancery of the Supreme Court of New South Wales had purchased one of Martens' paintings, View of Tahiti in September 1836. In late 1851 Martens sailed to Brisbane then travelling back by road across the Great Dividing Range to the Darling Downs, then south through New England to Sydney. En route, he lodged with squatters and pastoralists, drawing their houses and properties, and hoping for commissions. The plan succeeded, and Martens was eventually commissioned to paint over seventy watercolours, nearly forty of which are still known today. Between 1841 and 1852 he travelled through the Newcastle and Hunter Valley regions with much of his collection digitized at the State Library of New South Wales. He exhibited at the Victorian Fine Arts Society in Melbourne in 1853, and at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1855. Eventual improvement in the Australian economy in the later 1850s (largely due to the discovery of gold) led to an increase in significant commissions. A famous painting is North Head, Sydney Harbour (1854). In 1862 he received a letter from Darwin, and replied congratulating him on the success of The Origin of Species. He sent Darwin a watercolour of Brisbane River and exhibited at the International Exhibition in London. In 1863 he became Assistant Librarian in the Parliamentary Library, securing his financial position, but severely curtailing the time he could spend on artistic work. Nevertheless, he exhibited at the Paris International Exhibition in 1867 and found time to tutor aspiring Australian talent such as Mary Gedye. He received his first public commission in 1872, from the Victorian Gallery (later National Gallery of Victoria), for a watercolour of Apsley Falls on Waterloo (Pastoral) Station, near Walcha, New South Wales, and a second similar commission in 1875 from the New South Wales Academy of Arts (later Art Gallery of New South Wales), of whose Council he became a member in 1877. From the later 1860s Martens suffered from angina, and he died from a heart attack on 21 August 1878. He was buried at a private ceremony at St Thomas Rest Park, North Sydney, and was carried to his grave by Sir John Hay, Dr. Ward, Mr. Slade, Mr. Marshall Bailey, and Captain Mann. Like many artists Marten was not universally acknowledged in his lifetime but by 1910 his works were displayed in pride of place at the opening of the Mitchell Gallery at the State Library of New South Wales.

Charismatic megafauna are large animal species with symbolic value or widespread popular appeal, and are often used by environmental activists to gain public support for environmentalist goals. Examples include the Bengal tiger, humpback whale, giant panda, bald eagle, California condor, harp seal, and penguin. Paradoxically, numerous charismatic species are endangered by hunting and black market commerce.  Use in conservation  Charismatic species are often used as flagship species in conservation programs, as they are supposed to attract people's feelings more. However, being charismatic does not protect species against extinction: all of the 10 most charismatic species are currently endangered, and only the giant panda shows a demographic growth from an extremely small population. Beginning early in the 20th century, efforts to reintroduce extirpated charismatic megafauna to ecosystems have been an interest of a number of private and non-government conservation organizations. Species have been reintroduced from captive breeding programs in zoos, such as the European bison to Poland's Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest. These and other reintroductions of charismatic megafauna, such as Przewalski's horse to Mongolia, have been to areas of limited, and often patchy range compared to the historic ranges of the respective species. Environmental activists and proponents of ecotourism seek to use the leverage provided by charismatic and well-known species to achieve more subtle and far-reaching goals in species and biodiversity conservation. By directing public attention to the diminishing numbers of giant panda due to habitat loss, for example, conservation groups can raise support for the protection of the panda and for the entire ecosystem of which it is a part. (The giant panda is portrayed in the logo of the World Wide Fund for Nature.)  Taxonomic bias  Charismatic megafauna may be subject to taxonomic inflation, in that taxonomists will declare a subspecies to be a species because of the advocacy benefits of a unique species, rather than because of new scientific evidence.\\"Species inflation: Hail Linnaeus\\", The Economist, May 17, 2007 The public's preference to identify with species sold through the ecotourism industry may be a factor for creating taxonomic inflation. In the public perception, ecotourism may be about seeing species, and the number of unique species increases the perceived biodiversity and tourism value of an area. A correlation may exist between the taxonomic bias in biodiversity datasets and the charisma of terrestrial megafauna, with the more charismatic species being largely over-reported.

Sound baffles are a fundamental tool of noise mitigation, the practice of minimizing noise pollution or reverberation. An important type of sound baffle is the noise barrier constructed along highways to reduce sound levels at properties in the vicinity. Sound baffles are also applied to walls and ceilings in building interiors to absorb sound energy and thus lessen reverberation. Highway noise barriers The technology for accurate prediction of the effects of noise barrier design using a computer model to analyze roadway noise has been available since the early 1970s. The earliest published scientific design of a noise barrier may have occurred in Santa Clara County, California in 1970 for a section of the Foothill Expressway in Los Altos, California. The county used a computer model to predict the effects of sound propagation from roadways, with variables consisting of vehicle speed, ratio of trucks to automobiles, road surface type, roadway geometrics, micro-meteorology and the design of proposed soundwalls. Interior sound baffle design Since the early 1900s, scientists have been aware of the utility of certain types of interior coatings or baffles to improve the acoustics of concert halls, theaters, conference rooms and other spaces where sound quality is important. By the mid-1950s, Bolt, Beranek and Newman and a few other U.S. research organizations were developing technology to address sound quality's design challenges. This design field draws on several disciplines including acoustical science, computer modeling, architecture and materials science. Sound baffles are also used in speaker cabinets to absorb energy from the pressure created by the speakers, thus reducing cabinet resonance. In 1973, Pearl P. Randolph, a school bus driver in Virginia, won a new school bus in a national contest held by Wayne Corporation for the suggestion that sound baffles be installed in the ceiling of school buses. In 1981, they were first made mandatory by the state of California. Vehicle exhaust sound baffles Baffles are also found in the exhaust pipes of vehicles, particularly motorcycles.

Essanay co-owner and star, Broncho Billy Anderson can be seen as an enthusiastic audience member in the boxing match scene. The Champion Plot In this comedy, Charlie Chaplin has a companion--a pet bulldog. Walking along a street with his bulldog, Charlie finds a \\"good luck\\" horseshoe just as he passes the training camp of an enormous fighter named Spike Dugan. Outside the camp is a large, painted advertisement which states Dugan is seeking sparring partners \\"who can take a punch.\\" After watching other better fighters be soundly beaten by Dugan, Charlie decides his best bet is to put the horseshoe inside his boxing glove. Using the loaded glove, Charlie connects with a solid punch and wins. The trainer prepares Charlie to fight the world champion. A gambler wants Charlie to throw the fight. He and the trainer's daughter fall in love. Notes In some versions of the film, an inter-title introducing the heavyweight boxers refers to Spike Dugan as \\"Spike Hennessey\\"--although the surname Dugan is clearly painted on the wall surrounding his training camp.

Although English has raising constructions, not all languages do. The term raising has its origins in the transformational analysis of such constructions; the constituent in question is seen as being \\"raised\\" from its initial, deep structure position as the subject of the embedded predicate to its surface structure position in the matrix predicate/verb.Early seminal accounts of raising were produced by Rosenbaum (1967) and Postal (1974). See further Grinder and Elgin (1973:141ff.), Bach (1974:120ff., 146ff.), Emonds (1976:75ff.), Borsley (1996:126-144), Carnie (2007:285ff.). Raising predicates/verbs are related to control predicates, although there are important differences between the two predicate/verb types. Examples There are at least two types of raising predicates/verbs: raising-to-subject verbs and raising-to-object predicates. Raising-to-object predicates overlap to a large extent with so-called ECM-verbs (= exceptional case-marking). These types of raising predicates/verbs are illustrated with the following sentences: ::a. They seem to be trying. - seem is a raising-to-subject verb. ::b. Prices appear to be increasing. - appear is a raising-to-subject verb. ::c. You seem to be impatient. - seem is a raising-to-subject verb. ::a. Fred wants us to help. - want can be a raising-to-object predicate. ::b. That proves him to be hiding something. - prove can be a raising-to-object predicate. ::c. She predicts there to be a problem. - predict can be a raising-to-object predicate. The primary trait of raising predicates/verbs like these is that they are not semantically selecting one of their dependents.That raising predicates, unlike control predicates, do not semantically select one of their arguments is emphasized in all accounts of raising and control. See for instance van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:130), Borsley (1996:133), Culicover (1997:102). The raising-to-subject verbs are not selecting their subject dependent, and the raising-to-object predicates are not selecting their object dependent. These dependents appear to have been raised from the lower predicate. Alternation with it-extraposition Raising predicates/verbs can be identified in part by the fact that they alternatively take a full clause dependent and can take part in it-extraposition,Concerning the ability of raising predicates to appear with full clausal arguments, see Bach (1974:149), Borsley (1996:127f.), Carnie (2007:291). e.g. ::a. Tom seems to have won the race. ::b. It seems that Tom won the race. - Raising-to- subject verb seem occurs with it-extraposition ::a. Larry appears to be doing the work. ::b. It appears that Larry is doing the work. - Raising-to-subject predicate verb appear occurs with it-extraposition. ::a. Sam believed someone to know the answer. ::b. Sam believed it that someone knew the answer. - Raising-to-object predicate believe occurs with it-extraposition. ::c. Sam believed that someone knew the answer. - Raising-to-object predicate believe occurs with clausal object argument. ::a. That proves Susan to be a jackass. ::b. That proves it that Susan is a jackass. - Raising-to-object predicate prove occurs with it-extraposition. ::c. That proves that Susan is a jackass. - Raising-to-object predicate prove occurs with clausal object argument. Raising predicates/verbs can appear with it-extraposition and/or a full clausal dependent. They appear to be subcategorizing for a propositional argument. Raising-to-subject verbs vs. auxiliary verbs The raising-to- subject verbs seem and appear are similar to auxiliary verbs insofar as both verb types have little to no semantic content. The content that they do have is functional in nature. In this area, auxiliary verbs cannot be viewed as separate predicates; they are, rather, part of a predicate. The raising-to- subject verbs seem and appear are similar insofar it is difficult to view them as predicates. They serve, rather, to modify a predicate. That this is so can be seen in the fact that the following pairs of sentences are essentially synonymous: ::a. Fred does not seem to have done it. ::b. Fred seems not to have done it. - Position of the negation is flexible. ::a. Mary does not appear to like pudding. ::b. Mary appears not to like pudding. - Position of the negation is flexible. The fact that position of the negation can change without influencing the meaning is telling. It means that the raising-to- subject verbs can hardly be viewed as predicates. While raising-to-subject verbs are like auxiliary verbs insofar as they lack the content of predicates, they are unlike auxiliaries in syntactic respects. Auxiliary verbs undergo subject-aux inversion, raising-to-subject verbs do not. Auxiliary verbs license negation, raising-to-subject verbs do so only reluctantly: ::a. Fred is happy. ::b. Is Fred happy? - Auxiliary verb be takes part in subject- auxiliary inversion. ::c. Fred is not happy. - Auxiliary verb be licenses negation. ::a. Fred seems happy. ::b. *Seems Fred happy? - Raising-to-subject verb seem cannot take part in subject-auxiliary inversion. ::c. ??Fred seems not happy. - Raising-to-subject verb seem can hardly license negation. ::a. Susan should stay. ::b. Should Susan stay? - Modal auxiliary should takes part in subject-auxiliary inversion. ::c. Susan should not stay. - Modal auxiliary should can license negation. ::a. Susan appears to be staying. ::b. *Appears Susan to be staying? - Raising-to-subject verb appear cannot take part in subject-auxiliary inversion. ::c. ?Susan appears not to be staying. - Raising- to-subject verb appear reluctantly licenses negation. Raising-to-object verbs are also clearly NOT auxiliary verbs. Unlike raising-to-subject verbs, however, raising-to-object verbs have clear semantic content, so they are hence indisputably predicates. Representing raising The fact that the raised constituent behaves as though it is a dependent of the higher predicate is generally reflected in the syntax trees that are employed to represent raising structures. The following trees are illustrative of the type of structures assumed for raising-to-object predicates.The flat VP analysis of raising structures shown in the a-sentences was posited by some in the 1970s and later. For examples of the \\"flat\\" analysis, see for instance Bach (1974:146), Emonds (1976:77), and Borsley (1996:128). Most modern dependency grammars (also) assume a flat structure for raising structures.For an early layered analysis, however, see Culicover (1982:251ff.). Both constituency- based trees of phrase structure grammar and dependency-based trees of dependency grammar are employed here:The dependency trees are like those found, for instance, in Osborne et al. (2012). ::Raising trees 1 The constituency-based trees are the a-trees on the left, and the dependency-based trees are the b-trees on the right. While the structures assumed here can be disputed - especially the constituency structures - the trees all show the main stance toward raising structures. This stance is that the \\"subject\\" of the lower predicate appears as a dependent of the higher predicate - the relevant constituents are in bold. Relatively flat structures are assumed to accommodate this behavior. Both it and the claim are shown as dependents of expects and proves, respectively, although they are semantic arguments of the lower predicates to happen and to be false, respectively. A number of empirical considerations support the relatively flat structures shown here. That is, empirical considerations support the position of the \\"raised\\" constituent as a dependent of the matrix predicate/verb. These dependents can appear in object form, they can appear as the subject of passive sentences, and they can appear as reflexives coindexed with the matrix subjects:Concerning these points, see Bach (1974:147f.), Postal (1974), Lasnik and Saito (1999:9ff.). ::a. We expect him to help. - Pronoun him appears in object form. ::b. He is expected to help. - Object pronoun becomes subject in passive. ::c. He1 expects himself1 to help. - Reflexive is coindexed with subject. ::a. You proved her to be competent. - Pronoun her appears in object form. ::b. She was proved to be competent. - Object pronoun becomes subject in passive. ::c. She1 proved herself1 to be competent. - Reflexive is coindexed with subject. This behavior speaks strongly for the general analysis reflected in the trees, namely that the \\"raised\\" constituent is a dependent of the higher predicate. Raising vs. control An understanding of raising is significantly expanded by comparing and contrasting raising with control. Examine the following (dependency) trees: ::Raising trees 2 The a-trees contain the raising predicates wants and judges, whereas the b-trees contain the control predicates told and asked. Despite the fact that structures assumed for these different predicate types are essentially the same, there is a major distinction to be drawn. This distinction is that the control predicates semantically select their objects, whereas the raising predicates do not. In other words, the object is a semantic argument of the control predicate in each case, whereas it is not an argument of the raising predicate. This situation obtains despite the fact that both predicate types take the object to be the \\"subject\\" of the lower predicate. The distinction between raising-to-object and control predicates is identified using the there-insertion diagnostic. Expletive there can appear as the object (or subject) of raising predicates, but it cannot appear as the object of control predicates,The expletive is widely employed to distinguish control from raising constructions. Concerning there-insertion as a diagnostic for distinguishing between control and raising, see for instance Grinder and Elgin (1973:142-143), Bach (1973:151), Culicover (1982:256ff.), Borsley (1996:127), Culicover (1997:102), Lasnik and Saito (1999:8-9), Falk (2001:131). e.g.: ::a. Sam judges there to be a problem. - Expletive there can appear as the object of a raising-to-object predicate. ::b. *Sam asked there to be a problem. - Expletive there cannot appear as the object of an object control predicate. ::a. We want there to be a revision. - Expletive there can appear as the object of a raising-to-object predicate. ::b. ??We helped there (to) be a revision. - Expletive there cannot appear as the object of an object control predicate. Since the raising predicates place no semantic restrictions on their object dependents, expletive there is free to appear. In contrast, object control predicates do place semantic restrictions on their object arguments, which means expletive there usually cannot appear. Notes References *Bach, E. 1974. Syntactic theory.

He was elected best player of the 1994 World Championship and 1995 European Championship, and in 2001, the FIVB declared him to be the \\"Volleyball Player of the Century\\" with Karch Kiraly.FIVB Player of the Century part of Volleyball Hall of Fame 2011 Inductees Career Born in Trento, Bernardi started his long career in the 1980s as setter, but later was switched to hitter and passer. From 1985 he played with the Panini Modena club. Bernardi won the Italian championship nine times with Modena and with Sisley Treviso, which he played for from 1990 to 2001. His first cap with Italy national volleyball team was on 27 May 1987, he played for a total of 306 times in \\"Azzurri\\" colours, winning two European gold medals in (1989 and 1995), two World Championships (1990 and 1994), three Volleyball World Leagues and the Volleyball World Cup in 1995. His international tally also includes two more gold medals, five silver medals and one bronze. Lorenzo was named the most valuable player of the 1992 FIVB World League after the Italians won the event for the third time in a row. Lorenzo was named the Best Player of the 1994 FIVB World Championship after Italy captured the gold medal for the second consecutive time. During Bernardi's final Olympic Games appearance in 1996 in Atlanta, Italy won all five of its Pool B matches in straight sets. Italy continued its success with a four-set victory over Argentina in the quarterfinals, followed by a four-set semifinal victory over Serbia and Montenegro to reach its first-ever Olympic gold-medal match. However, Netherlands battled to a five-set victory leaving Italy with the silver medal. Lorenzo was named the Best Player of the 1994 FIVB World Championship after Italy captured the gold medal for the second consecutive time. In 2004, he played some competitions in Qatar and after a spell in Greece and Olympiacos, he has returned to play in Italy as of November 2005. In spite of his late age of 37, he was declared MVP of the first match in his new Italian club career. In his later career he played for a B1 series (Italy's third category) near his native Trento, finishing his playing career with Montichiari in 2007. Overall, Bernardi competed 306 times for Italy in international competition. Lorenzo was part of nine Italian League championship teams to cement his legendary status in his home country. During the 2010/2011 season, he took over the head coach position of the Polish club Jastrzƒôbski Wƒôgiel, and was able to reach the 4th spot in the CEV Champions League. Bernardi in 2014 was named new coach of the Halkbank Ankara. In November 2016, he replaced Slobodan Kovaƒç as coach of Sir Safety Perugia.Perugia cambia: via Kovac, arriva il mito Bernardi =Style played= Lorenzo Bernardi‚Äôs versatility became a superior attribute to the sport that become a multi-talented hitter, outstanding passer and one of the ultimate all-around players of his generation.Topendsports - Lorenzo Bernardi Sporting achievements =As a player= * CEV Champions League ** 16px 1989/1990, with Pallavolo Modena ** 16px 1994/1995, with Sisley Treviso ** 16px 1998/1999, with Sisley Treviso ** 16px 1999/2000, with Sisley Treviso * CEV Cup ** 16px 1985/1986, with Pallavolo Modena ** 16px 1993/1994, with Sisley Treviso * CEV Challenge Cup ** 16px 1990/1991, with Sisley Treviso ** 16px 1992/1993, with Sisley Treviso ** 16px 1997/1998, with Sisley Treviso ** 16px 2004/2005, with Lube Banca Macerata * National championships ** 1985/1986 16px Italian Cup, with Pallavolo Modena ** 1985/1986 16px Italian Championship, with Pallavolo Modena ** 1986/1987 16px Italian Championship, with Pallavolo Modena ** 1987/1988 16px Italian Cup, with Pallavolo Modena ** 1987/1988 16px Italian Championship, with Pallavolo Modena ** 1988/1989 16px Italian Cup, with Pallavolo Modena ** 1988/1989 16px Italian Championship, with Pallavolo Modena ** 1992/1993 16px Italian Cup, with Sisley Treviso ** 1993/1994 16px Italian Championship, with Sisley Treviso ** 1995/1996 16px Italian Championship, with Sisley Treviso ** 1997/1998 16px Italian Championship, with Sisley Treviso ** 1998/1999 16px Italian SuperCup, with Sisley Treviso ** 1999/2000 16px Italian SuperCup, with Sisley Treviso ** 1999/2000 16px Italian Cup, with Sisley Treviso ** 1999/2000 16px Italian Championship, with Sisley Treviso ** 2000/2001 16px Italian Championship, with Sisley Treviso ** 2001/2002 16px Italian SuperCup, with Sisley Treviso * National team ** 1989 16px CEV European Championship ** 1990 16px FIVB World League ** 1990 16px FIVB World Championship ** 1991 16px FIVB World League ** 1991 16px CEV European Championship ** 1992 16px FIVB World League ** 1994 16px FIVB World League ** 1994 16px FIVB World Championship ** 1995 16px CEV European Championship ** 1995 16px FIVB World Cup ** 1996 16px Olympic Games ** 2000 16px FIVB World League ** 2001 16px CEV European Championship =As a coach= * CEV Champions League ** 16px 2013/2014, with Jastrzƒôbski Wƒôgiel ** 16px 2016/2017, with Sir Safety Perugia ** 16px 2017/2018, with Sir Safety Perugia * FIVB Club World Championship ** 16px Qatar 2011, with Jastrzƒôbski Wƒôgiel * National championships ** 2012/2013 16px Polish Championship, with Jastrzƒôbski Wƒôgiel ** 2013/2014 16px Polish Championship, with Jastrzƒôbski Wƒôgiel ** 2014/2015 16px Turkish SuperCup, with Halkbank Ankara ** 2014/2015 16px Turkish Cup, with Halkbank Ankara ** 2015/2016 16px Turkish SuperCup, with Halkbank Ankara ** 2015/2016 16px Turkish Championship, with Halkbank Ankara ** 2017/2018 16px Italian SuperCup, with Sir Safety Perugia ** 2017/2018 16px Italian Cup, with Sir Safety Perugia ** 2017/2018 16px Italian Championship, with Sir Safety Perugia ** 2018/2019 16px Italian Cup, with Sir Safety Perugia * National teams ** 1999 16px Mediterranean Games, with Italy B Individual awards * 1992 World League \\"Most Valuable Player\\" * 1994 World Championships \\"Most Valuable Player\\" * 1995 European Championships \\"Most Valuable Player\\" * 1996 World League \\"Most Valuable Player\\" * 1996 World League \\"Best Scorer\\" * 60px 2000 Order of Merit of the Italian Republic President of the Republic External links *Personal data - LegaVolley *Bernardi in The International Volleyball Hall of Fame References Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Trento Category:Italian men's volleyball players Category:Olympiacos S.C. players Category:Olympic volleyball players of Italy Category:Olympic silver medalists for Italy Category:Volleyball players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Volleyball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Volleyball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in volleyball Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Jastrzƒôbski Wƒôgiel coaches ","title":"Lorenzo Bernardi"},{"id":"3011180","title":"Essential Marvel"},{"id":"3011188","text":"Edward Gregson (born 23 July 1945), is an English composer of instrumental and choral music, particularly for brass and wind bands and ensembles, as well as music for the theatre, film, and television. He was also principal of the Royal Northern College of Music. Early life & education He was born in Sunderland, England, in 1945. He studied composition (with Alan Bush) and piano at the Royal Academy of Music from 1963‚Äì7, winning five prizes for composition. Career In 1988 he was nominated for an Ivor Novello award for his title music to BBC Television's Young Musician of the Year programmes, for which he also regularly officiated as a jury member and broadcaster. He was Principal of the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester from 1996‚Äì2008. There he faced criticism for the appointment of Malcolm Layfield, previously a violin teacher at the College, to the post of Head of Strings, despite Gregson's knowledge of allegations that Layfield had a history of sexual misconduct against students. In 2008 he retired from academic life to concentrate on his composition. He has since completed orchestral commissions for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Hall√© and the BBC Philharmonic orchestras. In 2014, the North American Brass Band Association honored both Edward Gregson and his brother Bramwell Gregson (best known for his conducting work with the London Citadel Band and Canada's Brassroots, modelled on the Philip Jones brass tentet). Each section's required test piece was composed by Edward Gregson. He continues to sit on a number of Boards relating to music education and the music industry. He is a fellow at the RNCM, as well as at the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music. Performances His music has been performed by many orchestras and ensembles worldwide, including in the UK: the London Symphony Orchestra and all the BBC orchestras; in the USA: Detroit, Louisville and Albany (New York); in the Far East: Tokyo Philharmonic and China National Broadcasting Orchestra; and in Europe: orchestras in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Scandinavia.

Life Bliss grew up in a Chicago family that eventually became affluent; in 1907, his father became president of the company supplying all of Chicago's electricity. The family was not affluent, however, when Bliss entered the University of Chicago in 1893 (its second year of operation). Hence he had to support himself while a student by winning a scholarship, and by playing in a student professional mandolin quartet. After obtaining the B.Sc. in 1897, he began graduate studies at Chicago in mathematical astronomy (his first publication was in that field), switching in 1898 to mathematics. He discovered his life's work, the calculus of variations, via the lecture notes of Weierstrass's 1879 course, and Bolza's teaching. Bolza went on to supervise Bliss's Ph.D. thesis, The Geodesic Lines on the Anchor Ring, completed in 1900 and published in the Annals of Mathematics in 1902. After two years as an instructor at the University of Minnesota, Bliss spent the 1902‚Äì03 academic year at the University of G√∂ttingen, interacting with Felix Klein, David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, Ernst Zermelo, Erhard Schmidt, Max Abraham, and Constantin Carath√©odory. Upon returning to the United States, Bliss taught one year each at the University of Chicago and the University of Missouri. In 1904, he published two more papers on the calculus of variations in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. Bliss was a Preceptor at Princeton University, 1905‚Äì08, joining a strong group of young mathematicians that included Luther P. Eisenhart, Oswald Veblen, and Robert Lee Moore. While at Princeton he was also an associate editor of the Annals of Mathematics. In 1908, Chicago's Maschke died and Bliss was hired to replace him; Bliss remained at Chicago until his 1941 retirement. While at Chicago, he was an editor of the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 1908‚Äì16, and chaired the Mathematics Department, 1927‚Äì41. That Department was less distinguished under Bliss than it had been under E. H. Moore's previous leadership, and than it would become under Marshall Stone's and Saunders MacLane's direction after World War II. A near-contemporary of Bliss's at Chicago was the algebraist Leonard Dickson. During World War I, he worked on ballistics, designing new firing tables for artillery, and lectured on navigation. In 1918, he and Oswald Veblen worked together in the Range Firing Section at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, applying the calculus of variations to correct shell trajectories for the effects of wind, changes in air density, the rotation of the Earth, and other perturbations. Bliss married Helen Hurd in 1912, who died in the 1918 influenza pandemic; their two children survived. Bliss married Olive Hunter in 1920; they had no children. Bliss was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (United States) in 1916. He was the American Mathematical Society's Colloquium Lecturer (1909), Vice President (1911), and President (1921‚Äì22). He received the Mathematical Association of America's first Chauvenet Prize, in 1925, for his article \\"Algebraic functions and their divisors,\\" which culminated in his 1933 book Algebraic functions. Bliss once headed a government commission that devised rules for apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among the several states. Work Bliss's work on the calculus of variations culminated in his classic 1946 monograph, Lectures on the Calculus of Variations, which treated the subject as an end in itself and not as an adjunct of mechanics. Here Bliss achieved a substantial simplification of the transformation theories of Clebsch and Weierstrass. Bliss also strengthened the necessary conditions of Euler, Weierstrass, Legendre, and Jacobi into sufficient conditions. Bliss set out the canonical formulation and solution of the problem of Bolza with side conditions and variable end-points. Bliss's Lectures more or less constitutes the culmination of the classic calculus of variations of Weierstrass, Hilbert, and Bolza. Subsequent work on variational problems would strike out in new directions, such as Morse theory, optimal control, and dynamic programming. Bliss also studied singularities of real transformations in the plane.

The river rises in Wangdue Phodrang district (or dzongkhag in Dzongkha), near Gangkhar Puensum, Bhutan's highest peak at . Bhutan's main east-west highway crosses the Mangde Chhu about west of Trongsa. South of Trongsa, the river drains the eastern slopes of the Black Mountains (Bhutan), and forms the eastern boundaries of Black Mountain National Park and Royal Manas National Park. Another highway follows the river south from Trongsa to Shemgang. The highway leaves the river at Tingtinbi, and eventually reaches the Indian border at Gelegphug. South of Tingtinbi, the Mangde is joined by the Bumthang River from the east, and is known as the Tongasa. Shortly before entering India in Assam, the Manas River flows into the river from the east, and the river exits Bhutan near Manas. Important towns and areas through which the Trongsa - Gelegphug road passes are Shemgang (Shamgong), Taama, Bataase, and Surey rice fields.

At any given time, the Chief of the General Staff is the only active officer holding the IDF's highest rank, rav aluf (), which is usually translated into English as lieutenant general, a three-star rank. The only exception to this rule occurred during the Yom Kippur War, when former Chief of the General Staff Haim Bar-Lev, who was a cabinet member at the outbreak of and during the war, was brought out of retirement and installed as chief of Southern Command. For a brief period, he and Chief of the General Staff David Elazar were both in active service with the rank of rav aluf. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is an integrated force, its ranks are the same in all services. It has a slightly compacted rank structure; for instance, the Chief of the General Staff is seemingly only equivalent to a lieutenant general (NATO OF-8) in other militaries. Rav aluf means 'chief-general', which would be equal to a field marshal or five star general in other armies and equivalent to OF-10. Legal position The position of ramatkal is defined in the Basic Law: The Military (1976), clause three: *The supreme command rank in the military is that of the Chief of the General Staff *The Chief of the General Staff is to be placed under the authority of the government and subordinate to the Defense Minister *The Chief of the General Staff is to be appointed by the government, according to the recommendation of the Defense Minister The Chief of the General Staff is formally appointed once every three years, with the government often extending the term to four years, and in some occasions, even five. As of 15 January 2019, the Chief of the General Staff is Aviv Kochavi. Significance Given the importance of the IDF in Israeli society, the Chief of the General Staff is an important public figure in Israel. On appointment of a new Chief of the General Staff, mass-circulation papers such as Yediot Aharonot and Israel Hayom customarily provide their readers with large-scale portrait photos of the new Chief. Former Chiefs of the General Staff often parlay the prominence of their position into political life, and sometimes the business world. Two Chiefs of the General Staff (Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak) have become Prime Minister of Israel and eleven others (Yigael Yadin, Moshe Dayan, Tzvi Tzur, Haim Bar-Lev, Mordechai Gur, Rafael Eitan, Amnon Lipkin- Shahak, Shaul Mofaz, Moshe Ya'alon, Gabi Ashkenazi, and Benny Gantz) have served in the Knesset. Of these, only Tzur did not get appointed to the Cabinet. Five former Chiefs of the General Staff (Dayan, Rabin, Barak, Mofaz and Ya'alon) held the position of Defense Minister, widely considered to be one of the most powerful ministerial posts in the country and the immediate civilian superior of the Chief of the General Staff. The current holder of the post (as of July 2020) is former Chief of Staff Benny Gantz. Moshe Dayan served also as Foreign Minister. Soon after his discharge, Dan Halutz became the CEO of a prestigious car importer. Ehud Barak took a hiatus from politics twice after defeats for re-election and pursued successful international business ventures.

History Middlesbrough had previously played at Linthorpe Road West cricket ground, but election to the Football League meant that an improved stadium was required. Ayresome Park was built at Paradise Field, adjacent to the old Paradise Ground of Middlesbrough Ironopolis, who had played in the Football League in the 1893‚Äì94 season. The highest attendance at the ground (53,802) was set on 27 December 1949, when Middlesbrough played their North East rivals Newcastle United. Ayresome Park was also one of the venues for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Three games were played at the ground, involving the Soviet Union, North Korea, Italy and Chile. North Korea famously beat Italy 1‚Äì0 at the ground, to knock out of the World Cup one of the most powerful footballing nations, and advancing the Koreans to the quarter-finals in the process. However, the attendances at Ayresome Park were among the lowest in the entire tournament, with a low of 15,887 fans at the game for North Korea versus Chile. Middlesbrough famously had to play their first home game of the 1986‚Äì87 season at Hartlepool because they were locked out of Ayresome Park by the bailiffs due to huge debts which almost put the club out of business. However, they were soon back at Ayresome Park after a takeover deal saved the club, with their attendances and fortunes on the pitch both improving almost immediately. Despite this crisis, a ¬£1.2 million sports centre was opened at the stadium on 3 March 1986 after a six- year delay caused by fire and safety regulations. By the early 1990s, the stadium was showing its age and clearly in need of major work to bring it up to date. The demands of the Taylor Report meant that all stadiums in the highest two divisions of English football had to be all-seater by the start of the 1994‚Äì95 season. The surrounding residential area limited scope for expansion to an all seater capacity of no more than 20,000, and with the club wanting a considerably bigger capacity, by 1993 the decision had been made to relocate the club to a new site. Plans for a new 30,000-seat stadium on the banks of the River Tees were given the go-ahead in the spring of 1994, and construction work began that autumn, with the new stadium being ready for the 1995‚Äì96 season; when it became the first new stadium to be built by a top division club since Manchester City moved to Maine Road in 1923. The final competitive game at Ayresome Park was played against Luton Town on 30 April 1995 in a match which Boro won 2‚Äì1 to secure the Division One title and promotion to the Premier League, two years after being relegated. It was also a fine first season in management for the club's new manager Bryan Robson. John Hendrie, a key player for Boro during the first half of the 1990s, earned the honour of scoring the final competitive goal at Ayresome Park. The last game at the ground was a sell-out testimonial match for long-serving goalkeeper Stephen Pears, who scored the ground's final goal, scoring from the penalty spot in a 3‚Äì1 win for Peter Beardsley's select XI against the Middlesbrough promotion winning side. The select XI's other goals were scored by Beardsley and Bernie Slaven; Paul Wilkinson scoring the Boro's only goal. Boro collected the First Division Championship Trophy following the game. Ayresome Park was retained as a training ground for a year until a new facility was opened, and it was finally demolished in early 1997. The site of the stadium is now a housing estate. To commemorate the ground, the gates of Ayresome Park have been erected outside the main entrance to the club's new ground, the Riverside Stadium. 1966 World Cup matches at Ayresome Park \\\\---- \\\\---- References External links *Ayresome Park Remembered Website *World Stadia Article Category:Defunct football venues in England Category:Sports venues in Middlesbrough Category:Middlesbrough F.C. facilities Category:1966 FIFA World Cup stadiums Category:Premier League venues Category:Defunct sports venues in North Yorkshire Category:Sports venues completed in 1903 Category:1903 establishments in England Category:Sports venues demolished in 1997 Category:1997 disestablishments in England Category:English Football League venues Category:Demolished sports venues in the United Kingdom ","title":"Ayresome Park"},{"id":"3011278","text":"Theron ( , ) is a surname of Occitan origin (from place-names Th√©ron, Th√©rond variant form of *Thoron ‚Äî same as Le Thor (Vaucluse, Torum 1029) ‚Äî from PIE *tur- or Latin torus \\"height\\"), and a given name in English.

He was the author of a play upon which Israeli film He Walked Through the Fields was based.Israeli Film: A Reference Guide, p. 74 Biography Shamir was born in Safed. He went to the Tel Nordau School and graduated from the Herzliya Hebrew High School in Tel Aviv. Members of the Harel Brigade, January 1949. Moshe Shamir 2nd right. In the Israeli War of Independence he served in Palmach. He began his political career as a member of the movement Hashomer Hatzair, in which he filled a leadership role. He was one of the editors of their official newspaper Al Ha-Homa from 1939 to 1941. From 1944 to 1946 he was a member of kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. He was founder and editor of the Israel Defense Forces official newspaper Bamahane (\\"In the Camp\\") from 1947 to 1950. During the 1950s he was a member of the editorial board of the newspaper Maariv and the editor of its literature section. Literary and journalism career Shamir began writing stories at a young age. They immediately attracted attention, and not only for his literary ability. He was always engaged with political problems, always arousing opposition. The first opposition came from Meir Yairi, leader of the left-wing movement to which Shamir belonged, concerning what was perceived as \\"ideological aberration\\" in his stories. In hindsight it is difficult to understand what the fuss was about. The stories seem completely innocent and certainly are not hostile or injurious to the kibbutz movement. However, the anger that was aroused against Shamir was so strong that he decided to leave his kibbutz in 1947 for ideological reasons. Shamir's first story, appearing in print in 1940, dealt with Abraham and the binding of Isaac. The story was published in the youth movement newspaper Al Ha-Homa. In his 1947 novel He Walked Through the Fields, which became the first play performed in the established State of Israel, the hero is a native-born Israeli, a \\"Sabra\\". The book won the Ussishkin Prize. It was adapted as a movie directed by Yosef Millo, who also directed its theatrical debut. In 1947, he became the chief editor of the Haganah (later Israel Defense Forces) newspaper Bamahane. He edited it until he was dismissed at the request of David Ben-Gurion for publishing an article about a celebration of the disbanding of Palmach. Thereafter he continually aroused scandals, more than any other Hebrew author of our time. The hero of With His Own Hands: Elik's Story (1951) is his brother Elik who fell in the War of Independence. The book became an icon of that war. Alik's Story was translated into English, adapted into radio plays, and even merited an adaptation for television. It is one of the greatest Israeli bestsellers of all time, selling to date over 150,000 copies. It became part of the program of study in schools. Under the Sun (1950) and That You Are Naked (1959) are autobiographical pieces based on his life in the thirties and forties. Shamir wrote additional books about the members of his family: With His Own Heart about his father, and Not Far From the Tree about his family history. Besides The King of Flesh and Blood, his most translated book was a children's book, The Fifth Wheel (1961). It is about the adventures of a kibbutznik, dispatched to bring a tractor from the port, who at every step meets various and sundry obstacles and adventures. Joseph Klausner was critical of The King of Flesh and Blood, whose central character is the Hasmonean king Alexander Jann√¶us. Menachem Begin recalled Klausner's words in a later day when Moshe Shamir, as a member of the Knesset, crossed the political lines from left to right to oppose the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. As the prime minister at the time, Begin spoke out against Shamir in the Knesset, indicating that Shamir's objections showed a lack of awareness of the historic moves taking place. He said to Shamir (in Hebrew): :Certainly you recall that, in his day, the late Prof. Joseph Klausner wrote, when you published your book The King of Flesh and Blood, these words: \\"There may sometimes be a writer who is not a historian, but to such an extent?\\" And now I say: \\"There may sometimes be a politician who does not recognize the rustling wings of history, but to such an extent?\\" Moshe Shamir also wrote poetry. However, most of his trade was in prose. He was a prolific author, publishing in the course of his life more than 25 books. Thus he is best recognized as a novelist and a playwright. He died in Rishon LeZion at the age of 83. He was survived by his wife Tzvia. Political career He was active in Mapam. After the Six-Day War, similarly to the songwriter Naomi Shemer, he changed his political leaning. He became one of the creators of the Movement for Greater Israel (Eretz Israel HaShlema, literally \\"Whole Land of Israel\\"), a part of the La'am faction in the Likud. He was elected to the Knesset in the legislative elections of 1977. He was among the founders of the \\"Bnai\\" faction (acronym for a phrase meaning \\"Union of Eretz Israel Faithful\\") that opposed the Camp David Accords (1978). In late 1979, after the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, he broke away from Likud, along with Knesset member Geula Cohen, and found the Tehiya Bnai party. He supported the settling of the West Bank after its capture.http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1216/Israeli- lawmakers-move-to-annex-West-Bank-one-museum-at-a-time/%28page%29/2 His shift from left to right took a toll on him as the main literary societies banned him from membership. Awards Among the various prizes received by Shamir for his work were the following: * In 1950, the Ussishkin Prize; * In 1953, the Brenner Prize; * In 1955, the Bialik Prize for literature; * In 1988, the capstone was the Israel Prize, for Hebrew literature.

If books are available in digital form, a button labeled \\"Read\\" appears next to its catalog listing. Digital copies of the contents of each scanned book are distributed as encrypted e-books (created from images of scanned pages), audiobooks and streaming audio (created from the page images using OCR and text-to-speech software), unencrypted images of full pages from OpenLibrary.org and Archive.org, and APIs for automated downloading of page images. Links to where books can be purchased or borrowed are also provided. There are different entities in the database: * authors * works (which are the aggregate of all books with the same title and text) * editions (which are different publications of the corresponding works) Open Library claims to have over 20 million records in its database. Copies of the contents of tens of thousands of modern books have been made available from 150 libraries and publishers for ebook digital lending. Other books including in-print and in-copyright books have been scanned from copies in library collections, library discards, and donations, and are also available for lending in digital form. In total, the Open Library offers copies of over 1.4 million books for what it calls \\"digital lending\\" and critics have called distribution of digital copies. Technical Open Library began in 2006 with Aaron Swartz as the original engineer and leader of the Open Library's technical team. The project was led by George Oates from April 2009 to December 2011. Oates was responsible for a complete site redesign during her tenure. In 2015, the project was continued by Giovanni Damiola and then Brenton Cheng and Mek Karpeles in 2016. The site was redesigned and relaunched in May 2010. Its codebase is on GitHub. The site uses Infobase, its own database framework based on PostgreSQL, and Infogami, its own Wiki engine written in Python. The source code to the site is published under the GNU Affero General Public License. Book sponsorship program In the week of October 21, 2019, the Open Library website introduced a Book Sponsorship program, which according to Cory Doctorow, \\"lets you direct a cash donation to pay for the purchase and scanning of any books. In return, you are first in line to check that book out when it is available, and then anyone who holds an Open Library library card can check it out.\\". The feature was developed by Mek Karpeles, Tabish Shaikh, and other members of the community. Books for the blind and dyslexic The website was relaunched adding ADA compliance and offering over 1 million modern and older books to the print disabled in May 2010 using the DAISY Digital Talking Book. Under certain provisions of United States copyright law, libraries are sometimes able to reproduce copyrighted works in formats accessible to users with disabilities. Copyright violation accusations The Open Library has justified its ability to offer full contents of books in digital formats as part of the first-sale doctrine and fair use law. The Open Library owns a physical copy of each book that they have made available, and thus argue that the lending out of one digital scan of the book in a controlled manner falls within the first-sale doctrine, a practice known as Controlled Digital Lending. Since its launch, the Open Library has been accused of mass copyright violation, via the systematic distribution of copies of in-copyright books, including both in-print and out-of-print books, by numerous groups, including the American Authors Guild, the British Society of Authors, the Australian Society of Authors, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, the US National Writers Union, and a coalition of 37 national and international organizations of \\"writers, translators, photographers, and graphic artists; unions, organizations, and federations representing the creators of works included in published books; book publishers; and reproduction rights and public lending rights organizations\\". The UK Society of Authors threatened legal action unless the Open Library agreed to cease distribution of copyrighted works by February 1, 2019. Individual authors reported that Open Library had ignored multiple DMCA takedown notices until after they made a fuss on the Internet Archive blog. The Open Library further came under criticism from several groups representing writers and publishers when it created the National Emergency Library in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The National Emergency Library removed the waitlists of all books in its Open Library collection and allowed any number of digital copies of a book to be downloaded as an encrypted file that would be unusable after two weeks, asserting that this unlimited borrowing was a reasonable exception under the national emergency to allow educational functions to continue since physical libraries and bookstores were forced to be shuttered. The Authors Guild, the Association of American Publishers, the National Writers Union, and others argued that this allowed unlimited copyright infringement and denied revenues from distribution of authorized digital copies of books to authors who also needed relief during the COVID-19 national emergency. Though the Open Library asserted that the copies of entire books in ebook format were still encrypted and the unlimited borrowing was for educational purposes, the National Writers Union asserted that images of each page of each book could still be accessed on the Web without encryption or other controls. Four major publishers‚ÄîHachette, Penguin Random House, John Wiley & Sons, and HarperCollins, all members of the Association of American Publishers‚Äîfiled a lawsuit in the Southern New York Federal District Court against the Internet Archive in June 2020, asserting the Open Library project violated numerous copyrights. In their suit, the publishers claimed \\"Without any license or any payment to authors or publishers, [the Internet Archive] scans print books, uploads these illegally scanned books to its servers, and distributes verbatim digital copies of the books in whole via public-facing websites. With just a few clicks, any Internet-connected user can download complete digital copies of in-copyright books from [the] defendant.\\" The publishers are represented by the law firms Davis Wright Tremaine and Oppenheim + Zebrak. In wake of the lawsuit, the Internet Archive ended the National Emergency Library on June 16, 2020 instead of the intended June 30 date, and requested the publishers to \\"call off their costly assault\\".

History Hampton Loade station opened as part of the Severn Valley Line on 1 February 1862, appearing as 'Hampton' in the public timetable. It was originally built with one platform and siding; a passing- loop and second platform being added in 1883. There was also a weighbridge located on the river side of the site at one point. The station is actually on the west side of the River Severn in the hamlet of Hampton but was renamed within a month of opening after Hampton Loade, the larger hamlet on the eastern side of the river. Due to the presence of Hampton Loade station in Hampton most residents now refer to their hamlet as Hampton Loade. Most of the local passenger traffic came from the eastern side of the river using the current operated foot reaction ferry to get to the station. The station was always popular with anglers due to the easy access to the river. The station was host to a GWR camp coach in 1939. Although closed by British Rail during the implementation of the Beeching Axe in 1963, plans for its closure had already been made before Beeching's report was published. Following closure all signalling equipment was removed from Hampton Loade, and the signal box was almost completely demolished after purchase from BR by the residents of Station House for use as a chicken coop. Preservation From 1970 to 1974, Hampton Loade was the southern terminus of the SVR, just 4¬Ω miles from Bridgnorth. Although at the time the SVR was said to go from \\"somewhere\\" to \\"nowhere\\" the terminus was a quaint and peaceful place to end services. When preservationists first arrived at Hampton Loade from Bridgnorth, signalling was reinstated as a priority during the early days, mainly using equipment from the closed Stourport-on-Severn station. A legacy of Hampton Loade's former guise as the SVR's southern terminus is the now rarely used down starting signal No. 13 at the north end of the up loop. The platforms at Hampton Loade can only accommodate around four coaches at a time, this or less being the norm in GWR and BR days. As the SVR's trains are longer than this plans have been mooted to extend the platforms. The current Station Master is Lee Whittaker and the Assistant Station Master position is currently vacant. Retired railwayman Fred Hughes is Chief Booking Clerk. The station is operated entirely by a volunteer workforce. There are a number of items of rolling stock in the sidings at Hampton Loade. These include British Railways built no. 3467; a 'fruit D' goods van designed by the GWR and built at Swindon in 1955. It is owned by the Hampton Loade Station Fund and is in use as the station fund shop, known on the SVR as a 'treasure trove' for railwayana and books. It is currently painted in GWR freight grey and lettered with the words 'return to Helston'. It later had a number of W3467W and was preserved in 1973.http://www.cs.vintagecarriagestrust.org/se/CarriageInfo.asp?Ref=181 The oldest carriage on the line, the ex-GWR Churchward third coach 2426 of 1910, was used for staff accommodation at Hampton Loade for 28 years before being moved to Kidderminster in September 2016 for overhaul.SVR Official Facebook page Retrieved 27 October 2016 Its place has been taken by GWR Riding Van 55 built in 1908. The station takes part in the annual SVR's 1940s weekends, held over a week with two weekends in June/July. The weekends are a light-hearted look back at the 1940s and also underline the important part Britain's railways played in the Second World War. For this event the station has a 'Dig for Victory' allotment, Bren gun, an ARP warden's post, unexploded bombs, R.T.O. Office and several period vehicles along with a standard 'blast tape and sandbags' appearance. Since being reopened in SVR preservation the station has also become home to several relocated corrugated huts of typical GWR design. These being a lamp room from Cleobury Mortimer, a larger hut from Bearley and another from Kingham. All are painted in the GWR Stone colours. Also on the down platform is a larger hut original to the station, being installed by the GWR at sometime in the 1920s. Signalling Hampton Loade signal box controls three points, two distant signals, three starter signals, three home signals, and a set of catch points with related \\"Dummy\\" signal. Two of the points are located at either end of the station, controlling the exits to the loop, the third set of points controls the entrance to the siding, and are protected by the \\"Dummy\\" signal and its catch points. There are starter signals on the end of the down and up platforms, as well as an extra starter signal on the Brignorth end of the up platform which permits down trains starting at Hampton Loade to be despatched from the up platform. The home signals are located just before the loop entrance points that they protect, in the up direction a bracket carries two homes controlling entrance to the loop and main line, in the down direction a single home controls entry to the main line. In both directions working distant signals protect the homes. The Paddock Garden Railway The station is also the home of the 32mm Paddock Garden railway, which celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 2013. Barry Railway Coach No163 Hampton Loade remains the home of Barry Railway coach 163 undergoing restoration for over two decades. An 1895 6-wheel, 5 compartment first and second class composite built at Ashburys in Manchester, it was scrapped at Swindon on Saturday 24 November 1928, (at that time the Great Western Railway would write off its account assets on Saturdays). The body went to the Clent Hills near Birmingham becoming a holiday home, where it remained until 1992. Re-wheeled onto a 4-wheel ex-Southern Railway Van C underframe on 16 August 2003 some 75 years after being scrapped, it has been in the final stages of restoration back to its opulent Barry Railway condition for several years. Down platform looking towards Highley Film and television The station has been used as the filming location for many films and TV programmes, including The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain,Stills on ReelStreets.com Retrieved 29 October 2016 Mad Dogs and a 1970s serial.

A passenger steam train 608 at speed 55 km/h abreast collided with a diesel railcar 653 at speed 60 km/h. 118 people died as a result of the accident and 110 were injured badly.  Trains  Train 608 drove from Liberec via Hradec Kr√°lov√© to Pardubice. It was hauled by the steam locomotive type 354.7128 from the engine house Hradec Kr√°lov√© and operated by the train driver and an assistant/fireman. Behind the locomotive, were post car type F 9-2236, freight car type Ztr 1-36700, personal car Bi 3-3323, service car Dd 7-2286 and eight more personal cars. The train crew was composed of a head guard, senior conductor, junior conductor, and train attendant. Train 653 drove from Pardubice to the Hradec Kr√°lov√© at distance 22 kilometers. It was composed of the diesel railcar M 131.1272, four personal cars (Blm 5-2338, Blm 5-2333, BDlm 6-6890, BDlm 6-6899) and another diesel railcar M 131.1327 at the train's end. The machine crew was composed of two train drivers accompanied by the head guard and conductor. According to the train diagram, both trains should have passed in the St√©blov√° station, which has three tracks. At that time, the station was secured by the mechanical equipment with central interlock and mechanical signals in both directions.  Disaster course  = Events before disaster = Train 653 left Pardubice at 17:22, one minute behind schedule. Train 608 left Hradec Kr√°lov√© at 17:25, seven minutes behind schedule. The St√©blov√° station dispatcher set the route for train 608 to track number 1 and assigned train 653 to track number 2; this was the reverse of what was usually done. Train 608 arrived at St√©blov√° station at 17:40. The station dispatcher left the office, but after a while he returned to set the route for train 653. The switchman went away to operate switch number 4 to set up for the future departure of the train 653, and also to lift the crossing gates after train 608 passed through. Meanwhile, the station dispatcher confirmed by telephone with ƒåeperka (the station from which train 608 arrived) that the track was empty, and then set the route for the train 653 arrival. What happened next was never clearly explained. The weather was very foggy, with visibility limited to 50 meters. The senior conductor and junior conductors both got down from the train. The senior conductor supposedly saw a green light close to the station office, which would have meant \\"permission to depart\\". He informed the junior conductor that he had seen the signal and shouted \\"Get on, [station dispatcher] gives departure\\"; he asserted later that he saw only the flash of green light. Because of the fog, he was not able to identify the source of the light. It could not have been the station dispatcher, as he was in his office at the time. Though the junior conductor personally did not see the green light, he passed the signal to the locomotive. The head guard also accepted the existence of the green light, although he had not seen it. Some passengers later stated that they also might have seen such a light, but were not absolutely sure. The source of the green light (if it existed at all) was never determined. The most likely possibility would have been a junior conductor's lantern, as they were equipped with filters in multiple colors, including green. The train driver (although he did not see the green light) called \\"departure\\" and started the train. Just at the moment the train passed the signal, the fireman was putting coal into firebox and discovered the water level was low, so he did not notice that the signal was in the \\"stop\\" position, even though checking the signals was part of his duty. Moreover, the head guard likewise overlooked that \\"stop\\" signal. Indeed, as he later mentioned, he remembered that train 608 normally passed train 653 at St√©blov√° station, but he assumed the passing had been moved to the next station. When the station dispatcher saw that the train had started to move, he rushed out of his office and used a lantern and two whistles to signal \\"stop by any possible means\\". The duty of the senior conductor during departure was to observe signals coming from the station, but he had already begun to check tickets. One of the switchmen jumped on a bicycle and unsuccessfully attempted to catch up with the train. The station dispatcher tried to call a signal box two kilometers away to ask the staff there to stop train 653. However, the signalman had left the box to watch the arriving train 653 and only picked up the phone after the train had passed. Meanwhile, the switchman from the signal box in St√©blov√° informed the station dispatcher that train 608 had just passed him, leaving the station area. = Collision = The collision between trains 608 and 653 happened on kilometer 8.055 at 17:42 (some sources says at 17:44). The speed of the steam train 608 was about 55 km/h, train 653 about 60 km/h. Both drivers braked, but it was too late. The train 608 driver and fireman survived almost unhurt, because the locomotive's construction, especially its long boiler, saved them. The first car (mail) was seriously damaged and derailed. The next car (freight) collided with and demolished the mail car in front of it. The third car (first passenger) was almost totally demolished by the fourth (service) car. The fifth car ran up on the fourth from behind. The remaining seven cars sustained little or no damage. Train 653 experienced much worse damage. Its first railcar was lifted on top of the forward part of train 608's steam locomotive. The first passenger car crashed into the locomotive's side, and next three passenger cars collided with it and were totally crushed. The rearmost railcar cut loose and stayed on the track. In order to prevent a boiler explosion, the steam machine driver and fireman dumped their firebox on the ground. The hot coals and ashes ignited diesel fuel leaking from the first railcar, and the train burst into flame. = Rescue operation = The rescue operation started at around 18:00, with the help of medical teams from Pardubice and Hradec Kr√°lov√©, members of police (then called Public Security), soldiers from the nearby military school and local citizens. The field first aid post was set up, ambulances transported the injured to hospitals in Pardubice and Hradec Kr√°lov√© and the operations were run even in maternity home. Special trains equipped with cranes were sent to the place of disaster to deal with the wreckage. Most survivors were rescued before 20:00. The last survivor was found under the wreckage at around 23:00, but died during transportation. Wreckage of disaster and the debris was removed on the next day, 15 November 1960 at around 11:30. At 12:30 the first scheduled train went through. During the cleanup, 5 fast, 21 passenger, and 21 freight trains were cancelled. The total account was 118 dead and 110 seriously injured (according to some sources 110 and 106). It was impossible to identify some of the victims and three bodies were not found. The total damage was around 477.000 Kƒçs (Czechoslovak crowns ‚Äì country average month income was 1,303 Kƒçs in 1960).  Aftermath  = Court trial = The disaster clarifying begun immediately in the night. The government investigation commission was created, which published the final report on 30 November 1960. In general, it stated flagrant violation of railway transportation elementary rules. The trials took place at the Regional Court in Hradec Kr√°lov√© from 8 to 11 February 1961. The verdict of the train 608 crew was: * train head ‚Äì 5.5 years imprisonment * train driver ‚Äì 4.5 years imprisonment (released after 3 years) * senior conductor ‚Äì 4 years imprisonment * assistant/fireman ‚Äì 1.5 year imprisonment * junior conductor ‚Äì 1-year suspended * train attendant ‚Äì acquitted All those convicted were also forbidden from the profession for several years. = Publicity = The official bulletin was issued on 15 November 1960 by Czechoslovak Press Agency, which was printed by the Rud√© Pr√°vo (Communist Party of the Czechoslovakia central newspaper) next day. The bulletin published the number of victims, mentioned politicians who visited the disaster place and informed about the creation of a government investigation commission. The commission report was published in Rud√© Pr√°vo on 14 February 1961, with information about trial which concluded the previous day. = Memorial = thumb A cross was erected on the place of disaster; it was replaced about 80 meters away in 1967 and enclosed by low grille fence. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the disaster in 2000, a memorial ceremony was held in which the municipal office in St√©blov√° replaced the cross (at that time considerably dilapidated and rusty) by a black granite plaque with an appropriate inscription, inserted into the modified area.

Kodandarami Reddy starring Chiranjeevi, Vijayashanti and Radha in key roles. Upon release, the film received positive reviews, and emerged as a Blockbuster at the box office. Subsequently, the film was dubbed into Tamil as Thangamalai Thirudan. The technically brilliant film was the first Telugu film to be released on a 70 mm with 6-Track Stereophonic sound. The production design by Bhaskar Raju, with background score, and music by Ilaiyaraaja received positive reviews. The film had collected a distributors share of 7.4 million on its opening weekend. Plot An orphan Kondaveeti Raja M.A.,L.L.B.,I.A.S. (Chiranjeevi) is raised through the support of people living in the tribal village of Kondaveedu. Upon his return from Hyderabad, he witnesses the failed legal system and the village being engulfed in political corruption, forgery, smuggling, money laundering, drug trafficking, land grabbing and alcohol abuse carried out by the local mafia and landlords (Sarabhoji (Rao Gopal Rao), Narasimham (Mohan Babu) and Khaadra (Amrish Puri)), who impose taxes on farmers. Instead of being in the system and taking the direct route as an administrator himself, he transforms into a Robin Hood for the village and indulges in swashbuckling heists of money and paddy worth several crores from the landlords while being in disguise, much to the frustration of corrupt officials. He funds the tribals into self-sustaining farmers, while providing food, irrigation, healthcare, shelter and education to the poor and transforms the village. Cast *Chiranjeevi as Kondaveeti Raja, a man raised by the tribals. He becomes Kondaveeti Donga (like Robin Hood) to fight the evil. *Vijayashanti as Sri Lekha, an undercover police officer appointed to capture Kondaveeti Donga, who later becomes Raja's love interest. *Radha Sri Kanya, a home surgeon serving in the tribal area of Kondaveedu.

All songs remain popular to date. Except Chamaku Chamaku song all songs written by Veturi. Chamaku Chamaku is written by Sirivennela, the same can be seen in the titles of movie and Sirivennela Tarangaalu book too. =Telugu (original soundtrack)=  Reception  Giddaluri Gopalrao of Zamin Ryot, writing his review on 23 March 1990, gave a positive review for the film. Gopalrao praised the screenplay by Yandamuri and Chiranjeevi's performance however criticized the weak story by Paruchuri brothers.

In a career that lasted just over three months in the spring and summer of 1993 he won five of his six races, most notably the Derby at Epsom and the Irish Derby at the Curragh. He was the first Derby winner since Morston in 1973 not to have raced as a two-year-old. Furthermore, the Racing Post had not even included him in their list of horses for the 1993 Ten-to-Follow on the flat competition. Commander in Chief was voted the 1993 Cartier Champion Three-year-old Colt. Background Commander in Chief was a dark bay colt (officially \\"bay or brown\\") with a white snip, bred by his owner's Juddmonte Farms breeding organisation. He was sired by Dancing Brave out of Slightly Dangerous. Dancing Brave was the most highly rated British racehorse of the 1980s winning a series of major races culminating in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. At stud, he was a modest success, siring the Group One winners White Muzzle, Wemyss Bight and Cherokee Rose before being sold and exported to Japan in 1991. Slightly Dangerous finished second in the 1982 Epsom Oaks and went on to be an outstanding broodmare, producing the Group One/Grade I winners Warning and Yashmak as well as the Epsom Derby runner-up Dushyantor. Commander in Chief was trained for all his starts by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was ridden in all of his races other than the Derby by the eleven times Champion Jockey Pat Eddery. Racing career =Early races= Commander in Chief did not run as a two-year-old and made his debut in April 1993 in a ten furlong maiden race at the Newmarket Craven meeting. Starting the even money favourite he took the lead a furlong from the finish and drew away from the rest of the field, winning by six lengths despite being eased down in the closing stages. Eighteen days late he returned to Newmarket for the twelve furlong Culford Stakes. On this occasion he started 2/5 favourite and won by three and a half lengths from Oakmead and Blue Judge. On the 13 May he completed his hat-trick in the Glasgow Stakes at York, but in this race he was less impressive: Eddery attempted to make all the running on the 2/9 favourite, and he had to be pushed out in the closing stages to win by a neck from Needle Gun. =Epsom Derby= Commander in Chief went into the 1993 Epsom Derby on 2 June as an unbeaten horse, but one who had never contested a Group Race. He was the youngest of the sixteen runners in a race which attracted a crowd of 106,000. In the build-up to the race he had been overshadowed by his stable companion Tenby. Owned like Commander in Chief by Khalid Abdullah and also unbeaten, Tenby's successes had come in more high- profile races such as the Grand Crit√©rium and the Dante Stakes and he was made 4/5 favourite. He was the preferred ride of Pat Eddery, leaving the ride on Commander in Chief to Mick Kinane. Commander in Chief who started 15/2 second favourite, was held up in the early stages and turned into the straight in sixth place. He then made rapid progress to take the lead two furlongs out and quickly went clear. He was never in any danger and won very easily by three and a half lengths from the 150/1 outsiders Blue Judge and Blues Traveller. Tenby, who had been in second place at one point, weakened badly in the straight and finished tenth. =After Epsom= On 27 June Commander in Chief traveled to the Curragh for the Irish Derby. The build-up and betting suggested that the race would effectively be a match between Commander in Chief (4/7 favourite) and the French-trained Hernando, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club who started at 9/4. The two colts duly came to the front two furlongs out and raced together throughout the closing stages. The English colt however, proved the superior horse on the day and won by three quarters of a length. After the race Eddery said that the winner was comparable to \\"all the good ones I've ridden\\", while Cecil described him as \\"a late maturing sort\\" for whom \\"the best is yet to come\\". On 24 July, Commander in Chief, now undefeated in five races, started 7/4 favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, in which he took on older horses for the first time. His main rivals included the 1992 European Horse of the Year User Friendly, the five-year-old Opera House who had recently won the Eclipse Stakes and White Muzzle a three-year-old who had won his last five races including the Derby Italiano. Commander in Chief raced prominently and took the lead in the straight, but in the closing stages he was overtaken and beaten one and a half lengths and a short head by Opera House and White Muzzle. Commander in Chief did not race again, and in October it was announced that he had been sold to stand as a stallion in Japan. Assessment and honours In the 1993 Cartier Racing Awards, Commander in Chief was voted European Three-Year-Old Champion Colt. In the official International Classification for 1993 he was rated on 127, equal with White Muzzle and three pounds below the top-rated three-year-old Zafonic. Commander in Chief was rated at 130 for his Derby win by Timeform. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Commander in Chief as an \\"inferior\\" Derby winner. Stud career Commander in Chief was the leading first-season sire in Japan in 1997. His best offspring included Rascal Suzuka, who finished second in the 2000 Spring Tenno Sho, and Ein Bride, the Japanese champion two-year-old filly. He died at the Yushun Stallion Station in Japan in 2007 after fracturing his leg in a paddock accident.

Control was intensively studied in the government and binding framework in the 1980s, and much of the terminology from that era is still used today.See for instance van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:128ff.), Cowper (1992:161ff.), Borsley (1996:126-144). In the days of Transformational Grammar, control phenomena were discussed in terms of Equi-NP deletion.Concerning the designation Equi-NP deletion for control structures, see for instance Bach (1974:116f.), Emonds (1976:193f. note 15), Culicover (1982:250). Control is often analyzed in terms of a null pronoun called PRO. Control is also related to raising, although there are important differences between control and raising. Most if not all languages have control constructions and these constructions tend to occur frequently. Examples Standard instances of (obligatory) control are present in the following sentences: ::Susan promised us to help. \\\\- Subject control with the obligatory control predicate promise ::Fred stopped laughing. \\\\- Subject control with the obligatory control predicate stop ::We tried to leave. \\\\- Subject control with the obligatory control predicate try ::Sue asked Bill to stop. \\\\- Object control with the obligatory control predicate ask ::They told you to support the effort. \\\\- Object control with the obligatory control predicate tell ::Someone forced him to do it. \\\\- Object control with the obligatory control predicate force Each of these sentences contains two verbal predicates. Each time the control verb is on the left, and the verb whose arguments are controlled is on the right. The control verb determines which expression is interpreted as the subject of the verb on the right. The first three sentences are examples of subject control, since the subject of the control verb is also the understood subject of the subordinate verb. The second three examples are instances of object control, because the object of the control verb is understood as the subject of the subordinate verb. The argument of the matrix predicate that functions as the subject of the embedded predicate is the controller. The controllers are in bold in the examples. Control verbs vs. auxiliary verbs Control verbs have semantic content; they semantically select their arguments, that is, their appearance strongly influences the nature of the arguments they take.Accounts of control emphasize that control verbs semantically select their dependents, as opposed to raising predicates, which do not select one of their dependents. See for instance van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:130), Borsley (1996:133), Culicover (1997:102). In this regard, they are very different from auxiliary verbs, which lack semantic content and do not semantically select arguments. Compare the following pairs of sentences: ::a. Sam will go. \\\\- will is an auxiliary verb. ::b. Sam yearns to go. \\\\- yearns is a subject control verb. ::a. Jim has to do it. \\\\- has to is a modal auxiliary verb. ::b. Jim refuses to do it. \\\\- refuses is a subject control verb. ::a. Jill would lie and cheat. \\\\- would is a modal auxiliary. ::b. Jill attempted to lie and cheat. \\\\- attempted is a subject control verb. The a-sentences contain auxiliary verbs that do not select the subject argument. What this means is that the embedded verbs go, do, and lie and cheat are responsible for semantically selecting the subject argument. The point is that while control verbs may have the same outward appearance as auxiliary verbs, the two verb types are quite different. Non-obligatory or optional control Control verbs (such as promise, stop, try, ask, tell, force, yearn, refuse, attempt) obligatorily induce a control construction. That is, when control verbs appear, they inherently determine which of their arguments controls the embedded predicate. Control is hence obligatorily present with these verbs. In contrast, the arguments of many verbs can be controlled even when a superordinate control verb is absent, e.g. ::He left, singing all the way. \\\\- Non-obligatory control of the present participle singing :: Understanding nothing, the class protested. \\\\- Non-obligatory control of the present participle understanding :: Holding his breath too long, Fred passed out. \\\\- Non-obligatory control of the present participle holding In one sense, control is obligatory in these sentences because the arguments of the present participles singing, understanding, and holding are clearly controlled by the matrix subjects. In another sense, however, control is non-obligatory (or optional) because there is no control predicate present that necessitates that control occur.See van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:137) and Haegeman (1994:277) concerning non-obligatory/optional control. General contextual factors are determining which expression is understood as the controller. The controller is the subject in these sentences because the subject establishes point of view. Arbitrary control Arbitrary control occurs when the controller is understood to be anybody in general, e.g.Arbitrary control is discussed for instance by van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:137f.), Cowper 1992:162), Culicover (1997:75-76), Carnie (207:285ff.). ::Reading the Dead Sea Scrolls is fun. \\\\- Arbitrary control of the gerund reading. ::Seeing is believing. \\\\- Arbitrary control of the gerunds seeing and believing ::Having to do something repeatedly is boring. \\\\- Arbitrary control of the gerund having The understood subject of the gerunds in these sentence is non- discriminate; any generic person will do. In such cases, control is said to be \\"arbitrary\\". Any time the understood subject of a given predicate is not present in the linguistic or situational context, a generic subject (e.g. 'one') is understood. Representing control Theoretical linguistics posits the existence of the null pronoun PRO as the theoretical basis for the analysis of control structures. The null pronoun PRO is an element that impacts a sentence in a similar manner to how a normal pronoun impacts a sentence, but the null pronoun is inaudible.For accounts of PRO, see for instance van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:132ff.), Cowper (1992:157ff.), Haegeman (1994:257ff.), Culicover (1997:75-77), Carnie (2007:395ff.). The null PRO is added to the predicate, where it occupies the position that one would typically associate with an overt subject (if one were present). The following trees illustrate PRO in both constituency-based structures of phrase structure grammars and dependency-based structures of dependency grammars:The constituency trees shown here are similar to those that were widely produced in the 1970s, e.g. Bach (1974). The dependency trees here are similar to those that are produced by Osborne and Gro√ü (2012). ::Control trees. ::Control trees 2 The constituency-based trees are the a-trees on the left, and the dependency-based trees the b-trees on the right. Certainly aspects of these trees - especially of the constituency trees - can be disputed. In the current context, the trees are intended merely to suggest by way of illustration how control and PRO are conceived of. The indices are a common means of identifying PRO and with its antecedent in the control predicate, and the orange arrows indicate further the control relation. In a sense, the controller assigns its index to PRO, which identifies the argument that is understood as the subject of the subordinate predicate. A (constituency-based) X-bar theoretic tree that is consistent with the standard GB-type analysis is given next:Numerous GB trees like the one here can be found in, for instance, Haegeman (1994). ::Syntactic tree The details of this tree are, again, not so important. What is important is that by positing the existence of the null subject PRO, the theoretical analysis of control constructions gains a useful tool that can help uncover important traits of control constructions. Control vs. raising Control must be distinguished from raising, though the two can be outwardly similar.Concerning the difference between control and raising, see Bach (1974:149), Culicover (1997:102), Carnie (2007:403ff.). Control predicates semantically select their arguments, as stated above. Raising predicates, in contrast, do not semantically select (at least) one of their dependents. The contrast is evident with the so-called raising-to-object verbs (=ECM-verbs) such as believe, expect, want, and prove. Compare the following a- and b-sentences: ::a. Fred asked you to read it. \\\\- asked is an object control verb. ::b. Fred expects you to read it. \\\\- expects is a raising-to-object verb. ::a. Jim forced her to say it. \\\\- forced is an object control verb. ::b. Jim believed her to have said it. \\\\- believes is a raising- to-object verb. The control predicates ask and force semantically select their object arguments, whereas the raising-to-object verbs do not. Instead, the object of the raising verb appears to have \\"risen\\" from the subject position of the embedded predicate, in this case from the embedded predicates to read and to have said. In other words, the embedded predicate is semantically selecting the argument of the matrix predicate. What this means is that while a raising-to-object verb takes an object dependent, that dependent is not a semantic argument of that raising verb. The distinction becomes apparent when one considers that a control predicate like ask requires its object to be an animate entity, whereas a raising-to-object predicate like expects places no semantic limitations on its object dependent. = Diagnostic Tests =  Expletives  The different predicate types can be identified using expletive there.The expletive is widely employed to distinguish control from raising constructions. See for instance Grinder and Elgin (1973:142-143), Bach (1973:151), McCawley (1988:121), Borsley (1996:127), Culicover (1997:102), Saito (1999:8-9). Expletive there can appear as the \\"object\\" of a raising-to- object predicate, but not of a control verb, e.g. ::a. *Fred asked there to be a party. \\\\- Expletive there cannot appear as the object of a control predicate. ::b. Fred expects there to be a party. \\\\- Expletive there can appear as the object of a raising-to-object predicate. ::a. *Jim forced there to be a party. \\\\- Expletive there cannot appear as the object of a control predicate. ::b. Jim believes there to have been a party. \\\\- Expletive there can appear as the object of a raising-to-object predicate. The control predicates cannot take expletive there because there does not fulfill the semantic requirements of the control predicates. Since the raising-to-object predicates do not select their objects, they can easily take expletive there.  Idioms  Control and raising also differ in how they behave with idiomatic expressions.Many syntax books discuss the way idioms are used to diagnose control and raising constructions. See Carnie (2007), Davies & Dubinsky (2008). Idiomatic expressions retain their meaning in a raising construction, but they lose it when they are arguments of a control verb. See the examples below featuring the idiom \\"The cat is out of the bag\\", which has the meaning that facts that were previously hidden are now revealed. ::a. The cat wants to be out of the bag. \\\\- There is no possible idiomatic interpretation in the control construction. ::b. The cat seems to be out of the bag. \\\\- The idiomatic interpretation is retained in the raising construction. The explanation for this fact is that raising predicates do not semantically select their arguments, and therefore their arguments are not interpreted compositionally, as the subject or object of the raising predicate. Arguments of the control predicate, on the other hand, have to fulfill their semantic requirements, and interpreted as the argument of the predicate compositionally. This test works for object control and ECM too. :a. I asked the cat to be out of the bag. \\\\- There is no possible idiomatic interpretation in the control construction. :b. I believe the cat to be out of the bag. \\\\- The idiomatic interpretation is retained in the raising construction.

In the series of crime novels featuring him one can isolate a subset of novels each set in a different quarter (arrondissement) of Paris which Malet dubbed the \\"New Mysteries of Paris\\", alluding to Eugene Sue's The Mysteries of Paris (1842‚Äì43). Burma is a hardboiled private detective, in the mold of American characters such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe but decidedly more humorous. He works with a secretary, H√©l√®ne, who is hopelessly infatuated with Nestor, in what he calls the \\"Fiat Lux Agency\\". Burma's nemeses are typically just as much the police investigating the crime as they are the original perpetrators. Specifically, he often matches wits with Commissaire Faroux and Inspector Fabre. The novels have been adapted numerous times, most notably a television series starring Guy Marchand, which began in 1991. A series of graphic novels by artist Jacques Tardi have also been published to great critical acclaim. The third in this series was an original story by Tardi.

Its headquarters are in Riga. It is owned by Estonian Margus Linnam√§e through his Eesti Meedia group.  History  It was founded as Latopress in 1919, soon after Latvia became independent; the name was changed to LTA the next year when the wire service was subordinated to the Latvian Telegraph Agency. The name LETA was only used occasionally during the interwar period. In 1940, when Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union, it became a subordinate agency of the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS), a status it would keep until Latvia regained independence in 1991. During the occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany, LETA was subordinated to the German DNB news agency. From 1971 it was known as Latinform. On 31 May 1990, the Latvian government restored the name LETA and the news agency's independence from TASS. In 1997, LETA was put up for privatisation by the Latvian state. On 27 April 2011, the LETA website was defaced by an unknown hacker who claimed to be protesting commercially biased news sources.

In Iberia during the Reconquista from Muslim rule, new towns were founded and to entice settlers, they were offered the status of vecinos, prominent and respected residents and citizens. In colonial Mexico in the immediate conquest era, only encomenderos, those holding grants of the labor and tribute of particular Indian communities, were granted the title of vecino.Lockhart, James and Schwartz, Stuart. Early Latin America. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983, p. 96. As Spanish cities were founded in New Spain, vecinos could petition the municipal council cabildo for a grant of land in the municipality to build a house and land outside the municipality to pursue economic activity. As the number of Spanish households increased, the term vecino expanded to mean male head of household and neighbor, and came to mean being a member of Spanish colonial society.Altman, Ida, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador. The Early History of Greater Mexico. Prentice Hall 1993, pp. 34, 163, 182, 263. The word vecindad can also refer to a person's legal residence, in terms of a city, province, or state, not just a neighborhood. In Guatemala, there's a national ID referred to as carnet de vecindad, not mattering the actual \\"neighborhood\\" but giving the person a legal document saying they are from that country. In parts of for a building containing several (often low-income oriented) housing units. It was originally a form of housing created from a residential subdivision of vacated elite housing in historic centers in Mexican cities, where rooms around a central patio were let to families who shared facilities (such as lavatories and/or kitchens) with the other tenants. Purpose-built vecindades were constructed in the early 20th century to meet the demand for central low- income housing and resembled the original vecindades by having small units and shared facilities. The term is now used ambiguously.Baldoqu√≠n, Natal√≠ Collado, and Mabel Matamoros Tuma. \\"Las casas de vecindad. Or√≠genes, desarrollo y problemas actuales.\\" Arquitectura y Urbanismo 36.3 (2015): 104-115. In some Latin American countries the \\"vecindades\\" are called \\"conventillos\\". The word is a derogative from \\"convento\\": cloister. The name comes from the similarity of the spatial distribution of the buildings: covered living spaces around an open court or \\"patio\\". Important is the inherent social tissue of the \\"vecindad/conventillo\\". The dwellers form a complex communal unit with a varied array of social interrelationships. The outside world, very often, considers the inhabitants of a \\"vecindad\\" as a group of slum people and project on them their prejudices against the lower classes. In the modern era, the idea of vecindad is debated in the European Union.Llorente, Mercedes Guinea. \\"La Pol√≠tica Europea de Vecindad y la estabilizaci√≥n del entorno pr√≥ximo: el caso de Europa Oriental.\\" Revista de Derecho Comunitario Europeo 12.31 (2008): 805-831.

DC's Weird Western Tales appeared in the early 1970s and the weird Western was further popularized by Joe R. Lansdale who is perhaps best known for his tales of the 'weird west,' a genre mixing splatterpunk with alternate history Western. Examples of these cross-genres include Deadlands (Western/horror), The Wild Wild West and its later film adaptation (Western/steampunk), Jonah Hex (Western/supernatural), BraveStarr (Western/science fiction), The Goodbye Family (Gothic Western/macabre comedy), and many others. Background When supernatural menaces of horror fiction are injected into a Western setting, it creates the horror Western. Writer G.W. Thomas has described how the two combine: \\"Unlike many other cross-genre tales, the weird Western uses both elements but with very little loss of distinction. The Western setting is decidedly 'Western' and the horror elements are obviously 'horror.'\\"Crossing Horror: Using Horror in Other Genres, by G.W. Thomas Jeff Mariotte's comic book series Desperadoes has been running, off and on, for a decade now and he still remains bullish about the genre:How the West was Weird: Mariotte talks ‚ÄúDesperadoes‚Äù Return, Comic Book Resources, October 30, 2006 > As far as Mariotte is concerned, the potential for Weird West stories is > limitless. \\"The West was a weird place. There are ghost towns and haunted > mines and when you bring Native American beliefs into it, then the > possibilities are even greater.\\" Examples =Books= The term is of recent coinage, but the idea of crossing genres goes back to at least the heyday of pulp magazines. There was at least one series character who could be classified as a Weird West character. Lee Winters was a deputy whose adventures often involved ghosts, sorcery and creatures from Greek mythology. The Winters stories were written by Lon Williams and published in the 1950s. Around that same time, one of the oddest of all Western characters, Six-Gun Gorilla, appeared. This was an actual gorilla who strapped on a pair of Colts to avenge the death of the kindly prospector who had raised him. His adventures appeared in the British story paper The Wizard. There have also been various Weird West novels including Joe R. Lansdale's Dead in the West. In this book an unjustly lynched Indian shaman curses the town of Mud Creek, Texas. After dark the dead rise and not even the Reverend Jebediah Mercer can save the inhabitants. Examples include: * \\"The Horror from the Mound\\" (by Robert E.

Set in an alternate 1870s America, the game draws heavily on gothic horror conventions and old Native American lore to derive its sense of the supernatural. Characters can get involved in situations ranging from banks heists to shoot-outs involving vampires and zombies over the course of their adventures. Another example is the White Wolf Game Studio production, Werewolf: The Wild West, in which players play werewolf characters (called garou) who are charged with fighting a force of spiritual corruption called the Storm-Eater. Video games also use this same motif, one of the earliest horror-Western games being SilverLoad for the PlayStation. The game has a variety of classic horror tropes in it, ranging from werewolves and vampires, to Satanic cults, that the player must contend with nothing more than a trusty six-gun at his hip. In this same vein is the modern PS2/Xbox first-person shooter, Darkwatch, in which the protagonist is himself a vampire, fighting through the west for either his own redemption, or furthering his own damnation. The PC adventure/puzzle game Alone in the Dark 3 takes place in a western setting, albeit in the 1920s, and features a number of \\"weird west\\" staples, with magic, monsters, the undead, and some anachronistic sci-fi elements such as references to nuclear weaponry. The PC first-person shooter title, Blood, is an occult-horror-comedy hybrid, and sets the player avatar \\"Caleb\\" in approximately 1920 (retroactively dated as 1928 in the game's sequel) as an un-dead gunslinger anti-hero from the late 19th century, who rises from his grave to battle a widespread cult by which he was betrayed and killed when he was a member. Gun play, the undead, horror, the occult, and the underworld are strong elements of the game. The game spawned a sequel, Blood II: The Chosen, although it was much less influenced by the main character's western back-story. One level of its expansion pack, however, is set in a western frontier town. Another weird western is the Wild ARMs series ‚Äì video games that mix together high-fantasy magic and science- fiction technology with Old-West-style gunslinging. Each game changes leads and alters settings (though the world's name, Filgaia, remains throughout), but always at the core are the ideas of \\"drifting\\" and of one's personalized sense of justice among outlaws. Red Dead Redemption, a Western-themed video game, enters into the genre of Weird West with its Undead Nightmare add-on. The story revolves around an undead outbreak that has spread across the frontier. Other fantasy elements are new weapons such as holy water, and new mythical mounts, which include a unicorn and the Four Horses of the Apocalypse. Its sequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, features a number of minor Easter eggs which the player may discover, such as UFOs and the remains of a giant hominid. Fallout: New Vegas, a post-apocalyptic game set in the Mojave Desert has an additional perk at the beginning of the game named \\"Wild Wasteland\\" that adds various strange occurrences to the game. The game itself could also be considered a Weird West game due to its mixing of Western, Horror, Survival, and Science Fiction styles. Call of Duty: Black Ops II includes a map for its Zombies mode called Buried. The map takes place in a subterranean ghost town complete with saloon and general store that is located in Angola due to tectonic plate shifting. Naturally, the zombies are the reanimated town folk, dressed in period attire. Hard West, turn-based tactical game. The game follows standards of the Western genre, like bank robberies, lynching and the gold rush, but with the addition of supernatural elements, such as demons, shamans, satanic cults. West of Loathing, a single-player comedy/adventure RPG, takes place about twenty years after \\"The Cows Came Home\\", a mysterious cataclysmic event that caused all cows to transform into demonic monsters, devastating the west. The player character must help with the completion of a transcontinental railroad that will make travel faster and safer for would-be settlers. This involves navigating a variety of obstacles including the aforementioned demonic cows, as well as giant snakes, necromantic cultists, literal ghost towns, murderous rodeo clowns, goblins, malfunctioning robots left behind by a long-dead civilization, and occasionally ordinary bandits. Eternal is an online collectible card game that takes place in a world filled with gunslingers and witches. Weird West is an upcoming action role-playing game that borrowed directly from the Weird West genre. = Podcasts = Let's Be Legendary: The Feywild West is an actual play Dungeons & Dragon's podcast set in a wild/weird west steampunk campaign featuring LGBTQ+ characters and producers. The story follows two bounty hunters-- a werewolf gunslinger and a priestess of the death god. Through the story, they explore what it means to be in a relationship, all the while seeking revenge and learning the truth of their pasts. =Music= Ghoultown are a Texan psychobilly band with Spaghetti Western influences. They have released albums like 2001's Tales from the Dead West with songs like \\"Death of Jonah Hex\\". In turn they produced their own eponymous \\"vampire-cowboy\\" comic book, through Bad Moon Studios, which saw an eight-page preview in Texasylum and the first two issues of a planned four-issue miniseries, before the publisher left the comic field. \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" is a song by English rock band Muse. The video clip is filmed and edited in the style of a spaghetti Western film with post-apocalyptic themes. The 2015 music video for the Brandon Flowers song \\"Can't Deny My Love\\" transposes Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1835 story Young Goodman Brown to a Western frontier setting. Flowers plays an unnamed protagonist who leaves his young wife (played by Evan Rachel Wood) for some unknown errand in the desert, despite her pleas that he stay with her \\"tonight of all nights.\\" On his journey he meets a man with a black staff (played by Richard Butler of The Psychedelic Furs), and later he discovers a group of townspeople carrying out witchcraft-like ceremonies ‚Äî his wife among them. The protagonist tries to flee when the townspeople notice him, but as they approach the scene instantly vanishes and the man awakes uncertain whether the previous night's events were real or a dream.

School organization By the 1990s, when the school had three functioning elementary schools, district population growth necessitated construction of a larger middle school and addition of a fourth elementary school. Once the new middle school was completed, the General Wayne facility was closed and converted into the fourth elementary school. Thereafter, Sugartown students temporarily used the renovated General Wayne school to allow for Sugartown's renovation and expansion. Thereafter, the high school underwent a four-year renovation that was completed during the 2006/2007 school year. After Sugartown's elementary renovation, reassignment of students to schools within the district was necessary. This process began in June 2004 and was implemented in time for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year.. Some students throughout the district from the other three elementary schools were relocated to Sugartown. Former schools Two older elementary schools ‚Äî Greentree Elementary in Willistown Township and Malvern Elementary in Malvern Borough ‚Äî were closed in the early 1980s and the buildings sold. Greentree was renovated and enlarged to become a commercial office building while the Malvern school was renovated and enlarged to become the Malvern borough town hall, police station, and public library.

2005, occurred when the National Socialist Movement (NSM), a neo-Nazi organization, planned a march to protest African-American gang activity in the North End of Toledo, in the U.S. state of Ohio. The appearance of the group sparked a four-hour riot by elements within the assembled protesters, and caused a citywide curfew to be implemented for the remainder of the weekend. The anti-fascist organization Anti-Racist Action helped to assemble the counter-demonstration. Neo-Nazis plan to march through Toledo's North End Several weeks before the rally, members of the National Socialist Movement went door-to-door through a North Toledo neighborhood, and discussed with residents the possibility of addressing gang activity. The NSM claimed that a local resident invited the group, but the named individual refuted this, saying that the group misrepresented themselves and that he did not invite the NSM. The NSM planned to march through the North End of Toledo, Ohio. The group stated that the purpose of the march was to protest gang activity in the area. Approximately fifteen supporters of the NSM, including Bill White (neo-Nazi), gathered under police guard in preparation to march. They began an impromptu rally at the staging point for the march, shouting insults and other racial slurs at black members of the community. Rally turns to rioting Responses had been organized during the week leading up to the rally. Neighborhood residents, the Toledo chapter of the International Socialist Organization, local anarchist organizations, and Anti-Racist Action groups from other cities coordinated in planning a massive protest aimed at forcing the NSM rally to be cancelled.historymike: Extreme Showdown? Groups Lining Up To Confront Nazis In Toledo The protesters directed aggression against the police, who responded by arresting dozens. This set off a four-hour conflict between over 500 protesters and the Toledo police force. Police cancelled the NSM march as the situation between police and the crowd escalated. Members of the NSM and their supporters were told to leave town with a police escort. While the neo-Nazi group had already left the park, most of the community members and protesters were unaware of this and began rioting. Eleven police personnel suffered injury, and one paramedic suffered a concussion after a brick smashed through the side window of her vehicle, hitting her in the head. Police, media vehicles and emergency vehicles were all targeted. A number of stores in the community were targeted by the crowd, including a local bar, believed by many locals to be a regular hangout for police and politicians, which was broken into and set on fire. A local gas station was also looted. Police arrested several dozen rioters, most of whom were residents of the North End. According to the mayor, a number of protesters were wearing gang colors. Although disturbed by the NSM's intentions to march, the city's mayor, Jack Ford, was extremely critical of the riot, saying that it was \\"just what they [the neo- Nazis] wanted.\\" Ford declared that a state of emergency existed, and imposed an 8 pm curfew on the entire city. Police officers from several jurisdictions, local SWAT team members, and private security firms patrolled the North End that evening. Neo-Nazis return for rally The NSM were granted permission to rally at the Government Center in downtown Toledo on December 10, 2005. The Ohio State Highway Patrol was responsible for security at the Center. The stated purpose of the rally was to protest how the city dealt with the previous planned march. Approximately 45 people participated in the one-hour rally, separated from 170 observers and counter-protesters by approximately 700 law-enforcement personnel. The assembled police forces - which included local, state, and federal officers - had at their disposal additional support as mounted patrols, armored personnel carriers, and rooftop snipers. In addition, a last minute injunction was granted by Judge Thomas Osowik on December 9, barring public gatherings of any kind for the following two weeks. Aggressive policing of the counter-protesters, which included the reported use of police Tasers, resulted in a total of 29 arrests. Three of those arrested were photojournalists covering the event. People entering the rally zone, including members of the media, were subject to searches, and police engaged in videotaping all persons near the rally site for what was termed as \\"intelligence gathering for future investigations.\\" The majority of arrests occurred in the police controlled observation area; however, several people were arrested near public libraries for violating a court order banning unauthorized protests. Local attorneys and civil rights activists protested the unusually strict police tactics, summed up by one attorney: \\"What you have in Toledo is martial law for a day.\\" None of the neo-Nazis who participated in the rally were arrested, but they were escorted from the rally site in buses protected by police. In retaliation, a local tattoo parlor that had allegedly been used as a base of operations for the NSM rally was vandalized later that night. The front window was smashed out with a rock marked with the anarchist circle \\"A\\" symbol. The owner of the parlor blamed the attack on an anarchist group called \\"The A Project.\\" See also * Anti-Racist Action * List of riots * Bill White (neo-Nazi) * National Socialist Movement (United States) * List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States References External links * Toledo Under Curfew Following Neo-Nazi Riot includes video * Something's Happenin' Here: An On-The-Ground Analysis of the North Toledo Riots A progressive analysis of the riots * CNN: Planned neo-Nazi march sparks violence * * Melee In Toledo A band from Ridgefield, CT, whose name was inspired by a news account of the incident Category:2005 riots Category:History of Toledo, Ohio Category:2005 in Ohio Category:History of racism in Ohio Category:Neo-Nazism in the United States Category:Riots and civil disorder in Ohio Category:October 2005 events in the United States Category:Political riots in the United States ","title":"2005 Toledo riot"},{"id":"3011375","text":"The Langeberg Range is a mountain range in the Western Cape province of South Africa.

The significance of the various geological layers (coloured layers) can be found in the articles on the Karoo Supergroup and Cape Fold Belt. The heavy black line flanked by opposing arrows is the fault that runs for nearly 300 km along the southern edge of the Swartberg Mountains. The Swartberg Mountain range owes some of its great height to upliftment along this fault line. The subsurface structures are not to scale. The range runs roughly NW/SE in its western part and in an east-west direction in its mid and eastern section and is approximately 250 km long, from Worcester, past Robertson, Montagu, Swellendam, Heidelberg and Riversdale to the proximity of George.

He was born at Staines, the son of the Rev. C. W. Furse, archdeacon of Westminster, and rector of St John's, Smith Square and descended collaterally from Sir Joshua Reynolds; and in his short span of life demonstrated such skill as a portrait and figure painter that he forms an important link in the chain of British portraiture which extends from the time when Van Dyck was called to the court of Charles I into the 20th century. His talent was precocious; at the age of seven he gave indications of it in a number of drawings illustrating the novels of Sir Walter Scott. He attended public school at Haileybury College. He entered the Slade School in 1884, winning the Slade scholarship in the following year, and completed his education at Julian's atelier in Paris. Hard worker as he was, his activity was frequently interrupted by spells of illness, for he had developed signs of consumption whilst still attending the Slade School. An important canvas called Cain was his first contribution (1888) to the Royal Academy, to the associateship of which he was elected in the year of his death. For some years before he had been a staunch supporter of the New English Art Club, to the exhibitions of which he was a regular contributor. In October 1900 he married Katharine Symonds, the daughter of John Addington Symonds. She later became known as Dame Katharine Furse. The couple had two sons. Peter Reynolds Furse (born in 1901) and John Paul Wellington Furse (born 13 October 1904). His fondness for sport and of an open-air life found expression in his art and introduced a new, fresh and vigorous note into portraiture. There is never a suggestion of the studio or of the fatiguing pose in his portraits. The sitters appear unconscious of being painted, and are generally seen in the pursuit of their favourite outdoor sport or pastime, in the full enjoyment of life. Such are the Diana of the Uplands, the Lord Roberts and The Return from the Ride at the Tate Gallery; the four children in the Cubbing with the York and Ainsty, The Lilac Gown, Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Fishing and the portraits of Lord Charles Beresford and William Johnson Cory. His revealing portrait of a younger Charles Darling who as Mr Justice Darling was later to sit on the criminal appeal of Sir Roger Casement is in the National Portrait Gallery. Nearly all of Furse's work shows a pronounced decorative tendency. His sense of space, composition and decorative design can best be judged by his mural decorations for Liverpool Town Hall, executed between 1899 and 1902. A memorial exhibition of Furse's paintings and sketches was held at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1906.

Florigen is produced in the leaves, and acts in the shoot apical meristem of buds and growing tips. It is known to be graft-transmissible, and even functions between species. However, despite having been sought since the 1930s, the exact nature of florigen is still disputed.  Mechanism  Essentially, to understand Florigen, you must first understand how flowering works. For a plant to begin flowering, it must make its changes to the shoot apical meristem (SAM). However, there are factors the plant must first consider before it begins this process such as the environment but even more specifically, light. It is through \\"the evolution of both internal and external control systems that enables plants to precisely regulate flowering so that it occurs at the optimal time for reproductive success.\\" The way the plant determines this optimal time is through day-night periods through the use of Photoperiodism. Although it was originally thought that the accumulation of photosynthetic products controlled the flowering of plants, two men by the names of Wightman Garner and Henry Allard proved it was not. They instead found that it was a matter of day length rather than the accumulation of the products within the plants that affected their flowering abilities. Flowering plants fall into two main photoperiodic response categories: # \\"Short-day plants (SDPs) flower only in short days (qualitative SDPs), or their flowering is accelerated by short days (quantitative SDPs)\\" # \\"Long-day plants (LDPs) flower only in long days (qualitative LDPs), or their flowering is accelerated by long days (quantitative LDPs)\\" These types of flowering plants are differentiated by the whether the day has exceeded some duration - usually calculated by 24-hour cycles - known as the critical day length. It is also important to note that there is no absolute value for the minimum day length as it varies greatly amid species. Until the correct amount of day length is reached, the plants ensure no flowering results. They do so through adaptations like preventing immature plants from responding to inadequate day lengths. Plants also have the ability to prevent the response of the photoperiodic stimulus until a certain temperature is reached. Species like winter wheat that rely on just that. The wheat require a cold period before being able to respond to the photoperiod. This is known as vernalization or overwintering. This ebb-and-flow of flowering in plants is essentially controlled by an internal clock known as the endogenous oscillator. It is thought that these internal pacemakers \\"are regulated by the interaction of four sets of genes expressed in the dawn, morning, afternoon, and evening hours [and that] light may augment the amplitude of the oscillations by activating the morning and evening genes.\\" The rhythms between these different genes are generated internally in the plants, starts with the leaves, but requires an environmental stimulus such as light. The light essentially stimulates the transmission of a floral stimulus (florigen) to the shoot apex when the correct amount of day-length is perceived. This process is known as photoperiodic induction and is a photoperiod-regulated process that is also dependent on the endogenous oscillator. The current model suggests the involvement of multiple different factors. Research into florigen is predominately centred on the model organism and long day plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Whilst much of the florigen pathways appear to be well conserved in other studied species, variations do exist. The mechanism may be broken down into three stages: photoperiod-regulated initiation, signal translocation via the phloem, and induction of flowering at the shoot apical meristem. =Initiation= In Arabidopsis thaliana, the signal is initiated by the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) coding a transcription factor called CONSTANS (CO). CO mRNA is produced approximately 12 hours after dawn, a cycle regulated by the plant's circadian rhythms, and is then translated into CO protein. However CO protein is stable only in light, so levels stay low throughout short days and are only able to peak at dusk during long days when there is still some light. CO protein promotes transcription of another gene called Flowering Locus T (FT). By this mechanism, CO protein may only reach levels capable of promoting FT transcription when exposed to long days. Hence, the transmission of florigen‚Äîand thus, the induction of flowering‚Äîrelies on a comparison between the plant's perception of day/night and its own internal biological clock. =Translocation= The FT protein resulting from the short period of CO transcription factor activity is then transported via the phloem to the shoot apical meristem. =Flowering= Florigen is a systemically mobile signal that is synthesized in leaves and the transported via the phloem to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) where it initiates flowering. In Arabidopsis, the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes encode for the flowering hormone and in rice the hormone is encoded by Hd3a genes thereby making these genes orthologs. It was found though the use of transgenic plants that the Hd3a promoter in rice is located in the phloem of the leaf along with the Hd3a mRNA. However, the Hd3a protein is found in neither of these places but instead accumulates in the SAM which shows that Hd3a protein is first translated in leaves and then transported to the SAM via the phloem where floral transition is initiated; the same results occurred when looked at Arabidopsis. These results conclude that FT/Hd3a is the florigen signal that induces floral transition in plants. Upon this conclusion, it became important to understand the process by which the FT protein causes floral transition once it reaches the SAM. The first clue came with looking at models from Arabidposis which suggested that a bZIP domain containing transcription factor, FD, is somehow interacting with FT to form a transcriptional complex that activates floral genes.. Studies using rice found that there is an interaction between Hd3a and OsFD1, homologs of FT and FD respectively, that is mediated by the 14-3-3 protein GF14c. The 14-3-3 protein acts as intracellular florigen receptor that interacts directly with Hd3a and OsFD1 to form a tri-protein complex called the florigen activation complex (FAC) because it is essential for florigen function. The FAC works to activate genes needed to initiate flowering at the SAM; flowering genes in Arabidopsis include AP1, SOC1 and several SPL genes, which are targeted by a microRNA and in rice the flowering gene is OsMADS15 (a homolog of AP1). =Antiflorigen= Florigen is regulated by the action of an antiflorigen.< Antiflorigens are hormones that are encoded by the same genes for florigen that work to counteract its function. The antiflorigen in Arabidopsis is TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) and in tomato it is SELF PRUNING (SP). Research history Florigen was first described by Soviet Armenian plant physiologist Mikhail Chailakhyan, who in 1937 demonstrated that floral induction can be transmitted through a graft from an induced plant to one that has not been induced to flower. Anton Lang showed that several long-day plants and biennials could be made to flower by treatment with gibberellin, when grown under a non-flower-inducing (or non- inducing) photoperiod. This led to the suggestion that florigen may be made up of two classes of flowering hormones: Gibberellins and Anthesins. It was later postulated that during non-inducing photoperiods, long-day plants produce anthesin, but no gibberellin while short-day plants produce gibberellin but no anthesin. However, these findings did not account for the fact that short-day plants grown under non-inducing conditions (thus producing gibberellin) will not cause flowering of grafted long-day plants that are also under noninductive conditions (thus producing anthesin). As a result of the problems with isolating florigen, and of the inconsistent results acquired, it has been suggested that florigen does not exist as an individual substance; rather, florigen's effect could be the result of a particular ratio of other hormones. However, more recent findings indicate that florigen does exist and is produced, or at least activated, in the leaves of the plant and that this signal is then transported via the phloem to the growing tip at the shoot apical meristem where the signal acts by inducing flowering. In Arabidopsis thaliana, some researchers have identified this signal as mRNA coded by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, others as the resulting FT protein. First report of FT mRNA being the signal transducer that moves from leaf to shoot apex came from the publication in Science Magazine. However, in 2007 other group of scientists made a breakthrough saying that it is not the mRNA, but the FT Protein that is transmitted from leaves to shoot possibly acting as \\"Florigen\\". The initial article that described FT mRNA as flowering stimuli was retracted by the authors themselves.  Triggers of gene transcription  There are three genes involved in clock-controlled flowering pathway, GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Constant overexpression of GI from the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT. Action potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants. The intracellular calcium signals are responsible for regulation of many biological functions in organisms. For instance, Ca2+ binding to calmodulin, a Ca2+-binding protein in animals and plants, controls gene transcriptions.  Flowering mechanism  A biological mechanism is proposed based on the information we have above. Light is the flowering signal of Arabidopsis thaliana. Light activates photo-receptors and triggers signal cascades in plant cells of apical or lateral meristems. Action potential is spread via the phloem to the root and more voltage-gated calcium channels are opened along the stem. This causes an influx of calcium ions in the plant. These ions bind to calmodulin and the Ca2+/CaM signaling system triggers the expression of GI mRNA or FT and CO mRNA. The accumulation of GI mRNA or GI-CO-FT mRNA during the day causing the plant to flower.

Featuring an unusual Venetian Gothic Revival architectural style inspired by the Doge's Palace in Venice, the building is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks and has been described as \\"unique in the country\\". The building was designed by Henry C. Trost and opened in 1917. A fire in 1933 left the Occidental Life Building mostly gutted; however the exterior walls remained standing and the remainder of the structure was rebuilt. The architect for the reconstruction, W. Miles Brittelle, took the opportunity to redesign the roofline for a more consistent Venetian appearance. The building interior was remodeled again in 1981 to add a second story. The Occidental Life Building is located on the northwest corner of Third Street and Gold Avenue in Downtown Albuquerque. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1973 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The Occidental Life Building was built in 1917 as the new headquarters of the Occidental Life Insurance Company, which had been organized in 1906 by a group of prominent local businessmen. The building was designed by Henry C. Trost, the chief architect of the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost. Trost was a prolific designer whose other built works in Albuquerque include the Rosenwald Building, First National Bank Building, and Sunshine Building. The building's unusual Venetian Gothic design was reportedly suggested by Occidental Life vice president George Roslington, a native of England. The building opened to the public with an evening ceremony on August 1, 1917, which was attended by an estimated 1,000 people. In recognition of the American entry into World War I that year, the program included performances of Rule, Britannia!, The Maple Leaf Forever, and La Marseillaise. The building's early tenants included a number of other insurance agencies in addition to Occidental Life, as well as savings and loan companies, realtors, and an engineering firm. A fire broke out in the Occidental Life Building early on the morning of April 25, 1933, causing an estimated $100,000 in damage before firefighters managed to extinguish it around noon that day. The building was mostly gutted, though the exterior walls remained intact up to the roofline. The Albuquerque Journal reported that the fire was thought to have started \\"between the ceiling and the roof in the northeast corner of the building\\". The fire occurred just hours after the burning of another Albuquerque landmark, the Fourth Ward School (replaced the following year by Lew Wallace Elementary), leading police and local residents to suspect arson. Following the fire, the building was rebuilt to the design of W. Miles Brittelle of the Albuquerque firm of Brittelle and Ginner, reopening in the spring of 1934. In keeping with the building's Venetian influence, Brittelle decided to redesign the roofline to more closely resemble the Doge's Palace, with an ornamental frieze and finials in place of the original overhanging cornice. The interior office space was also expanded by eliminating the original open arcade behind the facade, and the building structure was upgraded from frame to steel construction. In 1981 the interior was remodeled again to add a second story within the original facade. Architecture The Occidental Life Building features a Venetian Gothic Revival architectural style which is highly unusual for New Mexico, and has been described by the Albuquerque Landmarks and Urban Conservation Commission as \\"unique in the country.\\" The Baum Building in Oklahoma City, built in 1909, employed similar architectural features but was demolished in the early 1970s. The building's most significant feature is the white terra cotta facade, which wraps around the south and east sides of the building. The facade was modeled after that of the Doge's Palace in Venice, with arcades of pointed Venetian Gothic arches, quatrefoil windows, and, following the 1934 rebuilding, an ornamental frieze with a row of finials. The spandrels and capitals are decorated with elaborate floral ornamentation, and the building's rounded corners are punctuated with pointed turrets. The tile used in both the original and rebuilt portions of the exterior was manufactured by the Denver Terra-Cotta Tile Company.

Retrieved March 2011 (APPG) is a grouping in the Parliament of the United Kingdom that is composed of members of parliament from all political parties. APPGs are informal cross-party groups of members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. APPGs generally have officers drawn from the major political parties and strive to avoid favouring one political party or another. APPG members meet to discuss a particular issue of concern and explore relevant issues relating to their topic. APPGs regularly examine issues of policy relating to a particular areas, discussing new developments, inviting stakeholders and government ministers to speak at their meetings, and holding inquiries into a pertinent matter. APPGs have no formal place in the legislature, but are an effective way of bringing together parliamentarians and interested stakeholders. Every APPG must hold at least two meetings during its reporting year, one of which must be an annual general meeting (AGM) or a meeting which involves an inaugural election of officers. APPGs cease to exist when Parliament is dissolved for a general election, and must be reconstituted. The official register of APPGs is updated about every six weeks. The number of APPGs is very variable. For example, in 2015 there were more than 550 APPGs. On 2 January 2019, there were 692 APPGs. As of 24 February 2020, there were 355 APPGs. Examples APPGs are either country based, e.g., the APPG on Zimbabwe, or subject based, e.g., the APPG on Breast Cancer - the topics reflecting parliamentarians' concerns. APPGs allow campaign groups, charities, and other non-governmental organisations active in the field to become involved in discussions and influence politicians. Often a relevant charity or other organisation will provide a secretariat for the APPG, helping to arrange meetings and keeping track of its members. Examples of this include: * Survival International acting as secretariat for the All- Party Parliamentary Group for Tribal Peoples. * Humanists UK acting as secretariat for the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group. * The APPG on Christianity being administered by a staff member from the Bible Society. * Housing Justice administering the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Homelessness and Housing Need. Other ways of administering APPGs include borrowing capacity from an MP or peer's office, or by employing staff independently. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief, for example, employs two members of staff paid for through subscriptions from its stakeholders. The APPG on Agriculture and Food for Development uses a similar model. Other APPGs may have less stringent administrative needs, such as the UK parliament's All Party Parliamentary Jazz Appreciation Group. Associate parliamentary groups In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, an associate parliamentary group is similar to an all- party parliamentary group except that it is made up of not only members of the House of Commons or Lords but can also include members from outside Parliament.  Criticism  In early 2016, the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists launched an inquiry into concerns that APPGs were being used to bypass lobbying registration rules, following reports that lobbyists were acting as APPG secretariats and so gaining access to legislators. As sponsorship for trip to Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir\\" between 18 and 22 February 2020, the APPG on Kashmir (APPGK), chaired by Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, received a \\"benefit in kind\\" of amounting ¬£31,501 (Rs 29.7 lakh) and ¬£33,000 (Rs 31.2 lakh) on February 18, 2020 from the Government of Pakistan.

The force's headquarters are at Hutton, near the city of Preston. As of October 2018 the force had just under 3,000 officers as well as 2,000 Police Staff - of which 272 are police community support officers. History After many complaints over a number of years over the crime ridden state of Lancashire it was decided in 1839 that a combined county police force was required to police the county. In the same year the force was founded and Captain John Woodford was made chief constable with two assistant chief constables, 14 superintendents and 660 constables. Over the next 50 years the police force saw many changes including the introduction of the police helmet and, during the 1860s, the force lost its first officer, PC Jump, who died after being shot by a group of men that he and a colleague were searching. By the end of the century the force had developed a detective department who were allowed to wear plain clothes. The first detective appointed was John Wallbank. In 1917 the force first allowed female officers although it was only in the 1950s that they were allowed uniforms, and not until the 1970s were they paid at the same rate as their male counterparts. In 1948 the force's dog section was established with many differing breeds being used, but by the 1950s it was established that the German shepherd was the most suitable. In 1965, the force had an establishment of 3,784 officers and an actual strength of 3,454, making it the second largest police force (after the Metropolitan Police) and the largest county force in Great Britain.The Thin Blue Line, Police Council for Great Britain Staff Side Claim for Undermanning Supplements, 1965 The force then went through major changes in the 1970s when the force was reduced to cover the new re-bordered Lancashire with the other areas coming under the jurisdiction of Greater Manchester Police and Merseyside Police. On 10 October 2007 the Home Office announced that Lancashire Constabulary had ranked joint first, with Surrey, out of 43 forces by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies. All 43 police forces were assessed on seven areas - tackling crime, serious crime, protecting vulnerable people, satisfaction, neighbourhood policing, local priorities and resources and efficiency. The Radio Branch or Wireless Workshops pioneered many techniques in the use of radio by the police. In 1925 they had radio communications between constabulary headquarters in Preston and six divisional headquarters. A year later a van was equipped with a transmitter. Tests were done with radio communication to cars in the 1930s. In 1939 four fixed stations provided coverage over much of the county. At the start of World War II divisional headquarters were equipped with transmitter-receivers as a back-up to the telephone system. This was used in 1941 when the telephone system in Liverpool was put out of action by bombing, Lancashire Constabulary's radio system was sole means of communications with the city for a time. After the war they were involved in the development and move to VHF FM by the UK police. In 1961 a personal radio scheme was installed in Chorley with Motorola VHF personal radios imported from the USA after a demonstration in Stretford in 1959. This led in 1963 to the design of the Lancon VHF personal radio manufactured by GEC.Mobile radio for Lancashire's police, J. Davies, Electronics & Wireless World History since 2000 = Proposed merger = Under proposals made by the home secretary on 6 February 2006, it was to be merged with Cumbria Constabulary. These were accepted by both forces on 26 February, and the merger would have taken place on 1 April 2007. However, in July 2006, both Cumbria and Lancashire constabularies decided not to proceed with the merger because the government failed to remedy issues with the council tax precept which left both forces unable to proceed. =Intelligence analysis= Over recent years, Lancashire Constabulary has developed a reputation for leading the way in intelligence analysis and holds an annual intelligence analysis conference in Blackpool attended by a large number of analysts from other UK police forces and law enforcement agencies. Other forces are now looking to Lancashire as a pioneering force in IT support. In particular in 2007 Cumbria police (and more recently Durham Constabulary) secured their own version of Lancashire's intelligence, police investigation and work management system SLEUTH; an easy to use front line focussed alternative to NICHE Record Management System. =TacOps= At the end of 2017 Lancashire Constabulary formed the Tactical Operations Team (TacOps for short) which is composed of the Roads Policing Unit, Dog Unit, Mounted Branch, Armed Response Unit and Operational Support Unit.  Divisions and collaborations  The force is split into 5 divisions, three geographical and two based at the force HQ at Hutton. The split is approximate, and divisions are deliberately vague, giving a seamless approach to policing in the Lancashire area. The geographical divisions and their headquarters are as follows: ;Western :The headquarters are in Blackpool from where this division is responsible for the Fylde area stretching from Bispham down to Kirkham. Lancaster is also assigned with the policing of Morecambe, Heysham and the Wyre area. A new divisional HQ was opened in 2018. ;Southern :The headquarters are in Lancaster Road, Preston, with a secondary base at Chorley Magistrates' Court: it polices the Preston, South Ribble, Chorley and West Lancashire areas. ;Eastern :Based at Greenbank, Blackburn, this division is primarily assigned to police the Blackburn with Darwen, Ribble Valley and Accrington, Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale areas. ;G Division :Headquarters; encompassing the Force Intelligence Department (F.I.D), Serious Organised Crime Unit (S.O.C.U) and Special Branch (S.B). ;H Division :Operations Support and Operations Planning, which encompasses Motorway, Armed Response, Air Support, Mounted and various other functions. Lancashire Constabulary partners with the North West Police Underwater Search & Marine Unit and the North West Motorway Police Group.  Police stations  The constabulary has 36 full-time stations across the county with over 100 further police posts and smaller village stations. Although the county has this large number of stations less than half have adequate provisions to hold prisoners. The training of student officers is undertaken at police headquarters (Hutton). In addition, specialist training and certain specialist units such as the dog section and mounted department are based at the force's HQ at Hutton. Equipment The routine patrol officer is not armed but does carry a baton (either an ASP, Monadnock MX21 or Deanside ESP), a PAVA incapacitant spray, limb restraints (leg restraints), a first aid kit, a torch and rigid handcuffs. All police officers, special constables, PCSOs and civilian members of staff are required to wear a stab vest when on duty and \\"not in an office environment\\"; most choose to wear their vest at all times. Lancashire Constabulary issues black stab vests made by German manufacturer \\"Mehler Vario Systems\\". Although officers are not routinely armed, many response and neighbourhood policing officers are now trained in the use of taser guns and routinely carry them whilst on patrol. Lancashire also has several Armed Response teams carrying G36 assault rifles, Glock pistols and taser guns. In September 2014 the force rolled out the use of 150 body-mounted cameras, for officers in ‚Äòresponse‚Äô roles, following a successful pilot scheme. All officers are now trained to use them and many choose to use them on every shift. However it is not mandatory for officers to wear them at all times. All officers also carry two-way radios registered to Airwave Solutions, a nationwide radio network in the UK on which police and other emergency rely. Based on the TETRA standard, the radio network is secure and fully protected against eavesdropping on transmissions, as well as allowing interoperability with other police services, fire brigades, as well as ambulance services. For the Lancashire Police, Motorola MTH800s are the radios of choice. Motorway unit The force's motorway policing unit has headquarters at Samlesbury near Preston. The unit is led by a single inspector who in turn is responsible for seven sergeants and 43 police constables. The unit also operates a vehicle checking station at Cuerden between Chorley and Preston on the M65, this is done in co-operation with VOSA. Lancashire's motorway unit is one of the four forces that make up the North West Motorway Police Group along with Merseyside Police, Greater Manchester Police and Cheshire Constabulary. = Vehicles = Beat patrol car The standard patrol car is the Hyundai i30 but this is currently being phased out in favour of the new Peugeot 308. Roads Policing Unit Lancashire Constabulary TacOps uses BMW 3 Series estates and BMW X5 SUVs for roads policing. Previously they used a fleet of BMW 5 Series estates, and prior to that the Vauxhall Vectra. BMW 3 Series Tourer (Estate) Motorbike Lancashire Constabulary uses the BMW R1200RT. These are primarily used for traffic enforcement and escort duties . BMW k1200 Motorway Motorway vehicles are primarily BMW 3 Series Estates. The BMW typically carries VASCAR equipment, mobile video equipment and tracker. The BMWs carry a lot more equipment compared to the vehicles used by the TacOps Unit, including a camera, tape measure, carriage marking spray, tow rope, hazard and police tape, portable blue lights, cones and a first aid kit. Discovey 3 Operations Support Unit The OSU (Operations Support Unit), known colloquially as a \\"riot van\\", is used for providing a response to public order incidents and also finds use during Operation Summer Nights and similar initiatives. It is able to carry up to ten people including the driver. Lancashire Constabulary has 33 carriers in use across the county. It has special features including headlight grilles, which protect the headlights when missiles are thrown at the vehicle, a windscreen grille, which helps protect the vehicle's windscreen and officers when missiles are thrown at the vehicle, and run flat tyres. Mercedes Sprinter Van Section van Lancashire Constabulary primarily uses the Ford Transit Custom and the Vauxhall Vivaro both of which have been specially modified in order to transport detained persons safely and securely. Armed response vehicle (ARV) Lancashire Constabulary currently has six armed response vehicles, which are based within the six divisions in Lancashire. Currently the vehicle of choice for armed response officers is the BMW X5 SUV. They are crewed by two or three authorised firearms officers and have a safe, which holds firearms equipment. Dog van The force uses multiple vehicles in order to transport dogs, including Ford Transits and specially modified Ford Escort Estates. The big vans can carry up to four dogs and the smaller cars can carry up to two dogs. The vehicles have been modified with ventilation equipment installed in to the roofs allowing ample ventilation to the rear of the cars. 200px Air Support Unit This now defunct unit operated an EC135 helicopter based at BAE Warton. The force had an ASU since 1994 when it fielded a Eurocopter Squirrel but this was retired in the early 2000s as it was replaced by the newer EC 135. Since 2013 air support has been provided by the National Police Air Service, which provides air support to all police forces in England & Wales. Firearms unit Due to police officers in the county not being routinely armed the force has its own specialised firearms unit based at locations around the county. The force has at any one time has nine armed officers on patrol. The standard issue weapon is the Glock SLP whilst officers are also armed with the Heckler & Koch G36 carbine. Tasers are carried by all armed response officers as well as officers from the Tactical Operations Team and appropriately trained local officers. The Firearms unit utilise the BMW X5 SUV as their patrol vehicle which has been modified in order to carry specialist equipment particular to their role. As well being trained in firearms, AFOs are also trained in other skills such as method of entry and advanced pursuit tactics. Chief Constables *1839‚Äì1856: John Woodford *1859‚Äì1868: William P.

Life and career He is most widely known for his hugely popular work with John Lennon on the classic album Imagine, as string arranger. He wrote advertising jingles, including a famous one for Maxwell House, and background music for many television programs. In 1964, he conducted and did the arrangements for singer Morgana King's classic album, Miss Morgana King. Those with a good ear might like to compare the voicing of the first few bars of Torrie's arrangement of the track \\"All Blues\\" with that of the first few bars of Symphony No. 11 by Dmitri Shostakovich. They are remarkably similar; a hint by Torrie that long sections of the symphony are inspiration for variations on All Blues. Helen Merrill confirms that Torrie was interested in the music of Shostakovich. A New York City resident, Zito was married to singer Helen Merrill, with whom he recorded several albums. He had one daughter, Lisa Zito, from his first marriage, and a stepson, a singer-songwriter Alan Merrill (most known for his 1975 hit \\"I Love Rock'n'Roll\\"), by his second marriage (to Merrill).

It is located approximately north of Colchester and northeast of the county town of Chelmsford. The village is in the borough of Colchester and in the parliamentary constituency of North Essex. There is a Parish council. The village was the site of a series of skirmishes between Parliamentary and Royalist troops in July 1648, known as the Battle of Boxted Heath. Two historic manors are located in the parish: Boxted Hall and Rivers Hall, which are both mentioned in the Domesday records. Boxted was split into two settlements, 'Boxted' and 'Boxted Cross', during the plague when non infected villagers moved across the valley from 'Old Boxted' to escape infection. A timber framed cottage called Songers is reputedly the oldest private dwelling in Essex dating back to 1280. In 1630 the village vicar, George Phillips, and many other Boxted residents emigrated to America as part of the Great Migration. Phillips subsequently founded a church at Watertown on the Charles River in Massachusetts. Other Boxted residents went to Ipswich, Massachusetts. Today Boxted can be easily reached from Colchester along Boxted Straight Road, which is often mistaken for a Roman road but is in fact a relatively modern road based upon an old heathland track, many other local roads are much older. Parts of the Boxted parish - such as Old Boxted - are within the Dedham Vale conservation area where development of buildings etc. is tightly controlled. Old Boxted is not developing as fast as Boxted Cross which contains a broad mix of modern housing developments and has now extended considerably along Straight Road. Recently the school has moved from Old Boxted to Boxted Cross. At Boxted Cross is a Village hall overlooking the George V playing fields where Boxted Lodgers football team and Boxted Cricket club play. In 2017 the Boxted Runners were formed, a local running group catering for all abilities. They held the first Boxted 10k event in 2018 raising funds for the local Primary School. Boxted heath to the southern end of the parish is mostly divided into nearly 70 small holdings which were originally built by the Salvation Army in the early 20th century under an initiative to create a land settlement or colony. These small holdings replaced the Priory farm that was here in the 19th century. although the old farm house and some outbuildings still remain. No public houses are trading in the village since the Wig & Fidget closed about 2005. The Cross Inn ceased trading in mid-1980s and was converted into residential usage. The Queens Head (Queens Hd Rd/Ellis Rd corner) closed in 1972 and was demolished after several years as a retirement home. Most of the other pubs - such as the Fox (near the church) and Thatchers (Mill Rd) closed much earlier.

He is voiced by American comedian Gilbert Gottfried in the animated canon and by voice actor Alan Tudyk in the live action adaptation of Aladdin. Iago first appeared in the first film as a minion to the main villain Jafar, and later becomes one of the protagonists for part of the franchise's run, particularly the two direct-to-video sequels and television adaptation. The red-plumed talking scarlet macaw is an homage to the villain of William Shakespeare's Othello.  Development  Iago's original voice actor, Gilbert GottfriedIn the original story treatment by Howard Ashman, Iago (previously named Sinbad) had been originally conceived as a \\"British\\" calm and serious straight man working off Jafar, who was originally conceived as more over-the- top, comedic, and irritable, but the filmmakers later reversed their personalities in large part in order to make Jafar more threatening and when they saw Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II, Gottfried was cast to provide Iago's voice. Iago's animator Will Finn tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi- closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth.Pop Up Fun Facts. [DVD]. Aladdin Platinum Edition Disc 1: Walt Disney Home Video. 2004. Gilbert Gottfried has said that his voiceover career really began after voicing the character in the 1992 film. ‚Äú... that has been one of those things that lives on,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat seemed to open the door for other voiceover jobs.‚Äù Gottfried's unique onstage persona led to him being cast as the wise-cracking Iago. Gottfried is often referred to as \\"the Iago guy\\" and similar terms, being more known by his voice role than by name.  Characteristics  Iago resembles a scarlet macaw, though smaller in size and with shorter feathers while retaining the blue tipped wing feathers, blue tail, and white around the eyes. He can speak fluent English and has the ability to perfectly mimic other characters' voices.TOP PICKS: Animated sidekicks He also possesses knowledge of various tricks learned from Jafar. He is easily frustrated and openly vocalizes his frustrations, and avoids direct confrontations if he can help it, but when required, he can be quite cunning and mischievous. Iago is also known for his notorious greed of treasure and gold, for which he will go to outlandish lengths to acquire, usually dragging along Abu to help him, but Abu's incompetence always costs him. Iago is often put in situations of deciding between saving his own tail feathers or doing the right thing. His guilt always leads him to do the latter as he lacks a moral conscience; his greed leaves him unsatisfied in usually losing some form of reward or riches, for which he always berates himself afterwards. He (as well as maybe Jafar) is a reference to the character of the same name. In Shakespeare's play Othello, Iago is the name of the titular protagonist's ensign; though believed to be trustworthy, all he cares about is getting himself ahead and his own wants. The play revolves around his devious scheme to find a way to get what he wants‚Äîan unpleasant surprise to everyone when he is exposed.  Appearances  According to a piece of conversation in The Return of Jafar, Jafar had picked up Iago in Agrabah's bazaar and reared him as his accomplice in crime. He also mentions in the animated series of having a criminal twin brother named Othello, reference to his name's supposed origins. = Aladdin = In the first movie, he resents living under the Sultan and Jasmine as much as his owner Jafar does, though he contrasts Jafar's dark brooding with angry, sarcastic ranting. Iago often says how he hates crackers which the Sultan always force-feeds him. The Sultan seems to not know until the end of the first movie that Iago can fully comprehend and converse in human speech and is evil. In the end, Iago is dragged into Jafar's lamp with him at the end of the movie and is banished to the Cave of Wonders. Several allusions to Shakespeare's Othello are seen: * Jafar and Iago resent living under the Sultan and Jasmine like how Shakespeare's Iago and Roderigo resent Othello. ** Similarly, each individual hates their opposition for different reasons and in differing manners: *** Jafar and Shakespeare's Iago resent being second best, and in dark brooding orchestrate most of the betrayal. *** Jafar's Iago and Roderigo are more vocal, contrasting dark brooding with bouts of useless complaining (in the case of Roderigo) and angry sarcastic ranting (in the case of Iago). Iago often says how he hates crackers which the Sultan always force- feeds him; and Roderigo complains about being at the short end of the stick, what with lusting for Othello's wife Desdemona, whose father Brabantio promised him for a hand in marriage. * Neither pairing's superiors seem to know of betrayal until it is too late. Whereas Shakespeare's Iago and Roderigo never gain their wants, however, Jafar and his Iago do, albeit for a short period of time. * Both Jafar and Shakespeare's Iago end up imprisoned for their actions, and their respective accomplices pay dearly with it. But while Shakespeare's Iago kills Roderigo before being ousted, Jafar drags his Iago into the lamp with him. = The Return of Jafar = Having escaped from the lamp, Iago sets out on his own at last, mostly because he is fed up with being taken for granted. Iago appears to have the most character development in the film, as he slowly warms to the idea of friendship after Aladdin saves him from the Sultan's wrath in return for Iago unintentionally saving him from Abis Mal, and finally risks his life to kill Jafar by pushing his lamp into molten lava. Following his heroic deed, he is adopted by Aladdin as his second pet. In the film, Iago performed the songs \\"I'm Looking Out for Me\\" and \\"Just Forget About Love\\" (the latter with Aladdin and Jasmine as a piece of reverse psychology to encourage Jasmine to forgive Aladdin for keeping Iago's return secret). = Aladdin TV series = In the series, he provides a sarcastic, realistic, or cowardly perspective on events and is only really willing to face danger if the great reward is promised. However, he is sometimes forced to battle his conscience (despite respectively saying in The Return of Jafar that he never had one), and generally does the right thing even when he doesn't have to or could just as easily leave the city (alone) altogether: when Sadira used memory sand that somehow caused her and Jasmine to switch lives, with animals unaffected, Iago leads Abu and Rajah in finding Jasmine to restore the world to normal. Iago's common schemes involve trying to sell anything with any value (real or not), trying to steal things, and trying to treasure-hunt; he can usually convince Abu to be his partner in crime, but Abu is more likely to leave at the first sign of danger and often lacks the finesse that Iago requires. He cares a lot about Abu, though, as shown in episodes such as \\"Much Abu About Something\\". Iago and Thundra the rain-bird had feelings for one another, despite a rocky start and him admitting his manipulative personality made appealing to others difficult; Aladdin has occasionally exploited the latter fact, since antagonists are more willing to accept Iago as being more ruthless and amoral than he actually is, though, given Iago's villainous origins and upbringings in the underworld, this is rational. Due to his time with Jafar, Iago possesses extensive knowledge of various forms of magic, not only proving useful as Genie's otherwise superior knowledge is ten thousand years out of date (it was Iago who recognized the Kingdom of the Black Sand and its former ruler Distance in \\"The Citadel\\"), but also giving him Genie's ability to commonly reference modern things for humor, albeit without a logical excuse (one episode has him screaming in his sleep, \\"YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY! YOU WANT MY TWIN BROTHER, OTHELLO!\\", a reference to the play where his name may have come from). As a sidekick Iago is always good for a laugh‚Äîan in-joke in the episode \\"When Chaos Comes Calling\\" has Iago running in panic after his face is turned into that of his voice actor Gilbert Gottfried (\\"I WANT MY BEAK BACK!\\").Aladdin - Episode 53 - When Chaos Comes Calling approx. 4 mins in. Iago's and Genie's interactions revolve around their magical talents: in one episode Genie gives Iago his powers just for one day (though this backfires when Iago tries to bring water to the desert), and Iago is the only one who knows that Genie once used his own magic to make himself an ice cream sundae as big as a pyramid (something that Genie dares not let the Genie Guild know about). He favors Jasmine the most of the group, not because she trusts him, but because she is the one whose trust he has to work for. = Aladdin and the King of Thieves = He has a supporting role in Aladdin and the King of Thieves, where he helps out with Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding, as well as aiding Aladdin to find his estranged father Cassim, who happens to be the King of the Forty Thieves. Acting on behalf for Aladdin, Iago convinces Cassim to attend the wedding, promising that he will help him get the Hand of Midas. In the end, although the Sultan pardoned him from the sentence of life imprisonment for his complicity with the King of Thieves, Iago chooses to depart Agrabah with Cassim instead of staying with Aladdin and Jasmine on the grounds that he could not handle the \\"lovey-dovey\\" stuff, though he briefly breaks down in tears while telling Cassim, implying he will miss them dearly. He also points out that Cassim's sense of thievery is more in line with his as well. However, Iago does promise to visit the couple frequently. He is last seen with Cassim waving farewell to the newly-wed Aladdin and Jasmine as they ride off to the night. = Kingdom Hearts = In the video game Kingdom Hearts, he is initially Jafar's sidekick, but then later is used by the player to assist in defeating Jafar. His Japanese voice actor in Kingdom Hearts is Akira Kamiya, and his voice actor in Kingdom Hearts II is T≈çru ≈åkawa. Gilbert Gottfried reprises his role in the English versions of both games. In Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories he makes a brief cameo appearance during the Boss battle against Jafar's genie form. During the battle, attacking Jafar has no effect. Rather, the lamp must be hit which is held up high by Iago, √† la The Return Of Jafar. It can therefore be assumed that Iago is on the side of the good guys again. In Kingdom Hearts II, like in The Return of Jafar, Iago leaves Jafar and returns to Agrabah in a slump after failing to make amends to Aladdin and Jasmine. When he unintentionally assisted Sora in the task of beating the Heartless and retrieving Jafar's lamp, he manages to gain everyone's trust. But that trust is soon shattered when Iago is forced to help Jafar yet again in keeping Sora and the others occupied at the ruins. Despite losing faith, Iago redeems himself by intentionally getting shot by a spell that Jafar intended to shoot at Aladdin. After Jafar's defeat, Iago reveals he wants to help Aladdin out, but can't do as much as Genie and the others. However, Sora tells Iago that friendship is about enjoying each other's company and having fun. = Aladdin (2019) = Iago appears in the 2019 live-action Aladdin, voiced by Alan Tudyk. It marks the first time Iago is voiced by someone other than Gilbert Gottfried as on December 20, 2018, Gottfried said he was not asked to reprise the role. While his role remains the same and he still shows signs of sentience and a cynical sense of humor, he is notably less anthropomorphic than his animated counterpart as the film wanted to make Iago more realistic. This still manages to leave only a few plot-related deviations: * He first appears during the song \\"Arabian Nights\\", where Rajah slashes him with his claws for spying on Jasmine, then he flies to the Cave of Wonders to be with Jafar. * He later appears in Jafar's lair in the castle dungeon. After Jafar talks to the Sultan, Iago mimics Jafar saying \\"remember your place\\", after which Jafar threatens the bird if he says it again; this is ironic, however, as Jafar hates being called second and is only mildly annoyed with Iago saying it. * He's later enlarged and piloted by Jafar in order to retrieve the lamp from Aladdin, Jasmine, and Abu; he succeeds only for a mere moment before being transformed back to a normal parrot, though he succeeds again with Jafar's help. = Other appearances = With his travels with Cassim at the end, Iago has returned to Agrabah and appears as a supporting character in the straight- to-DVD movie Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams, and he performs a musical number called \\"Peacock Princess\\" with Princess Jasmine in her princess duties. Like most characters from Disney's animated films, Iago made recurring appearances on Disney's House of Mouse, he also sings \\"A Parrot's Life For Me\\" at the House of Mouse where the movies' continuity did not seem to matter, and Iago was depicted as either Jafar's sidekick or exhibiting his protagonist behavior. At Walt Disney World, along with Zazu from The Lion King, he was introduced as one of the hosts of The Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management) in 1998. Following a small fire in 2011, the two were removed as the attraction reverted to its earlier format as Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room. Reports had described the 1998 format as \\"unpopular\\" and Iago as \\"annoying.\\" Iago also appears in the stage adaptation of the film. However, unlike his film counterpart, he is portrayed as a human, working as a personal assistant to Jafar. Iago appears in season six of Once Upon a Time: however, this version is a non-anthropomorphic red cockatiel as opposed to a macaw.  Reception  In reviews for The Return of Jafar Iago was often described as being the real star of the film: \\"The plot thickens when Aladdin becomes indebted to Jafar's former partner, Iago (a wisecracking parrot), for saving his life. Struggling with issues of honesty and loyalty, Iago becomes the film's focus as he grapples between standing by Aladdin or succumbing to Jafar's evil pressures.\\"  In popular culture  Iago's ability of mimicking voices (e.g., Aladdin) was referenced during a sketch entitled the \\"Real Housewives of Disney\\" in an episode of Saturday Night Live.

It is a comedy set in a small seaside village in rural East Anglia during the Edwardian period and draws from some of the themes of Shakespeare's The Tempest. It was well-received by critics.  Plot summary  Set in 1907, the play begins with a tempestuous storm in which a well-known and loved member of the community drowns and explores the reactions of the villagers and the attempts by two young lovers to break away from the constraints of the hierarchical, and sometimes irrational, society. At the same time, the town's draper struggles with abuse and bullying from the town's \\"First Lady\\", Mrs. Rafi. Believing that aliens from another planet have arrived to invade the city, he had refused to help the drowning man's friend's attempts to save him and eventually goes stark raving mad. Original production The play was originally produced at the Royal Court Theatre on 22 May 1973, directed by William Gaskill. *Willy Carson - Simon Rouse *Evens - Alan Webb *Hatch - Ian Holm *Hollarcut - Mark McManus *Vicar - Jeremy Wilkin *Carter - Anthony Langdon *Thompson - Simon Cord *Louise Rafi - Coral Browne *Rose Jones - Diana Quick *Jessica Tilehouse - Gillian Martell *Mafanwy Price - Susan Williamson *Jilly - Adrienne Byrne *Rachel - Barbara Ogilvy *Davis - Margaret Lawley Revivals In 1991 it was produced by the National Theatre, directed by Sam Mendes, with Judi Dench as Mrs. Rafi and Ken Stott as Hatch. In 2000, Sean Holmes directed a production at The Minerva Theatre Chichester, with Susan Engel as Mrs. Rafi and Michael Gould as Hatch. In 2008, Jonathan Kent produced the play at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, with Eileen Atkins as Mrs. Rafi and David Haig as Hatch. This production was reviewed positively in Evening Standard. It was also produced by the 1812 Theatre Company at Helmsley Arts Centre in Helmsley, Yorkshire in 2009. It was produced by Eva Holmes in 2014, with Fiona Reid's performance as Louise Rafi highly praised in The Buffalo News and Toronto Star. In 2007, in a New York production Off-Broadway, The Actors Company Theatre (TACT) staged the play. Reception Ann Marie Demling wrote in 1983 that The Sea enjoyed popular and critical acclaim, and that in the play, Bond \\"most clearly and articulately expresses a vision that was only suggested in The Pope's Wedding and Saved.\\" Lawrence MacDonald praised the dynamic between Carson and Hatch, as well as the character of Evens. However, MacDonald said that the play's eight scenes \\"don't quite add up to a total, self cementing structure\\" and derided the scenes \\"between Willy Carson and Rose Jones. They come across as fiat and banal concessions to the boy meets girl syndrome.\\" Ian Shuttleworth wrote for the Financial Times, \\"His comedy is frequently as broad as a 1970s television sitcom, and his passages of more profound comment tend to interrupt this silliness obtrusively rather than to sneak in under its Trojan-horse cover. [...] The Sea constantly declares that it has depths, but Bond never summons the resolve to trawl them properly\\". Colin Dabkowski of The Buffalo News wrote, \\"For this particularly bleak brand of existentialist drama to sit side-by-side with such finely calibrated mannerist comedy is unusual but often thrilling. [...] by placing haunting reflections on the experience of life in a dead-end seaside town in such proximity to slapstick comedy, Bond seems to be making a statement on the power of theater as an antidote to the void, or at least a distraction from it.\\" Chicago Tribune's Sid Smith billed The Sea in 1994 as a \\"dense, erratic, compelling piece of theater\\", as well as \\"a feast of acting opportunity and emotional depths\\" that \\"gracefully wends back and forth between [tragedy and comedy]\\", but Smith criticized some of the acting in the Cypress Group performance he attended. In 1999, Ian Stuart of the University of Southern California described the play as \\"excellent\\". Mark Ravenhill called Mrs Raffi \\"terrifyingly hilarious [...] ruling a small seaside community with an iron fist and an acid tongue.\\" In 2007, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times dubbed The Sea a \\"funny-in-that-British-way\\" play. The following year, Paul Taylor said in The Independent that the play has \\"hilarious\\" and \\"haunting\\" aspects. Charles Spencer of The Telegraph described the work as a \\"classic piece of English eccentricity\\". Molly Flatt of The Guardian criticized the incidental characters as cliches but still wrote of The Sea, \\"It works. It made me laugh, and feel sad, and really think about, as Bond himself puts it, 'the moral and political paths people could take in the situation the world was in'.\\" In a 2014 article for The Wall Street Journal, Terry Teachout called the play a \\"masterpiece\\" deserving of more productions. Grant Golden of Buffalo Rising said that while The Sea is \\"a little less than the sum of its estimable parts\\", portions of it \\"have stuck around in my head for a good deal longer than I thought they would.\\" He called Mrs. Rafi's final appraisal of herself \\"simultaneously humorous and touching\\". Variety's Karen Fricker had reservations about the first act but stated that the play \\"[achieves] the required comic-tragic-pathetic grandeur in the second-act funeral scene\\", the waterside setting of which provides (in the critic's opinion) \\"a jarring but effective tonal contrast to the scene‚Äôs arch sendup of Englishness\\". Fricker argued, \\"Bond is clearly no fan of the red pen, and the play suffers for it. But there is exhilaration in the breadth of his reference, social conscience and theatrical imagination\\". Jon Kaplan of Now praised the play as \\"thoughtful and incisive\\" and said that the Shaw Festival's acting ensemble \\"know how to mine the work's text and emotional subtext\\". The Globe and Mail's J. Kelly Nestruck praised Hatch as Bond's \\"most riveting theatrical creation\\". Tamara McCarthy said of The Sea, \\"The complex characters, the poetry of the piece, and the absolute ripping humour resonated with me for quite a while afterward.‚Äù Some critics have been less laudatory. Toronto Star's Richard Ouzounian wrote that the \\"writing throughout is brilliantly witty, yet savagely political\\", and that the \\"battered old rum-pot [offers] some astonishingly valid philosophical views of the universe\\" near the ending. But he also said, \\"The Sea is full of wonderful moments, but it‚Äôs not a unified wondrous experience. Is it Edward Bond‚Äôs fault or Eda Holmes‚Äôs? I don‚Äôt know.\\" Robert Cushman of National Post lauded Hatch and Mrs. Rafi as \\"major creations\\", referring to the latter's speech about her future self as \\"one of the great speeches in modern drama\\"; Cushman also praised the funeral scene as \\"brilliantly grotesque\\", but criticized the play's ending as \\"a moralistic discussion between three characters of whom we know very little.\\" The Guardian's Michael Billington lauded the acting in Kent's production as acting \\"of the highest order\\" and wrote that \\"Bond achieves moments of limpid poetry as when the local wise fool announces 'in the end life laughs at death'. But, for all the insistence on the echoing sea and the surrounding army's battery- guns, I'm not sure the story is strong enough to bear the cosmic weight imposed on it.\\" Time Out's Kris Vera said that the thread on Hatch's fear of alien invasion \\"has an unfortunate resonance amid an increasingly ridiculous political season\\" but \\"sits uncomfortably alongside\\" other parts of the play.

Early life MacGregor was born in Oxford. Her parents were Scottish and emigrated to South Africa where she was brought up. Her father was a doctor, a neurologist, who, during the Second World War was in the Royal Army Medical Corps with the British 14th Army in Burma. She attended the Herschel Girls' School, an independent boarding school in Cape Town. She completed her education at the √âcole de commerce in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, and at an English college called the House of Citizenship. Career in broadcasting For a time in London, she worked as a typist at Australia House, then became a temporary junior secretary at the BBC. This entitled her to an induction course, where she was taught the BBC's method of working. Returning to South Africa she began her broadcasting career there on the SABC's English-language radio service. Initially joining the BBC in 1967 as a reporter for The World At One, she went on to host Woman's Hour from 1972 until 1987. In 1984 she became one of the hosts of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, a position she held until 2002. That same year she was appointed a CBE for her services to broadcasting. Sue is a trustee of UNICEF and was a trustee of the John Ellerman Foundation. She is also on the Chancellor's Forum for the London Institute and an honorary graduate of several universities, among them the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent and Dundee. She hosted The Reunion on BBC Radio 4 from 2003 to 2019. In late 2010, she recorded her final episode as chair of the popular book programme A Good Read, also on BBC Radio 4. After seven years and approximately 500 book reviews, she was the show's longest serving presenter at the time. Personal life A friend of Helen Suzman, via her niece Janet Suzman, MacGregor used her local knowledge in BBC broadcasts over many years about the struggle against South Africa's apartheid system . Her autobiography, Woman of Today, published in 2002, contained candid revelations and outlined her claimed relationships, including an affair with Leonard Rossiter.

Patterson was born in 1833 at Patterson Cottage, Alnwick, Northumberland, England to James Patterson, contractor, and Agnes, n√©e Brown. Patterson emigrated to Victoria in 1852 to seek his fortune on the goldfields. After a few years as a digger and four as a farmer, he settled in Chewton, where he went into business as a butcher, later moving into real estate. He was Mayor of Chewton for four years before he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Castlemaine in 1870. A moderate conservative, Patterson served in the second third governments of the liberal leader Graham Berry, as Commissioner for Public Works in August 1875 and as Commissioner for Public Works and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works in 1877‚Äì1880. From July 1878 to March 1880 he was also Postmaster-General. After 1881 he went into opposition, under the leadership of Duncan Gillies, and was Commissioner for Trade and Customs in the Gillies government from 1889 to 1890. With the onset of the depression which followed the end of the Land Boom in 1891, Patterson emerged as the leader of the conservative critics of the governments of James Munro and William Shiels, who tried to deal with the crash by cutting government expenditure and raising taxes. Patterson spoke for the business and middle classes who did not want increased taxation at a time of depressed trade. In January 1893 Patterson moved a successful no-confidence motion in the Shiels government and became Premier. Patterson's government, however, had no better solutions to the depressed state of Victoria's government. A series of bank failures in April lead Patterson to declare a \\"bank holiday\\" (1 May 1893 ‚Äì 5 May 1893) preventing panicked depositors from withdrawing their money. There were near-riots outside the closed banks, and confidence in the colony's finances plummeted. Later in the year Patterson became convinced that tax increases were after all inevitable, which the liberal opposition supported, but his conservative supporters revolted and he withdrew the idea, leaving himself with no policy at all. Affairs drifted until August 1894, when Patterson in turn lost a confidence vote in the Assembly. At the resulting elections the conservatives were heavily defeated by the protectionists under George Turner. Patterson returned to the opposition benches and was created K.C.M.G. in 1894. He was still a member of Parliament when he died on 30 October 1895 from influenza in Murrumbeena, Victoria. An 1893 portrait of Patterson by Gordon Coutts hangs in the Victorian Parliament House.

Shares in Refco then proceeded to drop from $28 per share to $0.08 per share, before being halted and then delisted from the NYSE. Bennett had been buying bad debts from Refco in order to prevent the company from needing to write them off, and was paying for the bad loans with money borrowed by Refco itself. Between 2002 and 2005, he arranged at the end of every quarter for a Refco subsidiary to lend money to a hedge fund called Liberty Corner Capital Strategy, which then lent the money to Refco Group Holdings, Inc (a company he controlled and owned). Liberty Corner then paid the money back to Refco, leaving Liberty Corner as the apparent borrower when financial statements were prepared. Upon their maturity‚Äîtimed to occur after the end of Refco's reporting period‚Äîthe loans were \\"unwound\\" (supposedly without the knowledge of Refco's auditors). This meant that Refco Group Holdings. Inc. was put back in the position of owing the same amount of debt to Refco that it owed before it borrowed the money from Liberty Corner. Thus on paper, these debts remained hidden from one quarter to another. Bennett, a former resident of Gladstone, New Jersey, was sentenced in 2008 to 16 years in jail for the financial fraud. Bennett was given early release on 26th May 2020 on compassionate grounds due to health concerns during the Covid crisis at the age of 71. He was immediately deported to the UK.

It was introduced by Ella Logan in the original 1947 Broadway production of Finian's Rainbow. Production The music was composed by Burton Lane and the lyrics were written by E.Y. Harburg. The song was published in 1946 and introduced in the 1947 musical Finian's Rainbow. There is no actual Glocca Morra in Ireland (though there is a Glockamara). In a television interview late in his life, Harburg revealed that the name \\"Glocca Morra\\" was made up by composer Lane, who had devised a dummy lyric beginning with the line, \\"There's a glen in Glocca Morra\\". Harburg liked the name but insisted on changing the line to \\"How are things in Glocca Morra?\\" because this is personal and immediately evocative of nostalgia and homesickness. James Stephens' work The Crock of Gold (first published in 1912) refers to \\"the leprechauns of Gort na Cloca Mora\\" (an approximation of gort na clocha m√≥ra, \\"field of the big rocks\\" in Irish). It is unknown whether Lane or Harburg were aware of the novel or whether this is a coincidence. Other versions Many versions of this song were recorded in 1946 and 1947, including a version by Dick Haymes, recorded on December 29, 1946, and released by Decca Records as catalog number 23830. The record reached the Billboard charts on March 29, 1947, peaking at #9, and spent five weeks on the chart. Other early versions included the Buddy Clark version, recorded on October 14, 1946, and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 37223. It spent eight weeks on the chart, peaking at #6; the Ella Logan/Albert Sharpe version, recorded on April 3, 1947, and released by Columbia Records as catalog number MM 686 (the original cast album of the Broadway production); the Stuart Foster/Tommy Dorsey version, recorded on December 30, 1946, and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-2122; the Martha Tilton version, recorded on November 25, 1946, and released by Capitol Records as catalog number 345; and the Harry Babbitt version recorded on January 20, 1947, and released by Mercury Records as catalog number 3056. In addition, legendary jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins recorded this tune for his Blue Note Records debut, Sonny Rollins, Volume One. In the publication Cash Box, which combined sales of all artists into a single position. the song reached #4. The song, performed by Petula Clark, is also part of the soundtrack of the 1968 film version of the stage musical. She has included the number in her concert repertoire ever since. Numerous others have recorded the song, including Bing Crosby in 1975 for his album At My Time of Life, Barbra Streisand, and Julie Andrews. In 1969 it was recorded by Scottish singer Moira Anderson. Gracie Fields first recorded this in 1947 and re- recorded it in 1956 and 1970. This song was regularly performed in her cabaret acts and live performances, often with a trademark headscarf. She also performed this during her famous two-week run at The Batley Variety Club in 1965. Jazz guitarist Gene Bertoncini recorded a solo guitar arrangement of this song on his 1999 release, Body and Soul. Impact The song was a particular favorite of President John F. Kennedy, as was Finian's Rainbow. The song was parodied by Scotland the What? about their fictional Aberdeenshire village Auchterturra in \\"How Are Things in Auchterturra?\\" In the movie Party Monster, Seth Green's character, James Saint James, makes a reference to the perfect sentence: \\"Last night, I dreamt of Glocca Morra...again.\\" (The reference parodies: \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\", the famous first line of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca.) The song is referenced in the Sports Night episode \\"Celebrities\\" (Season 2, Episode 15) and the song title is directly used as the title of an episode from Season 1 (Episode 17). When Goody Rickles (Don Rickles' sillier look-alike) comically mangles the name of the deadly compound \\"Pyrogranulate\\" in the comic book Jimmy Olsen 139, by Jack Kirby, what comes out is \\"Pyro-Glocca-Morra\\". In an episode of All in the Family, Archie Bunker refers to New York City as a \\"regular Sodom and Glocca Morra.\\" In \\"A Shift in the Night\\" (S02E18), an episode of \\"ER (TV Series)\\", Dr. Mark Greene asks a colleague \\"How are things in Glocca Morra?\\" The song was referenced by Daffy Duck in the 1948 cartoon Daffy Dilly. The title was parodied on comedians Abbott and Costello's radio showhttps://archive.org/download/otr_abbottandcostello/Abbott_and_Costello_- _Whos_On_First_Original_30_Min_Live_Rad.mp3 as \\"How are things in Glocca, moron?\\" In Mad Men: \\"For Immediate Release\\", Roger Sterling asks his airline ticket attendant girlfriend, Daisy, \\"How are things in Gloccamora?\\" Indie rock band Glocca Morra named their group after the phrase.

Chromium was first proposed as an essential element for normal glucose metabolism in 1959, and was widely accepted as being such by the 1990s. Cases of deficiency were described in people who received all of their nutrition intravenously for long periods of time. The essentiality of chromium has been challenged. Whereas the authorities in the European Union do not recognize chromium as an essential nutrient, those in the United States do, and identify an adequate intake for adults as between 25 and 45 Œºg/day, depending on age and sex. Dietary supplements containing chromium are widely available in the United States, with claims for benefits for fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1C and weight loss. Reviews report the changes as modest, and without scientific consensus that the changes have a clinically relevant impact. Signs and symptoms The claimed symptoms of chromium deficiency caused by long-term total parenteral nutrition are severely impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, peripheral neuropathy and confusion. Diagnosis According to the Dietary Reference Intake review, neither plasma nor urine concentrations can serve as useful clinical indicators of chromium status. Before chromium became a standard ingredient in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), people getting TPN as their sole source of nutrition developed symptoms that were reversed within two week after chromium was added. Dietary recommendations The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for chromium in 2001. For chromium there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for chromium for women ages 14 and up is 25 Œºg/day up to age 50 and 20 Œºg/day for older. AI for pregnancy is 30 Œºg/day. AI for lactation is 45 Œºg/day. For men ages 14 and up 35 Œºg/day up to age 50 and 30 Œºg/day for older. For infants to children ages 1‚Äì13 years the AI increases with age from 0.2 to 25 Œºg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of chromium there is not yet enough information and hence no UL. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).Chromium. IN: Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Chromium National Academy Press. 2001, PP.197-223. Japan designate chromium as an essential nutrient, identifying 10 Œºg/day as an Adequate Intake for adults.Overview of Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2015) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. The EFSA does not consider chromium to be an essential nutrient, and so has not set PRIs, AIs or ULs. Chromium is the only mineral for which the United States and the European Union disagree on essentiality. For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For chromium labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 120 Œºg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 35 Œºg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by 1 January 2020, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and by 1 January 2021 for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. During the first six months following the 1 January 2020 compliance date, the FDA plans to work cooperatively with manufacturers to meet the new Nutrition Facts label requirements and will not focus on enforcement actions regarding these requirements during that time. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. =Sources= Approximately 2% of ingested chromium(III) is absorbed, with the remainder being excreted in the feces. Amino acids, vitamin C and niacin may enhance the uptake of chromium from the intestinal tract. After absorption, this metal accumulates in the liver, bone, and spleen. Trivalent chromium is found in a wide range of foods, including whole-grain products, processed meats, high-bran breakfast cereals, coffee, nuts, green beans, broccoli, spices, and some brands of wine and beer. Most fruits and vegetables and dairy products contain only low amounts. Diabetes Given the evidence for chromium deficiency causing problems with glucose management in the context of intravenous nutrition products formulated without chromium, research interest turned to whether chromium supplementation for people who have type 2 diabetes but are not chromium deficient could benefit. Looking at the results from four meta-analyses, one reported a statistically significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) and a non-significant trend in lower hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C). A second reported the same, a third reported significant decreases for both measures, while a fourth reported no benefit for either. A review published in 2016 listed 53 randomized clinical trials that were included in one or more of six meta- analyses. It concluded that whereas there may be modest decreases in FPG and/or HbA1C that achieve statistical significance in some of these meta- analyses, few of the trials achieved decreases large enough to be expected to be relevant to clinical outcome. The authors also mentioned that trial design was for chromium as an addition to standard glycemic control medications, and so did not evaluate chromium as a first treatment for type 2 diabetes, or for prevention of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes. The conclusion was that \\"...there is still little reason to recommend chromium dietary supplements to achieve clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control.\\" The American Diabetes Association publishes a standards of care review every year. The 2018 review makes no mention of chromium supplementation as a possible treatment.Standards of Medical Care for Diabetes - 2018 Diabetes Care 2008:41:Supplement 1. Supplementation Chromium supplementation in general is subject to a certain amount of controversy as it is by no means clear that chromium is an essential element in human biology. Nevertheless, chromium is an ingredient in total parenteral nutrition, along with other trace minerals. It is also in nutritional products for preterm infants. Many chromium-containing products, including chromium chloride, chromium citrate, chromium(III) picolinate, chromium(III) polynicotinate are sold as non-prescription dietary supplements. = Government-approved health claims = In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a Qualified Health Claim for chromium picolinate with a requirement for very specific label wording: \\"One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain.\\"FDA Qualified Health Claims: Letters of Enforcement Discretion, Letters of Denial U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Docket #2004Q-0144 (August 2005). In 2010, chromium(III) picolinate was approved by Health Canada to be used in dietary supplements. Approved labeling statements included: \\"...provides support for healthy glucose metabolism.\\" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved claims in 2010 that chromium contributed to normal macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration.Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to chromium and contribution to normal macronutrient metabolism (ID 260, 401, 4665, 4666, 4667), maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations (ID 262, 4667), contribution to the maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight (ID 339, 4665, 4666), and reduction of tiredness and fatigue (ID 261) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 European Food Safety Authority EFSA J 2010;8(10)1732.

It is not known if it is a natural group; it is known that both Litopterna and Notoungulata form a clade based on collagen evidence, but the placement of the other members is uncertain. it was erected to distinguish the ungulates of South America from other ungulates. Relationships between the orders inside Meridiungulata remain unresolved and it could well be a \\"wastebasket taxon\\". Most Meridiungulata died out following the invasion of South America by North American ungulates and predators during the Great American Interchange, but a few of the largest species of notoungulates and litopterns survived until the end-Pleistocene extinctions. The notoungulate Mixotoxodon was able to invade North America to as far as present-day Texas. Taxonomy Meridiungulata might have originated in South America from a North American condylarth ancestor, and they may be members of the clade Laurasiatheria, related to other ungulates, including artiodactyls and perissodactyls. It has, however, been suggested the Meridiungulata are part of a different macro-group of placental mammals called Atlantogenata. Much of the evolution of meridiungulates occurred in isolation from other ungulates, a great example of convergent evolution. However, the argument that meridiungulates are related to artiodactyls and perissodactyls needs support from molecular sequencing. Some paleontologists have also challenged the monophyly of Meridiungulata by suggesting that the pyrotheres are more closely related to other mammals, such as Embrithopoda (an African order possibly related to elephants), than to other South American ungulates. Results from the sequencing of collagen from Pleistocene fossils of the notoungulate Toxodon and the litoptern Macrauchenia have indicated that at least these two orders are indeed laurasiatheres, and form a sister group to odd-toed ungulates. This result has been corroborated with mitochondrial DNA extracted from Macrauchenia, which points towards a branching date of 66 million years ago. Panperissodactyla has been proposed as the name of an unranked clade to include perissodactyls and their extinct South American ungulate relatives.

Background Armando Diaz During the Battle of Caporetto,Caporetto is the Italian name of the town of Kobarid, today in Slovenia. from 24 October to 9 November 1917, the Italian Army suffered over 300,000 casualties (dead, injured and captured) and was forced to withdraw, causing the replacement of the Italian Supreme Commander Luigi Cadorna with General Armando Diaz. Diaz reorganized the troops, blocked the enemy advance by implementing defense in depth and mobile reserves, and stabilized the front-line around the Piave River. In June 1918, a large Austro-Hungarian offensive, aimed at breaking the Piave River defensive line and delivering a decisive blow to the Italian Army, was launched. The Austro-Hungarian Army tried on one side to force the Tonale Pass and enter Lombardy, and on the other side to make two converging thrusts into central Venetia, the first one southeastward from the Trentino, and the second one southwestward across the lower Piave. The whole offensive, which became known as the Battle of the Piave River ended in a heavy defeat for the imperial army, with the Austro-Hungarians losing 11,643 killed, 80,852 wounded and 25,547 captured. After the Battle of the Piave, General Armando Diaz, despite aggressive appeals by Allied commanders, deliberately abstained from offensive action until Italy would be ready to strike with success assured. In the offensive he planned, three of the five armies lining the front from the Monte Grappa sector to the Adriatic end of the Piave were to drive across the river toward Vittorio Veneto, so as to cut communications between the two Austrian armies opposing them. Allied forces totaled 57 infantry divisions, including 52 Italian, 3 British (23rd, 7th and 48th), 2 French (23rd and 24th), and the 332nd US Infantry Regiment, along with supporting arms. The Austro-Hungarian army had 46 infantry divisions and 6 cavalry divisions, but both sides were ravaged by influenza and malaria and the Austrians only had 6,030 guns to 7,700 Allied. The Italian armies in the mountains were merely to hold the front line and follow up the enemy when he retreated. The task of opening the attack and taking on the strongest positions fell to Fourth Army (Lieutenant-General Gaetano Giardino) on the Grappa. Twelfth Army, consisting of one French and three Italian divisions was commanded by the English- speaking Lieutenant-General Enrico Caviglia and he had under command Tenth Army (Lieutenant-General Lord Cavan) to protect his right flank. Lord Cavan's army consisted of two British and two Italian divisions and they too were expected to cross the Piave by breaking the Austrian defenses at Papadopoli Island. The Third Army was simply to hold the lower Piave and cross the river when enemy resistance was broken. The Ninth Army, which contained two Italian divisions as well as the 6th Czechoslovak Division (consisting of former POWs captured by the Italians) Precl√≠k, Vratislav.

The plan was for two battalions from 22nd Brigade of the British 7th Division to occupy the northern half of Papadopoli while the Italian 11th Corps took the southern half.Wilks p.136 The British troops detailed for the night attack were the 2/1 Honourable Artillery Company (an infantry battalion despite the title) and the 1/ Royal Welch Fusiliers. These troops were helpless to negotiate such a torrent as the Piave, and relied upon boats propelled by the 18th Pontieri under the command of Captain Odini of the Italian engineers. On the misty night of the 23rd the Italians rowed the British forces across with a calm assurance and skill which amazed many of those who were more frightened of drowning than of fighting the Austrians. For the sake of silence the HAC used only their bayonets until the alarm was raised, and soon seized their half of the island. The Italian assault on the south of Papadopoli was driven off by heavy machine-gun fire. Nevertheless, the Austrians had surrendered the island by the end of the night.War Monthly (Issue 31): Vittorio Veneto, p. 35 by Peter Banyard. Battle Italian machine gunners on Monte Grappa In the early hours of 24 October, the anniversary of the beginning of the Battle of Caporetto, Comando Supremo launched the splintering attack on Monte Grappa designed to draw in the Austro-Hungarian reserves. At 03:00 the right wing of the Italian Fourth Army began a barrage to give time for its men to move into position. At 05:00 the rest of the artillery joined in. The infantry began to struggle up the steep slopes and secondary peaks which the Austrians had held for so long. The flooding of the Piave prevented two of the three central armies from advancing simultaneously with the third; but the latter, under the command of Earl Cavan, after seizing Papadopoli Island farther downstream, won a foothold on the left bank of the river on 27 October. In the evening the Allies had covered so much ground that they were over-extended and vulnerable to a counter-attack. The Italian Tenth Army maintained its ground and had established a bridgehead deep and broad. The British captured 3,520 prisoners and 54 guns.Peter Banyard. \\"Vittorio Veneto\\" War Monthly, Issue 31, p. 37-38 Svetozar Boroeviƒá von Bojna, the Austro-Hungarian commander, ordered a counter-attack on the Italian bridgeheads on the same day, but his troops refused to obey orders, a problem confronting the Austrians from that time on, and the counter-attack failed.Stevenson (2011), p.160. The first days of the battle involved heavy artillery dueling between the two sides, which were fairly evenly matched in firepower with the Italians possessing 7,700 guns to the Austro-Hungarians' 6,000 guns. From 24 to 31 October alone, the Italian artillery fired 2,446,000 shells.Gooch, p. 97 On 28 October, a group of Czechs declared Bohemia's independence from Austria-Hungary. The next day, another group purporting to represent the eventual South Slavs proclaimed their independence, and on 31 October, the Hungarian Parliament proclaimed their withdrawal from the union, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. On 28 October, under these new political and military conditions, the Austro- Hungarian high command ordered a general retreat. On 29 October the Italian Eighth Army pushed on towards Vittorio Veneto, which its advance guard of lancers and Bersaglieri cyclists entered on the morning of the 30th. The Italian Third Army forced a crossing of the Lower Piave while raids in the mountains disclosed that the Austrians were withdrawing there. Reserves including the 332nd US Infantry Regiment poured over the Piave behind the Italian Tenth Army. Vittorio Veneto was seized the next day by the Italian Eighth Army, which was already pushing on to the Tagliamento river. Trieste was taken by an amphibious expedition on 3 November. The Italian Eighth Army troops which had managed to cross the Piave were only able to communicate with the west bank by using swimmers. The swimmers were furnished by one of the most elite assault units in Italian history ‚Äì the Arditi Corps, the Caimani del Piave (\\"Caimans of the Piave\\"). 82 were recruited by Captain Remo Pontecorvo Bacci. These specialized troops were created after analyzing the mistakes one year before at Caporetto. Carrying a resolza knife and two hand grenades, they were trained to remain in the powerful currents of the icy Piave for up to 16 hours; 50 died in the river during the campaign, a casualty rate of over 60%. The Italian Twelfth Army, commanded by French General Jean Graziani, continued to advance, supported on the right by the Eighth Army. At dawn on the 31st, the Italian Fourth Army resumed the offensive on Monte Grappa and this time was able to advance beyond the old Austrian positions towards Feltre. In the mountains and on the plain the Allied armies pushed on until an armistice was arranged. The result was that Austria-Hungary lost about 30,000 killed and wounded and 300,000 prisoners (50,000 by 31 October; 100,000 by 1 November; 300,000 by 4 November). The Italians suffered during the 10 days' struggle 37,461 casualties (dead and wounded) ‚Äì 24,507 of them on Monte Grappa. British casualties were 2,139, while the French lost 778 men. The Armistice of Villa Giusti was signed on 3 November at 15:20, to become effective 24 hours later, at 15:00 on 4 November. Aftermath Italian troops landing in Trieste, 3 November 1918 The Austrian command ordered its troops to cease hostilities on 3 November. Following the signing of the armistice, Austrian General Weber informed his Italian counterparts that the Imperial army had already laid down its weapons, and asked to cease combat immediately and to stop any further Italian advance. The proposal was sharply rejected by the Italian General Badoglio, who threatened to stop all negotiations and to continue the war. General Weber repeated the request. Even before the order to cease hostilities, the Imperial Army had already started to collapse, beginning a chaotic retreat. Italian troops continued their advance until 3 p.m. on 4 November. The occupation of all Tyrol, including Innsbruck, was completed in the following days. Under the terms of the Austrian-Italian Armistice of Villa Giusti, Austria-Hungary's forces were required to evacuate not only all territory occupied since August 1914 but also South Tirol, Tarvisio, the Isonzo Valley, Gorizia, Trieste, Istria, western Carniola, and Dalmatia. All German forces should be expelled from Austria-Hungary within 15 days or interned, and the Allies were to have free use of Austria-Hungary's internal communications. They were also obliged to allow the transit of the Entente armies, to reach Germany from the South. Beginning in November 1918, the Italian Army with 20,000‚Äì22,000 soldiers occupied Innsbruck and all North Tyrol. The battle marked the end of the First World War on the Italian front and secured the end of the Austro-Hungarian empire. As mentioned above, on 31 October Hungary officially left the personal union with Austria. Other parts of the empire had declared independence, notably what later became Yugoslavia. The surrender of their primary ally was another major factor in the German Empire's decision that they could no longer continue the war. On 30 October the Wilhelmshaven mutiny erupted, shortly afterwards the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 started to spread from Kiel. Less than a week after the Austro- Hungarians, the Germans requested an armistice. Assessment German chief- of-staff Erich Ludendorff, a prominent World War I figure, stressed the importance of the battle claiming that its outcome prompted the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, \\"dragging Germany in its fall\\". German historian Ernst Nolte contended that Vittorio Veneto was \\"an encounter which had merely given the coup de grace to the abandoned army of an already crumbling state.\\"  Gallery  File:Italy-Stamp-1921-Battle of Vittorio Veneto.jpgPostage stamp, Italy, 1921 File:280 mm ita.jpgItalian heavy artillery 280mm howitzer File:Battle of Vittorio Veneto Q25946.jpgItalian troops in Val d'Assa File:Passaggio del Piave.jpgItalian troops cross the Piave File:Onthe march.jpgAmerican troops of the 332nd Infantry Regiment advance through Grave di Papadopoli during the latter stages of the offensive on the afternoon of 31 October 1918 File:Vittorio Veneto1918IWM.jpgItalian and British troops passing abandoned Austro-Hungarian artillery on the Val d'Assa mountain road, 2 November 1918 File:Trento 3 novembre 1918.jpgItalian cavalry reaches Trento on 3 November 1918 File:Italian Arditi.jpgMembers of the Arditi Corps wielding daggers, 1918 File:WWI - Battle of Vittorio Veneto - Austro-Hungarian prisoners.jpg Austrian prisoners of war taken during the Battle of Vittorio Veneto See also *Bollettino della Vittoria *Battle of the Piave River  Notes   References   Bibliography  * * Gooch, John. \\"The Italian Army and the First World War\\".

The club starts in 1919 when it was founded as Unione Sportiva Cavese. It was refounded as Pro Cavese in 1974. In 2012 the club, known as S.S. Cavese 1919 S.r.l. at that time, merged with another local side \\"U.S.D. Pro Cavese 1394\\", but retaining the \\"Cavese 1919\\" brand. It having last been in Serie B in 1984. History = From U.S. Cavese, Pro Cavese to S.S. Cavese 1919 = The team was founded in 1919 as Unione Sportiva Cavese, and played its first match ever against Salernitana, ended in a 3‚Äì2 win for the Aquilotti. In 1922 the team merged with Libertas Sporting Club, another local team, in order to build a more competitive side. That same year, the team was admitted to the Prima Divisione (the equivalent of the nowadays' Serie A). After a few years near the bottom of the table, the death of their coach and an economic crisis lead to their demotion in 1925. After languishing in the lower levels of Italian Football for 10 years, S.S. Cavese was promoted to the Prima Divisione (at that time became the 4th highest division) in 1937. With a new stadium Stadio Francis Palmentieri and star player Virgilio Levratto, the Aquilotti rose to the Serie C . However, in 1948 the club ran into more economic trouble, sending them back into the minor divisions. In 1964 the club played its way to the Serie D despite a 3-point penalty. In 1974, Cavese merged with Pro Salerno, another Serie D team, and renamed itself as Pro Cavese. After the merge, several new clubs were founded and named after \\"Pro Salerno\\" a few times. Pro Cavese returned to Serie C in 1977 and took back its original denomination in 1980. In 1981, Cavese was able to gain its first (and only) promotion to Serie B. The first Serie B season for Cavese ended in a 15th place which allowed the team to avoid relegation. The 1982‚Äì83 Serie B season was the top season ever for the Campanian team in its whole history: in fact, Cavese was almost to reach promotion to Serie A, ending the first half of the season in a third placed, which would allow the promotion, and sixth at the end of the season. That championship is remembered especially for the crushing 2‚Äì1 victory in San Siro against A.C. Milan. The scorers were Joe Jordan for Milan, and Tivelli and Di Michele for Cavese. However, the next season Cavese relegated to Serie C1, and was not able to reach Serie B anymore. The team was even cancelled from Italian football in 1991, and readmitted in the Eccellenza Campania with the denomination S.S. Cavese 1919. In the 2000s, Cavese went back to the professional Italian leagues and in the 2005‚Äì06 Serie C2 season it was able to win the division and come back to Serie C1. In the 2006‚Äì07 Serie C1 season, a third place in the regular season allowed Cavese to play the promotion playoffs: after a 5‚Äì2 defeat to Foggia in the first leg, Cavese nearly overturned it in the second leg, winning it 3‚Äì1 and being eliminated by a late Foggia goal during injury time. They defeated Napoli 2‚Äì1 in a friendly match in the beginnings of 2009. Starting from 2010, fans of the club also became the shareholders. Local photographer, Michele Angelo Sica, became the executive director (). In the end of 2010‚Äì11 Lega Pro Prima Divisione season (ex-Serie C1), Cavese relegated to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione (ex-Serie C2). But in July 2011, the club did not appeal against the exclusion of the first team from professional football by Co.Vi.So.C. Sica also made a press release in August 2011, stating the logo and color of the club were used by others without approval. S.S. Cavese 1919 had a team participated in a local league Campionato Regionale di Attivit√† Mista in 2011‚Äì12 season. The membership of \\"S.S. Cavese 1919 S.r.l.\\" in the Italian Football Federation was finally revoked in June 2016, despite the club already given the name of \\"Cavese 1919\\" to the phoenix club circa 2012. =From U.S.D. Pro Cavese 1394 to Cavese 1919= In July 2012, another club, U.S.D. Pro Cavese 1394, homage to one of the previous name, Pro Cavese, signed an agreement with S.S. Cavese 1919 to act as a phoenix club. U.S.D. Pro Cavese 1394 also applied to play in 2012‚Äì13 Serie D. Circa 2013‚Äì14 season Pro Cavese was renamed to U.S.D. Cavese 1919, and then the current name Cavese 1919 in the late 2010s. U.S.D. Pro Cavese 1394 was formerly known as A.S.D. Citt√† de la Cava 1394 , based in Cava de' Tirreni in Campania season. Cava won the national promotion play-offs of that division, but requires to deposit ‚Ç¨31,000 for the actual spot in 2012‚Äì13 Serie D season. Before 2011, the team was known as Vis Sangiorgio , based in Castel San Giorgio. A.S.D. Vis San Giorgio also participated in . The club had yet another name A.S.D. Paestum Citt√† dei Templi, based in Paestum frazione, Capaccio-Paestum (not to be confused with S.S. Akragas Citt√† dei Templi), but the club was takeover by businessman from Castel San Giorgio in 2009, and proposed to rename to A.S.D. Citt√† di Castel San Giorgio (not to be confused with other team of the city, such as A.S.D. Castel San Giorgio (registration number 620,901) and A.S.D. Castel San Giorgio Calcio (registration number 620,516)http://www.figc- campania.it/attachments/article/1405/denominazione%20cambi%20ratificati.doc). Paestum was relegated in season, but rep√™chage on 31 July 2009. Paestum was known as U.S. Poseidon before 2005‚Äì06 season (registration number 61,766), also based in Capaccio-Paestum. Some fans of the original S.S. Cavese 1919, also founded another phoenix club \\"S.C.S.D. Cava United F.C.\\" in 2014 (registration number 941,251),http://www.figc- campania.it/attachments/article/2261/ORGANICO%20CAMPIONATI%20LND%202017-2018.doc stating they are still fans of Cavese, but not agree with the club re- foundation by buying the sports title from other club. Cava United participated in Terza Categoria. While Poseidon, another predecessor of the current \\"Cavese 1919\\", was also re-founded as U.S. Poseidon 1958 in Capaccio- Paestum (registration number 620,531). Poseidon reached Promozione Campania in 2014. Another team, Aquilotto Cavese (registration number 934,893), was founded by a fans association Associazione Sogno Cavese in 2011, which also related to 2014 founded Cava United. In April 2014, U.S.D. Cavese 1919 was penalized 3 points in 2013‚Äì14 Serie D season, while the Chairman () Salvatore Manna was banned from football for 1 year, for some misconducts. He resigned as the chairman in the same month. Cavese 1919 promoted back to Serie C in 2018. The club was selected as one of the replacement of the teams that fails to register for 2018‚Äì19 Serie C. Cavese reached the finals of the promotion play-offs of 2017‚Äì18 Serie D Group H. But even as one the winners of the play- offs (9 winners from 9 groups in total), it did not guarantee promotion.

While the OT-62 is an improved copy of the BTR-50 developed jointly by Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Type 77, based on the Type 63 amphibious light tank developed by the People's Republic of China (PRC), is not a copy of the BTR-50. Description Front of the Israeli-modified ex-Syrian or ex-Egyptian late-production model BTR-50PK APC at the Yad la-Shiryon Museum, Israel. 2005. Note the elevated trim vane and IR searchlight. Rear view of the same APC. The two water-jets have their lids closed. Like the PT-76, the BTR-50 has a flat, boat-shaped hull. Unlike the PT-76, it has a new superstructure added to the front of the vehicle. The hull of the BTR-50 is made of all-welded steel with the crew compartment in the front, the troop compartment in the center and the engine compartment at the rear. It has the ability to transport up to 20 fully equipped infantrymen, who sit on benches that run across the full width of the troop compartment. They mount and dismount the APC by climbing over the sides of the hull. The driver sits in the center of the front of the hull and has three vision blocks and periscopes located at the top of the sloping glacis plate. During night operations, the center periscope can be swapped for the TVN-28 night vision device, which gives the driver clear vision up to 60 meters. The driver also has a small hatch that opens upwards‚Äîwhile it cannot be used to leave the vehicle, it can be opened in relatively safe areas for extra vision. In combat, the hatch is closed and the driver can use a vision block. There is an emergency hatch under the driver's seat. The commander, who sits on the left side of the vehicle at the front, has three vision blocks and periscopes in a projecting bay. On top of this bay is a cupola that opens forward and can be locked vertically; it has a vision block facing forward. The vehicle can operate in temperatures from ‚àí40 ¬∞C to +40 ¬∞C. The torsion bar suspension consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with a drive sprocket at the rear and an idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to assist its amphibious capabilities. These wheels increase the APC's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a hydraulic shock absorber, the steel tracks have a single pin and 96 links each when new. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. The BTR-50 is powered by a V-6 6-cylinder 4-stroke in line water-cooled diesel engine developing 240 hp (179 kW) at 1800 rpm. This gives it a road speed of 44 km/h with a cruising range of 400 km. The vehicle can negotiate 30¬∞ side slopes, ascend 60¬∞ gradients, cross 1.1 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches. The engine has a cooling system and a pre-heater (intended for ignition when the air temperature is ‚àí20 ¬∞C or below). The APC has a five gear manual shaft-type transmission system similar to that in the T-34/85 medium tank. The gearbox has four forward and one reverse gear. The vehicle has a side clutch that enables it to make turns, mechanical transmission and a bandbrake. The vehicle has three fuel tanks, two on the right at the front of the engine compartment and one at the rear. The total fuel capacity is 400 liters. The vehicle has four mounts for additional external fuel tanks located on the rear of the hull; the two on the hull corners are for a flat external tanks, whereas the two in the center are for a drum-type of tank. The BTR-50 is amphibious thanks to its flat, boat-shaped hull, which is hermetically sealed and ensures minimal resistance when the APC is afloat. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps; erecting the trim vane which improves the stability and displacement of the vehicle in the water and prevents water from flooding over the bow of the APC. Swapping the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope enables the driver to see over the trim vane. There is also a manual bilge pump for emergency use. In the water, it is propelled by two hydrojets, one on each side of the hull, the inlets are under the hull, the outlets are at the rear. There are also additional assistant water-jet inlets on both sides of the hull over the last road wheels. The rear outlets have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed outlets at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn. This system was designed by N. Konowalow. It is the same system as the one used in the PT-76. The vehicle's low freeboard of 15 to 20 cm and lack of a snorkel means that it can only swim in the calmest waters. Its armor is composed of homogeneous, cold rolled, welded steel‚Äîit is very thin by modern standards, 13 mm at the front, 10 mm on the sides and top and 7 mm at the rear. While its maximum armor protects it fully against small arms fire and small artillery shell fragments, it cannot protect it against large shell fragments and .50-caliber machine gun bullets. Although its front armor might protect it against 7.62 mm small arms fire, that same fire can sometimes penetrate the sides. The vehicle is equipped with an IR driving light and an IR searchlight. It lags behind other Soviet armored fighting vehicles as it has no fire protection systems and, with the exception of the BTR-50PK variant, it has no nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) protection systems, which significantly reduces its effectiveness. . Service history A US Army recognition poster. The BTR-50 was developed in 1952 and entered service with the Soviet Army in 1954. It was first shown in public in November 1957. It served in the motorized rifle regiments of tank divisions and mechanized brigades in the Soviet and East German armies. A typical mechanized brigade consisted of three battalions, each of which had 30 APCs and a command vehicle. They were replaced in front line service by the BMP-1 IFV. Command vehicle variants were employed by many Warsaw Pact armies. BTR-50s were used by Egypt and Syria during the Six-Day War (1967), a number of which were captured by Israel. Some vehicles were then re-used by the Israeli Army. Both sides used BTR-50s during the War of Attrition (1968‚Äì70). During Operation \\"Raviv\\" (September 8‚Äì9, 1969), an amphibious raid across the Suez Canal, three T-54 tanks and six BTR-50s were used to wreak havoc behind Egyptian lines. BTR-50s were again employed by Egypt, Syria and Israel during the Yom Kippur War (1973). During this conflict, BTR-50s, along with T-54s and T-55s, were used by the IDF during the fighting in and around the city of Suez. The Yom Kippur War also witnessed Israel capture additional BTR-50s from the Egyptians and Syrians. Some of Israel's BTR-50s were later transferred to the South Lebanon Army.

An ex-Syrian or ex-Egyptian BTR-50PU command vehicle. Note the second bay and the oval hatches. UR-67 * BTR-50P (Ob'yekt 750) (1952) ‚Äì The first production version with an open troop compartment. The vehicle had no integral armament, but it did have a pintle mount for a 7.62 mm SGMB medium machine gun. Early production BTR-50P models had folding ramps at the rear of the hull to enable either a 57 mm ZiS-2, a 76.2 mm ZiS-3 or an 85 mm D-44 anti-tank gun to be loaded and fired on the engine decks. The weapon could also be fired when the vehicle was afloat, but only when the water-jets were in operation. This system had one great flaw, the muzzle of the gun was usually over the open personnel compartment and as such submitted any occupants to a considerable amount of concussion and fumes. These ramps were absent in later production models. ** BTR-50P ‚Äì Converted into an artillery portee vehicle. This version carried its gun in the crew compartment, thus placing the muzzle of the gun outside the vehicle. While seen mostly carrying the 57 mm ZIS-2 anti-tank gun, there were also two other variants of this vehicle that carried anti-aircraft (AA) weapons. *** ZTPU-2 (zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka) ‚Äì BTR-50P converted into a self-propelled anti- aircraft gun (SPAAG), armed with twin ZPU-2 14.5 mm heavy machine guns (1,280 rounds). Prototype. *** ZTPU-4 (zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka) ‚Äì A BTR-50P converted into a SPAAG armed with quadruple ZPU-4 14.5 mm heavy machine guns (2,560 rounds). Prototype. ** BTR-50P ‚Äì Converted into a Forward Air Control vehicle with a second superstructure on top of the first. ** BTR-50P ‚Äì Converted into an NBC reconnaissance vehicle with a second superstructure on top of the first. ** BTR-50P ‚Äì Has a longer nose section. ** BTR-50PA (Ob'yekt 750M) (1954) ‚Äì BTR-50P armed with a 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun on a pintle mount at the front of the troop compartment. *** BTR-50PA with its heavy machine gun mounted on the commander's cupola. ** BTR-50PK (Ob'yekt 750K) (K stands for krisha ‚Äì \\"roof\\") (1958) ‚Äì A BTR-50P fitted with an armored roof, the troops mounting and dismounting the vehicle via two rectangular roof hatches that open to either side. There is also another rectangular roof hatch at the front of the roof. It was armed with a pintle-mounted 7.62 mm SGMB medium machine gun. This variant has an NBC protection system. The vehicle had two ventilators, one at the front of the troop compartment on the right and one at the rear, also on the right. It is likely that these vehicles were mostly upgraded from BTR-50Ps. Another production run of the BTR-50PK had a single firing port on each side of the superstructure. They were rarely seen in use as APCs as the majority consisted of specialized variants, such as command vehicles, before being replaced by another batch with two firing ports on each side of the superstructure. *** BTR-50PK ‚Äì Fitted with a locater light in the center of the engine deck. This variant was issued to Soviet marine and assault river crossing units. *** BTR-50PK ‚Äì Converted into a training vehicle with four cupolas on top of the roof. *** BTR-50PK ‚Äì Has a longer nose section. Used by marine units. *** UR-67 (ustanovka razminirovaniya) ‚Äì Mine- clearing vehicle equipped with a UR-67 rocket launcher system which has three launchers firing UZP-67 or UZR-3 tubes filled with explosives. The UZP-67 or UZR-3 are carried in a fabric tube container carried inside the hull. The mine clearing procedure is composed of driving the vehicle to the edge of the minefield and aligning it before the rockets are fired from its elevated launcher at the rear of the vehicle. The rocket tows the line charge, which is secured to the launcher vehicle, across the minefield. The line charge is then positioned by the vehicle crew and detonated to clear any mines in its vicinity. The cleared lane is usually 60 m to 150 m long and 2 m to 5 m wide. The vehicle has a crew of three. Some of the vehicles were based on the BTR-50PK, others were based on the PT-76. They were known in the west as the MTK and MTK-1. Only a small number remain in service, most have been replaced by the UR-77. *** BTR-50PN (1958) ‚Äì Early command vehicle with three radios (including an R-113) and three whip antennas. Only a small number were built. *** BTR-50PU (mashina upravleniya) (1959) ‚Äì Unarmed command vehicle. It carries a crew of 10 and has an armored roof with oval hatches and four whip antennas. Most of the BTR-50PUs have two projecting bays on the front of the vehicle (the respective NATO codes are: BTR-50PU(1) and BTR-50PU(2)). The two bays are the same shape, unlike in the OT-62 TOPAS, which is otherwise very similar in appearance. The vehicle has ten seats, of which four are for the commander and his staff, four are for the radio operators and two are for the vehicle's commander and driver. The staff compartment has a collapsible table, a second small table for the commander, two hammocks and three ladders. An emergency escape hatch is provided in the floor of the vehicle and the vehicle has thermal insulation. Specialized equipment consists of KN-2 and KP-2 navigation devices; an AB-1-P/30 1 kW generator (located on the rear engine deck); R-105, R-105U and R-113 VHF radios; a R-112 HF transceiver, a R-311 HF receiver; a collapsible 11 m mast antenna for the R-105U; a light 10 m telescopic mast for the R-112; a R-403BM relay-set; R-120 intercom and a P-193A 10-line field telephone switchboard with six TAI-43 field telephones and four cable reels, each with 600 m of two-wire cable. The navigation system includes a gyro course indicator and course plotter (the former indicates the vehicle's course, the latter plots it on a rectangular co-ordinate system). Some vehicles have different numbers of stowage boxes in different arrangements on the rear engine decks. Some vehicles have a second generator. **** BTR-50PU with a longer nose section. **** BTR-50PU-2 ‚Äì An improved version with more modern radio equipment, most probably the R-123 and the R-130M. It is externally similar to the BTR-50PU, but has a portable generator located immediately behind the troop compartment. **** BTR-50PUM ‚Äì A modernised variant, it is equipped with a large AMU telescopic antenna mast and R-123 (3√ó), R-130, R-326, R-405D and T-218 radios.

It features improvements in firepower and mobility, both of which can be carried out independently. Improvements in firepower are achieved by adding one of two new fighting modules (turrets), both of which are armed with one 30 mm ZTM1 or 2A72 autocannon, one 7.62 mm KT or PKT coaxial machine gun, one 9K113 Konkurs (NATO: AT-5 Spandrel) ATGM and one 30 mm AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher. Both main guns are stabilized in the vertical axis (the second variant has a two axis stabilization) and have electro-mechanical aiming drives. Both have a maximum effective range of 4,000 m and can be elevated or depressed between ‚àí10¬∞ and +60¬∞ or ‚àí4¬∞ and +60¬∞. The vehicle carries 150 rounds (the second variant carries 350 rounds). Both machine guns have a maximum effective range of 1,600 m. The vehicle carries 2,000 rounds in four batches of 500, (the second variant carries the same quantity of ammunition but in two batches of 1,000 rounds). The ATGM system has a minimum range of 100 m and maximum range of 4,000 m with four missiles. The automatic grenade launcher has a maximum range of 1,700 m. The vehicle uses a number of instruments with its armament. These include the TKN-5 day/night sight with a laser rangefinder, the PZU-7 day sight for firing at air and ground targets and the 9Sh119M1 anti-tank guided missile system sight. Mobility is improved by replacing the Soviet-built engine with the UTD-20 6-cylinder 4-stroke V-type water-cooled diesel engine built in the Ukraine, replacing the gearbox with a planetary system and installing hydraulic volumetric transmission. The suspension has also been improved by adding three return rollers. The vehicle has a new system of air intakes and exhausts on the left hand side of the front of the engine deck. This upgrade can also be applied to BTR-50PU vehicles. This vehicle has a greater combat capability, lower fuel consumption and a higher power-to-weight ratio. The vehicle can operate in temperatures between ‚àí40 ¬∞C and +55 ¬∞C and has an increased road speed of 75 km/h. As a result of all these changes the vehicle is now higher‚Äî3,085 m (the second variant is 2,895 m) and heavier‚Äî16.6 tonnes (the second variant weighs 16.8 tonnes). There are also additional improvements which can be carried out at customer's request. Those include adding kevlar- type spall liner to improve vehicle's protection, navigation system for improving tactical mobility and air conditioning system for improving crew comfort and allowing easier operation in hot climate.

Joseph F. Rutherford, second president of the Watch Tower Society, condemned politicians, business leaders and clergy in their support of the League of Nations. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the United Nations will soon destroy all other religions, and then turn against Jehovah's Witnesses.  History of teaching  =Development= At a convention of Bible Students held in September 1919, the local press reported J. F. Rutherford's comments on the League of Nations: \\"He declared a League of Nations formed by the political and economic forces, moved by a desire to better mankind by establishment of peace and plenty would accomplish great good, and then asserted that the Lord's displeasure is certain to be visited upon the League, because the clergy--Catholic and Protestant--have abandoned his plan and endorsed the League of Nations, hailing it as the political expression of Christ's kingdom on earth.\\"From the Sandusky, Ohio, Star Journal as quoted in the October 1, 1919 Watch Tower, p. 298 Rutherford's view was similarly held by other pre-millennialist expositors of that era.\\"Such a League of Nations, for instance, as is proposed to-day as a panacea for national wrongs, not only has been foretold in Scripture as the last resource of international politics, but its failure has likewise been predicted.\\"-- C.F. Hogg and W.E. Vine, Touching the Coming of the Lord, London 1919, p. 95. The Bible Student magazine Golden Age referred to the \\"professional politician\\" and the \\"financial powers\\" and the \\"clergy\\" as an \\"unholy trinity\\" in support of the League of Nations and predicted its demise: \\"Since these two classes [politicians and financial] are presumed to be worldly men who never claimed to have made a covenant with God, he might not interfere with them for a time, but chiefly because of the other member of the unholy trinity‚Äîthe clergy‚ÄîGod indicates that he will not permit the League of Nations and league of churches to endure.\\"September 9, 1920 Golden Age, p. 722 In 1930, Rutherford published the booklet Prohibition and the League of Nations--Born of God or the Devil, Which? The Bible Proof which concluded: \\"Here is the positive and unqualified statement from Jehovah God that neither the League of Nations nor any other combination of men and governments shall have anything to do with the setting up of his kingdom and establishing peace and righteousness. It is God‚Äôs kingdom, and not man‚Äôs; and for men to assume to do what God has declared he will do is a gross, presumptuous sin. The nation organization that attempts to run ahead of God and presumptuously attempts to set up a rule or organization and call it God‚Äôs kingdom will suffer severe punishment.\\" In a speech given on 20 September 1942, Nathan Knorr, the Society's third president, claimed the newly formed United Nations was the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation that would be ridden by the woman \\"Babylon\\", which Knorr identified as \\"the religious organization with headquarters at Vatican City\\". = 1963 resolution = In 1963 Jehovah's Witnesses adopted a resolution establishing the official view of the United Nations. The resolution was published in the November 15, 1963 issue of Watchtower. At 24 assemblies held throughout the year, a total of 454,977 convention attendees adopted the resolution. Regarding the United Nations, paragraph 5 of that resolution states, \\"the nations further refused the surrender of their sovereignty to God's Messianic kingdom by setting up ... the United Nations, ... This international organization stands for world sovereignty by political men. For years men without faith in God's kingdom have endeavored to get all people to worship this international image of human political sovereignty as the best hope for earthly peace and security, in fact, the last hope for humanity. To date 111 nations have given worship to this political image by becoming members of it. However, we, as witnesses of the Sovereign God Jehovah, will continue refusing to engage in such idolatrous worship.\\"  Current teaching  The flag of the United Nations Jehovah's Witnesses teach that the United Nations is the \\"image of the wild beast\\" referred to in and the fulfillment of the \\"disgusting thing that causes desolation\\" from . Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God will use the United Nations to destroy \\"false religion\\", wherein all institutionalized religions except Jehovah's Witnesses will be destroyed, which they refer to as the beginning of the great tribulation. They further believe that after all other religions are destroyed, \\"a coalition of nations\\" will then turn against Jehovah's Witnesses to destroy them, but Jehovah will intervene and destroy all political elements. They believe this act of divine intervention marks the beginning of Armageddon. In practice, Jehovah's Witnesses \\"view the United Nations organization as they do other governmental bodies of the world,\\" as \\"superior authorities\\" that \\"exist by God's permission,\\" based on their interpretation of . They believe \\"this Scriptural position does not condone any form of disrespect toward governments or their officials,\\" to which they are to \\"render due respect,\\" and they \\"obey them as long as such obedience does not require that they sin against God.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses' interactions with the United Nations In February 1992, Jehovah's Witnesses' New York corporation, the Watchtower Society, was granted association as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) of the United Nations Department of Public Information (UN/DPI). The Watchtower Society requested termination of the association in October 2001, and the DPI disassociated the NGO on 9 October after the matter was reported in The Guardian. A UN/DPI letter dated March 4, 2004, states, \\"The principal purpose of association of non-governmental organizations with the United Nations Department of Public Information is the redissemination of information in order to increase public understanding of the principles, activities and achievements of the United Nations and its Agencies.\\" The letter explained that \\"[b]y accepting association with DPI, the organization agreed to meet criteria for association, including support and respect of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and commitment and means to conduct effective information programmes with its constituents and to a broader audience about UN activities.\\" The official site further notes that association with the UN/DPI \\"does not constitute their incorporation into the United Nations system, nor does it entitle associated organizations or their staff to any kind of privileges, immunities or special status.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses have appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee about sanctions against their members' activities. Between April 2013 and early April 2016, Jehovah's Witnesses submitted 48 appeals to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, complaining that punishments for sharing faith violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Felix Corley, Kazakhstan: Punished for worship meetings; UN appeals, Forum 18, 13 May 2016.

Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a desktop computer, laptop, PDA, or mobile phone and can be duplicated. (Contrast hardware tokens, where the credentials are stored on a dedicated hardware device and therefore cannot be duplicated (absent physical invasion of the device).) Because software tokens are something one does not physically possess, they are exposed to unique threats based on duplication of the underlying cryptographic material - for example, computer viruses and software attacks. Both hardware and software tokens are vulnerable to bot-based man-in- the-middle attacks, or to simple phishing attacks in which the one-time password provided by the token is solicited, and then supplied to the genuine website in a timely manner. Software tokens do have benefits: there is no physical token to carry, they do not contain batteries that will run out, and they are cheaper than hardware tokens. SecurityPro News Strong Authentication Retrieved on April 3, 2007.  Security architecture  There are two primary architectures for software tokens: shared secret and public-key cryptography. For a shared secret, an administrator will typically generate a configuration file for each end-user. The file will contain a username, a personal identification number, and the secret. This configuration file is given to the user. The shared secret architecture is potentially vulnerable in a number of areas. The configuration file can be compromised if it is stolen and the token is copied. With time-based software tokens, it is possible to borrow an individual's PDA or laptop, set the clock forward, and generate codes that will be valid in the future. Any software token that uses shared secrets and stores the PIN alongside the shared secret in a software client can be stolen and subjected to offline attacks. Shared secret tokens can be difficult to distribute, since each token is essentially a different piece of software. Each user must receive a copy of the secret, which can create time constraints. Some newer software tokens rely on public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography. This architecture eliminates some of the traditional weaknesses of software tokens, but does not affect their primary weakness (ability to duplicate). A PIN can be stored on a remote authentication server instead of with the token client, making a stolen software token no good unless the PIN is known as well. However, in the case of a virus infection the cryptographic material can be duplicated and then the PIN can be captured (via keylogging or similar) the next time the user authenticates. If there are attempts made to guess the PIN, it can be detected and logged on the authentication server, which can disable the token. Using asymmetric cryptography also simplifies implementation, since the token client can generate its own key pair and exchange public keys with the server.

Early life and education Bliss was born in Newton St Loe, Bath, Somerset. He was the son of Rev. William Bliss and Jane Monck (born Jane Bridges). Bliss was the grandson of Dr John Bliss M.D., a physician who specialised in the treatment of gout. The family owned a tweed mill (Bliss Tweed Mill) at Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. He was educated at Winchester from 1847 to 1852. He then went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1859 (receiving his M.A. in 1863. In 1868 he was awarded a BCL. In 1854, he edited The Parson. On 4 May 1859 he married Mary Jane Wray, daughter of Rev. Cyril Wray of St. Martin's, Liverpool. Over twenty years they were to have eleven children. Clergyman Bliss had a stammer. He therefore spent more than the usual time as a deacon. He was finally ordained by the Church of England in 1865. He served as Curate of Honington for four years from 1858, then moved to St James, Plymouth until 1865 and took the Vicarage of North Hinksey on the outskirts of Oxford in 1866. In 1867 Bliss published his first major work, The Canons of the First Four General Councils, in Greek and English. It warranted a second edition in 1869. Contact with Catholicism Bliss appeared to have very good prospects within the established church. He was the son of a clergyman, was blessed with a good education and had very useful contacts. He was being published. However, at Oxford he came into contact with the Oxford Movement. This group of High Churchmen originally attempted to show that the Church of England was a direct descendant of the Church established by the apostles. Many members of the group converted to Catholicism, including John Henry Newman. Bliss became curate to his uncle James at Plymouth. His uncle was a leading Anglo-Catholic. Bliss was increasingly turning towards Catholic theology and doubting the historical legitimacy of the Church of England. In 1869 he followed Newman into the Roman Catholic faith. He then secured the position of Keeper of Periodicals at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Work in the Vatican In 1877 the Public Record Office asked Bliss to go to Rome to do research in the Vatican Archives on its behalf. He accepted the offer and spent most of his time searching the mediaeval Papal Registers in order to find all the dealings between the Papacy and Great Britain and Ireland. This job required Bliss to spend nine months of each year in Rome and this became Bliss‚Äô habit until he died at the Via Delphini in 1911. His wife raised the children in England and remained an Anglican. At first the Papal bureaucrats were suspicious of an Englishmen. He won them over and by 1886 he was the English Tutor to Victor Emmanuel, heir to the Italian crown. He enjoyed cordial relations with the Italian Royal family. In the Vatican Bliss produced a series called the Calendar of The Entries in the Papal Registers Relating to British Isles Volumes I and II. These were entirely Bliss's work. He edited volumes III, IV, and V with collaborators. Other work Bliss also studied the transcripts of manuscripts in Milan and Stockholm. His work from these cities is still available in the Public Record Office. Overall, his output is an important source of material for mediaeval historians. Bliss is buried in Rome. His papers are kept at Downside Abbey.

An infrared detector is a detector that reacts to infrared (IR) radiation. The two main types of detectors are thermal and photonic (photodetectors). The thermal effects of the incident IR radiation can be followed through many temperature dependent phenomena. Bolometers and microbolometers are based on changes in resistance. Thermocouples and thermopiles use the thermoelectric effect. Golay cells follow thermal expansion. In IR spectrometers the pyroelectric detectors are the most widespread. The response time and sensitivity of photonic detectors can be much higher, but usually these have to be cooled to cut thermal noise. The materials in these are semiconductors with narrow band gaps. Incident IR photons can cause electronic excitations. In photoconductive detectors, the resistivity of the detector element is monitored. Photovoltaic detectors contain a p-n junction on which photoelectric current appears upon illumination. An infrared detector is hybridized by connecting it to a readout integrated circuit with indium bumps. This hybrid is known as a focal plane array.

Geography It is located on the N67 national secondary road. Today, the village amenities include a pub (Kilshanny House), a primary school (St. Augustine's NS) and the church of St Augustine. Nearby towns and villages are Ennistymon, Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora, Liscannor, Lahinch and Doolin. Parish The parish is part of the Barony of Corcomroe. Kilshanny is part of the parish of \\"Lisdoonvarna and Kilshanny\\" in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora. Parish churches are \\"Corpus Christi\\" in Lisdoonvarna, \\"Holy Rosary\\" in Doolin, \\"Our Lady of Lourdes\\" in Toovahera and \\"Saint Augustine's\\" in Kilshanny (built in 1893). Antiquities In Smithstown townland lie the ruins of Smithtown Castle (also known as Ballingown Castle), a former O'Brien stronghold. An attached house was inhabited until 1837, but has since fallen into ruin. In 1600, Hugh Roe O'Donnell stayed here before moving through Kilfenora to \\"lay waste the countryside around Corcomroe\\". Honora, daughter of Teige of Smithstown, by marriage became Honora Wingfield, ancestor of the family that held the title of Viscount Powerscourt. The castle is today available for rental as tourist accommodation.http://www.smithstowncastle.com/ Official website The ruined abbey church of Kilshanny is all that remains of an abbey that may have been founded by early Christian Seanach Garbh, but is traditionally ascribed to St Cuanna. In 1194, the abbey became subservient to Corcomroe Abbey and was dedicated to St Augustine. Its abbot, Florence, was named bishop of Kilfenora in 1273. In 1302, the church became the parish church of Kilshanny, so the abbey seems to have been dissolved by that point. The abbey properties and rights finally passed to one Robert Kinsman. North door and south window of the church are from the transitional period but the other surviving features, including the triple-light east window, are later. In Ballydeely townland lies a stone mound known as Carn Connachtach or Carn Mic Tails. It rises to around 8 meters and has a base diameter of almost 100 meters. Legends hold that the mound served as the place of inauguration for the chiefs of Corcomroe. There are also tales that it is the burial mound of a whole army from Connacht. Annals do record a battle nearby in 1573, between factions of the O'Briens, which was won by Teige O'Brien. However, the mound is likely of prehistoric origin and may contain Bronze Age cyst graves. It has not been excavated.

If f: X -> Y is an embedding, then the Thom space of the normal bundle of X in Y can be viewed as a tubular neighborhood of X in Y, and excision gives a map :u:H^*(B(N), S(N)) \\\\to H^*(Y, Y-B(N)) \\\\to H^*(Y) and :v:K(B(N), S(N)) \\\\to K(Y, Y-B(N)) \\\\to K(Y). The Gysin map for K-theory/cohomology is defined to be the composition of the Thom isomorphism with these maps. Since the theorem holds for the map from X to the Thom space of N, and since the Chern character commutes with u and v, the theorem is also true for embeddings. f: X -> Y. Finally, we can factor a general map f: X -> Y into an embedding :i: X \\\\to Y \\\\times S^{2n} and the projection :p: Y \\\\times S^{2n} \\\\to Y. The theorem is true for the embedding. The Gysin map for the projection is the Bott-periodicity isomorphism, which commutes with the Chern character, so the theorem holds in this general case also. Corollaries Atiyah and Hirzebruch then specialised and refined in the case X = a point, where the condition becomes the existence of a spin structure on Y. Corollaries are on Pontryagin classes and the J-homomorphism.

Whereas probability theory uses a single number, the probability, to describe how likely an event is to occur, this method uses two numbers: the upper probability of the event and the lower probability of the event. Because frequentist statistics disallows metaprobabilities, frequentists have had to propose new solutions. Cedric Smith and Arthur Dempster each developed a theory of upper and lower probabilities. Glenn Shafer developed Dempster's theory further, and it is now known as Dempster‚ÄìShafer theory or Choquet (1953). More precisely, in the work of these authors one considers in a power set, P(S)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, a mass function m : P(S)\\\\rightarrow R satisfying the conditions :m(\\\\varnothing) = 0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! ; \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\sum_{A \\\\in P(X)} m(A) = 1. \\\\,\\\\\\\\! In turn, a mass is associated with two non-additive continuous measures called belief and plausibility defined as follows: :\\\\operatorname{bel}(A) = \\\\sum_{B \\\\mid B \\\\subseteq A} m(B)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,;\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\operatorname{pl}(A) = \\\\sum_{B \\\\mid B \\\\cap A e \\\\varnothing} m(B) In the case where S is infinite there can be \\\\operatorname{bel} such that there is no associated mass function. See p. 36 of Halpern (2003). Probability measures are a special case of belief functions in which the mass function assigns positive mass to singletons of the event space only. A different notion of upper and lower probabilities is obtained by the lower and upper envelopes obtained from a class C of probability distributions by setting :\\\\operatorname{env_1}(A) = \\\\inf_{p \\\\in C} p(A)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,;\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\operatorname{env_2}(A) = \\\\sup_{p \\\\in C} p(A) The upper and lower probabilities are also related with probabilistic logic: see Gerla (1994).

'Berlin Radio Show') is one of the oldest industrial exhibitions in Germany. Between 1924 and 1939 it was an annual event, but from 1950 it was held every other year until 2005. Since then it has become an annual event again, held in September. Today it is one of world's leading trade shows for consumer electronics and home appliances. It offers the opportunity to exhibitors to present their latest products and developments to the general public. As a result of daily reporting in almost all the German media, the radio exhibition and the showcased technology receives a large amount of attention around the globe. In the course of its history, many world innovations were first seen at the exhibition. IFA is ‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs biggest tech show‚Äù. 245,000 visitors and 1,645 exhibitors attended IFA 2015.

Ordered by Dr. Joseph Goebbels, designed by Otto Griessing, sold by Gustav Seibt, it was presented at the tenth Berliner Funkausstellung on 18 August 1933, its price fixed at 76 Reichsmark (RM). 100,000 units were sold during the exhibition. In 1938 the DKE 38 (Deutscher Kleinempf√§nger 38, i.e. German miniature receiver 1938) followed, the price fixed at 35 RM. AEG, founded in 1883 by Emil Rathenau, showed the first practical audio tape recorder, the Magnetophon K1, at the August 1935 show. In 1939 the exhibition was called Grosse Deutsche Funk- und Fernseh-Ausstellung (Great German Radio and Television Exhibition). The Einheits-Fernseh-Empf√§nger E1, a TV set designed to be affordable for everybody, was introduced. Plans for large-scale manufacture were thwarted by the outbreak of World War II. Color TV was also introduced (a prototype), based on an invention by Werner Flechsig (cf. shadow mask). Multinational Dutch electronics corporation Philips introduced the compact audio cassette medium for audio storage and the first cassette recorder (the Philips EL3300), developed by ir.

Because of the complexities of the OS/360 and successors control program dispatcher, a TCB does not strictly perform all the functions of a Process control block, although it performs most of these. Rather, a TCB provides an anchor for a linked list of other, related request control blocks (RBs), the composite of which (i.e., the TCB plus the top-linked RB) performs the function of a Process control block. The Program status word may be stored in one control block (possibly a PRB, a Program Request Block), while the general purpose registers may be stored in the immediately preceding control block (an SVRB, Supervisor Call Request Block, an IRB, Interruption Request Block, or the TCB itself), depending upon the particular context. Once the control program's dispatcher selects a TCB to be dispatched, the context is determined and the general purpose registers are obtained from the appropriate control block, then the PSW is loaded from the appropriate control block thereby dispatching the unit of work. History With the introduction of MVS/370 and successor systems, a whole new environment was introduced: the Service Request Block (SRB), which generally has a higher priority than any Task Control Block, and, indeed, which itself has two distinct priorities: a Global SRB (priority over all local address space SRBs and TCBs) and a Local SRB (priority over only the local address space TCBs); and MVS's dispatcher must manage all of these with absolute consistency across as many as two processors (MVS/370) and as many as sixteen processors (successor systems). A TCB is a general-purpose instance of a Process control block in OS/360 and successor systems. An SRB is a highly optimized instance of a Process control block in MVS/370 and successor systems.

A scratchcard (also called a scratch off, scratch ticket, scratcher, scratchum, scratchie, scritchies, scratch-it, scratch game, scratch-and-win, instant game or instant lottery in different places) is a small card, often made of thin paper-based card for competitions and plastic to conceal PINs, where one or more areas contain concealed information which can be revealed by scratching off an opaque covering. Applications include cards sold for gambling (especially lottery games and quizzes), free-of-charge cards for quizzes, fraudulent free cards encouraging calls to premium rate phone services, and to conceal confidential information such as PINs for telephone calling cards (otherwise known as recharge cards) and other prepaid services. In some cases the entire scratchable area needs to be scratched to see whether a prize has been won‚Äîthe card is printed either to be a winner or not‚Äîor to reveal the secret code; the result does not depend upon what portions are scratched off. In other cases, some but not all areas have to be scratched; this may apply in a quiz, where the area corresponding to the right answer is scratched, or in some gambling applications where, depending on which areas are scratched, the card wins or loses. In these cases the card becomes invalid if too many areas are scratched. After losing one can scratch all areas to see if, how, and what one could have won with this card.  Technology  The scratchcard itself is made of paper-based card, or plastic, with hidden information such as PIN or HRN (Hidden Recharge Number) printed on it, covered by an opaque substance (usually latex). The original cards were covered with an environmentally unsafe solvent based coating. In the late 1980s, adhesive specialist Jerome Greenfield invented a safe water- based coating still used in scratchers today that can be scratched off relatively easily, while resistant to normal abrasion. Other types of scratch panel are scratch labels, hot stamp foil or 'sandwich' label which are technologies that is easy to produce for manufacturers without specialised equipment for applying latex panels. Unlike silkscreen latex panels that bond with the card body, labels are distinctly separate to the card body and applied by adhesion which makes them prone to sophisticated and fraudulent manipulation. https://www.slideshare.net/NigelPageMIEx/scratching-the-surface- white-paperrecharge-card-security-npagedec2010  Gambling and quizzes  = Origins = The original game tickets were produced using manual randomization techniques. In 1974 the American company Scientific Games Corporation led by scientist John Koza and retail promotions specialist Daniel Bower produced the first computer-generated instant lottery game. In 1987, Astro-Med, Inc. of West Warwick, Rhode Island, received the U.S. Patent for the instant scratch- off lottery ticket.United States Patent 4,643,454 Simple prize scratchcards require the player, for example, to scratch off three (or more) areas hiding numbers, symbols, etc. If all the items revealed are the same, a prize has been won. More complicated scratchcards have several different ways to win on one card. Other scratchcards involve matching symbols, pictures or words, or are adaptations of popular (card-)games such as blackjack, poker or Monopoly. Games are also tied to popular themes such as Harley Davidson, Major League Baseball, NASCAR, the National Hockey League, Marvel Comics and FIFA World Cup. There are currently two major manufacturers of game tickets: Scientific Games Corporation, with production facilities in the USA, Chile, UK, Germany, Canada, Brazil and Australia; and Pollard Banknote, with production facilities in the USA and Canada. There are several other smaller manufacturers in North America, Europe, and Asia. = Popularity = Scratchcards are a very popular form of gambling due to their low cost and the opportunity to win instantly, as opposed to waiting for a drawing like many lotteries. There is a trend towards more expensive scratchcards (20-50 USD) that have prizes in the millions of dollars. However, many such \\"instant\\" tickets sold in the US, especially in Massachusetts and New York, do not pay top prizes \\"instantly,\\" but rather over many years, with no cash option. The popularity of lottery scratchcards has been increasing at a greater rate than any other form of lottery. = Predictability = In the 21st century there have been attempts to increase the odds on finding a prize-winning card based on statistics, by tracking the amount of prize money won and cards sold to calculate accurate current odds. There have been a number of instances where a series of cards are still available although all major prizes have been won. Some lotteries make this information available to all free of charge to help promote their games Washington's Lottery. Financial Report 2016. Hypothetically, large early payouts may exceed ultimate sales before expiration of the game card series. However, the low odds of winning ‚Äì typically from less than 1 in 5 to about 1 in 2.5 ‚Äì and players who buy cards unaware of the low return offset these losses, so the lottery still makes a profit. = Second-chance sweepstakes = Many state lotteries also run a second-chance sweepstakes in conjunction with the retail sale of state lottery scratchcards in an effort to increase consumer demand for scratchcards and to help control the litter problems associated with the improper disposal of non-winning lottery tickets.Tennessee Lottery. Play It Again Program ‚Äì FAQ. Since lottery tickets and scratchcards are considered in the United States to be bearer instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code, these scratchcard promotions can be entered with non-winning tickets that are picked up as litter. = Break opens = Break Opens, also known as breakopens, break open cards, strip tickets, pull-tabs, nevada tickets or in some Bingo Halls as \\"pickles\\" are lottery or bingo cards on which there are concealed letters, numbers, or symbols that have been predetermined as winners. The cards are often made of cardboard and contain perforated cover window tabs, behind which the combinations are printed. The purchaser must \\"break open\\" the card, or pull up the pull-tabs, to see the information printed within, and then must confirm with winning combinations printed on the back of the card, various cards may have come from the printer highlighted as winning under the tabs. The winning combination will be highlighted, making the identification of winning tickets easier. = Online gambling scratchcards = By around 2010 online versions of virtual \\"scratchcard\\" (not physical cards) gambling games which utilized Macromedia Flash and Java to simulate scratching a card on a computer were available. Virtual cards could be bought, and prizes collected, over an Internet connection.www.play-scratchcards.co.uk describing different Internet scratchcards. Encourages play, but not associated with any one provider. = Fraudulent practices = A widespread misuse of scratchcards is the free-of- charge distribution of cards offering a range of prizes, ranging from extremely low-value to very desirable; for example from time-limited discount vouchers redeemable only through a specified agent to cars. Cards always reveal that a prize has been won, but the nature and value of the prize can only be determined by phoning a premium rate telephone claim line costing a significant sum per minute. Calls to this number are designed by the promoter always to take several minutes, and the prize won is, in reality, always of far less value than the cost of the call, and usually not worth claiming. Regulatory authorities for telephone services have been taking action against such schemes, issuing warnings and large fines. = Games sold with claimed jackpots = Over the years, many lotteries have continued to sell scratch games, while failing to disclose that the larger prizes or jackpot have already been claimed in order to discourage players from no longer playing a won scratch game, though before the 2000s and direct connections between the lottery and their sales terminals could be made, there was no expectation of this to be known. In February 2018 it was reported that some scratch cards in the UK are still sold even after the jackpots have already been won. Research by The Guardian newspaper found that the ¬£250,000 Gold game, which advertises 15 top prizes worth a quarter of a million pounds each, were still being sold after all 15 jackpots had been claimed. This happened again in May 2018, in which the 20X Cash Scratchcard was still being sold after the last jackpot prize was claimed. . Many lotteries since the start of the 2010s have begun to have their retailers print out up-to-date game lists from their terminals daily or weekly (often with the force of state, provincial, or national law after consumer watchdog organizations or television station investigative units have exposed the practice), which note games where jackpots have already been won or which have large prizes left, along with up-to-date winners' lists on their websites.  Cards hiding confidential information  Scratchcards can also be used to distribute confidential information, without any element of chance or skill. A common example is the phone card or recharge card sold for a price which provides specified phone call usage. The card itself, unlike a credit card, has no function in itself; it is simply a vehicle to inform the purchaser confidentially of the PIN required to make the phone calls paid for.

The ship was laid down in June 1925, was launched in October 1926, and was commissioned in December 1928. Trieste was very lightly armored, with only a thick armored belt, though she possessed a high speed and heavy armament of eight guns. Though nominally built under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, the two cruisers significantly exceeded the displacement limits imposed by the treaty. The ship spent the 1930s conducting training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea, participating in naval reviews held for foreign dignitaries, and serving as the flagship of the Cruiser Division. She also helped transport Italian volunteer troops that had been sent to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War return to Italy in 1938. The ship saw extensive action during World War II, including the battles of Cape Spartivento and Cape Matapan in November 1940 and March 1941, respectively. Trieste was also employed to escort convoys to supply Italian forces in North Africa; during one of these operations in November 1941, she was torpedoed by a British submarine. On 10 April 1943, while the ship was moored in La Maddalena, Sardinia, she was bombed and sunk by American heavy bombers. Her superstructure was cut away and she was refloated in 1950; the Spanish Navy purchased the hull in 1952, with plans to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier, though the plan came to nothing due to the growing costs of the project. She was ultimately broken up by 1959. Design Line-drawing of the Trento class Trieste was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. She had a crew of 723 officers and enlisted men, though during the war this increased to 781. Her power plant consisted of four Parsons steam turbines powered by twelve oil- fired Yarrow boilers, which were trunked into two funnels amidships. Her engines were rated at for a top speed of , but on sea trials only reached .Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 291 That speed could only be reached on a very light displacement, and in service, her practical top speed was only . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of She was protected with an armored belt that was thick amidships with armored bulkheads thick on either end. Her armor deck was thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to at either end. The gun turrets had thick plating on the faces and the supporting barbettes they sat in were thick. The main conning tower had 100 mm thick sides. Trieste was armed with a main battery of eight Mod 24 50-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and four guns. In addition to the gun armament, she carried eight torpedo tubes in four deck mounted twin launchers. She carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located in under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.Brescia, p. 72 Triestes secondary battery was revised several times during her career. The 100 mm guns were replaced with newer Mod 31 versions of the same caliber. In 1937-1938, the two aft-most 100 mm guns were removed, along with all four 12.7 mm machine guns; eight 54-cal. Breda M1932 guns and eight Breda M1931 machine guns, all in twin mounts, were installed in their place. In 1943, the ship received eight 65-cal.

The completed hull was launched on 24 October 1926, a year before her sister . After fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 21 December 1928. On 16 May 1929 she joined Trento in the newly created Cruiser Division for a cruise in the northern Mediterranean Sea that lasted until 4 June. On 1 October, Trieste became the flagship of the 1st Squadron. In mid-1931, she entered the shipyard in La Spezia for an overhaul that included the replacement of her tripod foremast with a more stable five-legged version. On 6 and 7 July 1933, Trieste, Trento, and the four s held a naval review for the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in the Gulf of Naples. On 2 December 1933, Trieste, Trento, and the heavy cruiser formed the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron. The unit was renamed the 3rd Division in July 1934.Hogg & Wiper, p. 10 On 18 June 1935, Trieste temporarily relieved Trento as the divisional flagship. Mussolini took a short tour of Italian Libya from 10 to 12 March 1937, and Trieste was among the vessels to escort him. On 7 June, she took part in a major naval review held during the visit of German Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg. The ship became the 2nd Squadron flagship on 15 February 1938. On 5 May, another naval review was held in the Gulf of Naples, this time for the state visit of German dictator Adolf Hitler. On 12 October 1938, Trieste steamed out of Messina with the 10th Destroyer Squadron, bound for Cadiz, Spain. There, they met four Italian merchant ships on 15 October, which embarked 10,000 members of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (Corps of Volunteer Troops) that had been sent to support General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. The convoy left Cadiz on 16 October and arrived back in Naples on the 20th. On 17 May 1939, Trieste took part in another fleet review, this one for Prince Paul of Yugoslavia during his visit to Italy. From 5 to 19 June, Trieste joined the rest of the fleet in Livorno for the first celebration of Navy Day on 10 June. From October to December, the ship underwent a major refit, which included modifications to her armament and the installation of funnel caps. =World War II= On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France, formally entering World War II. The heavy cruiser replaced Trieste as the squadron flagship, which in turn became the flagship of the 3rd Division, which also included Trento and Bolzano. These four cruisers deployed north of Sicily to patrol for Allied vessels on Italy's first day of the war. On 31 August, the 3rd Division sortied to intercept the British convoy from Alexandria to Malta in Operation Hats, though the Italian fleet broke off the operation without encountering the merchant ships. Trieste arrived back in Taranto on 2 September. She was present there on the night of 11-12 November, when the British raided the port, and she emerged undamaged. Trieste sortied with the fleet on 26 November in an attempt to intercept another convoy to Malta.Greene & Massignani, p. 116 The following morning, a reconnaissance floatplane from Bolzano located the British squadron.Mattesini, p. 114 Shortly after 12:00, Italian reconnaissance reports informed the Italian fleet commander, Vice Admiral Inigo Campioni of the strength of the British fleet, and so he ordered his ships to disengage. By this time, Trieste and the other heavy cruisers had already begun engaging their British counterparts in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, and had scored two hits on the cruiser , the second of which is credited to either Trieste or Trento.Greene & Massignani, p. 119O'Hara, pp. 70-71 The battlecruiser intervened, and quickly straddled Trieste twice, though she inflicted only splinter damage.Stern, p. 62 This forced Campioni to commit the battleship , which in turn forced the British cruisers to break off the action, allowing both sides to disengage.O'Hara, p. 72 On 9 February 1941, Trieste sortied with the rest of the 2nd Squadron to search for Force H after the latter had shelled Genoa; the Italians returned to port without success. On 12-13 March, Trieste escorted a fast convoy to North Africa. Battle of Cape Matapan Map showing the movements of the Italian and British fleets On 27 March, the division sortied with the rest of the fleet for a major sweep toward the island of Crete. During the operation, Trieste flew the flag of Rear Admiral Luigi Sansonetti.Bennett, p. 119 At 06:55 on the 28th, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by Vittorio Veneto located a British cruiser squadron, and by 07:55, Trento and the 3rd Division had come within visual range. Seventeen minutes later, the Italian cruisers opened fire from a range of , initiating the first phase of the Battle of Cape Matapan; in the span of the next forty minutes, Trieste fired a total of 132 armor-piercing shells, though trouble with her rangefinders and the extreme range of the action prevented her from scoring any significant hits.Greene & Massignani, pp. 150‚Äì151Bennett, p. 120 At 08:55, the Italian fleet commander, Vice Admiral Angelo Iachino instructed Sansonetti to break off the action with the British cruisers and turn northwest, to lure the British vessels into range for Vittorio Veneto. By about 11:00, Vittorio Veneto had closed the distance enough to open fire, prompting Sansonetti to turn his three cruisers back to join the fight. The 6-inch-gun-armed British cruisers were outmatched both by the Italian heavy cruisers and Vittorio Veneto, and they quickly reversed course. While the two sides were still maneuvering, a group of British torpedo bombers from Crete arrived and unsuccessfully attacked Trieste and the rest of her division shortly after 12:00.Bennett, pp. 120-121 Further attacks from the aircraft carrier convinced Iachino to break off the action and withdraw at 12:20.Greene & Massignani, pp. 152‚Äì153 Later in the day, Vittorio Veneto and Pola were torpedoed by British aircraft, the latter left immobilized. Trieste, Trento, and Bolzano were also attacked by aircraft, but they escaped without damage. Trieste reached Taranto in company with the damaged Vittorio Veneto at 15:30 the following day. in the meantime, Pola and two other Zara-class cruisers were destroyed in the night action with British battleships late on the 28th. Convoy operations From 24 to 30 April, Trieste and Bolzano escorted a convoy to North Africa. A combination of heavy seas and the presence of British warships forced the convoy to shelter in Palermo, Messina, and Augusta in Sicily before being able to make the crossing to Tripoli. A month later, the two cruisers covered another convoy; for the return leg of the voyage, the ships joined a second convoy also returning to Italy. Another convoy made the crossing on 8-9 June, again escorted by Trieste and Bolzano, along with the destroyers , , and . Trieste and the heavy cruiser and the vessels of the 12th Destroyer Squadron covered four ocean liners that had been converted into troopships on 25 June; heavy British air attacks that night forced the convoy to return to Taranto. A second attempt was made on 27 June, and the ships successfully reached Tripoli on the morning of the 29th. Heavy air attacks targeted the ships while they were unloading the following day, but the ships were able to complete the task, depart that day, and reach Taranto on 1 July. From 16 to 20 July, Trieste, Bolzano, Ascari, Corazziere, and the destroyer covered another fast convoy to Tripoli. On 22 August, Trieste sortied with other elements of the Italian fleet to try to locate Force H; they returned to port four days later empty handed. In late September, the British sent another convoy to reinforce Malta, codenamed Operation Halberd; the Italian fleet sortied on 26 September to try to intercept it, but broke off the operation upon discovering the strength of the British escort force. Trieste took part in the Duisberg convoy on 8-9 November along with Trento, the two ships serving as the convoy's covering force. The convoy was attacked by British warships in the early hours of 9 November, though the covering force failed to intervene and the convoy was destroyed.Hogg & Wiper, pp. 10-11Brescia, p. 48 Trieste escorted another convoy to Libya on 21 November in company with the light cruiser . Late that evening, the convoy came under a combined submarine and aircraft attack; at 23:12, Trieste was torpedoed by the submarine , and a torpedo bomber hit Duca degli Abruzzi shortly thereafter. The two damaged vessels were escorted back to Messina by the cruiser and the destroyer , arriving at around 08:00 the next morning. After repairs were completed, Trieste joined Bolzano and Gorizia --the only other surviving heavy cruisers in the fleet--in the reorganized 3rd Division. The ships sortied with eight destroyers on 12 August 1942 to try to intercept a British convoy; while turning back after the operation was cancelled, Bolzano and one of the destroyers were torpedoed by a British submarine.Hogg & Wiper, p. 11 Fate On 10 April 1943, while moored in La Maddalena, Sardinia, Trieste came under attack from B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from the United States Army Air Forces. She received several hits at 13:45, and at 16:13 she capsized to starboard and sank in the shallow water. Casualties were relatively light, with 66 men killed or missing--of those, three were officers, eight were non-commissioned officers, and fifty-five were enlisted sailors--and 66 wounded--eight NCOs and fifty-eight sailors.Sanna, p. 11 The ship remained on the naval register until 18 October 1946, when she was formally stricken. Salvage operations began in 1950, starting with the removal of the ship's superstructure. The hull was then made watertight, was refloated, still capsized, and was towed to La Spezia. There, the ship was righted, and upon inspection, the shipyard workers discovered that fuel oil that had leaked into the engine rooms had preserved the machinery. The Spanish Navy purchased the hull and towed it to Cartagena and then to Ferrol in 1952 to convert Trieste into a light aircraft carrier. The cost of the project proved to be prohibitive, and in 1956 the Spanish Navy sold the vessel for scrap; the ship was broken up by 1959.

The ship was laid down in February 1925, launched in October 1927, and was commissioned in April 1929. Trento was very lightly armored, with only a thick armored belt, though she possessed a high speed and heavy armament of eight guns. Though nominally built under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, the two cruisers significantly exceeded the displacement limits imposed by the treaty. Trento frequently served as the flagship of the Cruiser Division throughout the 1930s. During the pre-war period, she also made lengthy trips abroad, including a tour of South America from May to October 1929 and a deployment to China from January to June 1932 to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. She also took part in numerous naval reviews held for visiting foreign leaders. After Italy entered World War II in June 1940, Trento saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea, including at the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan in July and November 1940 and March 1941, respectively. She was also present during the inconclusive First and Second Battles of Sirte, and at the latter she severely damaged a British destroyer. Trento was also frequently tasked with escorting convoys to supply Italian forces in North Africa as well as interdicting British convoys to Malta. During one of the latter missions to attack the British Operation Harpoon convoy in June 1942, Trento was torpedoed twice, first by a Bristol Beaufighter torpedo bomber and then sunk by the submarine with very heavy loss of life. Design Line- drawing of Trento Trento was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. She had a crew of 723 officers and enlisted men, though during the war this increased to 781. Her power plant consisted of four Parsons steam turbines powered by twelve oil- fired Yarrow boilers, which were trunked into two funnels amidships. Her engines were rated at for a top speed of .Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 291 On trials, she reached only , and in service, her practical top speed was only . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of She was protected with an armored belt that was thick amidships with armored bulkheads thick on either end. Her armor deck was thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to at either end. The gun turrets had thick plating on the faces and the supporting barbettes they sat in were thick. The main conning tower had 100 mm thick sides. Trento was armed with a main battery of eight Mod 24 50-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and four machine guns. In addition to the gun armament, she carried eight torpedo tubes in four deck mounted twin launchers. She carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located in under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.Brescia, p. 72 Trentos secondary battery was revised several times during her career. The 100 mm guns were replaced with newer Mod 31 versions of the same caliber. In 1937-1938, the two aft-most 100 mm guns were removed, along with all four 12.7 mm machine guns; eight 54-cal. Breda M1932 guns and eight Breda M1931 machine guns, all in twin mounts, were installed in their place. In 1942, the ship received four 65-cal. Breda M1940 guns in single mounts.Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 291-292Campbell, pp. 345-347 Service history The keel for Trento was laid down at the Odero Terni Orlando shipyard on 8 February 1925. The completed hull was scheduled to be launched on 4 September 1927, but sabotage from anti-fascist workers in the shipyard, who had mixed sand into the grease on the slipway, preventing the ship from sliding down into the water. After repeated attempts to complete the launching, the shipyard had to resort to dragging Trento from the slipway on 4 October 1927 using the passenger ship . After fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 3 April 1929.Hogg & Wiper, p. 2 On 11 May 1929, Trento became the flagship of the Cruiser Division; five days later, she and her sister began a cruise in the northern Mediterranean, which included a stop in Barcelona. The two cruisers returned to La Spezia on 4 June. Trento started a much more ambitious cruise the following month, departing Italian waters on 23 July, bound for South America. Over the following three months, she visited Cape Verde, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Bah√≠a Blanca, Las Palmas, and Tangiers, before arriving back in Italy on 10 October. Trento (center) and (background) underway On 15 September 1930, Trento embarked on a cruise to the eastern Mediterranean that concluded in La Spezia on 21 November. In mid-1931, she entered the drydock in La Spezia for modifications to her tripod foremast; a sturdier five-legged version was installed to reduce vibration in the fire control director. On 28 January 1932, Trento steamed to Gaeta, where she and the destroyer took on a contingent from the San Marco Battalion. The two ships then departed, bound for China, where they reinforced the Italian Far East Division, which included the old protected cruiser and the gunboats and . The force was tasked with protecting Italian nationals in the country during the Chinese Civil War. The ships stopped in Port Said, Aden, Colombo, and Singapore en route to Shanghai, where they arrived on 4 March. From 26 April to 1 May, Trento visited Nagasaki, Japan. Two weeks later, on 14 May, Trento left Shanghai to return to Italy, arriving in La Spezia on 30 June. On 6-7 July 1933, Trento took part in a major fleet review held in the Gulf of Naples for Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Trento became the flagship of the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron on 2 December. The ship visited Durazzo on 23-26 June 1934, and on 1 July, became the flagship of the 3rd Division. She made another cruise in the eastern Mediterranean from 8 to 20 March 1935, during which she made calls in Rhodes and Leros. On 18 June, Trieste temporarily relieved Trento as the divisional flagship. Another naval review was held in the Gulf of Naples on 27 November 1936, to honor the Regent of Hungary, Mikl√≥s Horthy, who was visiting Italy at the time. Trieste again replaced Trento as the flagship on 27 January 1937. From 10 to 12 March 1937, Mussolini took a short tour of Italian Libya aboard the heavy cruiser , escorted by Trento. The two cruisers stopped in Benghazi, Tripoli, and Ra's Lanuf during the trip. The ship participated in another fleet review on 5 May 1938, this one held in honor of German dictator Adolf Hitler's state visit to Italy. Another review, for Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, was conducted on 17 May 1939 in the Gulf of Naples. From 5 to 19 June, Trento joined the rest of the fleet in Livorno for the first celebration of Navy Day on 10 June. Another cruise in the eastern Mediterranean followed on 9 July, during which Trento stopped in Tripoli, Tobruk, Rhodes, and Leros, before returning to Taranto on the 29th of the month. From October to December, the ship underwent a major refit, which included modifications to her armament and the installation of funnel caps. =World War II= Trento and Trieste in the late 1930s, seen from the stern of a torpedo boat On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on France and Britain, joining its ally Germany in World War II. At that time, Trento was stationed in Messina, once again the flagship of the 3rd Division. The following day, Trento and the rest of the 3rd Division joined the 6th Division for a patrol in the Strait of Sicily, where they laid a minefield. On 8 July, the 3rd Division escorted a convoy to Libya, along with the battleships of the 1st Division; the next day, the returning warships collided with a heavily protected British convoy. In the ensuing Battle of Calabria, Trento engaged British cruisers and was heavily attacked by British aircraft, though she emerged undamaged. A force of 120 Italian aircraft arrived after both fleets had disengaged, and some Italian pilots accidentally attacked Italian vessels, prompting the fleet to paint red stripes on the forecastles of each ship. Another convoy to Libya, which passed without incident, followed on 30 July, with Trento returning to Messina on 1 August. On 31 August, the 3rd Division sortied to intercept the British convoys in Operation Hats, though the Italian fleet broke off the operation without encountering the merchant ships. Trento arrived back in Taranto on 2 September. Early on the morning of 12 October, Italian destroyers and torpedo boats engaged a pair of British cruisers in the Battle of Cape Passero; one of the destroyers, , was badly damaged in the action. Trento, Trieste, and were ordered to relieve the Italian light forces at 08:00, though this was far too late to save Artigliere, which was sunk about an hour later.O'Hara, p. 61 While on the way back, British aircraft attacked the Italian cruisers without success. On 21 October, Trento was moved to Taranto, and she was present in the harbor on the night of 11-12 November, when the British raided the port. During the attack, a single bomb hit the ship, though it failed to explode. It nevertheless damaged the forward 100 mm mount on the port side. On 26 November, Trento sortied with the fleet,Hogg & Wiper, pp. 2-3 in an attempt to intercept another convoy to Malta.Greene & Massignani, p. 116 The following morning, a reconnaissance floatplane from Bolzano located the British squadron.Mattesini, p. 114 Shortly after 12:00, Italian reconnaissance reports informed the Italian fleet commander, Vice Admiral Inigo Campioni of the strength of the British fleet, and so he ordered his ships to disengage.

This in turn forced the British cruisers to break off the action, allowing both sides to disengage.O'Hara, p. 72 Battle of Cape Matapan Map showing the movements of the Italian and British fleets The 3rd Division escorted another convoy to North Africa on 12-13 March 1941. Two weeks later, on 27 March, the division--at this time commanded by Rear Admiral Luigi Sansonetti--sortied with the rest of the fleet for a major sweep toward the island of Crete.Hogg & Wiper, p. 3Bennett, p. 119 At 06:55 on the 28th, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by Vittorio Veneto located a British cruiser squadron, and by 07:55, Trento and the 3rd Division had come within visual range. Seventeen minutes later, the Italian cruisers opened fire from a range of , initiating the first phase of the Battle of Cape Matapan; in the span of the next forty minutes, Trento fired a total of 204 armor-piercing shells, though trouble with her rangefinders and the extreme range of the action prevented her from scoring any significant hits.Greene & Massignani, pp. 150‚Äì151Bennett, p. 120 At 08:55, the Italian fleet commander, Vice Admiral Angelo Iachino instructed Sansonetti to break off the action with the British cruisers and turn northwest, to lure the British vessels into range for Vittorio Veneto.

She took part in the Duisberg convoy on 8-9 November along with Trieste, the two ships serving as the convoy's covering force. The convoy was attacked by British warships in the early hours of 9 November, though the covering force failed to intervene and the convoy was destroyed.Brescia, p. 48 Another convoy followed on 21 November, and during the crossing Trento helped to defend against a British air attack. Less than a month later, on 16 December, Trento joined most of the other heavy units of the fleet to escort two large convoys to Benghazi and Tripoli. The following day, the fleet encountered British forces covering a merchant ship steaming to Malta, leading to the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte. On 22 March 1942, Trento joined the battleship , the cruisers and , and several destroyers in an attempt to intercept a British convoy. In the Second Battle of Sirte, the four ships attacked Convoy MW10, but the British escorts--four light cruisers and eighteen destroyers--prevented the Italians from attacking the merchant ships. According to some sources, Trento scored a hit on the destroyer in this action, inflicting heavy damage.Brescia, p. 74 Two Italian destroyers, and , foundered in heavy weather after the battle; Trento attempted to come to their aid, but they sank before she could reach them. On 14 June, Trento left Taranto with Littorio, Vittorio Veneto, Gorizia, and the light cruisers and to attack the British convoy from Alexandria steaming to Malta in Operation Harpoon. The following morning, while steaming in the Ionian Sea, a British Bristol Beaufighter torpedo-bomber scored a hit on Trento at around 05:00. The torpedo caused a serious fire in the forward boiler rooms, which forced the ship to stop. Some of the escorting destroyers laid a smoke screen to hide the ship from further attacks and tried to tow her back to port, but at 09:10, the British submarine torpedoed the crippled cruiser. The forward magazines exploded, sinking Trento in a matter of minutes. Her rapid sinking doomed many of her crew, with some 549 men out of a wartime complement of 51 officers and 1,100 enlisted going down with the ship. Among the dead was her commander, Captain Stanislao Esposito. The other Italian warships managed to rescue 602 men, of whom around a third were wounded. Of those, 21 men later died of their wounds.Fioravanzo, p. 312 On 18 October 1946, the postwar Italian Navy formally struck Trento from the naval register.

A modified version of the earlier Trento class, she had a heavier displacement, slightly shorter length, a newer model of gun, and a more powerful propulsion system, among other differences influenced by the that had followed the Trentos. Bolzano was built by the Gio. Ansaldo & C. between her keel laying in June 1930 and her commissioning in August 1933. Bolzano had a fairly uneventful peacetime career, which primarily consisted of naval reviews for Italian and foreign dignitaries. She saw extensive action in the first three years of Italy's participation in World War II. She took part in the Battles of Calabria, Taranto, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. The ship was lightly damaged at Calabria, but she emerged from the other engagements unscathed. She also frequently escorted convoys to North Africa in 1941 and 1942 and patrolled for British naval forces in the central Mediterranean Sea. The ship was torpedoed twice by British submarines; the first, in July 1941, necessitated three months of repairs. The second, in August 1942, caused extensive damage and ended the ship's career. She was eventually towed back to La Spezia, where repairs were to be completed. Resources were unavailable, however, and Bolzano remained there, out of action. Plans to convert her into a hybrid cruiser- aircraft carrier came to nothing for the same reason. After Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, La Spezia was occupied by German forces; to prevent them from using her as a blockship, Italian and British frogmen sank Bolzano using Chariot manned torpedoes in June 1944. The Italian Navy ultimately raised the ship in September 1949 and broke her up for scrap. Design Bolzano was ordered under the 1929-1930 construction program; the Regia Marina had initially planned on building six heavy cruisers in the 1920s and 1930s, which comprised the and es. These vessels were to have operated as two three-ship cruiser divisions, but by 1929, the Regia Marina had decided to use as a temporary fleet flagship while the s were being rebuilt. As a result, the Regia Marina, which was under intense pressure from Gio. Ansaldo & C. for a construction contract, ordered a seventh heavy cruiser.Brescia, p. 80Ansaldo had to that point been left out of the cruiser construction program, the six previous cruisers having been built by STT and OTO. See: Brescia, p. 80 and Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 291-292 A new design was prepared that was based heavily on the Trento class, but also incorporated improvements from the Zara design. These included the new, longer gun, more powerful boilers, and a stepped up forecastle deck. The high command of the Regia Marina persisted in their belief that speed was more important than armor, and so the new vessel adopted a level of protection similar to the earlier Trentos rather than the more sturdily built Zaras. The sailors of the fleet referred to Bolzano as \\"un errore splendidamente riuscito--an error beautifully executed\\" owing to her weak armor protection. =General characteristics and machinery= Bolzano was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. She had a crew of 725 officers and enlisted men as originally configured, though her wartime complement increased to 28 officers and 788 enlisted men. The ship was fitted with two tripod masts, one atop the forward superstructure and the other just forward of the rear funnel. A large, rotating aircraft catapult was located amidships, between the two funnels.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 293 She could carry two or three IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance. Her power plant consisted of four Parsons geared steam turbines, which drove four screw propellers, and were powered by ten oil-fired water-tube boilers, which were trunked into two widely spaced funnels. Her engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . While on speed trials with a light displacement of , she reached from . Electricity was provided by generators with a total output of . =Armament and armor= Bolzano was armed with a main battery of eight Mod 29 53-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and eight guns in twin mounts. Bolzanos secondary battery was revised several times during her career. Two of the 100 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 54-cal. guns were installed in their place. The eight guns were replaced with four 65-cal. anti- aircraft guns in 1942. She also carried a battery of eight torpedo tubes mounted in four above-water, twin launchers. She was protected with an armored belt that was thick amidships, and capped with transverse, armored bulkheads on either end of the citadel. The forward bulkhead was and the aft was . Her armor deck was 50 mm thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to at either end. The gun turrets had thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were 60‚Äì70 mm thick. The main conning tower had 100 mm thick sides and a thick roof. Service history Bolzano shortly after completion The keel for Bolzano was laid down at Ansaldo's shipyard in Genoa on 11 June 1930, and her completed hull was launched on 31 August 1932. The ship was completed on 19 August 1933 and commissioned into the Italian fleet. On 2 December, Bolzano joined and in the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron. The ship received her battle flag on 29 June 1934 at a ceremony held in the Grand Canal of Venice, in company with Trento. The following month, the 2nd Division became the 3rd Division. On 27 November 1936, she took part in a naval review for the Regent of Hungary, Mikl√≥s Horthy. From 10 to 12 March 1937, Bolzano escorted the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on a cruise to Italian Libya.Hogg & Wiper, p. 62 The ship steamed to the Balearic Islands to retrieve the bodies of six Italian sailors who had been killed on 25 May aboard the auxiliary cruiser by Republican bombers during the Spanish Civil War; Bolzano arrived back in Italy on 3 June. Four days later, she took part in training exercises in the Gulf of Naples; these were held during the visit of German Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg. Another major fleet review took place on 5 May 1938, this time to honor German dictator Adolf Hitler during his state visit. Mussolini visited Bolzano in January 1939 while she was stationed in La Maddalena, Sardinia. The ship took part in a review for Prince Paul of Yugoslavia in the Gulf of Naples on 17 May. She was also present during the first Navy Day celebration, held between 5 and 19 June in Livorno.Hogg & Wiper, p. 62 =World War II= Bolzano under air torpedo attack at Cape Matapan Upon Italy's entrance into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, Bolzano was assigned to the 2nd Division in the 2nd Squadron, along with the two Trento-class cruisers.Brescia, p. 42 On 9 July, the ship took part in the Battle of Calabria; there, she led the line of Italian heavy cruisers as they engaged their British counterparts. She was hit by a salvo of three shells at 16:05 that killed two crewmen and jammed her rudder to port, forcing her to turn in a tight circle. The shells also hit her forward superfiring gun turret, though it was still able to fire.Brescia, pp. 80-81 The hits had come from the light cruiser .Greene & Massignani, pp. 74-75 After the two fleets disengaged, Italian aircraft misidentified the ship as a British vessel and attacked her, though they failed to score any hits. She reached La Spezia on 12 June, where her battle damage was repaired. By the night of 11-12 November, Bolzano had been moved to Taranto; she was present during the raid on Taranto that night, but was not attacked by the British torpedo bombers. A wave of horizontal bombers was tasked with attacking Bolzano and the two Trentos, but their captains decided to hold their fire; as a result, the British aircraft were unable to locate the three cruisers in the darkness and they attacked other vessels.Konstam, p. 68 On 26 November, Bolzano and the rest of the fleet sortied to intercept a British convoy to Malta.Greene & Massignani, p. 116 In the ensuing Battle of Cape Spartivento, Bolzano engaged the battlecruiser , but neither ship scored any hits before both sides broke off the action. She took part in the sweep into the eastern Mediterranean in late March 1941 that resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan. During the battle, British torpedo bombers attacked Bolzano but she successfully evaded their torpedoes. Bolzano thereafter took part in escort duties for convoys to Tripoli for the next several months to support the Axis forces fighting the North African Campaign. The first such convoy took place on 24-30 April. Another followed a month later on 24-27 May, and two were conducted in June, on 8-9 and 25 June - 1 July. She protected a fifth convoy that steamed to Tripoli and back on 16-20 July. Convoy operations were interrupted in late August by an unsuccessful sweep to locate British warships. While returning to port via the Strait of Messina, Bolzano was torpedoed by the British submarine . She was towed to Messina by a pair of tugs, where repairs were effected, lasting three months. She was back in service in time to escort another convoy to Tripoli on 8-9 November. (center) and Bolzano (background) underway Umberto II, the crown prince of Italy, visited the ship while she was in Messina on 17 July 1942. By August, the surviving Italian heavy cruisers, Bolzano, Trieste, and had been reorganized as the 3rd Division. On 11 August, the three cruisers sortied to intercept a British convoy, but were eventually ordered back after the Luftwaffe denied air support. In the return trip, Bolzano was torpedoed by the submarine , causing extensive damage. The torpedo explosion started a fire, prompting the crew to flood the forward magazines to prevent the fire from spreading to them and detonating the propellant charges stored there.Brescia, p. 81 To keep her from sinking, her crew beached the ship on the island of Panarea. The ship was listing 45 degrees and the crew had to abandon the ship. The fire burned through the next day, until some of the crew were able to return to extinguish it.Brescia, p. 47 She remained there until 15 September, by which time damage control parties had shored up the damaged hull enough to allow tugs to tow her back to Naples, where she entered the drydock so the damage could be inspected. Temporary repairs were effected, and in October she was transferred further north, to La Spezia, where permanent repairs would be completed. While she was awaiting repairs, the Regia Marina considered rebuilding the ship into a hybrid cruiser-aircraft carrier. This would have required removing the bridge structure and forward gun turrets, and splitting the forward funnel to vent on either side of the ship so a flight deck and hangar could be installed. The proposal came to nothing, however, as the Italian war economy could not spare the necessary resources to repair Bolzano, let alone convert her. Piecemeal repairs were made as material became available through early 1943, but she remained out of action. On 5 June, American B-17 bombers attacked La Spezia but did not damage Bolzano.Brescia, p. 48 On 3 September 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allies, and on 8-9 September, German troops occupied La Spezia. As the ship was still in an unusable condition, her crew did not scuttle Bolzano, instead leaving her partially afloat. During the German occupation, they cannibalized Bolzano and the also-damaged Gorizia for useful parts but otherwise did not make use of her. On the night of 21-22 June 1944, a team of British and Italian frogmen-- Italy having re-entered the war on the side of the Allies--entered La Spezia using Chariot manned torpedoes to sink Bolzano and Gorizia to prevent the Germans from sinking them as blockships. They succeeded in sinking Bolzano but Gorizia remained afloat. Bolzano was formally stricken from the naval register on 27 February 1947, and in September 1949, salvage workers raised the ship and she was subsequently broken up for scrap.

Etymology  A church key in the literal sense A church key in the figurative sense The term in the beverage-opening sense is apparently not an old one; Merriam-Webster finds written attestation only since the 1950s. Several etymological themes exist. The main one is that the ends of some bottle openers resemble the heads of large keys such as have traditionally been used to lock and unlock church doors.  History  A churchkey initially referred to a simple hand-operated device for prying the cap (called a \\"crown cork\\") off a glass bottle; this kind of closure was invented in 1892, although there is no evidence that the opener was called a \\"church key\\" at that time.Churchkey The shape and design of some of these openers did resemble a large simple key.January 1980 JFO Newsletter 300px In 1935, beer cans with flat tops were marketed, and a device to puncture the lids was needed.

White Kennett (10 August 166019 December 1728) was an English bishop and antiquarian. He was educated at Westminster School and at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where, while an undergraduate, he published several translations of Latin works, including Erasmus' In Praise of Folly. Kennett was vicar of Ambrosden, Oxfordshire from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, where he gave considerable impetus to the study of antiquities. George Hickes gave him lessons in Old English. In 1695 he published Parochial Antiquities. In 1700 he became rector of St Botolph's Aldgate, London, and in 1701 Archdeacon of Huntingdon. For a eulogistic sermon on the recently deceased William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire, Kennett was in 1707 recommended to the deanery of Peterborough. He afterwards joined the Low Church party, strenuously opposed the Sacheverell movement, and in the Bangorian controversy supported with great zeal and considerable bitterness the side of Bishop Hoadly. His intimacy with Charles Trimnell, bishop of Norwich, who was high in favour with George I of Great Britain, secured for him in 1718 the bishopric of Peterborough. He died at Westminster in December 1728. White Kennett Street, near St Botolph, Aldgate, is named after him. Biography White Kennett was born in the parish of St Mary, Dover, on 10 August 1660, the son of Basil Kennett, M.A., rector of Dimchurch and vicar of Postling, Kent, by his wife Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas White, a wealthy magistrate and master-shipwright of Dover. After receiving a preliminary education at Elham and Wye, he was placed at Westminster 'above the curtain,' or in the upper school; but as he was suffering from smallpox at the period of the election of scholars on the foundation, his father recalled him home. After his recovery he spent a year at Beaksbourne, in the family of Mr. Tolson, whose three sons he taught 'with great content and success.' He was the older brother of Basil Kennett, whose life and career he was considerably to influence. He was entered a batler or semi-commoner of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in June 1678, being placed under the tuition of Andrew Allam. According to Hearne he 'sometimes waited on Dr. Wallis to church with his skarlett,' and performed other menial offices, but, on the other hand, he associated with the gentlemen-commoners. While an undergraduate he began his career as a writer by publishing anonymously, just before the assembling of parliament at Oxford on 21 March 1680‚Äì1, A Letter from a Student at Oxford to a Friend in the Country, concerning the approaching Parliament, in vindication of his Majesty, the Church of England, and the University. The whig party endeavoured to discover the author, with a view to his punishment, but the sudden dissolution of the parliament put an end to the incident and occasioned the publication of Kennett's second piece, A Poem to Mr. E. L. on his Majesty's dissolving the late Parliament at Oxford, 28 March 1681. About this period Kennett was introduced to Anthony Wood, who employed him in collecting epitaphs and notices of eminent Oxford men. In his diary, 2 March 1681‚Äì2, Wood notes that he had directed five shillings to be given to Kennett \\"for pains he hath taken for me in Kent\\". On 2 May 1682 Kennett graduated BA, and next year published a version of Erasmus's Mori√¶ Encomium, under the title of Wit against Wisdom: or a Panegyric upon Folly, 1683, 8vo. In the following year he contributed the life of Chabrias to the edition of Cornelius Nepos, \\"done into English by several hands\\". He commenced MA on 22 January 1684, and having taken holy orders he became curate and assistant to Samuel Blackwell, B.D., vicar and schoolmaster of Bicester, Oxfordshire. Sir William Glynne presented him in September 1685 to the neighbouring vicarage of Ambrosden. Soon afterwards he published An Address of Thanks to a good Prince; presented in the Panegyric of Pliny upon Trajan, the best of Roman Emperors, London, 1686, 8vo, with a high- flown preface expressing his loyalty to the throne. =Political views= Kennett's political views were quickly modified by dislike of the ecclesiastical policy of James II. He preached a series of discourses against \\"popery\\", refused to read the 'Declaration for Liberty of Conscience' in 1688, and acted with the majority of the clergy in the diocese of Oxford when they rejected an address to the king recommended by Bishop Parker. Hearne relates that at the beginning of the Glorious Revolution Kennett lent Dodwell a manuscript treatise, composed by himself and never printed, offering arguments for taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to William and Mary. Subsequently, Kennett openly supported the cause of the revolution, and thereby exposed himself to much obloquy from his former friends, who called him 'Weathercock Kennett'. In January 1689, while shooting at Middleton Stoney, his gun burst and fractured his skull. The operation of trepanning was successfully performed, but he was obliged to wear a large black patch of velvet on his forehead during the remainder of his life. After a few years' absence at Ambrosden he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, and in September 1691 was chosen lecturer of St Martin's, commonly called Carfax, Oxford. He was also appointed a public lecturer in the schools, and filled the office of pro-proctor for two successive years. He proceeded BD on 5 May 1694. In February 1694‚Äì5 he was presented by William Cherry to the rectory of Shottesbrooke, Berkshire. He was created DD at Oxford on 19 July 1700, and in the same year was presented to the rectory of St Botolph's Aldgate. He resigned the vicarage of Ambrosden, and did not obtain possession of St Botolph's without a lawsuit. On 15 February 1701 he was installed in the prebend of Combe and Harnham, in the church of Salisbury. =Antiquarian reputation= Kennett's historical and antiquarian researches had meanwhile procured him some reputation. From Dr George Hickes (afterwards nonjuring bishop of Thetford), who lived for a time in seclusion with him at Ambrosden, he received instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and other northern tongues. For several years the two scholars were on the most friendly terms, but eventually there was an open rupture between them, owing to religious and political differences. Kennett contributed a life of William Somner to the James Brome's edition of that antiquary's Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent (1693), and the biography was enlarged and reissued in Somner's Treatise of Gavelkind, 2nd edition 1726. His reputation as a topographer and philologist was enhanced by his Parochial Antiquities attempted in the History of Ambrosden, Burcester, and other adjacent parts in the counties of Oxford and Bucks, with a Glossary of Obsolete Terms, Oxford, 1695, 4to, dedicated to his patron, Sir W. Glynne. A new edition, greatly enlarged from the author's manuscript notes, was issued at Oxford (2 vols. 1818, 4to) under the editorship of Bulkeley Bandinel. While engaged on this work the question of lay impropriations had come much under his notice, and he published \\"for the terror of evil-doers\\" the History and Fate of Sacrilege, discovered by examples of Scripture, of Heathens, of Christians, London, 1698, 8vo, written by Sir Henry Spelman in 1632, but omitted from the edition of that author's Posthumous Works. =Chaplain to Bishop Gardiner= Kennett was now chaplain to Bishop Gardiner of Lincoln, and on 15 May 1701 became archdeacon of Huntingdon. Thereupon he entered into a controversy with Francis Atterbury about the rights of Convocation, and ably supported Dr Wake and Edmund Gibson in their contention that convocation had few inherent rights of independent action. In Warburton's view, Kennett's arguments were based on precedents, while Atterbury's rested on principles. On Archbishop Tenison's recommendation he was appointed in 1701 one of the original members of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. In a sermon preached in his parish church of Aldgate on 31 January 1703‚Äì4, the fast day for the martyrdom of Charles I, Kennett acknowledged that there had been some errors in his reign, owing to a 'popish' queen and a corrupt ministry, whose policy tended in the direction of an absolute tyranny. To correct exaggerated statements made about this sermon, Kennett printed it under the title of A Compassionate Enquiry into the Causes of the Civil War, London (three editions), 1704, 4to. It elicited many angry replies from his high-church opponents. In 1704 he published The Case of Impropriations, and of the Augmentation of Vicarages, and other insufficient Cures, stated by History and Law, from the first Usurpations of the Popes and Monks, to her Majesty's Royal Bounty lately extended to the poorer Clergy of the Church of England. A copy of this work, bound in two vols., with copious additions by the author, was formerly in the possession of Richard Gough, and is now in the Bodleian Library. In 1705 some booksellers undertook a collection of the best works on English history down to the reign of Charles II, and induced Kennett to write a continuation to the time of Queen Anne. Although it appeared anonymously as the third volume of the Compleat History of England, 1706, fol., the author's name soon became known, and he was exposed to renewed attacks from his Jacobite enemies. A new edition, with corrections, was published in 1719, but it was not until 1740 that there appeared Roger North's Examen, or an Inquiry into the Credit and Veracity of a pretended Complete History, viz. Dr. White Kennett's \\"History of England\\". His popularity at court was increased by the published denunciations of his views, and he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to her majesty. He was installed in the deanery of Peterborough 21 February 1707‚Äì8. A few days previously he had been collated to the prebend of Marston St Laurence, in the church of Lincoln. A sermon which he preached at the funeral of the first Duke of Devonshire on 5 September 1707, and which laid him open to the charge of encouraging a deathbed repentance, was published by Henry Hills, without a dedication, in 1707. To a second edition, published by John Churchill in 1708, with a dedication to William, second duke of Devonshire, was appended Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish, a separate edition of which was published by Hills in the same year. A new edition of the sermon, with the author's manuscript corrections, was published by John Nichols in 1797, but very few copies were sold, and the remainder were destroyed by fire. The imputation against Kennett was fresh in the memory of Alexander Pope when in the Essay on Criticism he wrote: :Then unbelieving priests reformed the nation, :And taught more pleasing methods of salvation Kennett's subsequent preferment was naturally connected by his enemies with the strain of adulatory reference to the second duke with which the sermon concludes. =St Mary Aldermary, London= In 1707, desiring more leisure for study, he resigned the rectory of St Botolph, Aldgate, and obtained the less remunerative rectory of St Mary Aldermary, London. During this period he published numerous sermons, and his pen was actively engaged in support of his party. He zealously opposed the doctrine of the invalidity of lay baptism, and his answer to Henry Sacheverell's sermon preached before the lord mayor on 5 November 1709 raised a storm of indignation. In 1710 he was severely censured for not joining in the congratulatory address of the London clergy to the queen, which was drawn up on the accession of the tories to office after Sacheverell's trial. Kennett and others who declined to subscribe it were represented as enemies to the crown and ministry. Richard Welton, rector of St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel, introduced into an altar-piece in his church a portrait of Kennett to represent Judas Iscariot. It was stated that the rector had caused Kennett's figure to be substituted for that of Gilbert Burnet at the suggestion of the painter, who feared an action of scandalum magnatum if Burnet were introduced. A print of the picture in the library of the Society of Antiquaries is accompanied with these manuscript lines by Michel Maittaire: :To say the picture does to him belong, :Kennett does Judas and the Painter wrong. :False is the image, the resemblance faint: :Judas compared to Kennett is a Saint. Multitudes of people visited the church daily to see the painting, but Henry Compton, bishop of London, soon ordered its removal. For many years afterwards it is said to have ornamented the high altar at St Albans Cathedral. =Society for the Propagation of the Gospel= To advance the interests of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Kennett made a collection of books, charts, maps, and documents, with the intention of composing a History of the Propagation of Christianity in the English-American Colonies, and on the relinquishment of that project he presented his collections to the corporation, and printed a catalogue entitled Bibliothec√¶ American√¶ Primordia, London, 1713, 4to, afterwards republished with additions by Henry Homer the elder, 1789, 4to. He also founded an antiquarian and historical library at Peterborough, and enriched the library of that church with some scarce books, including an abstract of the manuscript collections made by Dr John Cosens, bishop of that see, and a copiously annotated copy of Gunton's History of Peterborough. The collection, consisting of about fifteen hundred books and tracts, was placed in a private room at Peterborough, and a manuscript catalogue was drawn up and subscribed Index librorum aliquot vetustorum quos in commune bonum congessit W. K., Decan. Petriburg. MDCCXII. =Bishop of Peterborough= On 25 July 1713 Kennett was installed prebendary of Farrendon-cum-Balderton at Lincoln. He preached vehemently against the Jacobite rising of 1715, and in the two following years warmly advocated the repeal of the acts against occasional conformity. In the Bangorian controversy he opposed the proceedings of convocation against Bishop Hoadly. By the influence of his friend Dr Charles Trimnell, bishop of Norwich and afterwards of Winchester, he was appointed bishop of Peterborough; he was consecrated at Lambeth on 9 November 1718, and had permission to hold the archdeaconry of Huntingdon and a prebend in Salisbury in commendam. He died ten years later at his house in St James's Street Westminster, on 19 December 1728. He was buried in Peterborough Cathedral, where a marble monument with a brief Latin inscription was erected to his memory. =Family= He married first, on 6 June 1693, Sarah, only daughter of Robert and Mary Carver of Bicester (she died on 2 March 1693‚Äì4, sine prole); secondly, on 6 June 1695, Sarah, sister of Richard Smith, M.D., of London and Aylesbury (she died in August 1702); thirdly, in 1703, Dorcas, daughter of Thomas Fuller, D.D., rector of Wellinghale, Essex, and widow of Clopton Havers, M.D. (she died 9 July 1743). His second wife bore him a son, White Kennett, rector of Burton-le-Coggles, Lincolnshire, and prebendary of Peterborough, Lincoln, and London, who died on 6 May 1740; and a daughter Sarah, who married John Newman of Shottesbrook, Berkshire, and died on 22 February 1756. Hearne, writing on 26 April 1707, says that Kennett's 'present [his third] wife wears the breeches, as his haughty, insolent temper deserves'. =Character= His biographer, the Rev. William Newton, admits that his zeal as a whig partisan sometimes carried him to extremes, but he was very charitable, and displayed great moderation in his relations with the dissenters. He is now remembered chiefly as a painstaking and laborious antiquary, especially in the department of ecclesiastical biography. The number of his works both in print and manuscript shows him to have been throughout his life a man of incredible diligence and application. He was always ready to communicate the results of his researches to fellow- students. Works Probably his best-known work, apart from his Compleat History, was his Register and Chronicle, Ecclesiastical and Civil: containing Matters of Fact delivered in the words of the most Authentick Books, Papers, and Records; digested in exact order of time. With papers, notes, and references towards discovering and connecting the true History of England from the Restauration of King Charles II, vol. i. London, 1728, fol. The original materials for this valuable work are preserved in the British Museum among the Lansdowne manuscripts. 1002‚Äì1010. The manuscript volumes bring the register to 1679. The published volume begins with the Restoration, and only comes down to December 1662. Kennett published more than twelve separate sermons preached on public occasions between 1694 and 1728, and others in support of charity schools (cf. The Excellent Daughter, 1708; 11th edit. 1807) or of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (cf. sermon issued in 1712). His addresses to his clergy at Peterborough on his first visitation were issued in 1720. Kennett was also the author of the following, besides the works already discussed: # Remarks on the Life, Death, and Burial of Henry Cornish, London, 1699, 4to. # Ecclesiastical Synods, and Parliamentary Convocations in the Church of England, Historically stated, and justly Vindicated from the misrepresentations of Mr. Atterbury, pt. i.

London, 1730, 8vo. Hearne published in his edition of Leland's Itinerary (vol. vii. Pref. p. xvii) a letter from Kennett \\"concerning a passage\\" in vol. iv. of the same work (1711). Some manuscript verses by Kennett on Religious and Moral Subjects, translated from some of the chief Italian Poets, belonged to S. W. Rix in 1855, and manuscript notes by Kennett, written in a Bible, were printed in Notes and Queries for 1885. Sir Walter Scott first printed, in his Life of Swift, p. 137, from a manuscript in the British Museum, the well-known description by Kennett of Swift's attendance in Queen Anne's antechamber (November 1713). Many of Kennett's manuscripts, which once formed part of the library of James West, president of the Royal Society, were purchased in 1773 by the Earl of Shelburne (afterwards Marquis of Lansdowne), with whose collection they passed, in 1807, to the British Museum. They are now numbered 935‚Äì1041 in the Lansdowne collection. Among them are: # Diptycha Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶; sive Tabul√¶ Sacr√¶ in quibus facili ordine recensentur Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, eorumque Suffraganei, Vicarii Generales, et Cancellarii.

He is best known for England: 1870-1914 (1936), a volume in the Oxford History of England series edited by George Clark. Born in Milborne Port, Dorset, he was the son of Robert H Ensor and his wife Olivia n√©e Currie. He was educated at Winchester and Balliol College, Oxford where he achieved a first in Greats and also the Chancellor's Latin verse prize. He was President of the Oxford Union in 1900. He became involved in left-wing politics, publishing a selection of writings of leading socialist theorists as Modern Socialism in 1903. He failed at his attempts to become a fellow of Merton, St John's and All Souls (twice) but later became a tutor at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1902 he became leader writer for The Manchester Guardian. In 1905 he moved to London where he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. From 1909 - 1911 he worked for the Daily News and from 1912 - 1930 for the Daily Chronicle. Ensor lived in Poplar, and from 1910 - 1913 represented the area on the London County Council as a Labour Party councillor. Following the closure of the Daily Chronicle in 1930, he retired from regular journalistic work, although he continued to contribute to various publications as an editor and reviewer. In 1931 he took up a post as a lecturer in the London School of Economics, but a year later returned to Oxford where he acted as deputy to Arthur Salter, Gladstone Professor of Political Theory and Institutions. George Clark commissioned him a volume of the Oxford History of England, covering the years 1870 to 1914. Reviewer Richard Hammond noted that he devoted six of his fifteen chapters to 'Economics and Institutions' and 'Mental and Social Aspects', and \\"these are both well-informed and up-to-date.\\" Richard Hammond, \\"Some recent books on English social history.\\" International Review for Social History 3 (1938): 431-440. Published in 1936 as the final volume, Ensor's book has sold more copies than any other in the original fourteen part series. He was subsequently made a research fellow of Corpus Christi College and a research lecturer of All Souls College in 1937 and a faculty fellow of Nuffield College in 1938. He was commissioned in 1937 to write a sequel to his volume of the Oxford History of England but he resumed his journalism during the Second World War with a weekly column on foreign affairs in the Sunday Times. The book, a volume covering the years 1914 to 1945, was eventually written by A.J.P. Taylor. Ensor married Helen Fisher of Manchester in 1906, and the couple had two sons and three daughters. The family made their home at Upper Sands, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. He retired in 1953 and was knighted in 1955. He died in a Beaconsfield nursing home in December 1958, aged 81.

It is common throughout the world, especially countries with historical links to Great Britain.  Etymology  For the most part, the surname Wood originated as a topographic name used to describe a person who lived in, or worked in a wood or forest. This name is derived from the Middle English wode, meaning \\"wood\\" (from the Old English wudu). which cited: for the surname \\"Wood\\". An early occurrence of this surname (of a personal residing near a wood) is de la Wode, recorded in Hertfordshire, England, in 1242. The locational name also appeared in early records Latinised as de Bosco (from the Old French bois, meaning \\"wood\\"). which cited: for the surname \\"Boyce\\". Another derivation for the surname is from a nickname of an eccentric or violent person, derived from the Old English w≈çd, wad, and Middle English wod, wode, all meaning \\"frenzied\\" or \\"wild\\". This derivation is considered to be much less common than the locational origin. An early occurrence of the surname derived in this fashion (from a nickname) is le Wode, recorded in Worcestershire, England, in 1221. Variations Variations of the name include the surnames Woodd, Woode, Woods, Wod, and Wode. The equivalent name in German is Wald, and in many cases, emigrants from the German-speaking countries Anglicized this name to Wood when they settled in countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, et cetera. The name \\"Wald\\" still exists, too. The element \\"wood\\" occurs in a number of surnames often indicating a place of origin or an occupation: Woodard, Woodburn, Woodby, Woodcock, Woodforde, Woodham, Woodly, Woodman, Woodruff, Woodstock, Woodvine, and Woodward. Other variations include; Blackwood, Eastwood, Greenwood, Inglewood, Hazelwood, Kirkwood, Leatherwood, Northwood, Redwood, Westwood.

Citt√† di Foligno 1928 S.r.l. is an Italian association football club, based in Foligno, Umbria. It currently plays in Serie D.  History  The club was founded in 1928, but Foligno had football teams since the early '900. Then meetings were held with the Czechoslovak military stationed in Foligno during the First World War. The best result Foligno obtained in the Prima Divisione championship in 1933‚Äì34 was when it ended in second place in the standings and thereby gained access to the finals for the promotion among the runners-up: the outcome of this season was later overturned paradoxically by Federation that condemned the company for unlawful sport to relegation. 1928‚Äì29 Foligno On 6 May 2007, with a day in advance of the end of the season 2006‚Äì2007, Foligno (led by Giovanni Pagliari) won the Serie C2 Group B and was promoted to Serie C1. In the season 2007‚Äì2008 played in Serie C1 Group A. Pierpaolo Bisoli was chosen by the company as the technical coach. On 27 April 2008, by beating 0‚Äì2 at Penzo stadium Venezia, gained access to the play-off for promotion to Serie B. In the first game, played in Foligno, the home team beat 1‚Äì0 Cittadella. The second leg, played at Cittadella on 25 May 2008, Foligno was beaten 0‚Äì2, losing the promotion to Serie B. In the season 2008/2009 Foligno participates in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione championship (formerly Serie C1) Group B. The conduction technique was entrusted to Roberto Cevoli, but with only two wins and a number of draws, was fired on 4 November and was replaced with Paolo Indiani; the initial impact of the new coach is bad, since the team suffers three consecutive defeats and was second from the bottom in half a season. From January, with a few new signings Foligno becomes stronger, and the team seems to catch up (gaining important victories: against league leader Gallipoli, in the derby against Ternana and Arezzo), although, because of a further decline in results, after the defeat against Virtus Lanciano, Marcello Pizzimenti became the new coach replacing Indiani. The Foligno still finished in the play-out zone and played against Pistoiese. It was beaten in Pistoia in the first leg 2‚Äì1, but obtained salvation after winning the second leg 1‚Äì0. On 7 July 2009 Luca Fusi was officially the new coach for season 2009‚Äì2010. At the end of 2009 Fusi signed a contract extension until 30 June 2011, but on 26 April 2010 was sucked. On 9 May 2010, the Foligno beat in \\"Renato Curi\\" Perugia with 2‚Äì0 and thus avoided the play- out. It was a very important victory and it was followed by a grand celebration in the streets of the city. On 13 December 2010 coach Salvatore Matrecano was sacked, and Federico Giunti appointed as the new coach. At the end of the championship, Foligno was found in the area play-out against Ternana. Foligno won the first leg at home 1‚Äì0. At the second leg of the play- out, played in Terni, the home team was preceding in the score with 1‚Äì0 in the second half, but in the extra time Foligno scored the winning goal, which result in a draw, ending the match 1‚Äì1, thus retaining its spot in the league. On 29 April 2012 Foligno was defeated 1‚Äì0 from Carpi. The result confirmed the mathematical relegation to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione as Foligno finished last in the standings.

After 1688, Fuller served Mary of Modena, Queen consort of James II of England, and the Jacobites while seeking at the same time to gain favor with William III of England. After associating with Titus Oates, being imprisoned for debt and pretending to reveal Jacobite plots, the House of Commons in 1692 declared he was an imposter, cheat and false accuser. Having stood in the pillory, he was again imprisoned until 1695, when he was released; at this time he took the opportunity to revive the old and familiar story that Mary of Modena was not the mother of James Francis Edward Stuart, Prince of Wales. In 1701, he published his autobiographical Life of William Fuller and some Original Letters of the late King James. Unable to prove the assertions made in his writings he was put in the pillory, whipped and fined. He was still in Newgate Prison in 1730, when he wrote to William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, disavowing (not for the first time) his earlier inventions. He was almost certainly the William Fuller, prisoner, whose burial is recorded in the register of Christ Church Newgate on 24 March 1733. Fuller's other writings are Mr. William Fuller's trip to Bridewell, with a full account of his barbarous usage in the pillory; The sincere and hearty confession of Mr. William Fuller (1704); and An humble appeal to the impartial judgment of all parties in Great Britain (1716).

It does not undergo the usual steam treatments of Japanese tea and does not have the characteristic astringent taste of most Japanese tea. After a short withering, they are fired in hot iron pans of up to 300 ¬∞C with repeated agitation to prevent charring. The various rolling techniques used produce teas of different leaf form.

Volumes are released quarterly with a subset of open access articles. Springer also cross- publishes some of the articles in Scientific American. Marjorie Senechal is currently the editor-in-chief. History The journal was started informally in 1971 by Walter Kaufman-Buehler, Alice Peters and Klaus Peters. \\"Intelligencer\\" was chosen by Kaufman-Buehler as a word that would appear slightly old-fashioned. An exploration of mathematically themed stamps, written by Robin Wilson, became one of its earliest columns. In 1978, the founders appointed Bruce Chandler and Harold Edwards Jr. to jointly serve in the role of editor-in-chief. Prior to 1978, articles of the Intelligencer were not contained in regular volumes and sent out sporadically to those on a mailing list. To gauge interest, the inaugural mailing included twelve thousand people of whom four thousand requested further copies via postcard. One of them was from Andr√© Weil, mocking the presentation of the letter. Articles from this period have been retroactively collected in \\"Volume 0\\". Later editors-in-chief included John Ewing from 1979 to 1986, Sheldon Axler from 1987 to 1991 and Chandler Davis from 1991 to 2004. Davis began to share editing responsibilities with long time Intelligencer author Marjorie Senechal until the former's retirement in 2013. During this time, the journal adopted online distribution and started requesting LaTeX submissions from prospective authors. The journal has been party to some publishing controversies during its history. One was a book review by Steven Krantz in 1989 which expanded to criticize research interest in fractals; \\"Fractal geometry has not solved any problems. It is not even clear that it has created any new ones.\\" This prompted Benoit Mandelbrot to publish a rebuttal in the same journal. The rebuttal format was initially planned for a paper by Theodore Hill and Sergei Tabachnikov on the variability hypothesis but in the end it was not published. Further controversy arose when a revised version of the paper, by Hill alone, was published by The New York Journal of Mathematics but then retracted without a notice. Reception The Mathematical Intelligencer has been described as a magazine that publishes articles about front-line research rather than the research itself. In 2001, Branislav Kisacanin opined that the magazine belongs in \\"every good mathematics library\\".Branislav Kisacanin (2001) Review of Mathematical Conversations.

Jurion spent most of his club career at R.S.C. Anderlecht where he won 9 championship titles and one Cup and was awarded 2 Golden Shoes. He played in the match Belgium-Netherlands in 1964 with 10 fellows from the Anderlecht team after the substitution of goalkeeper Delhasse by Jean-Marie Trappeniers. \\"Jef\\" began to play at Ruisbroek, Flemish Brabant and earned an early interest by Brussels giants Union and Racing White, but he finally signed with Anderlecht. In November 1954, he played his debut game in the first team of Anderlecht against Olympic Charleroi (won 2-4) as a right winger. Jurion remained in the first team until he left for Gent in 1967, to work as a player/coach. His early breakthrough permitted him to play the first European game of Anderlecht, against Hungarian side V√∂r√∂s Lobog√≥ (currently MTK) in 1955. Jurion achieved international fame after a memorable goal against Real Madrid in 1962 (a 1‚Äì0 win) which qualified Anderlecht for the second round of the Champions Cup after the 3‚Äì3 draw at Bernab√©u. After this goal, he received the nickname of \\"Mister Europe\\". He began his international career in 1955 against France.

It was recorded in 1994 and finally broadcast in six parts on BBC Radio 2 from January 20 to February 24, 1996. This was the second Third Doctor radio play, following The Paradise of Death in 1993. Plans for subsequent serials were abandoned after the death of Jon Pertwee in May of that year. The announcer in the radio serial gave the title as Doctor Who and the Ghosts of N-Space, but both the cassette and CD releases have dropped the \\"Doctor Who and\\" prefix in their packaging, as does the novelisation. It was written by Barry Letts, and featured Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor, Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith. The recording was originally released on cassette in 1996, re-released on a three CD set in 2000.

The Brigadier is trying to help his Uncle Mario, who is being threatened by a mobster named Vilmio. Mario is also trying to deal with the ghosts that have been sighted in his castello. The Brigadier asks the Doctor to investigate the hauntings and determine their source. The Doctor reveals that the ghosts are \\"N-Bodies\\", or the souls of the deceased who have not yet left the physical plane. The ghosts are gathering around Mario's castello due to a fracture in the N-Space barrier; if the barrier were to fail, Earth would be overrun with the monsters that inhabit N-Space. The Doctor travels back to the 19th and 16th century in an attempt to locate the cause of the fracture. In the past he discovers that Vilmio is actually an alchemist called Vilmius who has discovered a method for extending his lifespan; now that he is nearing the end of his life, he wants to use the power of N-Space to give himself true immortality. He also plans to control the monsters in N-Space and use them to rule the world. Vilmius has been waiting centuries for a specific astrological conjunction to occur, which is scheduled to occur in the next few days. Vilmius' men storm the castello, allowing Vilmio access to the N-Space fracture. The Doctor and Sarah Jane, using a device the Doctor invented, send their N-bodies into the fracture as well. Inside N-Space, Sarah Jane's belief in the Doctor transforms his body into that of a heroic white knight, which allows the Doctor to defeat Vilmius and sever his N-Body's link with his physical body. The defeat comes too late, and Vilmius begins absorbing the N-Space energy into his body. In a last-ditch attempt, the Doctor increases the amount of N-Space energy funnelling into Vilmius, which causes him to explode; the N-Space energy disperses harmlessly. Continuity *Jeremy Fitzoliver was introduced in Barry Letts' first Doctor Who radio play, The Paradise of Death and went on to appear in Letts' Past Doctor Adventure novel Island of Death. He is also featured in the Past Doctor Adventures novel Instruments of Darkness. Author Gary Russell originally intended Fitzoliver to be a part of the novel Business Unusual, but when BBC ordered it changed from a Third Doctor to a Sixth Doctor novel, the character was dropped.Author's notes for The Scales of Injustice. Doctor Who section at BBC website. *The term \\"N-Space\\" (Null Space) here is used differently than it is during the E-Space trilogy, where it stands for \\"Normal Space.\\" *Sarah Jane mentions encountering the Daleks, placing this story after Death to the Daleks. *The Doctor tells Sarah Jane a story about hiking around Gallifrey with a wise teacher who lived in the mountains. This seems to be a reference to the Gallifreyan they encounter in Planet of the Spiders. Cast and Crew Notes *Broadcast a few months before his death, this was Jon Pertwee's final performance as the Doctor. *Sandra Dickinson was married to Peter Davison (The Fifth Doctor). Their daughter, Georgia Tennant, played Jenny in The Doctor's Daughter, and later married David Tennant, the Tenth Doctor. *Stephen Thorne appeared in The D√¶mons, The Three Doctors, Frontier in Space and The Hand of Fear. *Harry Towb appeared in The Seeds of Death and Terror of the Autons.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of Lucca. Construction was begun in 1063 by Bishop Anselm (later Pope Alexander II). Description Of the original structure, the great apse with its tall columnar arcades and the fine campanile remain. The nave and transepts of the cathedral were rebuilt in the Gothic style in the 14th century, while the west front was begun in 1204 by Guido Bigarelli of Como, and consists of a vast portico of three magnificent arches, and above them three ranges of open galleries adorned with sculptures. In the nave a small octagonal temple or chapel shrine contains the most precious relic in Lucca, the Holy Face of Lucca () or Sacred Countenance. This cedar-wood crucifix and image of Christ, according to the legend, was carved by his contemporary Nicodemus, and miraculously conveyed to Lucca in 782. Christ is clothed in the colobium, a long sleeveless garment. The chapel was built in 1484 by Matteo Civitali, the most famous Luccan sculptor of the early Renaissance. The tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by Jacopo della Quercia of Siena, the earliest of his extant works was commissioned by her husband, the lord of Lucca, Paolo Guinigi, in 1406. Additionally the cathedral contains Domenico Ghirlandaio's Madonna and Child with Saints Peter, Clement, Paul and Sebastian; Federico Zuccari's Adoration of the Magi, Jacopo Tintoretto's Last Supper, and finally Fra Bartolomeo's Madonna and Child (1509). There is a legend to explain why all the columns of the fa√ßade are different. According to the tale, when they were going to decorate it, the inhabitants of Lucca announced a contest for the best column. Every artist made a column, but then the inhabitants of Lucca decided to take them all, without paying the artists and used all the columns. =Labyrinth= The labyrinth or maze is embedded in the right pier of the portico and is believed to date from the 12th or 13th century. Its importance is that it may well pre-date the famous Chartres maze, yet is of the Chartres pattern that became a standard for mazes.

After being unable to enlist in the Royal Navy, he would spend the World War I years as a Petty Officer in the Merchant Navy, in Admiralty Transport on Atlantic convoys carrying goods and passengers between England and America. After the war, Emmanuel worked mainly on coastal ships from Liverpool, picking up minerals from local mines on the west coast of Wales. Post-war continued to be difficult times for the working classes including seamen in Great Britain - 'through the 1920s Britain's economy was already struggling to pay for the effects of World War I‚Äô.The British Library, http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item107595.html, retrieved 7 February 2018 Work continued to be hard and low-paid, with workmen at loggerheads with factory and mine owners culminating in strikes and lock-outs such as the Miners Strike of 1926. The Trades Union Congress called a General Strike in 1926 in support of the mine workers which lasted 9 days from 3 ‚Äì 12 May. Seamen like Emmanuel, docking into Port Talbot, were not immune to these hardships, signing up to each voyage and becoming aware of the activities of workmen and trade unionists in ports and industrial towns like Aberafan, across Great Britain. Emmanuel met Sinah Lane, the daughter of a local miner and herself a Labour Party activist, at a local socialist rally. They married in 1922 and had a son David John. Both Emmanuel and Sinah were active in the Independent Labour Party working towards the successful election of the local Member of Parliament. Emmanuel and Sinah attended meetings and rallies by trade unionists and Labour Party members such as James Griffiths, Aneurin Bevan, Willie Cove and Ramsay MacDonald Aberavon Member of Parliament the 1st Labour Party Prime Minister in 1924. Emmanuel was known locally for his passionate speeches at meetings and rallies in Welsh. The tough times continued with high unemployment and low wages as a result of the worldwide Great Depression from 1929 until the start of World War II. Particularly hardest hit by economic problems were the industrial and mining areas in the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on payments from local government known as the dole‚Äô.Wikipedia, 2018, Great Depression in the United Kingdom, retrieved February 2018.

It is designed to optimally display that star's particular talents or personal appeal. The term is also applied to stage plays and television programs. In some cases, a performer may produce their own star vehicle as self-promotion or a vanity project. Richard Dyer, who extensively studied the phenomenon of movie stars, defined the vehicle phenomenon in his 1979 book Stars: Under the old studio system, vehicles were sometimes created for a promising young, inexperienced, or imported actor who had signed a long-term contract with a major studio. By showcasing that actor's talents, the vehicle was an attempt to create another bankable star bound to the studio until their contract expired. Vehicles were created for rising or established stars as diverse as Fred Astaire, Joan Crawford, the Marx Brothers and Elvis Presley. In some cases, audiences could be depended on to buy tickets to a succession of a favorite star's vehicles regardless of their plots or even their overall quality, as long as care was taken to present that star well. With the demise of the studio system, star vehicles are less common in the movie business, although they continue to appear occasionally (e.g. Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, The Rock's The Scorpion King, or more recently Miley Cyrus' The Last Song). They remain common in television, where sitcoms routinely function as vehicles for stand-up comedians. Welcome Back, Kotter, The Cosby Show, Roseanne, Seinfeld, Home Improvement, Martin, George Lopez, Everybody Loves Raymond, Everybody Hates Chris, and The Bernie Mac Show are some notable examples from the US. Musicals and music-themed films have commonly used the star vehicle format to capitalize on the popularity of their performer. Among the earliest examples is The Jazz Singer (1927), which drew on the popularity of Al Jolson. Elvis Presley was perhaps the most prolific star vehicle performer, featured in 25 films between 1956 and 1969. While Presley's films were a commercial success, they mostly failed to attract critical acclaim, being made primarily as a platform for his musical performances. On the other hand, Frank Sinatra is noted as a performer whose filmography strengthened his musical popularity and critical credibility. Although his first leading-role film, Meet Danny Wilson (1952), was a bland star-vehicle platform, his acting career reached a turnaround in the non-musical From Here to Eternity (1953), from which he went on to make over 40 musical and non-musical films.

It is written by Victor Pemberton, and stars Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith and Bill Mitchell as Zor. Plot =Part 1= The Doctor and Sarah Jane arrive on a beach by the Thames Estuary at night, and discover a metallic seaweed there. The Doctor consults with Professor Emerson, who says that three expeditions to recover a recent meteorite from the bottom of the estuary have all vanished. The Doctor goes diving and is attacked by something that wraps itself around him, but then lets him go. The meteorite is really a wrecked spaceship buried under the estuary. The Doctor believes it is a Pescaton ship. The Pescatons are carcharhinidae, or deep water sharks. The experts scoff at this, until one comes out of the Thames and makes its way to London Zoo in search of salt water. The Doctor confronts it in the Aquarium, where it dies and disintegrates. That night, more meteorites land in the Thames. =Part 2= London is invaded. The Doctor recalls his visit to planet Pesca, where he fell down a chasm into a cavern and met Zor, the Pescaton leader. Zor said he would use the Doctor to find a new home; Pesca was drying out and falling towards its sun. Zor used his hypnotic powers on the Doctor, who fought back and escaped. Back in London, Sarah Jane finds an abandoned baby while the military shoot rounds at the invading Pescatons with no effect. The Doctor distracts a Pescaton by singing \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" and doing a dance so that Sarah Jane can get away with the child. Finally the Pescatons fall back to the salt water, except for one trapped in a London Underground tunnel. The Doctor and Sarah Jane search for it, and the Doctor plays a piccolo to calm his nerves. The Pescaton retreats at the sound. Professor Emerson helps the Doctor build a high frequency sound trap inside a sewer, and Zor is lured there to be destroyed as the planet Pesca disintegrates in its orbit. Without Zor to control it, the Pescaton invasion ends.

The second was unearthed in 1968, 300 m from the first, during an excavation for the installation of concrete poles. Its grave goods are now on display in the National Museum of Romanian History. The second grave dates to c. 475 and was presumably the tomb of a Gepid king, based on the inscription on a gold ring called Omharus.  The hoard  The hoard displayed in the National Museum of Romanian History At Apahida, near Cluj-Napoca, three princely tombs attributed to Gepids were found in 1889, 1968 and 1979 respectively. Located on the right bank of the Some»ôul Mic River and near the former Roman road that ran between Napoca and camps on Some»ô River (Gherla, CƒÉ»ôeiu, ), the tombs occupy an area no greater than 500 m2. The fibulae of the thesaurus The discovery of the first tomb in 1889 was made while taking gravel from a neighbouring area of Apahida. Some of the artifacts were recovered for the Transylvanian Museum by H. Fin√°ly, and another two pieces (a sealing ring with monogram and a pendant with bells) were purchased by the Hungarian National Museum on the antiquities market in 1897. From the inventory of the tomb were preserved many objects of gold, a cruciform brooch with onion-shaped cufflinks, a bracelet with thickened ends, three rings, a belt buckle and a second smaller buckle, five pendants with bells, two silver mugs, a gold band and several appliques, probably used to decorate or repair vessels. The second tomb discovery was made, also by chance, in October 1968, by workers digging the foundation for a transmission tower. Gold pieces with a total weight of approx. 900 g were found; of these the authorities were only able to recover 800 g when the discovery became public the following February, the rest having probably been melted down and used to make modern jewelry. During the excavations the upper part of the tomb was destroyed, leaving only the lower part thereof to be studied by archaeologists. The artifacts recovered by the Transylvanian History Museum in Cluj-Napoca were then transferred to Bucharest, during the establishment in 1971 of the National Museum of History. In 1979, a 6-year-old child discovered a large gold buckle in the earth excavated during the construction of the local post. The buckle is the only piece preserved from a third tomb. The piece was taken over in 1980 by the National Bank of Romania, and in 2002 was transferred to the National Museum of History.

In the same year he was also appointed Chairman of the Committee on the Role of Models and Quantitative techniques in Geographical Teaching of the Geographical Association. At Cambridge University from 1970 to 1975 Chorley served as Secretary of the Faculty Board of Geography and Geology. In 1972 he was appointed Deputy Head of the Department of Geography, Cambridge University, for the Lent and Michaelmas terms, and from 1984 to 1989 he was Head of the Department of Geography, Cambridge University. In 1990 he was elected Vice-Master, Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University. =Awards and honours= Chorley received a series of Awards and honours, such as: *1967 Awarded the Gill Memorial of the Royal Geographical Society for contributions to Physical Geography and quantitative studies. *1974 Elected first honorary life member of the British Geomorphological Research Group. *1981 Honors Award, Association of American Geographers *1987 Awarded the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society *1988 Elected an Honorary Member of the Italian Geographical Society *1988 Elected to the Council of the Royal Geographical Society = Death= Chorley died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 May 2002 following a heart attack and was buried in Cambridge's Ascension Parish Burial Ground on the 21st; he was survived by his wife, Rosemary, and their two children. He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge. He married Rosemary More in 1965 and they had one son and one daughter.  Work  = Physical geography at Cambridge = Cambridge had provided the launching pad for Chorley's revolutionary ideas. He rejected the prevailing paradigm of the Davisian cycles of erosion and sought to replace these with a quantitative model-based paradigm with an emphasis on General Systems Theory and numerical modelling. Richard Chorley's negative assessment of Davis theories led Cliff Ollier to state that \\"'Davis bashing' was a theme\\" for Chorley. Cambridge contained a strong group in physical geography with colleagues that encouraged Chorley's ideas. It also provided a good environment for him to conduct his experiments. Chorley produced volumes of scientific papers in physical geography that codified his approach and allowed him to ask new questions about earth surface processes and ways they can be studied. Central to these was the concept of system dynamics, and his production of Physical Geography: A Systems Approach (1971) and Environmental Systems (1978) that influenced a generation of scholars. Chorley's studies ranged into climatology and hydrology where he cooperated with Colorado meteorologist Roger Barry on the text, Atmosphere, Weather and Climate (1968). Many of his writings were jointly authored or edited, including Water, Earth and Man (1969). In addition, Chorley launched in 1964 the first of a series of text on The History of the Study of Landforms. Two further volumes were published in 1973 and 1991. At the time of Chorley's death, Volume 4 was nearing completion. =Progress in Geography= Instead of confining himself to physical geography, Chorley took a broad approach to change in geography as a whole. He did this first through a series of annual summer conferences held at Madingley Hall near Cambridge, where his lectures helped form a basis of a series of volumes (notably Models in Geography, 1967) that influenced the discipline. The second was by founding an annual series, \\"Progress in Geography\\", later converted into two influential quarterly journals, in which changes over the whole discipline could be recorded and assessed.

Swami currently performs as a hybrid electronic DJ act with special world music guests and collaborations including Deep Forest and PunjabTronix. History Swami's debut dance album Desi Nu Skool Beatz was initially released on Simon & Diamond Duggal's own Sub Dub label in 1999. The album was picked up by Nation Records. Described as \\"blinding\\" by the Birmingham Post, the album received some international recognition when the opening track Mehbooba appeared in the 2004 Olsen twins movie New York Minute. Desi Nu Skool Beatz was followed by the 2002 album Bhangradotcom, which was less dance-oriented. 2004-2006: DesiRock Swami's big break came with the release of the third album DesiRock, which became popular in the British Asian music scene. By this time Diamond was the only original member remaining and had recruited his cousin S-Endz as rap vocalist in the band alongside British bhangra singer Jagz and MC Sarpanch. The title track DesiRock features guest Indian Punjabi vocalist Lehmber Hussainpuri and was voted a BBC Radio 1 favourite, which led to a Maida Vale session in the summer of 2005. The track also appeared in the Official 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany edition of EA Sports' FIFA series of video games. In the same year DJ Swami won the Media Storm Best Producer award at the UK Asian Music Awards, as well as being nominated for Best Track (DesiRock) and Best Group. In late 2005, Swami signed a deal with Sony BMG to release DesiRock in India as So Who Am I with a new line-up without Sarpanch and replacing Jagz with new vocalist Supreet Suri (aka Sups). With a heavily rock, electronic and Punjbai sound (nearly all songs re-recorded with live guitar and drums), Swami embarked on a promotional tour of India which included a performance at the MTV Style Awards. The Hindu credited Swami with bringing British bhangra back to prominence in Indian clubs. A fourth album of live recording sessions was scheduled to be released in the spring of 2006. Two songs from the sessions have been heard, \\"Afraid\\" and \\"No Apologies\\", both at one stage were available on the band's Myspace site. \\"Afraid\\"'s 'bhangra-fied mix' was played on the BBC's Desi DNA programme. These recordings remain otherwise unreleased. In December 2006, dhol player and percussionist Bobby Panesar joined the band. 2007-2009: Equalize In March 2007, an update was made to Swami's website, containing details of the forthcoming album and revealed that it would feature many guest appearances including Pras of the Fugees, Boostylz, Lady Ru, French rappers Asuivre, South African vocalist Ishmael, MC Spee from the band Dreadzone, Yam Boy and more. It was later announced that Swami's 2007 release was to be named Equalize and would be out in the fall following a tour including Wychwood and Glastonbury festivals. BBC Radio 1 premi√®red \\"Hey Hey\\", the first single from Equalize on 14 August. After this, Radio 1 DJ Bobby Friction announced that Swami would soon be performing an exclusive live session at Maida Vale. The session was recorded and broadcast at the end of September and featured many new songs from Equalize and guest appearances from some of the featured artists including Boostylz, MC Spee and Ishmael Ghetto Ruff. Equalize was released in the UK on 24 September, and in mid November a music video began rotating for \\"Hey Hey\\". In December 2007, Swami announced that they had signed a new record deal with Virgin/EMI and would soon be releasing Equalize in India and South Asia. The major label release is a new version including bonus tracks, one of them being an all-new version of the track \\"Electro Jugni\\" featuring Swedish popstar DeDe Lopez. In January 2008, Swami won the Album Of The Year award on DesiHits, and were nominated for three awards (Best Album, Best Producer and Best Underground Act) at the 2008 UK Asian Music Awards. Diamond (DJ Swami) was awarded the Best Producer award, but could not attend the event, so S-Endz, Liana and Bobby Panesar accepted the award on his behalf. In February 2008, Swami appeared on the UK TV show Desi DNA on BBC 2 and performed \\"Ching\\" and \\"Electro Jugni\\". The performance of \\"Electro Jugni\\" was also the d√©but of Swami's new vocalist Liana. The video to \\"Electro Jugni\\" was shot a few weeks later. In June 2008, Swami revealed a forthcoming digital EP of Electro Jugni/She's Mine. Both songs are new versions, \\"Electro Jugni\\" is a new Punjabi and Hindi version, and \\"She's Mine\\" is an all-new English version of the song. Both songs feature new vocals from Sups, S-Endz and Liana. The EP was eventually released on 9 March 2009. In August 2008, Swami's \\"Hey Hey\\" music video received its Canadian premi√®re at Toronto's FILMI South Asian Film Festival, as part of FILMI's d√©but music video night programmed by Deejay Ra. The video for \\"Electro Jugni\\" was premi√®red on the DesiHits website on 23 October 2008. A trailer for the music video to \\"She's Mine\\" appeared in March 2009, but the full video was not released. 2009-2011: 53431 On 12 June 2009, the Swami song \\"Sugarless\\" premi√®red via the entertainment website DesiHits, who reported that the track would feature on an upcoming Swami compilation called 53431 that would contain the hits from the band's previous studio albums, two new songs (\\"Sugarless\\" and \\"Tonight\\"), and two remixes. \\"Sugarless\\" received heavy worldwide radio support following its premi√®re, and shortly afterwards the band released a heavier dance remix, entitled \\"Sugarless (The New Desi Generation Remix)\\" which also went on to receive airplay. 53431 was released on 17 August 2009 and the music video for \\"Sugarless\\" premi√®red in early September. In an interview with Eastern Eye newspaper in November 2009, Swami revealed they were currently working on a new album and it would be \\"an international English electronic pop album which will be released by a major US label\\". In a newsletter sent out on 27 January 2010, S-Endz mentioned that he and Diamond had written 20 new songs for the new album, and that the 20 songs would all be completed before the best ones were chosen. The Sugarless Tour 2010 took place in the UK and Canada across June and July, and the set included several new songs from the upcoming album. 2011-2017: Upgrade On 17 May 2011, a new track entitled \\"Dumdaraka (Dub Upgrade)\\" was released to BBC Radio 1 and Asian Network. The following week, on 24 May, Diamond revealed in an interview with DJ Nihal on BBC Radio 1 that the new album is entitled Upgrade. In December 2012, a video preview of \\"Back It Up\\", the first official single from the new album was uploaded to Swami's official YouTube channel. On 12 January 2013, the single was released in two different versions ‚Äì the original mix, sung in English, and the Desi Mix, sung in a mix of English, Punjabi and Hindi. The two tracks were released as a free download on the band's official website. In August 2014, Swami announced filming of a new music video in India for a song called \\"Do It Again\\". The track was released on 7 November 2014, with several remixes including Dub and Extended versions released in January 2015. On 6 July 2015, Swami premiered a new song entitled \\"We Are\\" on Australian radio station PBS 106.7FM in Melbourne, on the Mumbai Masala show hosted by Richi Madan. On 2 August, Swami released a new EP entitled Upgrade In Progress featuring \\"We Are\\" alongside all the previously released songs, \\"Back It Up\\", \\"Do It Again\\", \\"Dumdaraka\\" (now renamed Dhoomdaraka) and a previously unreleased unplugged mix of \\"Do It Again\\". In May 2017, Swami released the album Upgrade on the Times Music label in India and South Asia. The lead single \\"Dil Vich\\" featuring the vocalist Lovely Pawar was released to coincide with the album release. The album was accompanied by a remixed DJ friendly electronic/deep/tech house version of the album entitled SIDETRKD. A deluxe version of the album featuring both versions was also made available. In August 2017, the Swami albums Upgrade and SIDETRKD were released internationally via INgrooves on the Station 5 label.

The Dreamcast version is a Gold Edition with improved graphics and gameplay. Railroad Tycoon II: Gold Edition was ported to Linux by Loki Software. Gameplay is displayed in dimetric view, unlike the top-down view of Railroad Tycoon. Gameplay Screenshot from Railroad Tycoon II. Railroad Tycoon II is a railroad simulation that covers the entire history of railroads from inception to the present day and beyond. The player chooses a map and assumes the role of chairman of a railroad company. The player tries to make profits for investors and completes various other objectives while being hindered by rivals, random events such as train breakdowns, train robbers, economic swings, and scripted events particular to the scenario. Most of the gameplay consists of building tracks, stations and trains, which are used for hauling passengers and freight from one station to another. Delivery revenue can vary by time, distance, demand, cargo type, economic state, station improvements and difficulty level. Companies can connect to and use each other's tracks and stations, so revenue can be split. Expenses include the fuel, track and engine maintenance and management fee. The fuel cost depends on the cargo weight and the distance each engine runs. Engine maintenance depends on engine age and the engine's type (some locomotives cost more to maintain than others). The elder engines cost more to keep them on the line. The track maintenance is solely calculated from track mileage. The player determines what kind of cargo(es) to put on/off at each station that the player adds to its routing. Way-points may also be inserted to override default track selection where multiple paths are possible. There are many industries in the game, and each can produce and/or convert specific cargoes. For example, coal mines produce coal, iron mines produce iron, and, in the advanced game, a steel mill can convert 1 load of iron plus 1 load of coal into 2 loads of steel. The players are encouraged to find a chain of production to make new cargo by hauling the right type of cargo to each step of the industries. By doing this right, the player can haul raw materials one way, \\"create\\" manufactured return cargo, and make even more money hauling finished products back the other way. =Locomotives and industry= One of the key elements of gameplay relates to the player purchasing and operating a variety of locomotives, each of which possesses different attributes relating to speed, fuel type, preferred cargo, and the ability to traverse hills and steep track grades. In general, the player should balance the cost of operating a train and the time required to transport cargo, with the balance being that the profit from cargo delivery outweighs train operating costs. The player also may purchase various industrial plants to earn extra money based on the amount of cargo received and delivered. Basic industry, such as bakeries, textile mills, and tool and die factories, earns less profit than advanced factories such as canneries, steel mills and automobile plants, although the latter require multiple goods delivered to produce one final product. Furthermore, idle industries which do not produce goods will generate a negative profit, thus increasing overall operating costs and overhead. The following locomotives are available for gameplay. Locomotives are only seen in specific time periods and scenarios. In addition to the attributes described above, locomotives are subject to \\"mechanical reliability\\", which is a randomly generated factor influencing how often a locomotive will break down. All locomotives begin their operational lives with a set chance of mechanical failure, with some types more prone to breakdowns than others. Breakdown percentage chance increases the older a locomotive becomes. A train may also suffer a wreck, which completely destroys the locomotive and all hauled cargo. The game also features one futuristic train, the \\"Mag-Lev TBX-1\\" which is portrayed as released in the (then) future date of 2008. The train operates using Maglev technology which, as of 2015, has been prototyped in both Europe and Japan. The first successful Maglev train to be operated was the SCMaglev with speeds approaching 400 miles per hour. =Economics= Gameplay also includes financial manipulation of companies, issuing bonds, share repurchases, stock issues, manipulating dividends, merging with other companies and declaring bankruptcy. These features are required in some scenarios and may be used for either great financial gain or total fiscal disaster. In normal financial mode, the player may buy or sell any companies' stocks at various prices depending upon the economy. On advanced settings, the broker may allow the player to buy on margin or short sell stocks if he has enough value of stocks or cash to rely on. The computer players may also engage in these practices and will attempt to bankrupt the player when he is heavily in debt. The economy may fluctuate during gameplay, with five economic states possible: Booming, Prosperity, Normal, Recession and Depression. When the economy is good, the revenue of hauled goods and stock prices will be higher. Bond interest rates will also be adjusted with the economy level, including the interest received from cash and the interest paid for the bonds. =Campaigns and scenarios= The original game features eighteen missions, divided between North America, Europe and the rest of the world. The missions can be played on three difficulty levels, and each also includes three listed objectives. Completing only the first objective awards the player a bronze medal, the first two a silver medal, and all three a gold medal. The player may play any mission in each set as many times as they wish; they may also continue even though a mission has been failed. The final score for the whole 18-mission campaign is calculated by the difficulty level and the number of each type of medal achieved. In addition to the campaign, Railroad Tycoon II features many single scenarios. As with the campaign, each scenario is based on a geographical location, which may be fictional. Most scenarios also have a medal system similar to that of the campaign, although any scenario may be played in sandbox mode as well. Many scenarios constrain the player to some specific point on the timeline and feature scripted events: for example, the Korean map presents an alternative history as the player is informed about the averted Korean civil war. Additional single scenarios may be created using the map editor included. Maps may be imported, drawn from scratch, or edited from existing maps and saved under new names. Many fan creations have been shared on various fan sites. Development In late 1997, Bruce Shelley said of his chance of developing Railroad Tycoon II, \\"I would be happy to work on such a game but there are real doubts about its ability to generate sufficient sales in this blockbuster market where a few of the games make most of the money.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/19990506043125/http://www.gamecenter.com:80/News/Item/Cont/0,4,0-1280_2,00.html =Soundtrack= The soundtrack of Railroad Tycoon II consist mostly of classical \\"railroad\\" blues and bluegrass from the era the game revolves around. These pieces were not, unlike most contemporary games, midi files, but rather high-quality studio recordings; some even with vocals. This fact has contributed to the solid ratings this game has received. =Editions= Railroad Tycoon 2: Gold is a collection of Railroad Tycoon 2 and Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century, in one package. Railroad Tycoon 2: Platinum is equivalent to the Gold Edition but with over 50 community-made maps added and enhanced mouse-wheel support. Maps (scenarios) developed specifically for the platinum edition may not function in some earlier versions. The last official patch to Railroad Tycoon 2 was platinum v1.56 on February 19, 2003. Reception =Sales= Before its release, Gathering of Developers' marketing director estimated that Railroad Tycoon would sell 250,000 units during the 1998 holiday shopping season. He speculated lifetime sales of 500,000 units.https://web.archive.org/web/20000311180912/http://headline.gamespot.com:80/news/98_11/02_train/index.html The game proceeded to become a commercial success. Its sales surpassed 500,000 copies globally by February 1999, and its computer version alone sold more than 1.5 million copies by August 2001. In the United States, the game and its Gold edition together sold 351,000 copies by October 2001. According to Franz J. Felsl of PopTop, much of Railroad Tycoon IIs success came from European markets; he explained that it \\"did better in Europe than it did in the US, which is not the way things usually end up.\\" By August 2000, Railroad Tycoon II had been released in 39 unique SKUs worldwide, including eight Windows versions in English alone. PopTop's Phil Steinmeyer wrote that roughly 33% of the game's sales were derived from the Gold edition and Second Century expansion, and that the port for Macintosh \\"sold respectably\\", while the PlayStation version was unsuccessful. He accredited the game's number of versions with its commercial success, and wrote in August 2000, \\"Overall, had we only released the original game, in English, for Windows only, our sales would be less than a quarter of what they are now.\\" In 2003, Steinmeyer remarked that Railroad Tycoon II continued to sell \\"pretty well\\". =Critical reviews= =Awards= Railroad Tycoon II won Computer Games Strategy Pluss and CNET Gamecenter's 1998 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" awards; the former magazine's editors wrote that it \\"capture[d] almost all of the things gamers had come to love about the original.\\" It also received IGN's \\"Best Soundtrack\\" award. The game was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds 1998 \\"Best Strategy\\", GameSpot's \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\", IGN's \\"Best Strategy Game of the Year\\" and PC Gamer USs \\"The Best Real-Time Strategy Game\\" awards, all of which ultimately went to StarCraft. Computer Gaming Worlds editors lauded Railroad Tycoon II as \\"a brilliant update of a gaming classic\\", and the staff of PC Gamer US wrote that the game \\"did a terrific job of immersing the player in a richly detailed world of empire-building, commerce and micro-management.\\" =The Second Century= Legacy Railroad Tycoon II became the first game published by Gathering of Developers to sell 1 million copies, and Geoff Keighley of Computer Gaming World declared it one of the publisher's few \\"certified hits.\\" In the United States, the publisher's combined lifetime sales reached 1.3 million copies by October 2001, including the sales of Railroad Tycoon II. Gathering of Developers president Mike Wilson believed that the game put his company on the map, at a time when others in the computer game industry doubted that an independent publisher could succeed. It was featured in G4 Icons' episode 12 Sid Meier as part of Sid's history with games and computers.

Gameplay With nearly 60 locomotives in the game (nearly 70 in the Coast to Coast expansion), the game has the most locomotives of the Railroad Tycoon franchise with locomotives from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Poland, Russia and more even fictional locomotives like the E-88 and the TransEuro, the latter of which is a fictional name for the Eurostar. =New features= The game interface is in full 3D, with free camera movement. The square grid is no longer rigid, as it was in Railroad Tycoon and Railroad Tycoon II - rail and structures can now be rotated 360 degrees. The economic model has been reworked. In previous games, goods could only be picked up at a station, and revenue depended on the distance between stations. Carloads in Railroad Tycoon 3 slowly move across the map (representing road and water transport) along the gradient of a scalar field representing price, where supply and demand sites function as sources and sinks. Revenue depends on the price difference between pick-up and delivery. This has several effects; raw materials can find their way to industries and get processed, without any trains involved, and a train does not need to pick up goods at the source. Other changes include: each carload of mail, passengers and troops now has a destination; car setup can be automated, so that trains always pick up the cars that yield the most revenue; warehouse buildings also appear in the game, completing the commodity market the same way as ports do; trains can pass each other on a single track (as in the original Railroad Tycoon on the lowest difficulty level); no need for signal towers, as well as station improvements (post offices, restaurants etc.), are placed individually on the map; players can buy industries, and also build processing industries wherever they like; processing industries have limited capacity, but they can be upgraded. =Campaign= The campaign of the game features 16 scenarios across a total of 5 continents with 7 Maps in North America, 6 Maps in Europe, 1 Map in Asia, 1 Map in Africa, and 1 Map in South America. USA Campaign: 1840 - 1941. Scenarios: 5 Europe Campaign: 1840 - 1914 Scenarios: 5 World Campaign: 1880 - 1985 Scenarios: 3 Future Campaign: 2025 - 2080 Scenarios: 3 After the player passes all scenarios on bronze or higher, she or he will be given the key to an anonymous city. Development By May 2003, the game had been in development for one and a half years, after another one and a half years were spent on its game engine. In 2002, Phil Steinmeyer had expressed his dislike of 3D graphics in strategy games, and felt that his company's next project after Tropico \\"would probably look better in straight pre-rendered 2D\\". To manage the popping inherent to level of detail systems in 3D graphics, the team created as many as six variants for the game's vehicles, buildings and other objects. Steinmeyer gave the example of a building that went as high as 931 or as low as 55 polygons, based on the closeness of the camera. According to Steinmeyer, the Railroad Tycoon 3 team comprised 13 people and development lasted roughly two and a half years. A port for Mac was published and developed by MacSoft, and released in 2004. Reception Railroad Tycoon 3 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Johnny L. Wilson of Computer Gaming World praised Railroad Tycoon 3s visuals, as well as the detail of its \\"marvelous\\" economics simulation. He considered the sequel \\"more than a face-lift\\" that simultaneously possessed \\"all the features that made its predecessors great\\". However, Wilson criticized its use of certain train models in countries where they had historically been absent. Writing for X-Play, John Duggan called Railroad Tycoon 3 \\"a serious time suck and highly addictive.\\" While he criticized its changes to the ledger interface from Railroad Tycoon II, he noted the sequel's \\"more sophisticated economic model\\", and summarized it as a \\"rewarding\\" experience. GameSpy named Railroad Tycoon 3 the tenth-best computer game of 2003, and the year's best \\"PC Empire Builder\\" game. The editors of Computer Gaming World nominated it for their 2003 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic. They wrote that \\"PopTop Software has done an amazing job updating this venerable series\\", but found Railroad Tycoon 3 too lacking in innovation to win the award. The game was also a finalist for IGN's \\"Best Economic Simulation Game\\" and GameSpot's \\"Best PC Game\\" and \\"Best Strategy Game\\" awards, but lost to SimCity 4 and Rise of Nations in these categories. Add-ons =Loco Commotion extra content= A train-based puzzle game included on the Play Disc as a 141MB optional extra. Loco Commotion involves solving routes and shunting puzzles by moving trains at precise times over increasingly difficult environments throughout the multiple levels. =Coast to Coast expansion pack= The freeware expansion pack Coast to Coast contains some new locomotives, maps and scenarios. Among the scenarios are imperial Russia and the People's Republic of China. There are unusual scenarios as well; including one in which the United States never underwent the Revolution, instead divided into seven separate nations. With the release of the Coast to Coast expansion pack, in addition to creating maps and scenarios, players were provided with tools to create custom logos, locomotive skins, and players.

It has been in use in its current form since 1975. Prior to the adoption of the current coat of arms, Greece used a number of different designs, some of which were not heraldic; the first heraldic design was introduced in 1832 and its main element, the blue shield with the white cross, has been the base for all other national coats of arms since then. The origin of the design is unclear, but it is most likely a heraldic representation of the Greek national flag adopted in 1822, which featured a white cross on a blue field. The proper heraldic description of the coat of arms is: . The Law regulating the coat of arms does not specify a tincture for the laurel branches, implying proper (or vert, i.e. green). Official usage portrays the laurel branches as monochrome blue, while a version with the branches in gold is used by the military and on the presidential standard. Since standardisation in 2010, the Government of Greece has used a stylised version of the coat of arms as a government logo, again in monochrome. In periods of monarchy, the shield was topped by a royal crown and surrounded by elaborate ornamentation expressive of royal authority, including male figures as supporters, the Order of the Redeemer, a mantle and pavilion, and the royal motto. The shield was also sometimes charged with the dynastic arms of House of Wittelsbach under Otto of Greece, and by those of the House of Gl√ºcksburg after his exile. Other designs adopted prior to 1832 made heavy use of ancient Greek imagery, such as Athena and her owl, as well as other popular revolutionary symbols such as the Phoenix rising from its ashes, symbolising the rebirth of Greece as an independent state. History =Non- heraldic designs= The political thinker and revolutionary Rigas Feraios was the first to propose a national emblem for Greece, including a hand-drawing rendition of it in his hand-written New Political Constitution of 1797. Rigas' proposal was composed of a club of Heracles, with the words superimposed on it, and three crosses topping it. In his Map of Greece of 17961797, Rigas explains that the club stands for the power of Greece, but its use was not limited to ethnic Greeks and could also be used by any of the other Balkan peoples he envisaged would make up his multi-ethnic Hellenic Republic. In his selection of this device, however, he was directly influenced by the Jacobin radicalism of the French Revolution, which utilised the device of the club of Heracles as a symbol of democratic power. The national colours he proposed were red, white, and black, symbolising self-determination, purity, and sacrifice respectively. The club, sewn onto a white cockade, would be the identifying mark by which \\"free democrats and equal brothers\\" would recognise each other. This design was never officially adopted. The first official Greek national emblem was described in the Provisional Constitution adopted by the First National Assembly at Epidaurus on 1 January 1822 and was established by decree on 15 March of the same year. The national emblem was described as a simple cockade of white and blue. These colours were chosen as the national colours over more \\"revolutionary\\" choices such as black and red, popular in Greece ever since Rigas had proposed them, so as to disassociate the government and the revolution from any perceived links to radical movements in the eyes of the conservative European royal courts. Since its establishment, the emblem has undergone many changes in shape and in design, mainly due to changes of regime. Apart from the cockade, the Provisional Administration of Greece used a seal depicting the goddess Athena and her symbol, the Owl of Athena, encircled by the words \\"Provisional Administration of Greece\\". During the governorate of Ioannis Kapodistrias (1827‚Äì1831), a new seal based on the phoenix, the symbol of rebirth, was created. The words \\"Hellenic State\\", accompanied with the date \\"1821\\" (the year the Greek War of Independence began) in Greek numerals, surrounded it. This seal gave Greece's first currency, the Phoenix, its name. The phoenix was also used as a symbol by later Greek non-monarchical governments, including the Second Hellenic Republic (1924‚Äì1935) and the junta-proclaimed republic of 1973‚Äì1974.

The current coat of arms of Greece derives from the Greek national flag, which was adopted in March 1822. Theories published retrospectively in Greece try to justify this use by making a connection to Byzantine flags and insignia. The 1934 edition of the Great Greek Encyclopedia explains that \\"the current national emblem of Greece shares this with the last emblem of Medieval [Greece], that it is made up of a cross dividing the emblem into four quarters. The difference is that the emblem of the Imperial house of the Palaiologoi also had a capital B in each of the quarters\\". This design is well attested in Byzantine and Western sources during the 14th and 15th centuries, but as the Byzantines entirely lacked the Western tradition of \\"national\\" or family heraldic designs as coats of arms, this design was only used in flags. Wittelsbach dynasty The introduction of the blue shield with the white cross as the heraldic device to represent Greece occurred on , when the regency which was governing Greece on behalf of its first king, Otto, announced the official design for the coat of arms. Approved by Prime Minister Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, it detailed the entire heraldic achievement and described, in Greek and German, its constituent parts. The lesser arms are described as an \\"equidistant azure escutcheon, pointed towards the middle of its lower side, and containing the Greek cross, argent, bearing at its centre a smaller escutcheon with the lozenges of the Royal House of Bavaria.\\" The shade of blue is specified as light blue (). The escutcheon itself was supported by two crowned lions rampant and surmounted by the royal crown. The entire composition was contained within a mantle and pavilion, purpleThe exact words used were \\"œÄŒøœÅœÜœÖœÅŒø·ø¶ŒΩ\\" in Greek and \\"purpurnen\\" in German. on the outside and ermine on the inside, topped again with the royal crown. This emblem was discarded following the 23 October 1862 Revolution and Otto's subsequent exile. Despite this fact, however, the blue shield with the white cross remained the basis upon which all subsequent coats of arms were based, including the current arms of the Third Hellenic Republic. The white and blue cockade of the revolutionary period was reinstated in March 1833, this time blue on the outside and white on the inside, so that the blue centre was equal to two thirds of the diameter of the cockade. This design, described both as a \\"national emblem\\" (·ºêŒ∏ŒΩœåœÉŒ∑ŒºŒøŒΩ) and a \\"cockade\\" (Œ∫ŒøŒ∫Œ¨œÅŒ¥Œ±) in Greek and as the \\"national cockade\\" (National-Kokarde) in German, was to be worn on caps by uniformed military and civilian personnel as well as on the hats of private citizens that wished to display their national pride. Gl√ºcksburg dynasty and Second Republic Following Otto's deposition in 1862, the 17-year old Prince William of Denmark was chosen in 1863 as Greece's new king. The coat of arms was suitably altered by the Royal Decree of 9 November 1863. The text of the decree was almost identical to that of 1833, with minor additions and removals to accommodate Greece's new royal house, the House of Gl√ºcksburg. The escutcheon remained the same, but the dynastic arms of the Gl√ºcksburg family, including the three lions of the arms of Denmark proper, the two lions of Schleswig, the nettle leaf of Holstein, the horse head of Lauenburg, the two red bars of the House of Oldenburg and the yellow cross of Delmenhorst, were added in the centre of the cross when the coat of arms was used to represent members of the Greek royal family. The shield remained surmounted by the royal crown but the supporters were changed to figures of Heracles, similar to the \\"wild men\\" of the coat of arms of Denmark. This gave rise to the use of \\"·º©œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒµ·øñœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ£œÑŒ≠ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ\\" (\\"Heracleses of the Crown\\") as a derogatory term for Greek monarchists. The Order of the Redeemer was also added, while the royal motto, \\" ·º∏œÉœáœçœÇ ŒºŒøœÖ ·º° ·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨œÄŒ∑ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒªŒ±Œø·ø¶\\" (\\"The people's love is my strength\\"), was also introduced in gold lettering on an azure band. When Greece became a republic in 1924, all ornamentation was discarded and a simple escutcheon adopted as the coat of arms. During the short-lived dictatorship of Theodoros Pangalos four symbols were added to the national emblem in the four quarters created by the cross: the head of Athena, symbolising the ancient Greek period; a helmet and spear, symbolising the Hellenistic period; a double- headed eagle, symbolising the Byzantine period; and a phoenix rising from its ashes, symbolising the modern Greek period. A wreath of oak and laurel surrounded the emblem, symbolising power and glory, respectively. This particular emblem was criticised for being inappropriate and violating heraldic rules before being again replaced by the simple shield following the fall of Pangalos and his dictatorship. This lasted until the abolition of the republic in 1935; sometimes a phoenix was added in the centre of the cross as a symbol of republicanism. Following the return of the monarchy in 1935, the original smaller version of the coat of arms of Denmark representing the royal family was supplanted by the greater coat of arms of Denmark of 1819‚Äì1903, and consequently also in 1863 when the Danish prince William accepted the Greek throne as King George I. This greater arms included all the former elements, as well as the three crowns of the former Kalmar Union, the stockfish of Iceland, the ram of Faroe Islands, the polar bear of Greenland, the lion and hearts of the King of the Goths, the wyvern of the King of the Wends, the swan with a crown of Stormarn, and the knight on horseback of Dithmarschen. In 1973, the then-ruling military junta abolished the monarchy, which was confirmed by a subsequent referendum. After the collapse of the military regime in 1974, the new government decided to hold another referendum regarding the form of government as acts of the junta were considered to be illegal. The 1974 referendum resulted in the republican form of government being maintained. This abolished the royal coats of arms, but the achievement remains in use by the current pretenders of the Greek royal family.

The current emblem is defined by Law 48/1975. The blue shield with the white cross was restored, and the proportions of the escutcheon specified as longer than its width. The shield is surrounded entirely by two branches of laurel; their colour is not specified but in practice they are almost universally shown as monochromatic. The coat of arms was designed in 1974 by Greek artist . The government uses a stylised version of the coat of arms as a government logo. The design was implemented beginning in 2010 as a means of standardising the branding of the various Greek government ministries. It specified the design and colour of the national emblem when used as a logo, and designated FF Meta as the official typeface for use across all media to represent the Government of Greece. Instead of showing the blue parts of the shield as solid colour, the government logo utilises heraldic hatching, with horizontal lines signifying azure (blue). The Great Seal of the State (ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöœÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ£œÜœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒØœÇ) is Greece's official Great Seal, used to confirm official documents. The current design was set out in the same law that specified the coat of arms in 1975; it is made up of the coat of arms, surrounded by the words Hellenic Republic (ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±) in capital letters, contained within a circle in diameter. Previous Great Seals were also specified by previous decrees specifying the older coats of arms in 1833 and 1863.

The colours used to render the coat of arms are inconsistent. The original regulation does not specify a colour for the branches of laurel surrounding the escutcheon, implying that they should be green, or proper tincture. In effect, however, usage varies greatly. The 2003 version of the provide a scalable vector graphic file of the coat of arms in black, without specifying any colours. Other government guidelines, such as that used in the Publicity Guidelines for public works (as part of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund), are heraldically inconsistent and require the laurel branches to be green (if not black-and-white), but the blue of the escutcheon is shown as horizontal hatching instead of solid colour. Similar guidelines were issued by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue as late as 2017. The most common usage is that of the laurel branches in monochrome. The general government guidelines which regulate the government logo are monochromatic, and so the laurel branches are not coloured. The official shade of blue that the coat of arms should be rendered in is also not specified. Historically, the shade has varied from light blue under King Otto to darker shades in later years. Differing shades of blue were also used by different departments of the Government of Greece, until the guidelines regulating the government logo were implemented in 2010. These specified the various colour codes to be used: * HEX #004588 as displayed digitally * Pantone 280 U/C/M or CMYK 100/70/0/20 The military of Greece uses a version of the coat of arms which has the laurel branches in gold. The standard of the President of Greece also uses this design, in his capacity as nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The various branches of the military have their own specifications for different types of usage. For example, the 2009 specifications for the colours of threads to be used on service caps, specified in CIELAB color space coordinates, were: * 86.20/2.66/49.65 for caps of type I (yellow thread) * 73.49/4.58/42.12 for caps of type II (goldwork) * 92.86/2.70/9.50 for all caps * 28.58/10.69/39.83 for all caps See also *Flag of Greece *Armorial of Europe References Sources   Category:National symbols of Greece Greece Category:Greek coats of arms Greece ","title":"Coat of arms of Greece"},{"id":"3012045","text":"The 142nd Fighter Wing (142 FW sometimes 142d) is a unit of the Oregon Air National Guard, stationed at Portland Air National Guard Base, Oregon.

It is under the jurisdiction of the Oregon Air National Guard unless it is federalized by order of the president of the United States. If activated to federal service, the wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. The 123rd Fighter Squadron assigned to the wing's 142nd Operations Group, is a descendant organization of 123rd Observation Squadron, formed on 30 July 1940. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II.

History =World War II= Republic P-47D-28-RE Thunderbolt, AAF Ser. No. 44-200284, of the 404th Fighter Squadron (photo taken at F√ºrth/Industrieflughafen, Germany.) Formed at Westover Field, Massachusetts in August 1943 and trained in the mid-Atlantic area, they moved to the European theater during February and March 1944 and served in combat with Ninth AF from April 1944 to May 1945. Began operations, using P-47s, by making a fighter sweep over France. Flew fighter- sweep, dive- bombing, and escort missions prior to the invasion of the continent. Attacked railroads, trains, vehicles, gun emplacements, and buildings in France during the invasion of 6 June 1944. Patrolled beachhead areas and continued its assaults against the enemy during the remainder of the Normandy campaign. Participated in the aerial barrage that prepared the way for the Allied breakthrough at St Lo on 25 July, and supported the subsequent drive across northern France. Operated in the area of northeastern France and southwestern Germany during the fall and winter of 1944‚Äì1945, attacking such targets as storage dumps, trains, rail lines, marshalling yards, buildings, factories, bridges, roads, vehicles, and strong points. Conducted operations that supported Allied ground action in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944‚Äì January 1945. Launched a series of attacks against vehicles, factories, buildings, railroad cars, tanks, and gun emplacements during the period 15‚Äì21 March 1945, being awarded a DUC for this six-day action that contributed to the defeat of the enemy in southern Germany. Continued operations until May 1945. Returned to the US, October and November 1945 and inactivated. =Oregon Air National Guard= The wartime 371st Fighter Group was re-activated and re- designated as the 142nd Fighter Group, and was allotted to the Oregon Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Portland Municipal Airport, Oregon, and was extended federal recognition on 30 August 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 142nd Fighter Group was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the 371st Fighter Group. The group's 123rd Fighter Squadron was equipped with P-51D Mustangs and was assigned to the Fourth Air Force, Air Defense Command. Korean War activation The group was federalized and brought to active duty on 2 March 1951. It was assigned to the Air Defense Command Western Air Defense Force. It was then reassigned to the federalized Washington ANG 142nd Fighter-Interceptor Wing on 11 April and moved to O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois, by 1 May 1951. Re- designated 142nd Fighter-Interceptor Group on 1 May 1951. At O'Hare, the 142nd Fighter Group controlled the 62nd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, flying F-86A Sabre day interceptors. The group was inactivated on 6 February 1952, being replaced by the 4706th Air Defense Wing. =Cold War= A two-seat McDonnell F-101B Voodoo Re-formed as the 142nd Fighter-Interceptor Group, flying F-86F Sabre day interceptor aircraft. It resumed its peacetime mission of the air defense of Oregon. Was upgraded by ADC in 1955 to the dedicated F-94A Starfire all-weather interceptor. With this new aircraft, the mission of the 123rd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron changed from day interceptor to day and night all-weather interceptor. In 1957 the 123rd again upgraded to the improved F-89J Scorpion then in 1966 to the supersonic F-102A Delta Dagger. In the summer of 1958, the 142nd implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 123rd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert 24/7/365. The runway alert continues to this day. In 1972 it received the Mach-2 F-101B Voodoo. As an example of the unit's readiness and capability, in 1976, the unit won top honors at a pair of Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) competitions, the Weapons Loading Competition and the famous William Tell Air Defense Competition. In William Tell 1976, the 142nd garnered first place in the F-101 category and Lieutenant Colonel Don Tonole and Major Brad Newell captured the overall \\"Top Gun\\" title flying the McDonnell F-101B Voodoo. After the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command in 1979 and the reassignment to Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), the 123rd began receiving F-4C Phantom II aircraft used in the interceptor mission beginning in 1981. Success came again at William Tell 1984 when the unit placed first in the F-4 category flying the McDonnell-Douglas F-4C Phantom II and beat many of its F-15 Eagle and F-106 Delta Dart rivals in the overall competition. Majors Ron Moore and Bill Dejager were the overall F-4 \\"Top Guns\\" of the competition. In 1985, as part of the retirement of the F-4C from the inventory, the Oregon Air National Guard began to receive F-15A Eagles from active-duty units receiving the upgraded F-15C. Since the end of the Cold War, the 142nd has served as the principal air defense unit of the Pacific Northwest. In 1992, as part of a large USAF reorganization, both the group and squadron were re- designated yet again as the 142nd Fighter Group and the 123rd Fighter Squadron, respectively. In 1995 the group was elevated to wing status, beginning its current designation as the 142nd Fighter Wing. The wing participated in a wide variety of expeditionary and humanitarian assistance missions in the turbulent post-Cold War environment while providing air defense of the Pacific Northwest. These included major deployments to Turkey in 1998 for Operation Northern Watch and to Saudi Arabia in 2000 for Operation Southern Watch, patrolling the no-fly zones then in place over Iraq. The wing deployed aircraft to Panama in 1998 in support of counter-drug missions, helping stem the flow of the drug trade by air. Wing personnel deployed on various other missions, sending medical troops to Belize, civil engineers to Macedonia, and to such places around the globe as Cura√ßao, Denmark, Germany, Guam, Kuwait, Spain and the United Kingdom. Global War on Terrorism On 11 September 2001, the wing was one of the first units to respond to the terrorist attacks on the east coast with increased air defense to enhance security on the west coast, and subsequently participated in Operation Noble Eagle, the national military response to homeland defense. In the 50th Year of William Tell Anniversary Competition held in 2004, the 142nd Fighter Wing was rated first in maintenance, element attack and gun categories. These William Tell successes demonstrate Oregon's long history of excellent performance and readiness to accomplish the real world mission. In 2004, unit personnel provided humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2007 floods in Vernonia, Oregon. The wing also supported ongoing contingency operations in Southwest Asia, including Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, such as in the 2004 deployment of medical personnel to Qatar and the 2009 deployment of Security Forces Squadron personnel to Iraq. In 2005, the early 1970s F-15A model were retired and the squadron received its current aircraft, the F-15C Eagle. With more than 1,000 officers and airmen, the 142nd Fighter Wing guards the Pacific Northwest skies from northern California to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, on 24-hour Air Sovereignty Alert as part of Air Combat Command the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The wing also stands ready to participate in state and federal contingency missions as required. The base was selected by the 2005 BRAC to close. Eleventh-hour negotiations between the political delegations from the states of Washington and Oregon saved the base from closure. Ironically the argument made by several groups to save the base was that of the NORAD mission it performed and the air cover it provided for the Pacific Northwest was essential to homeland security. However, the 2005 BRAC commission recommended keeping a small detachment in place at the base in order to support NORAD but close all other operations. As part of the recommendations of the 2005 BRAC, the Air Force Reserve Command's 939th Air Refueling Wing, which flew KC-135 aircraft and was colocated on the Portland Air National Guard Station, terminated operations. On 26 June 2007, an F-15 Eagle from the 142nd Fighter Wing crashed into the Pacific Ocean during a simulated dogfight. Two F-15s from the 142nd were flying with two F/A-18 Hornets from Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base performing dissimilar air combat training. The United States Coast Guard performed a search using two HH-60 Jayhawks, two Coast Guard Cutters, and one HC-130 Hercules. The night of the crash, the pilot, Major Gregory Young's body was found 40 miles west of Cannon Beach, Oregon. The crash was due to unrecognized spatial disorientation, which caused the pilot to misperceive his attitude, altitude, and airspeed until his aircraft impacted the water. In August 2010, two F-15 Eagles from this wing were dispatched in response to an airspace violation while the president visited Seattle, Washington.

During dry weather (and small storms), all flows are handled by the publicly owned treatment works (POTW). During large storms, the relief structure allows some of the combined stormwater and sewage to be discharged untreated to an adjacent water body. A combined sewer is a sewage collection system of pipes and tunnels designed to simultaneously collect surface runoff and sewage water in a shared system. This type of gravity sewer design is no longer used in almost any instance worldwide when constructing new sewer systems. Modern-day sewer designs exclude surface runoff from sanitary sewers, but many older cities and towns continue to operate previously constructed combined sewer systems. Combined sewers can cause serious water pollution problems during combined sewer overflow (CSO) events when combined sewage and surface runoff flows exceed the capacity of the sewage treatment plant, or of the maximum flow rate of the system which transmits the combined sources. In instances where exceptionally high surface runoff occurs (such as large rainstorms), the load on individual tributary branches of the sewer system may cause a back-up to a point where raw sewage flows out of input sources such a toilet, causing inhabited buildings to be flooded with a toxic sewage-runoff mixture, incurring massive financial burdens for cleanup and repair. When combined sewer systems experience these higher than normal throughputs, relief systems cause discharges containing human and industrial waste to flow into rivers, streams, or other bodies of water. Such events frequently cause both negative environmental and lifestyle consequences, including beach closures, contaminated shellfish unsafe for consumption, and contamination of drinking water sources, rendering them temporarily unsafe for drinking and requiring boiling before uses such as bathing or washing dishes.  Background  Recent archaeological discoveries have shown that some of the earliest sewer systems were developed 2500 BC in the ancient city of Harappa. The primitive sewers were carved in the ground alongside buildings. This discovery reveals the conceptual understanding of waste disposal by the early civilizations.handyrubbish.co.uk. \\"Brief History of Sewers in the Ancient World.\\" The earliest sewers were designed to carry street runoff away from inhabited areas and into surface waterways without treatment. Before the 19th century it was commonplace to empty human waste receptacles, e.g., chamberpots, into town and city streets and slaughter animals in open street \\"shambles,\\" while the use of draft animals such as horses and herding of livestock through city streets meant that most contained large amounts of excrement, while paving systems pre-Macadam were mostly porous, so that precipitation could soak away and not run-off and urban rooftop rainwater was often saved in rainwater tanks. Open sewers, consisting of gutters and urban streambeds, were common worldwide before the 20th century. In the majority of developed countries, large efforts were made during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to cover the formerly open sewers, converting them to closed systems with cast iron, steel, or concrete pipes, masonry, and concrete arches, while streets and footpaths were increasingly covered with impermeable paving systems. Most sewage collection systems of the 19th and early to mid 20th century used single-pipe systems that collect both sewage and urban runoff from streets and roofs (to the extent that relatively clean rooftop rainwater was not saved in butts and cisterns for drinking and washing.) This type of collection system is referred to as a combined sewer system. The rationale for combining the two was that it would be cheaper to build just a single system. Most cities at that time did not have sewage treatment plants, so there was no perceived public health advantage in constructing a separate \\"surface water sewerage\\" (UK terminology) or \\"storm sewer\\" (US terminology) system. Moreover, runoff was, pre- automobile, likely to be typically highly contaminated with animal waste, while until the mid-late 19thy century, the frequent used of shambles (open street slaughterhouses) contributed more waste. The widespread replacement of horses with automotive propulsion, paving of city streets and surfaces, construction of municipal slaughterhouses, and provision of mains water in the 20th century changed the nature and volume of urban runoff to be initially cleaner, include water that formerly soaked away and previously saved rooftop rainwater after combined sewers were already widely adopted. When constructed, combined sewer systems were typically sized to carry three to 160 times the average dry weather sewage flows. It is generally infeasible to treat the volume of mixed sewage and surface runoff flowing in a combined sewer during peak runoff events caused by snowmelt or convective precipitation. As cities built sewage treatment plants, those plants were typically built to treat only the volume of sewage flowing during dry weather. Relief structures were installed in the collection system to bypass untreated sewage mixed with surface runoff during wet weather, protecting sewage treatment plants from damage caused if peak flows reached the headworks. Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) Combined sewer outflow into the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. Photo of the interior of a combined sewer in Brighton, England. These relief structures, called storm-water regulators (in American English - or combined sewer overflows in British English) are constructed in combined sewer systems to divert flows in excess of the peak design flow of the sewage treatment plant. Combined sewers are built with control sections establishing stage- discharge or pressure differential-discharge relationships which may be either predicted or calibrated to divert flows in excess of sewage treatment plant capacity. A leaping weir may be used as a regulating device allowing typical dry-weather sewage flow rates to fall into an interceptor sewer to the sewage treatment plant, but causing a major portion of higher flow rates to leap over the interceptor into the diversion outfall. Alternatively, an orifice may be sized to accept the sewage treatment plant design capacity and cause excess flow to accumulate above the orifice until it overtops a side-overflow weir to the diversion outfall. CSO statistics may be confusing because the term may describe either the number of events or the number of relief structure locations at which such events may occur. A CSO event, as the term is used in American English, occurs when mixed sewage and stormwater are bypassed from a combined sewer system control section into a river, stream, lake, or ocean through a designed diversion outfall, but without treatment. Overflow frequency and duration varies both from system to system, and from outfall to outfall, within a single combined sewer system. Some CSO outfalls discharge infrequently, while others activate every time it rains. The storm water component contributes pollutants to CSO; but a major faction of pollution is the first foul flush of accumulated biofilm and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather wetted perimeter of combined sewers during peak flow turbulence. Each storm is different in the quantity and type of pollutants it contributes. For example, storms that occur in late summer, when it has not rained for a while, have the most pollutants. Pollutants like oil, grease, fecal coliform from pet and wildlife waste, and pesticides get flushed into the sewer system. In cold weather areas, pollutants from cars, people and animals also accumulate on hard surfaces and grass during the winter and then are flushed into the sewer systems during heavy spring rains. =Health impacts= CSO discharges during heavy storms can cause serious water pollution problems. The discharges contain human and industrial waste, and can cause beach closings, restrictions on shellfish consumption and contamination of drinking water sources. =Comparison to sanitary sewer overflows= CSOs should not be confused with sanitary sewer overflows. Sanitary sewer overflows are caused by sewer system obstructions, damage, or flows in excess of sewer capacity (rather than treatment plant capacity.) Sanitary sewer overflows may occur at any low spot in the sewer system rather than at the CSO relief structures. Absence of a diversion outfall often causes sanitary sewer overflows to flood residential structures and/or flow over traveled road surfaces before reaching natural drainage channels. Sanitary sewer overflows may cause greater health risks and environmental damage than CSOs if they occur during dry weather when there is no precipitation runoff to dilute and flush away sewage pollutants. =CSOs in the United States= Northeast and Great Lakes regions, and the Pacific Northwest. About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people. Pollutants from CSO discharges can include bacteria and other pathogens, toxic chemicals, and debris. These pollutants have also been linked with antimicrobial resistance, posing serious public health concerns. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a policy in 1994 requiring municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate CSO-related pollution problems.EPA (1994-04-19). \\"Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy.\\" Federal Register, 59 FR 18688. The policy is implemented through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program. The policy defined water quality parameters for the safety of an ecosystem; it allowed for action that are site specific to control CSOs in most practical way for community; it made sure the CSO control is not beyond a community‚Äôs budget; and allowed water quality parameters to be flexible, based upon the site specific conditions. The CSO Control Policy required all publicly owned treatment works to have ‚Ä≥nine minimum controls‚Ä≥ in place by January 1, 1997, in order to decrease the effects of sewage overflow by making small improvements in existing processes. In 2000 Congress amended the Clean Water Act to require the municipalities to comply with the EPA policy.United States. Wet Weather Quality Act of 2000, Section 112 of Division B, , December 21, 2000. Added section 402(q) to Clean Water Act, . Mitigation of CSOs The United Kingdom Environment Agency identified unsatisfactory intermittent discharges and issued an Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive requiring action to limit pollution from combined sewer overflows. In 2009 the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment adopted a Canada-wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent including national standards to (1) remove floating material from combined sewer overflows, (2) prevent combined sewer overflows during dry weather, and (3) prevent development or redevelopment from increasing frequency of combined sewer overflows. Municipalities in the US have been undertaking projects to mitigate CSO since the 1990s. For example, prior to 1990, the quantity of untreated combined sewage discharged annually to lakes, rivers and streams in southeast Michigan was estimated at more than per year. In 2005, with nearly $1 billion of a planned $2.4 billion CSO investment put into operation, untreated discharges have been reduced by more than per year. This investment that has yielded an 85 percent reduction in CSO has included numerous sewer separation, CSO storage and treatment facilities and wastewater treatment plant improvements constructed by local and regional governments. Many other areas in the US are undertaking similar projects (see, for example, in the Puget Sound of Washington). Cities like Pittsburgh, Seattle, Philadelphia, and New York are focusing on these projects partly because they are under federal consent decrees to solve their CSO issues. Both up-front penalties and stipulated penalties are utilized by EPA and state agencies to enforce CSO-mitigating initiatives and the efficiency of their schedules. Municipalities' sewage departments, engineering and design firms, and environmental organizations offer different approaches to potential solutions. =Sewer separation= Some US cities have undertaken sewer separation projects ‚Äî building a second piping system for all or part of the community. In many of these projects, cities have been able to separate only portions of their combined systems. High costs or physical limitations may preclude building a completely separate system. In 2011 Washington, D.C. separated its sewers in four small neighborhoods at a cost of $11 million. (The project cost also includes improvements to the drinking water piping system.) =CSO storage= Another solution is to build a CSO storage facility, such as a tunnel that can store flow from many sewer connections. Because a tunnel can share capacity among several outfalls, it can reduce the total volume of storage that must be provided for a specific number of outfalls. Storage tunnels store combined sewage but do not treat it. When the storm is over, the flows are pumped out of the tunnel and sent to a wastewater treatment plant. One of the main concerns with CSO storage is the length of time it is stored before it is released. Without careful management of this storage period, the water in the CSO storage facility runs the risk of going septic. Washington, D.C. is building underground storage capacity as its primary strategy to address CSOs. In 2011 the city began construction on a system of four deep storage tunnels, adjacent to the Anacostia River, that will reduce overflows to the river by 98 percent, and 96 percent system-wide. The system will comprise over 18 miles of tunnels with a storage capacity of 157 million gallons. The first segment of the tunnel system, 7 miles in length, went online in 2018. The remaining segments of the storage system are scheduled for completion in 2023. (The city's overall \\"Clean Rivers\\" project, projected to cost $2.6 billion, includes other components, such as reducing stormwater flows.) The South Boston CSO Storage Tunnel is a similar project, completed in 2011. =Expanding sewage treatment capacity= Some cities have expanded their basic sewage treatment capacity to handle some or all of the CSO volume. In 2002 litigation forced the city of Toledo, Ohio to double its treatment capacity and build a storage basin in order to eliminate most overflows. The city also agreed to study ways to reduce stormwater flows into the sewer system. (See Reducing stormwater flows.)EPA (2002-08-28). \\"United States and Ohio Reach Clean Water Act Settlement with City of Toledo, Ohio.\\" Press release. =Retention basins= Retention treatment basins or large concrete tanks that store and treat combined sewage are another solution. These underground structures can range in storage and treatment capacity from to of combined sewage. While each facility is unique, a typical facility operation is as follows. Flows from the overloaded sewers are pumped into a basin that is divided into compartments. The first flush compartment captures and stores flows with the highest level of pollutants from the first part of a storm. These pollutants include motor oil, sediment, road salt, and lawn chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) that are picked up by the stormwater as it runs off roads and lawns. The flows from this compartment are stored and sent to the wastewater treatment plant when there is capacity in the interceptor sewer after the storm. The second compartment is a treatment or flow-through compartment. The flows are disinfected by injecting sodium hypochlorite, or bleach, as they enter this compartment. It then takes about 20‚Äë30 minutes for the flows to move to the end of the compartment. During this time, bacteria are killed and large solid materials settle out. At the end of the compartment, any remaining sanitary trash is skimmed off the top and the treated flows are discharged into the river or lake. =Screening and disinfection facilities= Screening and disinfection facilities treat CSO without ever storing it. Called \\"flow-through\\" facilities, they use fine screens to remove solids and sanitary trash from the combined sewage. Flows are injected with sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and mixed as they travel through a series of fine screens to remove debris. The fine screens have openings that range in size from 4 to 6 mm, or a little less than a quarter inch. The flow is sent through the facility at a rate that provides enough time for the sodium hypochlorite to kill bacteria. All of the materials removed by the screens are then sent to the sewage treatment plant through the interceptor sewer. =Reducing stormwater flows= Communities may implement low impact development techniques to reduce flows of stormwater into the collection system. This includes: *constructing new and renovated streets, parking lots and sidewalks with interlocking stones, permeable paving and pervious concrete *installing green roofs on buildings *installing bioretention systems, also called rain gardens, in landscaped areas *Rainwater harvesting equipment collects runoff from building roofs during wet weather for irrigating landscapes and gardens during dry weather *Graywater collection and use on site reduces sewage discharges at all times =Gray vs. green infrastructure= CSO mitigating initiatives that are solely composed of sewer system reconstruction are referred to as gray infrastructure, while techniques like permeable pavement and rainwater harvesting are referred to as green infrastructure. Conflict often occurs between a municipality's sewage authority and its environmentally active organizations between gray and green infrastructural plans. The 2004 EPA Report to Congress on CSO's provides a review of available technologies to mitigate CSO impacts. New approaches =Smart infrastructure= Recent technological advances in sensing and control have enabled the implementation of real-time decision support systems (RT-DSS) for CSO mitigation. Through the use of internet of things technology and cloud computing, CSO events can now be mitigated by dynamically adjusting setpoints for movable gates, pump stations, and other actuated assets in sewers and storm water management systems. Similar technology, called adaptive traffic control is used to control the flow of vehicles through traffic lights. RT-DSS systems take advantage of storm temporal and spatial variability as well as varying concentration times due to diverse land uses across the sewershed to coordinate and optimize control assets. By maximizing storage and conveyance RT-DSS are able to minimize overflows using existing infrastructure. Successful implementations of RT-DSS have been carried out throughout the United States L.

Rocky Durrans (2000). \\"Urban Wastewater Management in the United States: Past, Present, and Future.\\" Journal of Urban Technology, Vol. 7, No. 3, pp. 33-62. . As part of a trend of municipal sanitation programs in the late 19th and 20th centuries, many cities constructed extensive sewer systems to help control outbreaks of disease such as typhoid and cholera.Cady Staley, George S. Pierson (1899). The Separate System of Sewerage, Its Theory and Construction. (New York: Van Nostrand.) Initially these systems discharged sewage directly to surface waters without treatment. As pollution of water bodies became a concern, cities added sewage treatment plants to their systems. Most cities in the Western world added more expensive systems for sewage treatment in the early 20th century. As Britain was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to experience the disastrous consequences of major urbanisation and was the first to construct a sewerage system as we know it today to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions. Joseph Bazalgette designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the Thames Estuary, downstream of the main centre of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totalling almost 135 miles (217 km) in length, were constructed. The intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720 km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000 km) of smaller local sewers.Goodman, David C. and Chant, Colin (1999) European Cities and Technology (London: Routledge). With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day. In France, the Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and waster water in a better and healthier way since the Seine received up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand led the development of a large scale system for water supply and wastewater management. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified.George Commair, \\"The Waste Water Network: and underground view of Paris,\\" in Great Rivers History: Proceedings and Invited Papers for the EWRI Congress and History Symposium, May 17‚Äì19, 2009, Kansas City, Missouri, ed. Jerry R. Roger, (Reston: American Society of Civil Engineers, 2009), 91-96 Society and culture A combined sewer-pipe being laid by the city's sewerage company in Ghent, Belgium. The image of the sewer recurs in European culture as they were often used as hiding places or routes of escape by the scorned or the hunted, including partisans and resistance fighters in World War II. Fighting erupted in the sewers during the Battle of Stalingrad. The only survivors from the Warsaw Uprising and Warsaw Ghetto made their final escape through city sewers. Some have commented that the engravings of imaginary prisons by Piranesi were inspired by the Cloaca Maxima, one of the world's earliest sewers. =Regulations= United Kingdom There is in the UK a legal difference between a storm sewer and a surface water sewer. You do not have a right of connection to a storm-water overflow sewer under section 106 of the Water Industry Act.United Kingdom. Water Industry Act 1991, c. 56. Section 106, \\"Right to communicate with public sewers.\\" National Archives, UK. Accessed 2017-06-13. These are normally the pipe line that discharges to a watercourse, downstream of a combined sewer overflow. It takes the excess flow from a combined sewer. A surface water sewer conveys rainwater; legally you have a right of connection for your rainwater to this public sewer. A public storm water sewer can discharge to a public surface water, but not the other way around, without a legal change in sewer status by the water company. =In fiction= The theme of traveling through, hiding, or even residing in combined sewers is a common plot device in media. Famous examples of sewer dwelling are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Stephen King's It, Les Miserables, The Third Man, Ladyhawke, Mimic, The Phantom of the Opera, Beauty and the Beast, and Jet Set Radio Future. The Todd Strasser novel Y2K-9: the Dog Who Saved the World is centered on a dog thwarting terroristic threats to electronically sabotage American sewage treatment plants. =Sewer alligators= A well-known urban legend, the sewer alligator, is that of giant alligators or crocodiles residing in combined sewers, especially of major metropolitan areas. Two public sculptures in New York depict an alligator dragging a hapless victim into a manhole.Subway Art: New York's Underground Treasures : NPR Alligators have been known to get into combined storm sewers in the southeastern United States.

In particular it maintains a close liaison with the International Numismatic Commission, and individual members take an active interest in the work of their national numismatic organizations. In 1965 the IAPN held an international congress in Paris to consider the study of and defence against counterfeit coins, and in 1975 the association established the International Bureau for the Suppression of Counterfeit Coins (IBSCC). This bureau maintains close links with mints, police-forces, museums and collectors with the publication of specialized reports on counterfeits. Since January 1997 the information about new dangerous counterfeits and the scanned photos of the pieces are available on Internet. The Bulletin of Counterfeits and Internet-access are restricted to members only. The members of the IAPN guarantee the authenticity of all the coins and medals which they sell ‚Äì this is a condition of membership. Collectors may purchase numismatic material from any of the firms from the membership list in the full knowledge that if any item did prove to be counterfeit or not as described the piece could be returned and the purchase price would be refunded, without regard to date of purchase. Membership of the association is not lightly acquired. Applicants have to be sponsored by three members, and the vetting of applications involves a rigorous and sometimes protracted procedure. In order to be admitted the applicants must have been established in business as numismatists for at least four years and must be known to a number of members. The committee need to be satisfied that they have carried on their business in an honourable manners and that they have a good general knowledge of numismatics as well as expertise in whatever field is their speciality. The Medal of Honour of the association was established in 1963 in memory of its first president, Leonard S. Forrer, and is awarded by the President to persons of distinction whom the association wishes to honour or for distinguished services to the association.

Frederic Rogers, 1st Baron Blachford (31 January 1811 ‚Äì 21 November 1889) was a British civil servant, styled as Sir Frederick Rogers, 8th Baronet from 1851 to 1871. Biography He was born in London and educated at Eton and Oriel College, Oxford, where he had a brilliant career, winning the Craven University scholarship, and taking a double first-class in classics and mathematics. He became a fellow of Oriel College in 1833 and won the Vinerian Scholarship (1834), and fellowship (1840). He was called to the bar in 1837, but never practised. At school and at Oxford he was a contemporary of William Ewart Gladstone, and at Oxford, he began a lifelong friendship with J. H. Newman and R. W. Church; his classical and literary tastes, and his combination of liberalism in politics with High Church views in religion, together with his good social position and interesting character, made him an admired member of their circles. From 1841 to 1844 he wrote for The Times, and he helped to found The Guardian in 1846; he also did a good deal to assist the Tractarian movement. But he eventually settled down to the life of a government official. He began in 1844 as registrar of joint-stock companies, and in 1846 became commissioner of lands and emigration. Between 1857 and 1859 he was engaged in government missions abroad, connected with colonial questions, and in 1860 he was appointed permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. Sir Frederic Rogers was the guiding spirit of the Colonial Office under six successive secretaries of state. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1869 Birthday Honours and a Knight Grand Cross in the 1883 Birthday Honours. On his retirement in 1871, he was raised to the Peerage as Baron Blachford, of Wisdome in the County of Devon, a title taken from his country home. His barony became extinct upon his death in 1889.

He served as a Judge of the High Court of Justice between 1876 and 1898. Background and education Born at Hitchin, Hertfordshire, Hawkins was the son of John Hawkins, a solicitor, and Susanna, daughter of Theed Pearse. Through his father he was early familiarised with legal principles. He was educated at Bedford School, and was called to the Bar, Middle Temple, in 1843.thepeerage.com Henry Hawkins, 1st and last Baron Brampton of Brampton Legal career 1843-1876 Hawkins at once joined the old home circuit, and after enjoying a lucrative practice as a junior, became a barrister in 1858 and a Queen's Counsel in 1859. His name is identified with many of the famous trials of the reign of Queen Victoria. He was engaged in the Simon Bernard case, in that of Roupell v. Waite, and in the Overend-Gurney prosecutions. The two causes c√©l√®bres, however, in which Hawkins attained his highest legal distinction were the Tichborne trials and the great will case of Sugden v. Lord St. Leonards, relating to the lost will of Edward Sugden, 1st Baron St Leonards. In both of these he won. He had a lucrative business in references and arbitrations, and acted for the royal commissioners in the purchase of the site for the new law courts. Election petitions also formed another branch of his extensive practice. Judicial career 1876-1898 Hawkins was raised to the bench in 1876, and was assigned to the then exchequer division of the High Court of Justice, not as baron (an appellation which was being abolished by the Judicature Act), but with the title of Sir Henry Hawkins. His knowledge of the criminal law was extensive and intimate and he got a reputation as a hanging judge. Hawkins would be the judge at a large number of the most famous English criminal trials of his day. His first major case was the 1877 trial of Louis Staunton, his brother Patrick, and two others for the murder of Louis' wife Harriet and her baby by starvation. A question regarding whether he was too favourable to the prosecution's case (coupled with evidence of meningitis rather than starvation being the cause of death) led to a public campaign orchestrated by the novelist Charles Reade. The decision reduced the sentences of the three convicted defendants (for the Staunton brothers prison sentences rather than death sentences). Patrick Staunton's barrister, Edward Clarke, never forgave Hawkins, whom he considered a wicked judge, and refused years later to support any attempt by the British Bar to celebrate the man upon his retirement. Other trials that Hawkins presided over included Dr George Henry Lamson for the poisoning of his brother-in-law Percy Johns at Wimbledon in December 1881 (the trial was in April 1882); the trial of Mary Fitzpatrick for murder in November 1882; the Earl of Euston's 1889 libel case against newspaper editor Ernest Parke ‚Äì a notorious miscarriage of justice that was part of the Cleveland Street scandal; the trial of Dr Thomas Neill Cream for the Lambeth/Stepney poisonings of prostitutes from December 1891 to April 1892 (the trial was in November 1892); and the trial of Albert Milsom and Henry Fowler for the Muswell Hill murder in February 1896 (the trial was in May 1896). In 1898 he retired from the bench. The following year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Brampton, of Brampton in the County of Huntingdon, and sworn of the Privy Council. He frequently took part in determining House of Lords appeals. Personal life The grave of Henry Hawkins, Lord Brampton, Kensal Green Cemetery. Lord Brampton was twice married. He married firstly Hannah T. Casey. After her death in September 1886 he married secondly Jane Louisa, daughter of Henry Francis Reynolds, in 1887. He held for many years the office of counsel to the Jockey Club, and as an active member of that body found relaxation from his legal and judicial duties at the leading race meetings, and was considered a capable judge of horses. In 1898 he converted to Catholicism, and in 1903 he presented, in conjunction with Lady Brampton (his second wife), the chapel of Sts. Augustine and Gregory to the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral, which was consecrated in that year. In 1904 he published his Reminiscences edited by Richard Harris, K.C. ( Publisher; Edward Arnold, London) Lord Brampton died at Tilney Street, Park Lane, London, on 6 October 1907, aged 90, when the barony became extinct. He left a fortune of ¬£141,000. Lady Brampton (Jane Louisa Reynolds) died in November the following year. They are buried together in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. References * *Adam, Hargrave L. (ed.)

Ernest Augustus was a soldier and served with some distinction under Emperor Leopold I during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1715, he became Prince-Bishop of Osnabr√ºck. Early life Ernest Augustus was born on 17 September 1674. He was the sixth son and seventh child of Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, and Sophia of the Palatinate, and a younger brother of the future George I of Great Britain. Ernest Augustus's father was Prince-Bishop of Osnabr√ºck,\\"The Treaty of Westphalia (1648) had stipulated that the bishopric of Osnabr√ºck, a principality within the Holy Roman empire, should alternate between a Catholic prelate and a Protestant prince; the Protestant bishops were secular rulers rather than churchmen.\\" and the first five years of his life were spent in Osnabr√ºck, until his father became Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and the family moved to Hanover. His education followed the customs of the time, by which German princes were expected to travel to foreign courts to make contacts and learn how to conduct diplomatic relations. In the summer of his 20th year, he visited the French court at Versailles via Amsterdam. While there, he turned 20 and the two brothers were popular with the French royal family.  Military career  Herrenhausen palace and gardens, Hanover After his visit to France, he trod the well-worn path for young German princes of those times and served as a soldier. His family interests were aligned with those of Emperor Leopold I and so he fought again the French in the Nine Years' War and was present at the Battle of Neerwinden in 1693. He continued his military career during the War of Spanish Succession and was actively engaged in the Siege of Lille (1708). After his father's death, George inherited all his lands and titles, including the electorate. His father, as part of the conditions he had to fulfil to acquire an electorship, had adopted primogeniture, thus disinheriting younger sons. Unlike his four elder brothers, Ernest Augustus did not oppose this change; consequently he got on well with his eldest brother George who trusted him. He was a prominent member of his brother's court at Herrenhausen, in Hanover, receiving diplomatic visitors and taking an active role in the cultural interests of the court. His influence may have helped secure the position of Kapellmeister for Handel at the court.  Dynastic role  The Bishop's Palace at Osnabr√ºck (after 1777) With his accession to the British throne, George moved to London and Ernest Augustus took on the mantle of the senior head of the family in Brunswick-L√ºneburg. In this capacity, he became regent in all but name, and took on the duty of care for George's seven-year-old grandson, Frederick Lewis, the future Prince of Wales and father-to-be of George III. Frederick was left in Germany as a diplomatic move, to reassure the populace and any ambitious neighbouring states of the family's continuing commitment to its German lands. Upon the death of Charles Joseph, Elector of Trier, in 1715, under the terms of the Treaty of Westphalia, it was the turn of a Protestant to become Prince-Bishop of Osnabr√ºck. This position as a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and ruler of an independent principality had to alternate between Catholics and Lutherans according to the treaty. Usually a member of the House of Welf held the office whenever the turn came to Protestants. As Ernest Augustus's elder brother Maximilian William of Brunswick-Luneburg had become a Catholic, King George nominated Ernest Augustus to be elected by the Osnabr√ºck cathedral chapter. The position was not just an honorific, and so Ernest Augustus had to divide his time between Schloss Osnabr√ºck and the court at Herrenhausen. In 1716, Ernst visited England where, on 29 June 1716, he was created Duke of York and Albany, and Earl of Ulster.\\"These titles had previously been held by James II during the reign of his brother Charles II\\" On 30 April 1718 (OS), he was created a Knight of the Garter together with his grand-nephew Frederick, later Prince of Wales.Ernest Augustus and Frederick would have been knighted in August 1716, but was delayed until December and in the end it did not take place until 30 April 1718 when both were represented by proxies.  Death  After his sojourn to Great Britain, Ernest Augustus returned to his previous life and continued to divide his time between Schloss Osnabr√ºck and the court at Herrenhausen, while actively managing the affairs of both states. He died at Osnabr√ºck on 14 August 1728 (NS) and was buried there. One year earlier his brother George I had also died there on a journey. Believed to be homosexual, Ernest Augustus never married. Upon his death, his British and Irish peerages became extinct.

James Bratt has identified a number of different types of Dutch Calvinism: The Seceders, split into the Reformed Church \\"West\\" and the Confessionalists; the Neo-Calvinists; and the Positives and the Antithetical Calvinists. The Seceders were largely infralapsarian and the Neo-Calvinists usually supralapsarian. Kuyper wanted to awaken the church from what he viewed as its pietistic slumber. He declared: This refrain has become something of a rallying call for Neo-Calvinists.  Emphases of Neo-Calvinism  Source:. *Jesus is Lord over all of creation. Jesus‚Äô Lordship extends through every area and aspect of lifeit is not restricted to the sphere of church or of personal piety. *The idea that all of life is to be redeemed. The work of Jesus on the cross extends over all of lifeno area is exempt from its impact. All knowledge is affected by the true knowledge of God through redemption in Christ.. *Cultural Mandate. Genesis 1:26‚Äì28 has been described as a cultural mandate. It is the mandate to cultivate and develop the creation. There is a historical development and cultural unfolding. Some Neo-Calvinists hold that the Cultural Mandate is as important as the Great Commission. *Creation, fall and redemption. God‚Äôs good creation has been disrupted by the fall. Redemption is a restoration of creation.. *Sphere sovereignty (Soevereiniteit in eigen kring). Each sphere (or sector) of life has its own distinct responsibilities and authority as designed by Godfor instance, communities dedicated to worship, civil justice, agriculture, family, etc.and no one area of life is sovereign over another. Hence, neither faith-institutions nor an institution of civil justice (that is, the state) should seek totalitarian control or any regulation of human activity outside their limited competence.. *A rejection of dualism. Dualisms are (purportedly false) bifurcations, dichotomies, contrasts, or oppositions, such as the dualism between nature and grace that [allegedly] dominated much of Scholasticism. In the Neo-Calvinist view, nature is the God-created and sustained cosmic order, not a \\"non-supernatural\\" category, and grace is God's means of renewing the cosmic order, it is not something \\"non-creational\\" added onto nature (albeit eschatological in consummated glorification of bodily resurrection to eternal life and cosmic transformation of the new heavens and earth). *Structure and direction. Structure denotes created laws and norms for (other) created things. Direction denotes relative deviation or conformity to norms; primarily regarding the central orientation of the human heart toward or away from God in Christ. *Common grace. God providentially sustains the created order, restraining of possible evils and giving non-salvific good gifts to all humanity despite their fall into sin, God's curse, and his eventual condemnation of the unredeemed.. *Presuppositional apologetics. The only framework in which any fact about the world is intelligible is the Christian worldview in general, and the theologically Reformed worldview in particular. The principles of logic and the use of reason assume the existence of God. Presuppositionalism is a reductio ad absurdum approach to Christian apologetics, in that it argues that all non-Christian worldviews are internally inconsistent. *The antithesis. There is a struggle in history and within every personbetween submission to and rebellion against God; between the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness; between the age to come (already inaugurated in Christ) and this present evil age (of sin). *World views. Neo-Calvinists reject the notion that theoretical thought can be religiously neutral. All thinking and practice is shaped by world views and religious ground motives. For the Neo-Calvinist, life in all its aspects can be shaped by a distinctively Christian world view.. *The role of law. For Neo- Calvinists, \\"Law\\" is more than the Mosaic Decalogue, or even the entire abiding moral will of God. Law is, rather, the order for creation (or creation ordinances) established by God and includes a variety of types of cultural norms including physiological, psychological, logical, historical, linguistic, social, economic, aesthetic, juridical, and faith norms.

He was successively Solicitor General and Lord Chancellor of England. He presided over the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots and died three months after her execution. Background Thomas Bromley was born around 1530.

Legal education and academic career Both Thomas Bromley and his elder brother, George, were trained in law and called to the bar at the Inner Temple. By 1555, Thomas had gained some trust and prestige at his Inn of Court and was appointed as one of the auditors of the steward.Inderwick, p.182 In that year his namesake, the chief justice, died, bequeathing the young Thomas an allowance of 40 shillings a year for ten years, on condition he continue his legal studies.Bindoff: BROMLEY, Thomas I (by 1505-55), of Eyton-upon-Severn; Wroxeter and Shrewsbury, Salop and London - Author: N.

Fuidge This he clearly did, as he received the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law from Oxford University in 1560Foster He also rose at his Inn: by February 1563 he was a member of the parliament of the Inner Temple, like his brother George.Inderwick, p.224 In 1565 he was appointed attendant on the Reader for the first time,Inderwick, p.235 accompanying Richard Onslow, a contemporary from Shropshire who often officiated with him. Bromley is variously stated to have been Reader at the Inner temple in 1566 for Lent, and autumn although the Inn's records only mention his selection as attendant on the Lent Reader, Francis Gawdy.Inderwick, p.237 ODNB states that he served in the autumn and lectured on the Statutes of Attaints.Jones He is listed as a double reader, along with his brother George, in a state paper, probably from about 1579.Inderwick, p.472 In 1567 the parliament of the Inn had to rectify a number of anomalies relating to chambers held by Onslow, Bromley and Gawdy,Inderwick, p.243 making clear that Bromley had been admitting trainee lawyers of his own for some years, even before he became a bencher. On 25 October 1573 Bromley was chosen to be Lent Reader for the following year but the honour was deferred until 1575 because of the pressure of parliamentary business, with Edmund Anderson standing in for him.Inderwick, p.271 A week later Bromley was elected Treasurer of the Inner Temple, with power to choose his own assistants. He seems to have taken his post very seriously, and apparently found the Inn's finances in crisis. On 19 November a levy was imposed on all members clear immediate debts, graded according to status, with Bromley and his fellow-benchers paying 13s. 4d. While junior barristers paid 6s. 8d. It was not enough, and in January 1574 the parliament noted that :the House at this present is greatly indebted and far behindhand, by reason whereof it is the worse served both of bread, drink, meat, and divers other things, for that the creditors are not in any reasonable and convenient time paid such sums of money as are due unto them for their wares.Inderwick, p.274 A butler was deputed to persecute members for their outstanding fees, on pain of physical exclusion from the premises, and a few months later, pleading inflation of food prices, the members were made chargeable for their actual consumption. Bromley continued in office the following year, listed as appearing at the parliament as treasurer.Inderwick, p.278 Financial reform continued, with the cook made chargeable for future losses of pewter dishes ‚Äì a major expense in the past. Bromley's appointment for a third term was noted in November 1575.Inderwick, p.281 File:Wroxeter St Andrews - Effigy of Thomas Bromley.JPGEffigy of Thomas Bromley, the chief justice, who left a small but useful annuity to support young Bromley's studies.

File:Sir Nicholas Bacon.jpegSir Nicholas Bacon, long a friend and patron of Bromley and his predecessor as Lord Chancellor. Member of Parliament Bromley sat as a member of the Parliament of England three times, all fairly early in his career, before he achieved major promotion as a judge. In 1558 Bromley was MP for the Shropshire borough of Bridgnorth in the last parliament of Mary's reign. At this point he had not completed his education, although he was about 28 years old and a recognised lawyer. He probably owed his election mainly to family connections.Bindoff: BROMLEY, Thomas II (1530-87), of Hodnet, Salop - Author: Alan Harding His mother's family had numerous links in the Bridgnorth area. The High Sheriff of Shropshire had a considerable say in elections,Bindoff: Bridgnorth - Author: N.M. Fuidge and in that year was Richard Newport, son-in- law of the chief justice Thomas Bromley and another Inner Templar. The town's elector's, a council of 14 aldermen and bailiffs, had a predilection for lawyers. Their other choice was John Broke, a young Middle Templar and the son of the Shropshire jurist Robert Broke.Bindoff: BROKE, John II (1538-98), of the Middle Temple, London and Madeley, Salop - Author: Alan Harding However, the election seems to have been delayed, perhaps for want of nominations, until 18 January, only two days before the opening of parliament. In 1559 Bromley was returned to parliament by Wigan. This was dominated by the Duchy of Lancaster and the Earl of Derby.Hasler: Wigan ‚Äì Author: W.J.J. Although it is not known precisely how Bromley obtained the seat, the duchy too had a preference for lawyers. It generally secured the return of a member of the Gerard family, another gentry-lawyer dynasty, and Bromley's colleague on this occasion was William Gerard. It is much clearer how Bromley came to be MP for Guildford in the parliament which assembled in January 1563. The seat was in the gift of Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel,Hasler: Guildford ‚Äì Author: M.A.P. a Shropshire landowner and the high steward of the borough, who was a friend and patron of Bromley. Bromley was to serve as one of the executors of Arundel's will. In 1566, when he was appointed Recorder of London, he became an MP for the City ex officio, as the aldermen always chose the recorder and one of their own number as MPs.Hasler: London ‚Äì Author: M.R.P. Richard Onslow had been recorder since 1563, succeeding Ralph Cholmley, who had died in office. Thus Bromley was now put forward as MP by two constituencies. However, parliament resolved the contradiction by deciding he should continue to represent Guildford. The London aldermen were forced to hold a by-election and chose Sir John White, a successful merchant in the trade with Spain.Hasler: WHITE, Sir John (d.1573), of London and Aldershot, Hants. - Author: A. M. Mimardi√®re Bromley served in 1566 on a committee concerned with legal issues and another on the succession to the throne. Legal and judicial career =Legal practice= Through family influence as well as the patronage of Sir Nicholas Bacon, the lord keeper, he quickly made progress in his profession. Alongside public appointments, Bromley built up a substantial practice in both the Queen's Bench, the senior common law court, and Chancery, the principal court of equity. He was patronised and befriended by major political and judicial figures, like Arundel, Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, the queen's cousin, Sir William Cordell, the Master of the Rolls, Francis Drake and Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, and even the great Lord Burleigh himself. In 1560 Bromley counselled Catherine, dowager duchess of Suffolk and her husband Richard Bertie. They were prominent Marian exiles who had entrusted much of their property to a lawyer, Walter Herenden of Gray's Inn, with the unwritten proviso that he return it when the persecution was over. Herenden, however, refused, bringing about a cause c√©l√®bre which is still considered of importance in developing English trust law and the law concerning refugees' property.Prebble Bertie, acting also on behalf of his wife, sued Herenden for breach of trust. While common law viewed the estates as clearly transferred to Herenden in fee simple, Nicholas Bacon and the Court of Chancery decreed otherwise, cancelling the lease and ordering Herenden to hand over the property. However, Bertie still had to get an act passed by parliament in 1563 to get the lands actually restored to him and his wife. It was generally believed that Bromley only took on cases when he was personally convinced of their justice, and this may account for his remarkable record of never losing in five years.Foss, p.464 File:William Cordell.jpgSir William Cordell File:Steven van Herwijck Henry Carey 1st Baron Hunsdon.pngHenry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon File:2ndEarlOfBedford.jpgFrancis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford File:Catherine, Duchess of Suffolk by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpgCatherine, dowager Duchess of Suffolk File:1590 or later Marcus Gheeraerts, Sir Francis Drake Buckland Abbey, Devon.jpgSir Francis Drake File:William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley from NPG (2).jpgWilliam Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley =Recorder of London= In 1566 Bromley was appointed recorder of the City of London in succession to Richard Onslow, who had become Solicitor General. This was a post occupied for a considerable period of the Mid-Tudor period by Shropshire lawyers: Robert Broke had held it for nine years.Bindoff: BROKE,Robert (by 1515-58), of London - Author: Helen Miller Broke and Onslow, like other London recorders, had represented the City as MPs, but Parliament ordered Bromley to continue as MP for Guilford, as noted above. =Solicitor General= On 14 March 1569 Bromley was appointed Solicitor General, again succeeding Onslow. The following year he was sent north to take part in the trials following the Revolt of the Northern Earls, which had been suppressed largely through the efforts of Hunsdon. He was greatly embarrassed by an accusation that he had helped Richard Dacres, an attainted rebel who was a distant relative. Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Bromley played an important part in his trial. However, Bromley played a notable part in 1571 trial of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, suspected of collusion with the Northern Earls and of involvement in the Ridolfi plot. Bromley spoke after Nicholas Barham, the Queen's Serjeant, who led the prosecution, and Gilbert Gerard, the Attorney General. He was apparently very zealous to secure a conviction.Campbell, p.239 After evidence had been given about the proposed marriage between Norfolk and Mary, Queen of Scots, Bromley's focus was on the communications between Ridolfi and Norfolk. His only evidence of Norfolk's involvement in a plot to invade England and remove the queen was an alleged deciphered copy of a letter given to one Barker to deliver to the Duke.Campbell, p.240 As Norfolk himself argued, there was no evidence that he had ever received the letter, much less that he approved its contents. Bromley was forced to resort to hearsay evidence: that a foreign ambassador in Flanders had heard about the plot and one of his servants had mentioned it to an unnamed English government minister. None of the links in this chain of intelligence gathering was available to give evidence or face questioning but Bromley's allegations were accepted as having explicit royal warrant.Campbell, p.241 The following year Bromley was one of those sent to Sheffield to lay charges before Mary, Queen of Scots, with the aim of getting her to renounce her claim on both the English and Scottish thrones and to transfer her rights to her son, James.Hamilton Bromley rehearsed the history of the recent plots and her alleged part in them, but to no avail.Campbell, p.242 In 1574 he was one of the arbitrators appointed to resolve a dispute between the city of Oxford and the university. On 26 April 1579 Bromley was appointed Lord Chancellor, although he had been made a Privy Counsellor as early as 11 March. Lord Chancellor =Appointment= Effigies of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and his wife, Lettice Knollys on their tomb in Warwick. Dudley was the main sponsor of Bromley's candidature for the post of Lord Chancellor. Sir Christopher Hatton, Bromley's sponsor for the Chancellorship and his successor in the post. Effigy of Sir Gilbert Gerard on his tomb at Ashley, Staffordshire. He was Bromley's senior and main rival for the Chancellorship. Bromley succeeded Sir Nicholas Bacon, who had died on 20 February 1579.Campell, p.237 Bacon had been Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and, on investiture, had been given all the powers of a Lord Chancellor,Campell, p.214 but never the office itself, probably because of his relatively humble origins. The queen had sent Burleigh and the Earl of Leicester, the main rivals for her attention, to York House, the Lord Keeper's residence, to collect the Great Seal of the Realm from Lady Bacon. The queen then took the seal into her own custody and gave it to Burleigh or Leicester alternately, with Walsingham substituted when Leicester was away. The reason for the delay was probably the internal debate and manoeuvring over the succession. Gilbert Gerard had been made Attorney General in 1559, immediately after the queen's coronation, and there is a tradition that he had been her lawyer during the reign of Mary.Foss, p.492 He was senior to Bromley in every way: a distinguished and highly respected lawyer of great experience. However, Campbell states that he was ‚Äúawkward and ungainly in his speech and manner, and not considered fit for such a place of representation and dignity.‚ÄùCampbell, p.238 Although very reliable, Gerard was known to be on good terms with recusants in his native Lancashire and his wife and daughters were Catholics.Hasler: GERARD, Sir Gilbert (d.1593), of Ince, Lancs. and Gerrard's Bromley, Staffs. - Author: W.J.J. Bromley seems to have been entirely untroubled by ideological and theological concerns and was certainly happy to ally himself with the more radically Protestant grouping around Leicester. He also had the support of the Inner Templar Christopher Hatton, a chronically indebted courtier,HATTON, Christopher I (c.1540-91), of Holdenby and Kirby Hall, Northants. - Author: P.W. Hasler who had the ear of the queen. Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador reported home that Leicester and Hatton had recommended Bromley, hoping to use him as a supporter of the proposed marriage of the queen to Francis, Duke of Anjou, who was sympathetic to the Huguenot cause. The alliance was evidently cemented with money, as Bromley had promised a pension to Leicester and Hatton. Bromley was duly appointed both Keeper of the Great Seal and Lord Chancellor, over the head of Gerard, who was compensated two years later with the post of Master of the Rolls. Bromley was knighted in May 1579. =Important cases= In 1581 Bromley played an important part in securing a judgment in Shelley's Case, which was for centuries a leading case in property law, although now superseded by legislation. Although the judgment was generally accepted, along with Bromley's part in it, the immediate motivation for it was political. The roots of the case went back more than 30 years: Sir William Shelley, the purchaser of the estates at issue had died in 1549. The queen instructed Bromley to assemble the judges to make a definite ruling. The defendant, Henry Shelley, who was successful, was a committed Protestant: the lessor of the plaintiff, Richard Shelly had been imprisoned as a Catholic the previous year. The 1582 case of Thomas Knyvett is generally cited as an example of Bromley's independence of judgment in many cases. Knyvett was a confidant of the queen who had been a gentleman of the Privy Chamber for at least ten yearsKNYVET, Thomas I (c.1545-1622), of Westminster, Mdx. and Escrick, Yorks. - Authors: A. M. Mimardi√®re / E.L.C.M. When he murdered a retainer of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the inquiry jury found that he had acted in self-defence and applied to Bromley for a special commission to clear him in privy session. Hatton also pressured Bromley to ‚Äúplease the Queen in this case.‚Äù However, Bromley refused to oblige, pointing out that Knyvett might still be open to an appeal of felony. He held his position, despite the queen's displeasure, later justifying himself in writing.Foss, p.465 =Political and constitutional issues= Francis, Duke of Anjou, the principal French suitor of Elizabeth I. Bromley and the Leicester faction at first supported him as tolerant of Huguenots and later opposed him as a potential Catholic king of England. Bromley was called upon to settle a number of important parliamentary matters. In 1581, Richard Broughton, one of the members for Stafford, informed Parliament that his colleague, probably Thomas Purslow,Hasler: PURSLOW, Thomas (d.1618), of Hogstowe, Salop. - Author: J.J.C. had been indicted for a felony. Bromley wrote to the Commons, claiming that he had been pressured to issue a writ for a by-election. This he refused to do unless and until the member was convicted ‚Äì a decision that was welcomed by the Commons. On 16 January the following year, representatives of the Commons approached Bromley for advice because the Speaker, Robert Bell had died in office.Campell, p.245 Bromley Informed the House of Lords and it was decided to send a deputation from the two Houses to see the queen. Bromley was then instructed to tell the Commons to elect a new Speaker for themselves, with the admonition that they were not to ‚Äúintermeddle with any matter touching her Majesty's person or estate, or Church government.‚Äù They elected Sir John Popham, but did not entirely heed Bromley's warning. In his closing speech Bromley excluded from the queen's thanks those MPs who ‚Äúhad dealt more rashly in some things than was fit for them to do so.‚Äù In 1582 the queen consulted Bromley about her proposed marriage to the Duke of Anjou, which he and the Leicester faction now opposed. Bromley stressed that Parliament would expect the queen to settle the succession question if she married a Catholic, which she was reluctant to do. =Honour and profit= Bromley had reached the peak of his power and influence and reaped both prestige and wealth, not all of it from judicial sources. In 1580 he was licensed to import 200 packs of wool annually from Ireland, an opportunity that reinforced his natural inclination to side with the Shropshire towns against the monopolistic claims of Chester. The following year, Drake made him a present of captured Spanish gold plate on his return from circumnavigating the earth. In 1582 he was able to use his influence with the queen to thwart attempts to shift production of cloth from Welsh wool back into Wales and to move the staple to Chester, winning the approbation of the merchants and municipalities of Shrewsbury and Oswestry, who had most to lose from the proposed changes. Shrewsbury's council voted 20 marks for a piece of plate in gratitude for his political support. In 1585 he obtained the right to grant licences for alnage, or supervision of the quality of woollen cloth ‚Äì a position of mutual advantage for himself and his regional allies. A major academic honour accorded to Bromley in 1585 was appointment as deputy chancellor of Oxford University, in succession to the Earl of Leicester, who was embarking on his expedition to the Netherlands. Royal grants and purchases allowed Bromley to build up a significant property portfolio across his native Shropshire and the neighbouring counties of Worcestershire and Montgomeryshire. According to a history of the town, Elizabeth I granted the Manor of Great Malvern in Malvern, Worcestershire, to Sir Thomas, and it remained in the possession of his family through several generations, until sold by Lord Mountfort in about 1740.Chambers, p.12 However, the Victoria County History asserts that his was a former monastic property, originally belonging to Great Malvern Priory, that the reversion had been held by John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley and the transfer was to the Lord Chancellor's son, Sir Henry Bromley, although the date is given as 1586, within Thomas's lifetime. Though the details are hazy, it seems that the manor was intended by the queen as a reward for Thomas Bromley's loyal and competent service. The manor of Wick Episcopi, formerly an estate of the Bishop of Worcester, as the name suggests, certainly was granted to Thomas Bromley by the queen in 1586 and subsequently had a similar history. Holt, in the Malvern Hills, had a chequered history and the estate was divided. Bromley acquired part of it as a marriage settlement from Thomas Fortescue, his wife's brother,Rex and part by direct purchase from Anthony Bourne, the son of John Bourne. A landowner in considerable hardship because of his violence, marital escapades and political unreliability,Emerson: Elizabeth Horne Bourne was compelled to sell several properties to Bromley. Sir Henry Bromley, the Lord Chancellor's son, completed the acquisition of Holt and it became the family seat. =Conspiracies= Mary, Queen of Scots, portrayed in 1578 by Nicholas Hilliard. In the 1580s came another spate of plots against the regime, centred on Mary, Queen of Scots. Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland was arrested in the aftermath of the Throckmorton Plot of 1583 on suspicion of complicity but later released. After contacting the French ambassador, he was rearrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was found dead in his cell on 21 June 1585. Three days later a commission of inquiry in the form of a meeting of peers in the Star Chamber. Bromley announced that Northumberland had committed suicide after participating in a conspiracy, although suspicions remained that he had been murdered. On 23 November 1585 Parliament was convened specifically to confront the issue of the Scottish queen.Campbell, p.246 There were legal difficulties inherent in trying Mary before the House of Lords, as she was not an English peeress, and an ordinary criminal trial would lead to political difficulties abroad. Bromley announced at the opening a bill to provide for the trial of Mary, using a special court of at least 24 peers and privy counsellors. This soon passed into law. In September 1586 Bromley was actively involved in the examination and trial of Anthony Babington and his associates,Campbell, p.247 whose conspiracy had aimed to assassinate Elizabeth and to enthrone Mary, with her knowledge. The following month, after the execution of the plotters, Bromley moved to convene a court to try Mary herself. Trial of Mary, Queen of Scots Contemporary drawing of the trial. Queen Elizabeth was represented by an empty throne. As Lord Chancellor, it was Bromley who presided over the court which tried Mary, Queen of Scots. It consisted of 36 of the 45 privy counsellors, judges and peers, who had been appointed to the commission and assembled on 11 November 1586 at Fotheringhay Castle, where Mary was imprisoned. She was brought before the court on 14 October but protested immunity from a foreign jurisdiction. Bromley read a passage from a letter of the queen,Campbell, p.248 stating baldly that ‚Äúas she lived under the protection of the Queen of England, she was bound to respect the law of England. Bromley maintained personal respect towards Mary throughout the trial but continued to insist that ‚Äúneither her imprisonment nor her prerogative of Royal Majesty could exempt her from answering in this kingdom.‚Äù The prosecution was led by Francis Gawdy,Campbell, p.250 Bromley's old associate from the Inner Temple and now Queen's Serjeant. Mary did not openly contest her knowledge of Babington's plot to set her free and even admitted countenancing a French invasion. However, she flatly denied any involvement in the plan to assassinate Elizabeth. After two days, the trial was adjourned to 25 October at the Star Chamber, where the guilty verdicts were delivered.Campbell, p.251 It was then Bromley's task to announce at the opening of Parliament :That the present parliament was summoned for no usual causes; not for making new laws, whereof her Majesty thought there were more made than executed; nor for subsidies with which, although there was some occasion for them, her Majesty would not burden her faithful subjects at this time, but the cause was rare and extraordinary; of great weight, great peril, and dangerous consequence. He next declared what plots had been contrived of late, and how miraculously the merciful providence of God, by the discovery thereof, beyond all human policy, had preserved her Majesty, the destruction of whose sacred person was most traitorously imagined, and designed to be compassed. He then outlined the case to the House of Lords and both houses resolved to petition the queen for immediate execution.Campbell, p.252 The address was delivered by Bromley and Elizabeth assented, although she did not actually sign the death warrant until 1 February 1587,Campbell, p.253 after much hesitation. Bromley appended the Great Seal and the warrant was entrusted to William Davison. Even then it took a small secret Privy Council meeting under Burleigh to make the decision for action and Davison was held responsible by the queen. Death Mary, queen of Scots, was executed at Fotheringhay on 7 February 1587. When Parliament assembled eight days later, Bromley was too ill to attend and his place was taken by Edmund Anderson. He died on 12 April at the age of 57 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 2 May. Bromley's demise is often attributed to strain of the trial and the responsibility of ordering the execution of a monarch, and to his apprehension at Elizabeth's response to the execution. However, this corresponds to no specific illness, but it is a recurring motif found in accounts of other 16th- century judges, like Richard Morgan.Bindoff: MORGAN, Richard (by 1510-56), of Skenfrith, Mon. and London. - Author: P. S. Edwards Foss gave no explanation of Bromley's death and more recent sources do not speculate. He was not a young man by the standards of the time: his namesake and cousin, the chief justice, died probably at a slightly earlier age. Family Bromley's married, by 1560 at latest, Elizabeth Fortescue, daughter of Sir Adrian Fortescue, a Hertfordshire landowner. Sir Adrian was executed on 9 July 1539 under an act of attainder that was mainly directed at the Pole family, including the Countess of Salisbury. However Fortescue's offence was unspecified, the clause relating to him mentioning ‚Äúdiverse and sundrie detestable and abhomynable treasons.‚ÄùFortescue: Adrian Fortescue In the 17th century Sir Adrian was to be venerated as a Catholic martyr and he was beatified in 1895. However, the real reasons for his execution remain mysterious and it is not at all clear that he was a religious conservative: in fact, his earlier period in favour had been because of his kinship to Anne Boleyn but he seems to have been on poor terms with Thomas Cromwell. So he may have been attached to the attainder as an act of political or personal spite among Protestants. Elizabeth Fortescue was one of the offspring of Sir Adrian's second marriage, to Anne Rede. One of her brothers was John Fortescue of Salden, who had been in Princess Elizabeth's service during the reign of her Catholic sister, Mary I, and proved a pillar of the Elizabethan regime and a persistent parliamentarian, later becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer.Hasler: FORTESCUE, John I (1533-1607), of Holborn, London; Welford, Berks. and Salden, Bucks. - Authors: Alan Harding / M.A.P. Her brother Anthony Fortescue, on the other hand, actually was a Catholic conspirator, closely involved with the Pole family.Fortescue: Anthony Fortescue Another brother, Thomas, seems to have negotiated Elizabeth's marriage with Bromley, purchasing part of the manor of Holt from Anthony Bourne to settle on her in 1578.

The Russian Orthodox Church considers him a saint (along with his most notable opponent, Nilus of Sora); his memory is celebrated on 9 September and 18 October (dates in the Julian Calendar). Background Joseph Volotsky came from a family of a wealthy landowner (a votchinnik) whose property consisted of the Yazvishche village in the Principaity of Volokolamsk, Moscow Oblast. He learned to read and write at the local monastery and then took the tonsure at the Borovsk Monastery in 1459. Upon the death of its abbot, St. Paphnutius of Borovsk, Joseph Volotsky took his place and attempted to introduce a strict monastic charter.David M. Goldfrank, \\"Old and New Perspectives on Iosif Volotsky's Monastic Rules,\\" Slavic Review, Vol. 34, No. 2 (Jun., 1975), pp. 279-301. The monks, however, rebuffed his idea, and he had to leave the monastery for good. After having lived in a few other monasteries, Joseph became disappointed with their lax morals and founded his own cloister in 1479 near Volokolamsk, which would become known as the Joseph- Volokolamsk Monastery. Joseph's charter prescribed a monk's chief virtue as absolute obedience to his abbot. All aspects of a monk's life at the monastery were regulated and controlled. Initially, Joseph Volotsky was connected with the appanage princes of Volokolamsk (brothers of Ivan III) and defended the right of local ecclesiastical and secular feudatories to oppose the authority of the grand prince. Later in his life he severed his relations with the opposition and took the side of the grand prince, sealing this alliance by transferring Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery to the patronage of Vasili III in 1507. Struggle against the non-possessors During the Church Sobor of 1503, Joseph Volotsky and his supporters (Josephites) managed to scrap the project of elimination of monastic landownership, proposed by the nestiazhateli, or non-possessors (those who opposed monastic landownership), in the persons of the so-called Transvolgan elders led by Nilus of Sora and Vassian Patrikeyev. Joseph Volotsky addressed a number of epistles to the nestiazhateli, in which he tried to prove the legality of monastic landownership and to justify the rich d√©cor of churches. Eventually, Joseph Volotsky gained the upper hand and the monasteries preserved their landholdings. Ideas on the authority of the tsar The triumph of the possessor party went hand in hand with Joseph's efforts to bolster the position of Russia's grand princes, who were now increasingly referred to as tsars, succeeding to the title of universal emperors of Byzantium. Joseph Volotsky restated the formula of an early Byzantine ecclesiastical writer Agapetus that the tsar was a \\"man in essence, but his power is that of God\\" and that he was God's deputy on Earth. According to Joseph, however, since the main duty of the tsar is to care for the well- being of the Christian Church, he is legitimate only as long as he adheres to Church rules and moral obligations. Struggle against heresies Writing by Joseph Volotsky Joseph Volotsky is also known to have been a staunch opponent of the heretical sect which was spreading in Russia at that time (\\"Judaizers\\"). During the Church Sobor of 1504, he demanded that all heretics be executed by the state. In his major work, called The Enlightener (–ü—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å), which consisted of 16 chapters, he tried to prove the wrongfulness of the \\"new teaching\\" in order to be able to prosecute the heretics and convince people not to believe in the sincerity of their repentance. Taking inspiration from the Roman-Byzantine treatment of heresiarchs and the Dominican-led persecutions in Spain and Portugal, he called for a civil inquisition against heretics and championed their imprisonment and execution. As with the controversy over monastic ownership of estates, Joseph Volotsky was opposed in this matter by Saint Nilus of Sora.

Anders Mygind Christensen (Keeper) Episode guide =Season one= Episode 1 One ball, 16 cones. - 16 nerds, who had never touched a football, top-train for three months, after the completion of which they will play against FCK, one of the top soccer teams in Denmark, in Parken, the national stadium. In the lead as coach is the former national team player and goal-king Mark Strudal. FC Zulu consists of a pack of logical thinking computer nerds, role players and a single politician. When the players meet their coach Mark Strudal for the first time, they realized that what they had signed up for was no picnic. First challenge: a training match against a teenage girl team from Skovlunde. Result: a shocked Mark Strudal. Episode 2 Strudal is tired of the nerds' intellectual debating society on the pitch. They must learn to act as a team. To that end, he sends them on a teambuilding trip to Lejre. Strudal also has a hidden agenda - he wants to find the team's captain on the trip. Dressed in Viking clothes and small leather moccasins, FC ZULU would, during the course of two days, become a close-knit unit. The solidarity is on trial for real, when one of the players is kidnapped by five hostile riders and hung out over \\"The Victin Bog\\". Episode 3 The boys are gradually well started with the training, but they should also learn to sell themselves as a real football team. They should therefore definitely have a battle song √† la \\"Re- Sepp-Ten\\". With Signe Svendsen as FC Zulu's own \\"Dodo\\" go the team in the studio, but there is a surprise for the boys - they should not only use their rusty song voices, but their condition will also be tested, when it come to realize for them, that a real music video (of course) also has both fancy dancing scenes and hot girls. Episode 4 One ball, 16 cones. - 16 nerds, who never had touched a football, should top-train in three months, whereupon they will play against FCK i PARKEN - a scenario, which all the players fears. To learn them to watch the fear in the eyes, sends Mark Strudal his team into Vridsl√∏selille State Prison to play against the prisoners. The prisoners' team consists of murder- and narco- prisoners, so the panic in FC Zulu spreads, when the players see their opponents for the first time. Can referee Kim Milton control the prisoners? Episode 5 The players don't have much wildness, e.g. excuse they still graciously, if they are running into each other on the pitch by accident. A desperate coach Strudal sends the nerds on re-education at the male therapist Carl-Mar M√∏ller. A decision, which makes the intellectual Zulu-nerds so angry, that they in secret plans a surprise, which makes even Carl-Mar gape. Episode 6 Nerds are often superintelligent - but are more interested in computers than the latest trends. It must be different, if the players should charm the female fans in Parken. Strudal sends the players to make-over at Zulu's \\"Modepatrulje\\" (Danish: Fashion Patrol), who gives the players a \\"lovely\\" treatment. There is a big surprise for the nerds' families, when they later appear with the right Beckham-look on the red runner in Imperial Cinema. Episode 7 So are we there soon - the nerds from FC Zulu should very soon play the big match in Parken against the FCK-lions. Even though Strudal has used all strengths into the training, the players are still a bit doubtful on the pitch. Strudal has therefore asked two earlier, known Br√∏ndby-players to help, to give FC Zulu tips about how to beat FCK. The boys should moreover play faith match against the girl junior team, they met on their very first day as FC Zulu-players. The players are keen to beat the girls and they give all, they got inside. Episode 8 So is it the big day, where the form for real should be tested, and Mark Strudal should find out if all the hard training have borne fruit: Today should FC Zulu meet the FCK-lions in Parken in front of thousands of spectators. The players are being accommodated on a hotel, just like real footballers, and we follow their preparations and anger attacks from early morning to when they are on the pitch in front of the lions. Will their exertions bear fruit? Can FC Zulu beat FCK on their home ground in Parken? FC Zulu vs. FCK All-stars FC Zulu 1-6 FCK All-stars =Season two= Episode 1 In FC Zulu's first season as a football team, they have been permitted to go through things - they never had dreamed about. Now meets Mark Strudal again his FC Zulu team after the winter break. And he is shocked. The nerds are again totally out of shape - and they have additionally got a lot of star crotches, because they now are famous. But Strudal has a cunning plan, as the nerds not had expected. Episode 2 The nerds on the country. How will the old players receive the four new heavyrock-interested players? The team's coach Mark Strudal means, that his team should get together before they for real start a new, hard season. FC Zulu taker therefore so far out on the country, as you almost can come, namely to G√•ser in Northern Jutland, where the farmer Mogens Mortensen knows, how you makes the right team spirit: All it needs is just a little bit of horses, pigs, cows and sheep. Episode 3 It is totally wrong with the condition, the dripples and the ball feeling at the FC Zulu-players. What will happen when the nerds, there badly can dribble, should play in front of filled stands in the decisive match against the Swedish nerd-team? When it is the nation's honour, there are risked, plans Mark Strudal a daring plan: Ball jugglers and circus artist should teach FC Zulu body- and ball control. And where is the press more merciless than in Circus Benneweis' ring? Episode 4 The nerds' discipline to the football training is bad. Very bad. And Mark Strudal is so frustrated over their lax pose, that he sends them on \\"re-education\\" in the Life Guards. But none of the nerds likes that-is-just-how-it-is-education - and in short time succeed it the 16 football cones, to get the sergeants on H√∏velte barracks go crazy. Episode 5 The rumours say that the Swedish nerds, as FC Zulu should play national game against, is some big guys, there are ready to smash FC Zulu. Mark Strudal let the earlier American football player and coach Claus Elming have his team, who promises, that he will give FC Zulu a hardness, brutality and cynicism, as they never will forget. Later should FC Zulu play match against some terrifying rocks. Episode 6 The important national game against the Swedes is just around the corner. Therefore, Mark Strudal decides that the boys should be toptuned on a training stay in foreign countries. But the nerds is more minded on relaxing and holiday than training. For the first time i the progress loses Mark Strudal courage - and with that is FC Zulu on way to the precipice. Strudal has namely planned, that FC Zulu should play their first international match.

It is the tallest building in Winnipeg and in the province of Manitoba.  History  Announced as TD Centre in November 1987, the 33-storey building was constructed between 1988 and 1990 by the Toronto Dominion Bank for $38,000,000. The construction of 201 Portage required the demolition of the Childs Building (also known as the McArthur Building) at 211 Portage. When the Childs Building was constructed in 1909, it was the tallest building in Winnipeg. The Childs Building had been 12 storeys above ground, and tall. A smaller twin building was planned but never built. Originally built by the Toronto Dominion Bank, the skyscraper was acquired by Canwest to serve as the company's main corporate headquarters. Global Winnipeg (CKND-DT) moved its operations to 201 Portage on September 1, 2008. Having declared bankruptcy and sold its media properties, Canwest has vacated the premises; its main successor Shaw Media retained only the lease for the 30th floor, where the Global Winnipeg studios were located before their move to a building near CF Polo Park owned by the same company that manages the shopping centre property. On 11 January 2011, the Canwest sign and logo were removed. The penthouse stayed vacant after Canwest's departure in November 2010, until late 2012 when RBC-Dominion Securities relocated to it from the Richardson Building. Currently, the building is branded as \\"201 Portage\\". The building was managed by Creswin Properties, a real-estate company privately owned by the Asper family that owned Canwest, until early 2014. The building was acquired under new ownership in May 2014 and is owned by Portage & Main Development Ltd., a private corporation whose shareholders include 201 Portage Equities Inc. and Harvard Developments Inc.  Description  The 33-storey, building stands tall, making it the tallest building in Winnipeg. It is taller than the next tallest building in Winnipeg, the Richardson Building, which is located across the street. It is the tallest building between Hamilton and Calgary, and has been since its construction. 201 Portage is connected to Winnipeg Square and the Winnipeg Walkway system via an underground concourse. The building is certified as BOMA BEST level 3.

It was originally named the Manitoba Parliament Building, not Legislative. The neoclassical building was completed in 1920 and stands 77 metres tall (253 ft). It was designed and built by Frank Worthington Simon (1862‚Äì1933)\\"\\"Frank Lewis Worthington Simon\\" \\", at Dictionary of Scottish Architects. and Henry Boddington III, along with other masons and many skilled craftsmen. The building is famous for the Golden Boy, a gold covered bronze statue based on the style of the Roman god Mercury, or the Greek god Hermes, at the top of the cupola.  History and construction  Manitoba Legislative Building In 1911, the Manitoba government announced an architectural competition to all architects in the British Empire. A grand prize of $10,000 was offered for the best design for the new Manitoba Legislative Building. It is the third building used by Manitoba's legislative assembly, the first being the home of A.G.B. Bannatyne, while the second stood on the same grounds as the current Legislative building. Of the 67 submissions, Frank Worthington Simon, a former student at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, had his design chosen for the construction of the impressive structure. Construction began in 1913, with Tyndall stone, quarried at Garson, about 20 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. On June 3, 1914 the north-east cornerstone ceremony, which was commonly done by masons, was laid by Thomas Kelly, the contractor. Kelly stole many of the materials to build his own house three blocks away, so the construction of the massive building was slowed and was not ready for partial occupancy until 1919. On July 15, 1920, the province's 50th anniversary date, opening ceremonies were performed by Sir James Aikins, then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba. The base of the building forms the letter H. The total square footage of the building is , with a total height of above ground level topped with a bronze statue, gilded with 23.75 k gold leaf, of the Greek God Hermes or the Roman God Mercury. The Legislative grounds cover of landscaped grounds. Throughout the exterior and interior of the building are examples of Fibonacci Sequence, Golden Ratio and Sacred Geometry.  Exterior  Manitoba Legislative building On the north side of the Legislative Building, above the 6 main columns, is the main pediment.\\"The Exterior\\", at the Legislative Tour, Province of Manitoba. In the bottom-left corner of the pediment is the Indolent Man, with a half-kneeling woman, the spirit of progress, beckoning the Indolent Man into the new land of promise. Next is the goddess Europa leading a bull, symbolizing Canada's European heritage and immigration. To the right of Europa, a man, woman and child symbolizing the colonization of a new land. Seated in the centre is Lady Manitoba with the rays of the sun behind her. Lady Manitoba closely resembles the fertility goddesses Ishtar and Demeter, both patron deities of agriculture. To the west is Neptune's trident symbolizing the Pacific Ocean, to the east is a ship‚Äôs wheel symbolizing the Atlantic Ocean. Adjacent to Lady Manitoba are a man and a woman laden with wheat and fruit, products of the soil. Next is a muscular male figure with a team of powerful horses and a primitive plough tilling the soil. Finally in the bottom right corner are two entwined female figures representing the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. Above the main pediment, flanking both sides are two Egyptian sphinxes facing both east and west. Carved onto a flat piece of stone, just below the chin, in Egyptian hieroglyphics, is \\"The everlasting manifestation of the Sun God Ra, the good God who gives life.\\" On both the east and west porticos sit figures representing war and peace. On the east side, with engraved images of weapons of war, are two male figures, one a native warrior with an eagle head-dress, another a Roman soldier, and on the west side there are two female figures for peace. Each pair guards a chest, rumoured to represent the Ark of the Covenant because of the proper proportions as mentioned in the ancient Hebrew texts. On the grounds of the Legislative Building, facing the Assiniboine River, there is the Louis-Riel sculpture by Miguel Joyal. It was erected in 1996 and commemorates M√©tis leader Louis Riel.  The Golden Boy  The Golden Boy, \\"Eternal Youth\\", or Mercury Each one of the four corners of the copper dome supporting the Golden Boy has a stonework grouping representing the four elements of alchemy, earth, air, fire and water. They are identified as Agriculture, Science, Industry and Art. The dome is above the main floor. The height of the central tower without the Golden Boy is . The statue was first installed in 1919, originally called Eternal Youth, and sculpted by Parisian artist Georges Gardet. The Golden Boy was last regilded and refurbished in 2002, and is illuminated by floodlights.  Grand Staircase  The Grand Staircase, North side The Grand Staircase, South side Within the main entrance is the Grand Staircase. This is a perfectly square room measuring on each side, which is meant to represent the numerological number 666, which are all the numbers added from one to 36, which is the square of 6, in mathematics, geometry, and arithmetic. The staircase is composed of three flights of steps each with 13 steps.\\"The Interior\\", at the Legislative Tour, Province of Manitoba. The steps are brown- veined Carrara marble, the finest marble in the world. Flanking the steps are life size North American bison. Made of solid bronze, they were modelled by Georges Gardet, creator of the Golden Boy,\\"Golden Boy \\", at the Legislative Tour, Province of Manitoba. and cast at the Roman Bronze Works in New York City. Each bison weighs 2,268 kilograms (2¬Ω tons). Legend has it that to install the bison safely without damaging the marble floors, the main entrance was flooded and left to freeze. Both bison were then placed on enormous slabs of ice cut from the Assiniboine River, and safely slid into the building. The bison are one example of apotropaic icons in the Grand Staircase. The bison, a symbol of the Province of Manitoba, are meant to represent the sacred bulls which guard temple entrances. Above the south entrance to the legislature lobby is the Medusa's head, and over the north entrance facing Medusa is the bust of Athena, Greek goddess of war, embodiment of democracy and also the protector of cities. Around the perimeter of the room are 14 lion heads and 8 cattle skulls at the edge of the ceiling. Around the second floor balcony, lamps rise from the balustrades, each containing 13 bulbs, 12 around 1 (Twelve Apostles and Jesus). The third floor facing the Grand Staircase is supported by two pairs of columns, reproductions of the caryatids, sculpted female figures serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar. Each figure holds a scroll and key. The figures located on the third floor were carved by the Piccirilli Brothers of New York, using models prepared by Albert Hodge of London, England. The ceiling is made of a glass atrium to allow natural sunlight to illuminate the room.  Rotunda  Rotunda, North side The antechamber at the head of the grand staircase provides a formal approach to the legislative chamber.\\"The Rotunda \\", at the Legislative Tour, Province of Manitoba. 8 Corinthian columns rise from the floor to the cornice surrounding the base of the dome. Between each pair of columns are busts of Hermes. The floor of the dome rotunda is Tennessee marble bordered with black Vermont and verde antique marble. The height to the eye of the dome is and the diameter is . Within the dome above are four panels containing 5 gold rosettes. Rotunda, South side In the centre of the Rotunda is an Italian marble balustrade across surrounding the Pool of the Black Star on the floor of the level below, a representation of the altars of the ancient Greeks. The diameter of the circle above the balustrade is also , and both align with the Golden Boy above these. Above the doorway to the Manitoba Assembly is a mural by Frank Brangwyn depicting World War I. In the centre of the painting is a man in tattered rags with his left chest and arm exposed, being helped along by a comrade. Above the men are a faint depiction of The Madonna and child.  Pool of the Black Star  Pool of the Black Star The Pool of the Black Star is the room below the Rotunda with four entrances and marked by 3 steps forming a circumference of the room. The room is circular with a radius of . At the centre of the floor is an 8-pointed black marble star. Directly above in alignment with the Pool of the Black Star is the dome of the building, on which the Golden Boy is mounted. The design of the building allows sounds from all over the building to be caught and heard in the circular room, and echoes can be heard by speaking in the room.  Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room  In the east corridor of the Manitoba Legislative Building is the Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room. This finely decorated room is used by the Lieutenant-Governor on state occasions to receive visiting royalty and foreign dignitaries and general public is barred from entry. During such events, scarlet-coated Royal Canadian Mounted Police are posted on either side of the door and military aides assist the Lieutenant-Governor with official duties. The room is panelled in black American walnut inlaid with ebony, and decorated with hand-carved ornaments around the ceiling and along the four corner pillars. Pictures of sovereigns grace the walls and a French gilt chandelier hangs from the ceiling. The floor features a carpet specially hand-woven in Donegal, Ireland. Facing across from each other on the north and south wall are two elaborate mirrors in gilt frames. The room measures in both directions. Directly above the Lieutenant- Governor's Reception Room are the two male warriors (War), one native in full eagle feathered head dress, and one Roman, guarding the representation of the Ark of the Covenant.  Legislative Chamber  The Legislative Chamber The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Lieutenant Governor form the Legislature of Manitoba, the legislative branch of government in the Canadian Province of Manitoba. Fifty-seven members are elected to this assembly in provincial general elections, all in single-member constituencies with first- past-the-post voting.\\"The Legislative Chamber\\", at the Legislative Tour, Province of Manitoba. Originally, in 1870, there were 24 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). As the province grew in population and size, more electoral divisions were added. Winnipeg was once the third largest city in Canada, and often called Chicago of the North. Manitoba's Legislative chamber is unique among Provincial Legislatures in that the Members' benches are grouped in a horseshoe shape. The Speaker of the House's chair is located on the south wall below the press gallery of 13 seats. All debate is addressed to the Speaker, who rules on points of order and procedure and has the responsibility of maintaining order and decorum. When the Legislature is in session, each day begins in accordance with procedures that have origins in the early beginnings of Parliamentary rule. The speaker enters the Legislative Chamber followed by the clerks of the Legislative Assembly and preceded by the Sergeant-at-arms bearing Manitoba's Mace. The original desks and chairs of the Chamber are fashioned of walnut with inlaid ebony. They are arranged in three tiers rising from a sunken floor in the centre of the Chamber. Each desk is equipped with a microphone connected to a public address system and a recording machine used in the publication of Hansard, a verbatim report of debates and proceedings in the Legislature. During question period, translators provide simultaneous translation from French to English. The Chamber is also equipped for video and internet broadcasts of question period and special events such as throne and budget speeches. Yet even as such changes have brought the assembly into the future, the original inkwells employed by an earlier generation of Manitoban politicians are still visible. To the right of the speaker is a statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, to the left is Solon, a famous lawmaker of ancient Athens. Each statue is made of bronze and sculpted by Gardet.  Today  The cost of reconstruction today would be prohibitive, due to such factors as a shortage of skilled masons. In 2014, the local government stressed about the state of deterioration of the building to the level of life safety concerns. Tree roots, insects and bird feces are identified as the main threats to the building's longevity. In March 2015, a military hall of honour opened in the Manitoba Legislative Building commemorating the Manitoba's regiments who fought World War I. In May 2017, Rick Hansen (CEO of the Rick Hansen Institute) criticized the accessibility of the building after Independent MA Steven Fletcher gave him an official tour.  Bibliography  * . * .

In species with well-known lineages (such as domesticated crops), f can be calculated by examining detailed pedigree records. Modernly, f can be estimated using genetic marker data.  Evolution of inbreeding coefficient in finite size populations  In a finite size population, after some generations, all individuals will have a common ancestor : f \\\\rightarrow 1 . Consider a non-sexual population of fixed size N, and call f_i the inbreeding coefficient of generation i.

At each generation, each individual produces a large number k \\\\gg 1 of descendants, from the pool of which N individual will be chosen at random to form the new generation. At generation n, the probability that two individuals have a common ancestor is \\"they have a common parent\\" OR \\"they descend from two distinct individuals which have a common ancestor\\" : :f_n = \\\\frac{k-1}{kN} + \\\\frac{k(N-1)}{kN}f_{n-1} What is the source of the above formula? Is it in a later paper than the 1948 Reference. : \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{N}+ (1-\\\\frac{1}{N})f_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation easily solved. Considering the worst case where at generation zero, no two individuals have a common ancestor, :f_0=0, we get :f_n = 1 - (1- \\\\frac{1}{N})^n. The scale of the fixation time (average number of generation it takes to homogenize the population) is therefore : \\\\bar{n}= -1/\\\\log(1-1/N) \\\\approx N. This computation trivially extends to the inbreeding coefficients of alleles in a sexual population by changing N to 2N (the number of gametes).

Lynn. Barry W. Lynn (born 1948) was the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State from 1992 to November 2017. He is an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ and a prominent leader of the religious left in the United States. Lynn was formerly a member of the District of Columbia Bar Association. He is known to be a strong advocate of separation of church and state. Early life Barry Lynn was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but his family moved to nearby Bethlehem when he was a child. He attended Bethlehem's Liberty High School, graduating in 1966.Barry Lynn - baltimoresun.com Lynn received his B.A. in 1970 from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and his theology degree from Boston University School of Theology in 1973. After attending law school at night, he received his J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center. Career After law school, Lynn continued to work with the United Church of Christ to gain amnesty for young men who chose desertion to protest the Vietnam War. Before going to Americans United, Lynn held positions related to religious liberties. In the mid-to-late 1980s he was legislative counsel for Washington's ACLU office, where he frequently worked on church‚Äìstate issues. From 1974 to 1980, Lynn held positions within the national offices of the United Church of Christ, including two years for the Church's Office of Church in Society in Washington, D.C., as legislative counsel. Lynn has appeared frequently on radio broadcasts and television to debate and discuss First Amendment issues, including MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour, NBC's Today Show, Nightline, Fox Morning News (Washington, D.C.), CNN's Crossfire, Lou Dobbs Tonight, Anderson Cooper 360¬∞, The Phil Donahue Show, Meet the Press, CBS Morning News, ABC's Good Morning America, NBC Nightly News, ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News and Larry King Live. He was formerly a weekly commentator on church-state issues for UPI Radio, and served for two years as regular co-host of Buchanan and Company on the Mutual Broadcasting System. Lynn hosted the radio program Culture Shocks, until 2013, which could be heard on 1160 AM in Washington, D.C., and on several stations nationally. Lynn's first book, Piety & Politics: The Right-Wing Assault on Religious Freedom (), was published in October 2006. His second book, God and Government: Twenty-Five Years of Fighting for Equality, Secularism, and Freedom Of Conscience () was published in 2015. =Legal actions and positions= In 2006 Lynn argued that Focus on the Family‚Äôs efforts to bring up moral issues in the 2004 election represented ‚Äúa blatant effort by [James] Dobson to build a partisan political machine based in churches...[Dobson] has made it abundantly clear that electing Republicans is an integral part of his agenda and he doesn‚Äôt mind risking the tax-exemption of churches in the process‚Äù. A separate organization unrelated to Lynn's Americans United later filed a formal complaint with the IRS over Dobson's political endorsements.Focus on the Family refuses to make public its letter from IRS  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington Lynn did not support this complaint, and the IRS determined that since the endorsements were given by Dobson as a private individual, they did not violate federal tax law. Americans United filed suit against the InnerChange Freedom Initiative (IFI), a program of Prison Fellowship Ministries. IFI had contracted with the state of Iowa to provide in-prison rehabilitation programs. The suit alleged that the Iowa program violated the separation of church and state in the Constitution. Lynn asserted that the program was saturated with Christian fundamentalism and treated non-fundamentalist inmates like second-class citizens. Prison Fellowship Ministries responded with claims that the program was effective in reducing recidivism, citing two studies ‚Äî a 2002 one by the State of Texas and one done in 2003 by the University of Pennsylvania. These studies were contradicted by UCLA Professor Mark Kleiman's analysis, which found that Colson's 2003 figures were statistically invalid. Two federal courts agreed with Lynn that the program was unconstitutional. After a federal court struck down the program, Prison Fellowship appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The state of Iowa joined with IFI in appealing the decision. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals panel consisted of three judges: William Duane Benton, Roger Leland Wollman, and retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor sitting by special designation. On December 3, 2007 this panel unanimously affirmed the lower court decision, and the IFI program was removed from the Iowa prison. Lynn was very critical of the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment, which was supported by the Catholic Church, and which aims to restrict the federal funding of abortion in recent health care legislation.Unhealthy Trend: House Action On Abortion Showcases Power Of Bishops‚Äô Lobby Awards and honors *2013 Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship References External links *Barry W.

In Australia, the term beat is used to refer to an area frequented by gay men, where sexual acts occur. This use of the word parodies the beat walked by a police officer or a prostitute. Most commonly, public toilets, parks, and nightclubs are used as beats, though sometimes suburban car parks become beats after nightfall. Sex researchers have found that a considerable proportion of men who use \\"beats\\" are men who have sex with men (MSMs) rather than gay-identifying. This is possibly because, while gay men have a plethora of venues for meeting legitimately, MSMs ‚Äì who are often closeted ‚Äì do not risk being observed in (or reported as attending) gay venues. History Although little is known about beats in the early colonial and Federation periods, it is known that specific areas in larger cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane have recorded histories of use for this purpose through the 20th century to the present . Social and sexual behaviour in beats Presently, beats are known to be actively used by men who have sex with men (MSM). Due to the casual nature and anonymity of most of the encounters, beats have been identified as areas of high risk for the transmission of HIV, syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Law Engaging in sexual activity in a public place is against the law in all states and territories in Australia. Police have been criticised for excessive patrolling of known beats, and the defence of entrapment is commonly used by those caught when charged. People using beats are also more likely to be subject to homophobic hate crimes and other general crimes than gay men who don't use beats, prompting some to welcome the police presence . In Sydney and Melbourne at least, gay beats have attracted some attention from some sections of the media. This has led to a police presence at those identified. There is currently a NSW Parliamentary inquiry into hate crimes (public submissions closed 7 November 2018).

The Ngoni trace their origins to the Nguni and Zulu people of kwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The displacement of the Ngoni people in the great scattering following the Zulu wars had repercussions in social reorganization as far north as Malawi and Zambia. History Three Young Ngoni Chiefs, Malawi The rise of the Zulu nation to dominance in southern Africa in the early nineteenth century (~1815-~1840) disrupted many traditional alliances. Around 1817, the Mthethwa alliance, which included the Zulu clan, came into conflict with the Ndwandwe alliance, which included the Nguni people from the kwaZulu- Natal. One of the military commanders of the Ndwandwe army, Zwangendaba Gumbi (c1780-1848), was the head of the Jele or Gumbi clan, which itself formed part of the larger emaNcwangeni alliance in what is now north-east kwaZulu-Natal. In 1819, the Zulu army under Shaka defeated the Ndwandwe alliance at a battle on the Mhlathuze River, near Nkandla. The battle resulted in the diaspora of many indigenous groups in southern Africa. =The long migration north= In the following decades, Zwangendaba led a small group of his followers north through Mozambique and Zimbabwe to the region around the Viphya Plateau.\\"Among the Wild Ngoni\\" Page 18, 1899 In this region, present-day Zambia (Chipata district), Malawi (Mzimba, Ntcheu and Karonga district) and Tanzania (Matema district), he established a state, using Zulu warfare techniques to conquer and integrate local peoples. The date on which Zwengandaba's party crossed the River Zambezi, sometimes given in early writings as 1825, has been argued to have been on 20 November 1835.E.A. Lane Poole, \\"The Date of the Crossing of the Zambezi by the Ngoni\\" Journal of the African Society, 29, 1929-30, pp.290-2; also Marwick, M.G., (1963). \\"History and Tradition in East Central Africa Through the Eyes of the Northern Rhodesian Che≈µa\\", Journal of African History, 4, 3, p.385. Following Zwangendaba's death in 1848, succession disputes split the Ngoni people. Zwangendaba's following and the Maseko Ngoni eventually created seven substantial Ngoni kingdoms in Tanzania, Zambia and Malawi. While the Ngoni were primarily agriculturalists, cattle were their main goal for raiding expeditions and migrations northward. Their reputation as refugees escaping Shaka is easily overstated; it is thought that no more than 1,000 Ngoni crossed the Zambezi River in the 1830s. They raided north, taking women in marriage and men into their fighting regiments. Their prestige became so great that by 1921, in Nyasaland alone, 245,833 people claimed membership as Ngoni although few spoke the Zulu dialect called Ngoni. The Ngoni integrated conquered subjects into their warfare and organization, becoming more a ruling class than an ethnic group, and by 1906 few individuals were of pure Ngoni descent. It was only after Ngoni status began to decline that tribal consciousness of the component groups began to rise along with their reported numbers. In the early 1930s, the Ngonde, Nyasa, Tonga and other groups once again claimed their original tribal status. =Present= An Ngoni dancer from Tanzania While the Ngoni have generally retained a distinct identity in the post-colonial states in which they live, integration and acculturation has led to them adopting local languages; nowadays the Zulu language is used only for a few ritual praise poems and songs. The Ngoni people of Zambia Young Ngoni dancer in Zambia Mpezeni (also spelt Mpeseni) was the warrior-king of one of the largest Ngoni groups, based in what is now the Chipata District of Zambia, and was courted by the Portuguese and British. The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes sent agents to obtain a treaty--Alfred Sharpe in 1889, and Joseph Maloney in 1895, who were both unsuccessful. In 1897, with over 4,000 warriors, Mpezeni rose up against the British, who were taking control of Nyasaland and North-Eastern Rhodesia, and was defeated. Mpezeni signed the treaty which allowed him to rule as Paramount Chief of the Ngoni in Zambia's Eastern Province and Malawi's Mchinji district. His successors as chief take the title Paramount Chief Mpezeni to this day.T W Baxter: Angoni Rebellion and Mpeseni.\\" The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol I, No. 2, pp. 14-24 (1950). Website accessed 29 April 2007. An Ngoni dancer from Tanzania The cruelty and ruthlessness of Mpezeni's raids can be understood from this account written by a British hunter who came across a Chewa village a few hours after a raid in 1897: > On my arrival I found the male population all under arms, and the women > crying. A raiding party of Mpezeni‚Äôs people had attacked them suddenly that > morning. Ten women were killed in the gardens and twenty-two were taken away > as prisoners.

Nothing in the American musical theater has been more inaccessible, however, than the record of its dance traditions, and there are many to recount. For the most part, dance movement itself was either the last to be mentioned by critics or ignored altogether, resulting in dance numbers in musicals going unrecorded. The only way to preserve dance movements from generation to generation was by demonstration, imitation, practice, and personal supervision. Not until 1960, with the musical Bye Bye Birdie, did the permanent notation of a show's complete choreography exist. History In the late 1920s, the importance of dance in a musical changed. Seymour Felix realized dance needed to aid in plot and character development as well as enhance the spirit of the show. Having convinced Florenz Ziegfeld, the producer of Whoopee!, that it is the story that counts, Felix set about to devise dances that unfolded gradually and consisted of plot development and climax as if they were dramatic units themselves instead of \\"a mere pounding of the feet and kicking to music.\\" The major step of integrating dance into a unified effect onstage were vital and ingenuous for commercial dancing. One of the earliest successful examples of this concept was in Pal Joey. The dancing in the show enhanced the environment and projected character without any reduction in the flashy entertainment values then prized in musical shows. Famous director-choreographers When it was realized the importance of dancing as a tool for character development and plot advancement, famous director-choreographers began to emerge: Jerome Robbins, Bob Fosse, and Gower Champion. Robbins believed whoever controlled the movement controlled the show. This was definitely evident in West Side Story when Robbins allowed the choreography and the intense, adolescent passion of a teenage boy in love to move him. When Robbins abandoned commercial dance to pursue a career in choreography with the New York City Ballet, Bob Fosse took up the cause and argued the case for director-choreographers with shows like Sweet Charity, Pippin, Chicago, and Dancin'. Fosse had a talent for manipulating, tampering with, or otherwise reconstructing the contribution from writers in order to make the material serviceable to his staging and choreography. Fosse's style of self-contained acts of vaudeville and burlesque led him to a career of show-stopping numbers for audience approval. Champion wasn‚Äôt as personal as Fosse, or as material-oriented as Robbins, but nonetheless, his craft and work sustained the old-fashioned musical comedy scene for two decades, [1960 with Bye Bye Birdie to 1980 with 42nd Street. Champion used dancing to embellish, extend and enlarge an existing emotion. He was no innovator, like Robbins. He never created his own distinctive style, like Fosse. Yet, Champion's body of work is as much a part of the history of the contemporary musical as that of his talented peers.

(October 21, 1919 ‚Äì November 27, 2008) was an American psychologist and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University.JOHN L. HOLLAND, 1919-2008 A SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY ADDED TO THE TRIBUTE & OBITUARY He was the creator of the career development model, Holland Occupational Themes, commonly known as the Holland Codes. Early life and Education Holland was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. At the age of 20, Holland's father emigrated from England to the U.S. He initially worked as a laborer, later becoming an advertising executive after attending night school at the YMCA. Holland's mother was an elementary school teacher, and he was one of four children. Holland graduated from Central High, Omaha, Nebraska, in 1938 and from the University of Nebraska at Omaha (then Municipal University of Omaha) in 1942. He received his B.A. in Psychology (and also studied French and math).University of Nebraska Graduation Photo of John L. Holland, 1942 Holland joined the army after graduating from college, becoming engaged in the events of World War II. He stayed with the army as a private until 1946, working as \\"a classification interviewer, test proctor, paralegal clerk, laborer, squadron clerk, psychological assistant, and Wechsler test administrator [.... this experience] led to his belief that many people exemplify common psychological types, although his training had fostered the belief that people are infinitely complex. He was also able to work with and get training from social workers, psychologists, and physicians‚Äîexperiences that stimulated his desire to become a psychologist.\\" After leaving the army, he entered a doctoral program in psychology at the University of Minnesota, receiving a master's degree in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1952. Holland was an \\"average\\" student at Minnesota, where he had \\"trouble finding an interesting\\" topic for his doctoral dissertation. He finally produced a dissertation that explored \\"speculations about art and personality [....] This topic did not set well with fellow students or faculty despite its straightforward empirical design. Holland eventually got the doctorate and 10 sets of used painting materials.\\"\\"The Development, Evolution, and Status of Holland‚Äôs Theory of Vocational Personalities: Reflections and Future Directions for Counseling Psychology.\\" Journal of Counseling Psychology, Vol 57(1), 2010, 11-22. Career His initial work after completing his Ph.D. was at Western Reserve University and the Veteran's Administration Psychiatric Hospital (1953‚Äì56). He later worked for the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (1957‚Äì63) and the American College Testing Program (1963‚Äì69). Holland joined Johns Hopkins University's Sociology department in 1969, where he published some of his most important research on personality and career choice. He retired from Johns Hopkins in 1980, but continued his research until his death in 2008. Holland died on November 27, 2008, at Union Memorial Hospital at the age of 89. He was awarded the APA Distinguished Scientific Award for the Applications of Psychology in the same month. =Holland Codes= John L. Holland's RIASEC hexagon of The Holland Codes. Holland's theory of vocational choice The Holland Occupational Themes, \\"now pervades career counseling research and practice.\\" Its origins \\"can be traced to an article in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 1958 and a subsequent article in 1959 that set out his theory of vocational choices [....] The basic premise was that one's occupational preferences were in a sense a veiled expression of underlying character.\\" Athanasou, James. \\"Obituary: John L. Holland 1919-2008\\" Australian Journal of Career Development, September 22, 2009. The 1959 article in particular (\\"A Theory of Vocational Choice,\\" published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology) is considered the first major introduction of Holland's \\"theory of vocational personalities and work environments.\\" Holland originally labeled his six types as \\"motoric, intellectual,esthetic, supportive, persuasive, and conforming.\\" He later developed and changed them to: Realistic (Doers), Investigative (Thinkers), Artistic (Creators), Social (Helpers), Enterprising (Persuaders), and Conventional (Organizers).\\" According to the Committee on Scientific Awards, Holland's \\"research shows that personalities seek out and flourish in career environments they fit and that jobs and career environments are classifiable by the personalities that flourish in them.\\" Holland also wrote of his theory that \\"the choice of a vocation is an expression of personality.\\"Holland, John. Making Vocational Choices: a theory of careers. (Prentice-Hall, 1973): 6. Furthermore, while Holland suggests that people can be \\"categorized as one of six types,\\"Holland, John. Making Vocational Choices: a theory of careers. (Prentice-Hall, 1973): 2. he also argues that \\"a six- category scheme built on the assumption that there are only six kinds of people in the world is unacceptable on the strength of common sense alone. But a six category scheme that allows a simple ordering of a person's resemblance to each of the six models provides the possibility of 720 different personality patterns.\\"Holland, John. Making Vocational Choices: a theory of careers. (Prentice-Hall, 1973): 3. Holland's typology provides an interpretative structure for a number of different vocational interest surveys, including the two measures he developed: The Vocational Preference Inventory in 1953 and the Self Directed Search (SDS) in 1970 (revised in 1977, 1985, and 1994). Holland continued to work on his theory after his retirement from Johns Hopkins in 1980, finally revising it once again in 1997. He also worked with Gary Gottfredson on a few new inventories. In 1991, they developed the Position Classification Inventory (PCI) which was an outgrowth of their attempt to extend the system to all occupations in 1982, 1989, and 1996. In 1994, they developed The Career Attitudes and Strategies Inventory.

Ernst was started in 1893 by Seattle brothers Charles and Fred Ernst and in 1960 became a division of Pay 'n Save, one of the largest retail companies in the Northwest. After a 1984 takeover of Pay 'n Save, Ernst was sold off and went public in 1994. Following several highly publicized lawsuits and a failed attempt to open larger stores, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996 and liquidated in early 1997. At the company's peak, it operated 95 stores in 12 western U.S. states. History An empty Ernst location in Boise, Idaho. =Founding= In 1893, brothers Charles and Fred Ernst started Ernst Hardware in Seattle, Washington. In 1907, the new company was incorporated as Ernst Hardware and Plumbing Co. and moved to 512 Pike Street in downtown Seattle. During the 1950s, M. Lamont Bean, president of Seattle-based drugstore chain Pay 'n Save, expressed the possibility of operating non-drugstore businesses. Bean later took interest in Ernst and, in February 1960, came to an agreement with Fred Ernst to buy his nine hardware stores. Two years later, Pay 'n Save acquired Malmo Nursery and began opening Ernst-Malmo combination stores; combining hardware, lumber, garden supplies, and nursery items in one building. =Trump Group= In September 1984, The Trump Group, led by New York investors Julius and Edmond Trump (who are not related to Donald Trumphttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/nyregion/how-donald-trump-tried-to- protect-his-name-from-others-who-shared-it.html) attempted to acquire Pay 'n Save for $355 million. Pay 'n Save's largest shareholders, Stuart Sloan and Samuel N. Stroum, vowed to fight the sale of the retail company. On September 12, 1984, The Trump Group announced that it had withdrawn its offer to purchase Ernst's parent company in order to negotiate with Sloan and Stroum. On October 15, 1984, Pay 'n Save was officially sold to the Trumps for $358 million. The future of Ernst was put at risk in May 1985 when Pay 'n Save announced plans to sell off all of its subsidiaries. On November 8, 1985, Pay 'n Save's drugstore chain became controlled by a company equally owned by the Trump Group and a partnership headed by William Zimmerman, owner of California discount chain Pic 'N' Save. The sale left Pay 'n Save with 69 Ernst stores, three Yard Birds stores and wholesaler Northwestern Drug Co. In January 1986, Pay 'n Save was renamed Seattle Standard Corp. In March 1986, Hal Smith, former president of Irvine, California-based Builders Emporium, succeeded Mike Rouleau as president and CEO of Ernst. In 1987 and 1988, Ernst remodeled and upgraded all of its stores and, in late 1990, tested a new concept store in West Seattle. The new concept featured garden-like nurseries, an espresso cart, wider aisles, expanded merchandise, brighter signs and other modern amenities. Ernst opened two more of the new concept stores in Lynnwood, Washington and Spokane, Washington in 1991. =Early 1990s lawsuits= An empty Malmo Nursery in Idaho Falls, Idaho. In April 1992, Ernst filed a lawsuit against retailer Wal-Mart claiming the discount chain stole Ernst's registered advertising slogan (\\"Always the right price. Always.\\"). Ernst asked the court to force Wal-Mart to stop using their slogan and pay unspecified damages to the retailer. Three months later, Ernst sued another retailer, Seattle-based home improvement chain Eagle Hardware & Garden, for unfair competition and violation of the state's Consumer Protection Act. The company claimed Eagle's comparisons of prices for various products were false and deceptive. Eagle, in turn, accused Ernst of also misleading consumers with its advertising and defamation for suing Eagle just before the newly formed company went public. At the same time of the Eagle suit, Ernst went after Pay 'n Save, accusing it of illegal competition for selling nursery products in 15 Washington shopping centers the two retailers operated in. Ernst had contracts with the owners of the 15 shopping centers to be the primary or exclusive seller of nursery products in them. PayLess Drug Stores, who had then-recently acquired Pay 'n Save, hit the chain with a counterclaim, which accused Ernst of selling camera film and film-processing services at eight shopping centers where PayLess had the sole right to sell those services. Shortly after the suits against the three retailers, the state of Washington sued Ernst on charges that it failed to objectively portray prices at competitors Pay 'N Pak and Home Club in a 1990 advertising campaign. In a settlement made in October 1992, Ernst admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to pay $19,500 in court costs, consumer education and to enforce the Consumer Protection Act. In November 1992, Ernst filed a lawsuit against United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1001 following several months of union complaints against the retail chain. Union complaints about off-the-clock work and unlawful pay practices prompted the chain to file the lawsuit alleging defamation and consumer protection violations by the union and its legal counsel. In March 1993, the union filed a class-action lawsuit against Ernst, charging the retailer with failing to pay employees for work done on their own time. The union, representing 450 of Ernst's Seattle area employees, had been boycotting the hardware chain since November 1992 when their contract expired on November 1. The union sued Ernst again in August 1993 for knowingly selling toilets that violate state water conservation requirements. Ernst later announced it would stop selling the specific toilets. =Decline= In June 1994, Ernst announced plans to go public and to raise $50 million through a stock sale to open 55 superstores over the next three years. The company began opening the superstores, averaged at , in 1991. At the time, Ernst was operating 77 stores in eight U.S. states. Ernst later delayed their initial stock offering, but later resumed their offering and went public in September 1994. In January 1996, Ernst reported a $47.6 million loss in its fourth-quarter, nearly twice what the retailer made in the past four years. At the same time, Ernst announced the cancellation of plans for 13 new stores and the closure of nine stores. On July 12, 1996, Ernst filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced the closure of 25 stores. The filing came after Ernst reported a loss of nearly $116 million in the company's past three quarters. On November 12, despite the chain's attempt to remain in business, Ernst announced it would close its remaining 53 stores and sell off the remainder of its operations. At the time, Ernst was operating 53 stores in six U.S. states and had about 2,000 full and part-time employees. Ernst began its final going-out-of-business sale on November 23. Malmo Nursery Charles Malmo, an immigrant from Norway, founded a seed store on Second Avenue in Seattle in 1893. Malmo was credited with being first in the Northwest to propagate and grow his own nursery stock rather than import ornamental shrubs from Japan, the Netherlands and England. In 1930, he opened the first \\"garden department store\\" on the Pacific Coast, selling all that was needed for the \\"most elaborate garden, from seeds to large trees,\\" as he humbly asserted during the opening festivities. His son Clark bought to cultivate at the present site of University Village shopping mall. Many of the gorgeous mature yards surrounding old Laurelhurst homes in Seattle today were the work of the Malmos. In 1962, the Malmos sold their business to Ernst Hardware and Pay 'n Save stores and became a wholly owned subsidiary.

It is part of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area. History Guano was mined on North West Island during the 1890s. Turtle soup canneries operated on the island from 1904 to 1914 and 1924 to 1926.

In mid April 2010, it was suspected that the 2010 Great Barrier Reef oil spill had reached North West Island. Small globules of oil were found along a 1 km long section of a beach. Clean-up crews were removing the oil by 14 April. A Maritime Safety Queensland spokesperson doubted the oil could have arrived on the island from the MV Shen Neng 1 so quickly, claiming the oil was from an earlier spill. Fatal Shark Attack 6 April 2020. A man has died following a shark attack off the Queensland coast. The 23-year-old man was swimming with a group of friends off North West Island, around 75 kilometres east of Gladstone. Queensland Police said the man was swimming back to the group‚Äôs charter boat when he was bitten by the shark. He sustained injuries to his leg, hand and elbow. A doctor and paramedics responded and treated the man on board the vessel before he was taken to Gladstone Hospital. Gabrielle Holmes from Capricorn Rescue Service said a helicopter reached the boat at around 6pm. ‚ÄúAt this stage we believe there was a group of them swimming and this patient was the last one to exit the water onto the boat, when the incident occurred,‚Äù she told the ABC. Despite a concerted effort to treat and stabilise the man‚Äôs condition so he was well enough to travel, he died are around 10pm at hospital. Flora and fauna The vegetation of the island is dominated by dense Pisonia forest. North West Island is an important nesting ground for seabirds and turtles. As many as 500,000 seabirds habitat the island at any one time. Seventy per cent of the total breeding population of wedge-tailed shearwaters on Australia's east coast nest on the island. The Capricorn silvereye, a small bird endemic to the southern Great Barrier Reef, is found on the island. The green sea turtle and the endangered loggerhead sea turtle nest on the island between November and February. Because of these important rookeries the size of nesting populations is monitored on an annual basis.

Eating food for example leads to elevated blood sugar levels. In healthy people these levels quickly return to normal via increased cellular glucose uptake which is primarily mediated by increase in blood insulin levels. Glucose tests can reveal temporary/long-term hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. These conditions may not have obvious symptoms and can damage organs in the long-term. Abnormally high/low levels, slow return to normal levels from either of these conditions and/or inability to normalize blood sugar levels means that the person being tested probably has some kind of medical condition like type 2 diabetes which is caused by cellular insensitivity to insulin. Glucose tests are thus often used to diagnose such conditions. Testing methods Tests that can be performed at home are used in blood glucose monitoring for illnesses that have already been diagnosed medically so that these illnesses can be maintained via medication and meal timing. Some of the home testing methods include *fingerprick type of glucose meter - need to prick self finger 8-12 times a day. *continuous glucose monitor - the CGM monitors the glucose levels every 5 minutes approximately. Laboratory tests are often used to diagnose illnesses and such methods include *fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting plasma glucose (FPG): 10‚Äì16 hours after eating *glucose tolerance test: continuous testing *postprandial glucose test (PC): 2 hours after eating *random glucose test Some laboratory tests don't measure glucose levels directly from body fluids or tissues but still indicate elevated blood sugar levels. Such tests measure the levels of glycated hemoglobin, other glycated proteins, 1,5-anhydroglucitol etc. from blood. Use in medical diagnosis Glucose testing can be used to diagnose or indicate certain medical conditions. High blood sugar may indicate *gestational diabetes. This temporary form of diabetes appears during pregnancy, and with glucose- controlling medication or insulin symptoms can be improved. *type 1 and type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. If diagnosed with diabetes, regular glucose tests can help manage or maintain conditions. Type 1, is commonly seen in children or teenagers whose bodies are not producing enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes, is typically seen in adults who are overweight. The insulin in their bodies are either not working normally, or there is not being enough produced. *pancreatic cancer *pancreatitis *underactive thyroid Low blood sugar may indicate *insulin overuse *starvation *underactive thyroid *Addison's disease *insulinoma *kidney disease Preparing for testing Fasting prior to glucose testing may be required with some test types. Fasting blood sugar test, for example, requires 10‚Äì16 hour-long period of not eating before the test. Blood sugar levels can be affected by some drugs and prior to some glucose tests these medications should be temporarily given up or their dosages should be decreased. Such drugs may include salicylates (Aspirin), birth control pills, corticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, diuretics and phenytoin. Some foods contain caffeine (coffee, tea, colas, energy drinks etc.). Blood sugar levels of healthy people are generally not significantly changed by caffeine, but in diabetics caffeine intake may elevate these levels via its ability to stimulate the adrenergic nervous system. Reference ranges =Fasting blood sugar= A level below 5.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) 10‚Äì16 hours without eating is normal. 5.6‚Äì6 mmol/l (100‚Äì109 mg/dl) may indicate prediabetes and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be done for high- risk individuals (old people, those with high blood pressure etc.). 6.1‚Äì6.9 mmol/l (110‚Äì125 mg/dl) means OGTT should be done even if other indicators of diabetes are not present. 7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) and above indicates diabetes and the fasting test should be repeated.Diabetes ‚Äì tests and diagnosis =Glucose tolerance test= =Postprandial glucose test= =Random glucose test= See also *Hyperglycemia *Hypoglycemia References Category:Blood tests ","title":"Glucose test"},{"id":"3012327","text":"The original Bobby was a free online tool, written by Josh Krieger and provided by the Centre for Applied Special Technology (CAST) used to validate websites for WAI and Section 508 compliance.

Two capitol buildings served the colony on the same site: the first from 1705 until its destruction by fire in 1747; the second from 1753 to 1780. The earlier capitol was reconstructed in the early 1930s as part of the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg. The reconstruction has thus lasted longer than the combined total of both original capitol buildings. History =First Williamsburg Capitol (1705‚Äì1747)= In 1698, the Capitol building in Jamestown, Virginia burned. Following the fire, the government of Virginia decided to relocate inland, away from the swamps at the Jamestown site. A better Capitol building was constructed by Henry Cary, a contractor finishing work on the College of William and Mary's Wren Building (the legislature's temporary home). Begun in 1701, the Capitol was completed in 1705, although the legislature moved in during 1704. In 1714, the Governor's Palace was constructed between the College and the Capitol. The Colonial Capitol was a two-story H-shaped structure, functionally two buildings connected by an arcade. Each wing served one of the two houses of the Virginia legislature, the Council and the House of Burgesses. The first floor of the west building was for the General Court and the colony's secretary, the first floor of the east for the House of Burgesses and its clerk. As a result of the fires that had destroyed several prior Virginia capitols, Cary built the first Capitol without fireplaces. In 1723, chimneys were added for fireplaces to help keep the Capitol dry. On January 30, 1747, the building burned and only some walls and the foundation remained. =Second Williamsburg Capitol (1753‚Äì1779)= 1845 engraving based on then-surviving drawings of the second capitol at Williamsburg (viewed from Duke of Gloucester Street) Governor William Gooch urged that the Capitol be rebuilt, but many legislators preferred relocating the government to a city more accessible to trade and navigation. In the meantime, the burgesses met again at the nearby Wren Building. Finally, in November 1748, reconstruction of the Capitol was approved (by only two votes: 40 to 38). The burgesses met inside for the first time on November 1, 1753. In this building, Patrick Henry delivered his Caesar-Brutus speech against the Stamp Act on May 29, 1765. Henry, George Washington, George Mason, George Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, and others played parts in the legislative maneuvering that ended in revolution. As fighting began in the North, the building featured discussion concerning Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, his Virginia constitution, and Jefferson's first attempt at a bill for religious freedom. On June 29, 1776, Virginians declared their independence from Great Britain and wrote the state's first constitution, thereby creating an independent government four days before Congress voted for the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia on July 4. The Capitol at Williamsburg served until the American Revolutionary War began, when Governor Thomas Jefferson urged it that the capital be relocated to Richmond. The building was last used as a capitol on December 24, 1779, when the Virginia General Assembly adjourned to reconvene in 1780 at the new capital, Richmond. After the capital of Virginia was moved to Richmond in 1779, the old Capitol was used for a wide range of purposes, from a court to a school. The east wing was removed around 1800 because of its dangerous condition, leaving only the west wing standing for the next 30 years, until it was destroyed by fire in 1832, leaving no trace of the original structure, except for the outline of its foundations. Taylor Stoermer, Colonial Williamsburg: The Official Guide (2014), 147. Reconstruction Reconstruction of the first Williamsburg capitol The building that stands now in Colonial Williamsburg is the third Capitol on that site. Early in the 20th century, the Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin undertook restoration of historic Bruton Parish Church (c. 1711) where he was rector. His dreams of restoring other buildings of the old colonial capital city led to his affiliation with Standard Oil heir and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the creation of Colonial Williamsburg. The reconstructed Capitol and Governor's Palace join the Wren Building of the College of William & Mary as the three main structures of the restoration. The architects charged with the restoration of Williamsburg chose to reconstruct the first capitol based on superior documentation of its design and its unique architecture compared to the second Capitol. Later architectural historians have since shown that parts of the reconstruction, chiefly its foundations, were embellished or conjectural and were based more on contemporary architectural ideas than actual historic evidence. However, the reconstructed Capitol is now itself valued as a Colonial Revival interpretation and work of architecture. The reconstruction opened to the public on February 24, 1934.

It offers a concise summary of the main point or claim of the essay, research paper, etc. It is usually expressed in one sentence, and the statement may be reiterated elsewhere. It contains the topic and the controlling idea. There are two types of thesis statements: direct and indirect. The indirect thesis statement does not state the explicit reasons, while the direct thesis statement does. If one writes, \\"I love New York for three reasons,\\" the fact that they love New York is the topic, and \\"three reasons\\" are an indirect thesis statement. The essay will contain the three reasons. If one writes, \\"I love New York because of the food, the jazz clubs and the Broadway Shows,\\" it is a direct thesis statement that tells what each section or body paragraph is going to be about.\\"How To Write a Thesis Statement\\". indiana.edu. The thesis statement is developed, supported, and explained in the course of the paper by means of examples and evidence. Thesis statements help organize and develop the body of the writing piece. They let readers know what the writer's statement is and what it is aiming to prove. A thesis statement does not necessarily forecast organization of an essay, which can be more complex than its purpose. Structure The thesis statement will reflect the kind of paper being written. There are three kinds of papers: analytical, expository, and argumentative. The structure of a thesis statement depends upon the nature of determining essay type. In simple terms, first a thesis statement will have a main topic sentence formed from questioning it, then the writer's statement regarding the topic sentence, and finally ends with the specific supporting points detailing the writer's statement for justifying its relation with the topic sentence. In general, it should have a supportable opinion (specific/focused) and clear intent for the essay.

Before joining the NL in 1892, they were also a charter member of the American Association (AA) from 1882 to 1891. Although St. Louis has been the Cardinals' home city for the franchise's entire existence, they were also known as the Brown Stockings, Browns, and Perfectos. In 134 seasons, the franchise has won more than 10,000 regular season games and appeared in 27 postseasons while claiming 12 interleague championships and 23 league pennants. Eleven of the interleague championships are World Series titles won under the modern format since 1903; 19 of the league pennants are NL pennants, and the other four are AA pennants. Their 11 World Series titles represent the most in the NL and are second in MLB only to the New York Yankees' 27. The first major award MLB presented for team performance occurred with the World Series champions in 1903, and for individual performance, in 1911 in the American League with the Chalmers Award. The first major award which the National League presented for individual performance was the League Award in 1924, the predecessor of the modern Most Valuable Player Award (MVP). Rogers Hornsby earned the League Award in 1925 making him the first winner of an MVP or its equivalent in franchise history. The following season, the Cardinals won their first modern World Series. They won the first World Series Trophy,The World Series Trophy was first awarded in 1970. In 1985, it was renamed the Commissioner's Trophy. From 1970 to 1984, the \\"Commissioner's Trophy\\" was the name of the award that was given to the All-Star Game MVP. following their 1967 World Series title, which, before that year, the World Series champion had never received any kind of official trophy.  Individual awards =National League Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award= Major League Baseball (MLB), with voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), first presented the modern MVP award to one player each in the American and National League in 1931. Voting is accomplished with two writers from each city containing an MLB club, of whom each fills in a ballot with the names of ten players, ranking each from first to tenth. The BBWAA began polling three writers in each league city in 1938 and reduced that number to two per league city in 1961. One of the MVP award's predecessors was the League Award, which the National League awarded via of voting process in a similar fashion to that of the BBWAA from 1924 to 1929.Gillette & Palmer, pp. 1764‚Äì1765 16 different Cardinals players have won the award a total of 20 times. Stan Musial and Albert Pujols are the only players to have won multiple times, each having won three times. Pujols is the only Cardinals player to have won in consecutive seasons, from 2008‚Äì2009. The most consecutive seasons a Cardinals player has won the award is three, which occurred from 1942‚Äì44 between Mort Cooper, Musial, and Marty Marion. Typically awarded to position players, Cardinals pitchers who have won an MVP award are Cooper, Dizzy Dean, and Bob Gibson. At least one Cardinals player has won the award in each completed decade since the League Award was given except in the 1950s.

It is located inside the Walled City of Lahore, near the Taxali Gate, and south of the Badshahi Mosque. The market had historically been the centre of the city's refined tawaif culture since the 15th and 16th centuries. Etymology The area's name is traditionally described by locals to describe the beauty of the girls in the market, as the word Heera means \\"diamond\\" in Urdu. The market is named after Heera Singh, who was the son of a minister of Ranjit Singh's court. The neighbourhood is sometimes also referred to as Shahi Mohalla (\\"The Royal Neighbourhood\\"), given its close proximity to the Lahore Fort. Historical background The market was originally the centre of the city's tawaif (concubine) culture for the Lahore's Mughal era elite during the 15th and 16th centuries. The neighbourhood became a centre for mujra - a sensual South Asian dance style that required years of practice to perfect. During Sikh rule of Lahore, Maharaja Ranjit Singh allowed the Heera Mandi business to flourish. During Sikh Rule, majority of the women sold into Heera Mandi were Punjabi Muslim women, and also included Uzbek women, who probably came to the region during the rule of the first Mughal emperor, Babur. Meanwhile most of the owners of the women were Sikh troops. Maharaja Ranjit Singh ordered many Sikh soldiers to sell Punjabi and Uzbek women into the Heera Mandi markets of Lahore. Most people believe that this was because of Ranjit Singh's unhealthy relationship with the Muslims, who he deemed to be Mughal and Durrani sympathizers. Under the British colonial rule, it became a hub of prostitution. Within the market, women and khusra (transgenders) offered traditional and classical dances. From the British colonial period till past few years, it remained a centre of prostitution in Lahore. Many Hijras, members of Pakistan's transgender community, frequent the area and are involved in the area's dance culture. =Prostitution= The brothel houses were first developed by the British in old Anarkali Bazaar for the recreation of the British soldiers during the British Raj. After that these were shifted to Lohari Gate and then to Taxali Gate. After 1947, many governments have made efforts to increase amenities for customers of prostitution at the Heera Mandi area of Lahore but have failed. During the Zia era, an operation was conducted against music and dance houses, which were alleged to be dens of prostitution. The operation served to spread the practice throughout the city. In recent times, the area has become known for prostitution again,Zohaib Saleem Butt, \\"Heera Mandi: Scarlet secrets of Lahore\\", The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 20 August 2010, Retrieved 18 February 2017 though the practice in the neighbourhood is in decline with the rise of online escort services. During the day, Heera Mandi is much like any other Pakistani bazaars and is known for its good food, wide range of Khussa (traditional Mughal footwear) and shops for musical instruments. At night, the brothels above the shops open. The place is also considered as a symbol for the city of Lahore and sometimes the words 'Heera Mandi' themselves are considered to be offensive in formal talks. Civic administration The neighbourhood forms part of Taxali Gate's Union Council 30. Cultural Portrayal Heera Mandi is referred to in the Bollywood movie Kalank.

Monument in Budapest. Tibor Szamuely (December 27, 1890 - August 2, 1919) was a Hungarian politician and journalist who was Deputy People's Commissar of War and People's Commissar of Public Education during the Hungarian Soviet Republic.  Early life  Born in Ny√≠regyh√°za, in northeastern Hungary, Szamuely was the oldest son of five children of a Jewish family. After completing his university studies, he became a journalist. He started his political activities as a member of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party.  Political career  Szamuely was drafted and fought as a soldier during World War I; in 1915, he was captured by Russia. After the Russian October Revolution in 1917, he was released. By then, Szamuely had become interested in communism. In Moscow, he organised a communist group together with B√©la Kun among the Hungarian prisoners of war. Many of them, including Szamuely and Kun, joined the Soviet Red Army and fought in the Russian Civil War. In January 1918, he resided in Moscow, where he worked with Kun to organize Hungarian prisoners of war who supported the Russian Revolution. He was also a member of the Central Committee, responsible for the management of war prisoners. On March 24, he was appointed political deputy of the Communist group of Hungarian war prisoners. Between April 14 and 18, during the sessions, he participated in the meeting of the deputies. From April 3, 1918, he published a communist newspaper, Socialist Revolution, with B√©la Kun. Many Hungarian war prisoners refused to join the Russian Red Guard, despite his efforts. Several Hungarian officers were executed in Russia as a result. Szamuely later went to Germany and in December 1918, he participated in the formation of the Spartacist League, with Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. He returned to Budapest on January 3, 1919. He became a member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party and joined the editing of the Red Paper. On February 20, he went into exile but continued his activities in the exiled Central Committee, such as participation in the organisation in the party's paramilitary./mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC14240/14481.htm Szamuely was an extremist in his views and his methods. In February 1919, as the communists in Budapest became prepared to rebel against the Social Democrat-Communist coalition government, he wrote in the pages of the V√∂r√∂s √öjs√°g (Red News): \\"Everywhere counter-revolutionaries run about and swagger; beat them down! Beat their heads where you find them! If counter-revolutionaries were to gain the upper hand for even a single hour, there will be no mercy for any proletarian. Before they stifle the revolution, suffocate them in their own blood!\\"V√∂r√∂s √öjs√°g, 11 February 1919 On 21 March 1919 a coup by the communist members of the coalition government established the Hungarian Soviet Republic, under the leadership of B√©la Kun. Szamuely became a prominent politician of the new government. He occupied a number of posts, but he then was made People's Commissar for Military Affairs. He became a figure of the so-called \\"Red Terror\\" of Hungary. Szamuely's guards became nicknamed the \\"Lenin Boys\\" or \\"Lenin Youth\\". They were an element in the heightened political tension and suppression towards counterrevolutionaries and anti-communists. The Lenin Boys' activities were sometimes aligned with another paramilitary, the Red Guard, led by J√≥zsef Cserny, in which, on an armoured train they travelled the country.Magyar katolikus lexikon: Lenin-fi√∫k The foundation for the suppression was given as following by Szamuely in a speech delivered in Gy≈ër on April 20, 1919: \\"Power has fallen into our hands. Those who wish the old regime to return, must be hung without mercy. We must bite the throat of such individuals. The victory of the Hungarian Proletariat has not cost us major sacrifices so far. But now the situation demands that blood must flow. We must not be afraid of blood. Blood is steel: it strengthens our hearts, it strengthens the fist of the Proletariat. Blood will make us powerful. Blood will lead us to the true world of the Commune. We will exterminate the entire bourgeoisie if we have to!\\"Cseh G√©za: V√∂r√∂s √©s feh√©r terror Szolnokon, Rubicon T√∂rt√©nelmi Magazin, 2011/2. sz√°m The revolutionary tribunals executed between 370 and 587 of those in custody,Sorensen: \\"Did Hungary Become Fascist?\\"; see Leslie Eliason - Lene Bogh Sorensen: Fascism, Liberalism, and Social Democracy in Central Europe: Past and Present, Aarhus Universitetsforlag, 2002, and others have placed the number at 590.Tibor Hajdu. The Hungarian Soviet Republic. Studia Historica. Vol. 131. Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. Budapest, 1979 In late May 1919, Szamuely travelled to Moscow by aeroplane to campaign for world revolution with Vladimir Lenin. As Szamuely progressed with the revolutionary tribunals, Kun became increasingly uneasy of him, and feared that he was gaining more power than the government. The Social Democrats, who were also members of the Revolutionary Governing Council, pushed for keeping Szamuely and Cserny in check. Therefore, the People's Commissar of Military Affairs at that time, Vilmos B√∂hm, ordered the dissolution of the paramilitaries and the tribunals at the end of April 1919. Szamuely did not obey, but continued the tribunals' activities in Szolnok in May, then in Abony. He planned to assassinate B√∂hm, but by August 1919, the Hungarian Soviet Republic had ended after Hungarian-Romanian war, and Szamuely was forced into exile.Konok P√©ter: Az er√¥szak k√©rd√©sei 1919‚Äì1920-ban, 76‚Äì77.Komor√≥czy G√©za: Zsid√≥k a Tan√°csk√∂zt√°rsas√°gban, Szombat.org  Later life  The Hungarian Soviet Republic lasted for six months. On 1 August 1919, Kun went into exile as Romanian troops invaded Budapest. Szamuely managed to escape the anticommunist reprisals, known as the \\"White Terror\\". He left in his car towards Austria on 2 August 1919, but after making an illegal border crossing, he was arrested by the Austrian authorities. Both Hungarian and Austrian authorities reported that Szamuely had shot himself while the Communist partisan who smuggled him across the border was searched.1919\\\\. augusztus 2. szombat/Samuely Tibor elvt√°rs menek√ºl√©se √©s √∂ngyilkoss√°ga, Valtozast.hu The wife of B√©la Kun wrote in her memoires that Szamuely had told her of his plan to commit suicide if he was captured and had showed her a gun hidden in his clothes.1919\\\\. augusztus 1. p√©ntek/R√©szletek Kun B√©l√°n√© visszaeml√©kez√©seib≈ël, Valtozast.hu That version of events is not universally accepted, however, and some believe that he had been shot by the border guards.

Lepakko or Lepakkoluola was a place for independent youth culture in Helsinki, Finland, functioning from 1979 to 1999. The building was mostly used for rock concerts. Many Finnish rock artists came into popular knowledge through Lepakko. Lepakko also had a sauna and on special \\"steam club\\" nights one could enjoy sauna and music. The main organiser of the activity was ELMU ry, the Live Music Association of Helsinki. Lepakko also hosted a radio station, Radio City, from 1985 to 1999. The name Lepakko is Finnish for bat - the shape of the logo of the paint factory that previously owned the building had resembled a bat. History The Lepakko building was originally a warehouse for a paint factory, built in 1940. From 1968 to 1978 it functioned as a shelter for homeless alcoholics. The City of Helsinki emptied the building in 1978. In 1979, a group of young people and the ELMU invaded the building and negotiated with the city officials to make it a place for youth and culture. The house was at first named Lepakkoluola (Finnish for bat cave), the name was later in most occasions shortened to Lepakko. Lepakko was demolished to make way for a new office building in 1999, despite complaints that it should be preserved as an institution and a monument of independent Finnish youth and rock culture. The City of Helsinki hired out Nosturi to ELMU as a substitute. Currently the site is occupied by a building originally built for Nokia, but actually occupied by Ilmarinen, an insurance company. A statue depicting a bat, in a glass enclosure, is in the yard.

She also broke new ground with Conversations on Political Economy (1816), which explained the ideas of Adam Smith, Malthus and David Ricardo. Life Jane Marcet was born in London on 1 January 1769, one of twelve children of a wealthy Genevan merchant and banker, Anthony Francis Haldimand (1740/41‚Äì1817), and his wife Jane (died 1785). She was educated at home with her brothers. Her studies included Latin (essential for the sciences), chemistry, biology and history, as well as topics more usual for young ladies in England. Jane took over the running of the family at age 15, after her mother's death. She managed the house and helped to bring up her younger siblings. Her younger brother William Haldimand (1784‚Äì1862) became a director of the Bank of England and a member of Parliament. She also acted as her father's hostess, helping to entertain frequent parties of scientific and literary guests. Jane developed an early interest in painting during a visit to Italy with her father in 1796, and studied with Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Lawrence. Her artistic training later enabled her to illustrate her books. Jane was married in 1799 to Alexander John Gaspard Marcet (1770‚Äì1822), a political exile from Geneva, Switzerland who graduated from medical school at the University of Edinburgh as a physician in 1797. After their marriage, the Marcets continued to live in London. They had four children, one of whom, Fran√ßois Marcet (1803‚Äì1883), became a well-known physicist.Morse, Elizabeth J. \\"Marcet, Jane Haldimand (1769‚Äì1858)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, September 2004). Retrieved 9 September 2010. Alexander was strongly interested in chemistry, and became a lecturer at Guy's Hospital in London and a Fellow of the Royal Society. When Jane became interested in learning more about chemistry, they conducted experiments together in a home laboratory, discussing the scientific principles involved. The Marcets were part of a literary and scientific social circle that included many leading writers and scientists such as Mary Somerville, Henry Hallam, Harriet Martineau, Auguste Arthur de la Rive and Maria Edgeworth. Novelist Maria Edgeworth described their home, with its lively, intelligent children and welcome for visitors, in her letters. One of Edgeworth's anecdotes gives a vivid picture of the Marcet family and its scientific and social activities: \\"We came here last Friday, and have spent our time most happily with our excellent friend Mrs. Marcet. His children are all so fond of Dr. Marcet, we see that he is their companion and friend. They have all been happily busy in making a paper fire-balloon, sixteen feet in diameter, and thirty feet high. A large company were invited to see it mount.\\" Jane and her father were close throughout their lives, and he lived with his daughter and her husband after their marriage. After Jane's father died in 1817, she received a substantial legacy which enabled Alexander Marcet to devote himself full-time to chemistry, giving up his medical practice. Alexander, in his turn, understood and supported his wife's need for intellectual engagement and productive work. \\"Conversations\\" After helping to read the proofs of one of her husband's books, Marcet decided to write her own, and produced expository books on chemistry, botany, religion and economics under the general title \\"Conversations\\". In her prefaces, Marcet explicitly addresses issues of whether such knowledge is suitable for women, arguing against objections and stating that public opinion supports her position. The first of these was written in 1805, although not published until 1819, as Conversations on Natural Philosophy. The textbook covered the basics of scientific knowledge of the time: physics, mechanics, astronomy, the properties of fluids, air, and optics. It established a common format in Marcet's works: a dialogue between two pupils, Caroline and Emily (or Emilie), and their teacher, Mrs. Bryant (Mrs. B). Caroline, the younger, asks flippant questions that nonetheless move the dialogue along, while Emily is more controlled and reflective. Mrs. Bryant is a maternal mentoring figure who leads them to question and examine their ideas. Both the scientific content of the dialogue, and the discursive process of sharing scientific knowledge, were important for Marcet's readers. Conversations on Chemistry, Title page, Twelfth edition, 1832. Chemical Heritage Foundation Plate from Jane Marcet's Conversations on Chemistry Marcet's next book, Conversations on Chemistry, Intended More Especially for the Female Sex was published anonymously in 1805, and became her most popular and famous work. Summarizing and popularising the work of Humphry Davy, whose lectures she attended, it was one of the first elementary science textbooks. It was illustrated with Marcet's own drawings of chemical apparatus. and emphasised the importance both of demonstration by experiment and of theoretical rigour. Jane Marcet was not explicitly identified as the author until the twelfth edition appeared in 1832. The book went into 16 editions in England, where it was an early inspiration for the young Michael Faraday. It was widely plagiarised in America, appearing in at least 23 editions there. Marcet also popularised the arguments of political economists like Adam Smith, Malthus, and above all David Ricardo, in her Conversations on Political Economy (1816). This was well received and widely read, although some later economists such as Alfred Marshall were dismissive, to the detriment of its later reputation, and Joseph Schumpeter derided it as \\"economics for schoolgirls\\". The purpose, however, was an important one that went beyond the lucrative supply of a niche market. Mrs B's flippant pupil, Caroline, says that she would have thought a woman could be excused ignorance of that topic. Mrs B replies tartly, \\"When you plead in favour of ignorance, there is a strong presumption that you are in the wrong.\\" Marcet's Conversations on Political Economy were an inspiration to Harriet Martineau to introduce economic topics into her writings. In 1820 the Marcets travelled to Geneva, Switzerland, intending to relocate there. In 1822, Alexander died unexpectedly while on a visit to Britain. Jane was extremely distressed by his death. She went through one of several periods of depression to affect her during her life, described by her friend Auguste de La Rive as a \\"shadow enveloping an energetic and active spirit\\". Though she retained strong ties to her Swiss friends, she eventually returned to England to live. She continued to be active in scientific circles, and updated and published new editions of her major works throughout her life. Her last edition of \\"Conversations on Chemistry\\" appeared when she was eighty-four. In later life, Marcet wrote new works mainly for children, perhaps with her grandchildren in mind. Mary's Grammar (1835) became a classic. Jane Marcet lived for the latter part of her life with a daughter, at 14 Stratton Street, Piccadilly, London. She died there on 28 June 1858. Legacy Marcet's major contribution was her work as an educator. Her works contained few original ideas, but were based on careful study of current theories and a voluminous ongoing correspondence with current scientists. Her works were noted for their precision, accuracy, and thoroughness. She presented science and economics in an informal way, but her simple introductions to often complex subjects were widely appreciated by adults as well as children. Perhaps most importantly, they reached women, including students in prominent women's seminaries, who had not been encouraged to explore the experimental sciences at that time. Marcet was uniquely qualified to play the role of popularizer of chemistry and economics by her contacts with many of the greatest thinkers and scientists of her day. She deserves credit for widely popularizing the new fields of chemistry and political economy. By writing in English, and in a discursive style, she made scientific knowledge accessible not only to women but also to men who were not trained in the fundamental languages of a classical education, Latin and Greek. While her original intent was to educate women, she reached a much broader audience in line with enlightenment ideals, and laid claim to the natural sciences as a public endeavour. When the Boston Girls' High and Normal School became the first school in America to teach science to women through laboratory experience, in 1865, Marcet's Conversations on Chemistry was the text they used. When Henry James wrote The Turn of the Screw in 1898, Marcet's works were still standard textbooks. The governess refers offhandedly to a text being \\"as impersonal as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine.\\"  Intellectual Legacy  One of the world's greatest scientists, revolutionizing both physics and chemistry, Michael Faraday, born in 1791, read the work of Jane. He was impressed by her work on chemistry and by this it helped him to find a new calling for science and later claimed that it had played a vital role in his career as a chemist. Faraday described Jane as, ‚ÄúWhen I came to know Mrs. Marcet personally; how often I cast my thoughts backwards, delighting to connect the past and the present; how often, when sending a paper to her as a thank you offering, I thought of my first instructress.‚Äù The book aimed at helping other people who were bewildered by chemistry. She explained better in a way to understand than other textbooks, but they were still scientifically accurate. It was a user-friendly book and the subjects were divided into two parts, each part with more than 300 pages. It highlights the conversations between an adult's teacher and two children. Marcet also added her own figures to explain more clearly to helping people understand chemistry in an easy way. In England, sixteen editions of the book Conversations on Chemistry were published until the 1830s with all-inclusive updates. She had influenced so much from her book all over the world. Girls and other people who were not wealthy were pursuing the subject, were able to get to along so well with it. Marcet's actively support on the teaching of chemistry to beginners by experimental laboratory presenting was new was recognized by many. After the Civil War, laboratory instruction was becoming the norm in American schools. Despite competition from many of the other authors and various books, Jane Marcet's Conversations on Chemistry ruled in the female advancement of knowledge. The popularity of Marcet's book during the early 1900s suggests that there was increasing acceptance by American schools to include basic subjects of theoretical and experimental science in the education of female sex. The availability of education on scientific theories in the schools of women to set the platform for increasing women's engagements in science. She has inspired many of the greatest chemists, scientists and Mathematicians in history. Mary Somerville, born in 1790, the Mathematician after whom The University of Oxford‚Äôs first women's college was named, said of Jane Marcet: ‚ÄúNo one at this time can duly estimate the importance of Mrs Marcet‚Äôs scientific works.‚Äù The book was also very popular in the United States, in part due to the publishing of nearly two dozen derivative editions by John Lee Comstock and others. Because of the lack of international copyright laws, Marcet did not control or receive payment for these editions. After being used as a standard textbook in Britain and United States, her book was translated in German and French. In the United States, Boston's Girls' High School and Normal School became the first school to teach science to women through laboratory experience, in 1865, based on the text of Marcet's Conversations on Chemistry. Jane was inspired by the work economists of David Ricardo, Adam Smith and many others. Marcet then wrote Conversations on Political Economy in 1816, which notably drew attention for the arguments based on some notable works of some famous economists. The book mainly targeted the general idea of economics with liberating and educating poor people with no discrimination in sex. The idea was to teach general notions of political economy with the distribution of the property, taxes, on the division of labour, on the capital, on the wages and population and on the condition of poor. In Jane Marcet's letter to Pierre Prevost, she clearly stated that: ‚Äò‚ÄòI can assure you that the greatest pleasure I derive from success is the hope of doing good by the propagation of useful truths amongst a class of people, who, excepting in a popular familiar form, would never have become acquainted with them.‚Äù The book was well accepted and became a popular read. Later some economists like Alfred Marshall showed indifference to her work, which damaged her reputation. Joseph Schumpeter mocked it as \\"economics for schoolgirls\\". The aim of her book was an important one that went beyond the moneymaking for small markets. It was aimed to popularize the lesson of political economy for self-improving working classes and school curriculum. It was an attempt to simplify economics for the fewer privileged audience and younger people to educate them about the principle of economics by which markets are regulated in simple tales. Marcet's Conversations on Political Economy were an inspiration to Harriet Martineau to introduce economic topics into her writings. Harriet Martineau was a British social theorist and Whig writer often cited as the first female sociologist. She was inspired by her to teach the principles of economics not being repressed in a story, but by being demonstrated in their natural workings in selected phases of life. It followed a style in resemblance to that of her previous book and was also extremely popular. Following the death of her father in 1817, Jane received a considerable Hereditary succession to properties. She and her husband moved to Geneva in the 1820s, and two years later Alexander died. Jane eventually settled back in London, where she again surrounded herself with prominent intellectuals and bankers. She continued to write, her later works largely focused on less-demanding topics and were typically for a younger audience. Further success came with the 1819 publication of Conversations on Natural Philosophy, which Marcet had written prior to Conversations on Chemistry. In 1832, Jane Marcet's name appears for the first time as the author of Conversations on Chemistry. Notable books from this period include Mary's Grammar which was published in 1835. Marcet's early anonymity gave the opportunity to male authors in the United States to supplement and issue their edition of Jane's work with their own invented language and place their names on the book's title page, thus claiming authorship. When Marcet published the 12th edition under her own name, it created a situation of chaos among the published books but nothing happened in the end. Owing to the lack of international copyright laws, Jane never received royalties for any editions published in the United States by authors. While Marcet went on to publish several other popular ‚Äúconversations,‚Äù including Conversations on Political Economy and Conversations on Plant Physiology, none of them was as famous or as widely read as the Conversations on Chemistry. With each successive edition, Marcet continued to update her book. She wrote to Michael Faraday in 1845, an esteemed writer and a member of the prestigious Royal Society, for detailed and expanded information on his research. He presented his latest breakthroughs to the woman who had first sent him on his chemical journey.  The Scholarship Of Popularization  Jane Marcet was engaged in the work of the knowledge agent via making easier the creation, sharing and use of economic knowledge. She created and maintained social and intellectual connections between and among scientists, elites, literary writers, economists and the larger public. Her work was not a simple act of making knowledge attractive created by others, but rather active work at the limits of various objects of discussion among which knowledge flowed in all directions. Scholars and historians like Thomas Robert Malthus and James Mill have shown their intellectual respect for Marcet's thoughts on political economy. Willie Henderson tried to place Jane within a frame of an educational broker with an argument to change perspective from other's mind for her work from ‚Äúmere capitalist propaganda‚Äù to ‚Äúsophisticated curriculum development‚Äù. For Jane, communication was not a one-way activity, but she conveyed the message and made the public aware of the ideas of professionals. Professionals were provided with new challenges by Marcet, and that Marcet herself played an active role in facilitating that two-way communication. She brought the deep perception of classical economics to bear on social questions, as to counter pose to the ‚Äúprejudices and popular feeling of uninformed benevolence‚Äù. Another thing she did was to bring together the insights of continental thinkers with the writings of the English classical school and thereby challenge those economists to decide the peripheral and central to the story. She also helped to consolidate the ideas of bankers, political actors, and business people to see them as professional political economists through her book and intellectual concepts. She always maintained some distance from people with central dogmas of classical economics, but always kept the conversation going with the masters of the economics. She was tough at accepting criticism and other times keeping her own directions to herself. She was not only teaching wisdom through professionals to the untaught public but also she established the networks which were certainly focused on her direct engagement to transmit the conversation to the people. Marcet's Conversations on Political Economy was published in fourteen editions. It was translated to Dutch, German, Spanish, and twice in French. It had a good impact on young persons, the writers and popularizes like Harriet Martineau, Jean-Baptiste Say, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, on great political economists of the nineteenth century, such as Malthus, JS Mill and many more, and on politicians and bankers whom she had social ties. Jane Marcet was one of the great early 1900s popularizers of political economy. Jane Marcet as a knowledge broker, rather than a popularizer or teacher, makes this information flow central to her work. Historically, she rests between the great female-led continental salons of the eighteenth century and the professional knowledge brokers of the twentieth. In the nineteenth century, Marcet helped to define the field. She explained the focus of knowledge sharing, how she could have such a large impact on so many fields of study. Jane Marcet lived for the rest of her life with her daughter, in Piccadilly, London. She died there on 28 June 1858 leaving a legacy of her works.

It was more portable than larger mortars, and had greater range and firepower than rifle grenades. History The two-inch mortar was one of a number of small mortars brought into service by European nations between the two World Wars. Due to its small size, and for simplicity, the mortar had no forward strut or bipod like larger designs needed. The barrel was held at the correct angle by one soldier while the other loaded and fired the round. The original design had a large base plate and sights for aiming which used spirit levels. As the design matured, the baseplate became smaller and the sights were omitted. Aiming was by eye and relied on the firer's judgment and experience. With such a short barrel the normal firing method, where the bomb was dropped down the tube and a pin in the base of the barrel struck the detonator in the tail of the bomb, would not work, so firing was by a small trigger mechanism at the breech. The bombs were cylindrical with a (perforated) four finned tail. For the HE projectile an impact fuze was fitted in the nose of the bomb. Post war, the two-inch mortar was kept in service to fire smoke and illuminating rounds. It was replaced by the Royal Ordnance 51 mm infantry mortar in the late 1980s.

Nitrogen Balance = Nitrogen intake - Nitrogen loss Sources of nitrogen intake include meat, dairy, eggs, nuts and legumes, and grains and cereals. Examples of nitrogen losses include urine, feces, sweat, hair, and skin. Blood urea nitrogen can be used in estimating nitrogen balance, as can the urea concentration in urine. Nitrogen Balance and Protein Metabolism Nitrogen is a fundamental component of amino acids, which are the molecular building blocks of protein. Therefore, measuring nitrogen inputs and losses can be used to study protein metabolism.World Health Organization Protein and amino acid requirements in human nutrition. WHO Technical Report Series 935 Positive nitrogen balance is associated with periods of growth, hypothyroidism, tissue repair, and pregnancy. This means that the intake of nitrogen into the body is greater than the loss of nitrogen from the body, so there is an increase in the total body pool of protein. Negative nitrogen balance is associated with burns, serious tissue injuries, fevers, hyperthyroidism, wasting diseases, and during periods of fasting. This means that the amount of nitrogen excreted from the body is greater than the amount of nitrogen ingested. A negative nitrogen balance can be used as part of a clinical evaluation of malnutrition. Nitrogen balance is the traditional method of determining dietary protein requirements.Institute of Medicine. Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein and Amino Acids (Macronutrients). The National Academies Press: 2005 Determining dietary protein requirements using nitrogen balance requires that all nitrogen inputs and losses are carefully collected, to ensure that all nitrogen exchange is accounted for.Rand WM, Pellett PL, Young VR (2003). Meta-analysis of nitrogen balance studies for estimating protein requirements in health adults. Am.J.Nutr 77(1):109-127. In order to control nitrogen inputs and losses, nitrogen balance studies usually require participants to eat very specific diets (so total nitrogen intake is known) and stay in the study location for the duration of the study (to collect all nitrogen losses). Because of these conditions, it can be difficult to study the dietary protein requirements of certain populations using the nitrogen balance technique (e.g. children). Dietary nitrogen, from metabolising proteins and other nitrogen-containing compounds, has been linked to changes in genome evolution. Species which primarily obtain energy from metabolising nitrogen-rich compounds use more nitrogen in their DNA than species which primarily break down carbohydrates for their energy. Dietary nitrogen alters codon bias and genome composition in parasitic microorganisms.

Early life Bohle was born in Bradford, England, the son of Hermann Bohle (1876‚Äì1943), a college teacher and engineer who emigrated to England. In 1906 Bohle moved to Cape Town, where his father was appointed to a professorship of electrical engineering, and attended a high school there. Bohle studied political sciences and business administration in Cologne and Berlin and graduated in business management at the Handelshochschule, Berlin, in December 1923. He married Gertrud Bachmann on November 14, 1925. Bohle was employed as branch manager and agent in the import-export business for several enterprises in the Rheinland from 1924 until 1930 and established and thereafter directed a large automotive firm in Hamburg from 1930 to June 1933. Nazism Bohle joined the NSDAP on 1 March 1932 (membership number 999,185) and on 13 September 1933 he joined the SS (membership number 276,915) at the rank of SS-Brigadef√ºhrer. Bohle was promoted SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer on 20 April 1937 and SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 21 June 1943. In early 1932 he became adjutant to Hans Nieland, the leader of the Foreign Organisation of the NSDAP (NSDAP Auslands-Organisation; NSDAP/AO), responsible for South and South-West Africa and later North America. This organisational unit was founded on 1 May 1931 in Hamburg and \\"Reich Organisation Leader\\" Gregor Strasser had appointed Nieland as the chief. Nieland resigned from office on 8 May 1933 (because he had become head of the Hamburg police and later a member of the Hamburg provincial government). Bohle was charged with the leadership of the party Department for Germans Abroad (Abteilung f√ºr Deutsche im Ausland) which then reported to Deputy-F√ºhrer Rudolf Hess. However, on 17 February 1934 the office was redesignated Auslands-Organisation der NSDAP and Bohle was raised to the rank of Gauleiter. Bohle's father Hermann was NSDAP/AO Landesgruppenleiter (Leader of the National Committee) in the Union of South Africa from 1932 until 1934 and he was president of the Berlin-based Deutsch-S√ºdafrikanischen Gesellschaft (German South-African Society). From 12 November 1933 till the end of Nazi Germany, Bohle was a member of the Reichstag for the constituency \\"W√ºrttemberg\\" and from December 1937 to May 1945 he was a State Secretary in the Foreign Office. The influence of the Foreign Office was greatly exaggerated to the extent that Bohle was mentioned in the foreign press as a likely successor to Joachim von Ribbentrop.McKale, Donald M. (1977). The Swastika Outside Germany. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press. p. 118. . He was also a confidant and on the staff of Rudolf Hess, the Deputy F√ºhrer until Hess' failed peace mission to England in May 1941. Trial and conviction Bohle surrendered to US forces on 23 May 1945 at Falkenau and was interned with other high ranking Nazi officials. Bohle was tried as a defendant in the \\"Ministries Trial\\" (\\"Wilhelmstra√üen-Proze√ü\\"), one of the Nuremberg follow-up trials. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on 11 April 1949. However, he was pardoned by U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy on 21 December 1949. Subsequent to his release, he worked as a merchant in Hamburg. He also advocated for the reformation of an organization for the development of German South-African interstate commerce. He died in D√ºsseldorf.

Common back braces include: * Rigid (Hard) braces : These braces are form-fitting plastic molds that restrict motion by as much as 50%; and * Soft braces : Elastic braces that limit forward motion of the spine and assist in setting spinal fusions or supporting the spine during occasions of stress (for example, employment requiring the lifting of heavy loads). Bracing for scoliosis  Back braces are also commonly prescribed to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, as they may stop the progression of spinal curvature in a growing child/adolescent. As of 2016, the Scientific Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) recommends bracing \\"is important, but does not have to be applied to all patients with this specific need\\" for idiopathic scoliosis during growth. Multiple studies have provided strong evidence of bracing as an effective conservative treatment for children and adolescents and may also help decrease the amount of curvature in the spine; with results lasting several decades following the end of treatment and brace weaning. A variety of brace styles are available; the Boston brace is the most commonly used brace for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). It is important to note that in- brace correction has been found to be directly related with treatment success, suggesting in-brace correction should be maximized; thus individualized custom braces which maximize in-brace correction show better results. Other designs include the Milwaukee brace, the Charleston bending brace, the Peak Scoliosis Bracing System, and the SpineCor (a soft brace) in the United States, Canada and Europe. In Europe, however, the SPoRT and Cheneau and Crass Cheneau braces are also used. There has been considerable research and information published in reputable journals on back braces for scoliosis. Issues like patient compliance with treatment, psycho-social impact of brace use, and exercise with bracing have been looked at. Quality of Life research has been attempted, but is difficult due to a current lack of instruments. Bracing is the primary treatment for AIS in curves that are considered to be moderate in their severity and are likely due to progress (determined by curve pattern/type and the patient's structural maturity). One large issue in bracing for scoliosis is patient compliance, as mentioned above. Compliance is often impacted by the other above-mentioned factors (psycho-social comfort, exercise), but there are others also, including ability to eat and move, pain, and physical deformation. Back braces, especially the Boston brace, puts a great deal of pressure on the abdomen and can make digestion uncomfortable. Scoliosis braces, like those used for correcting post-operatively and for fractures, inhibit motion to a large extent, though percentages are difficult to find. Patients frequently complain about the inability to tie their own shoes, sit on the floor, etc. Bracing is also painful, though the body can adapt to tolerate the pain. Braces can also deform the patient's existing bone structures, most notably the hips, though there have been complaints about rib cage deformities as well. =Boston brace= A Boston brace is a form of thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO). It is the most commonly used brace in the United States. It is a symmetrical brace. It corrects curvature by pushing with small pads placed against the ribs, which are also used for rotational correction (here it tends to be slightly less successful, however). These pads are usually placed in the back corners of the brace so that the body is thrust forward against the brace's front, which acts to hold the body upright. The brace opens to the back, and usually runs from just above a chair's seat (when a person is seated) to around shoulder-blade height. Because of this, it is not particularly useful in correcting very high curves. It also does not correct hip misalignment, as it uses the hips as a base point. This brace is typically worn 20‚Äì23 hours a day. =Charleston bending brace= This brace was designed with the idea that compliance would increase if the brace were worn only at night. It is asymmetrical. The brace fights against the body's curve by over-correcting. It grips the hips much like the Boston, and rises to approximately the same height, but pushes the patient's body to the side. It is used in single, thoracolumbar curves in patients 12‚Äì14 years of age (before structural maturity) who have flexible curves in the range of 25‚Äì35 Cobb degrees. =Ch√™neau-Gensingen Brace (CGB)= This brace is designed for use with the Schroth physical therapy method. It utilizes large, sweeping pads to push the body against its curve and into blown out spaces. The Schroth theory holds that the deformity can be corrected through retraining muscles and nerves to learn what a straight spine feels like, and breathing deeply into areas crushed by the curvature to help gain flexibility and to expand. The brace helps patients to keep doing their exercises throughout the day. This brace is asymmetrical, and is used for patients of all degrees of severity and maturity. It is often worn 20‚Äì23 hours a day. The brace principally contracts to allow for lateral and longditutal rotation and movement. =Crass Cheneau Brace= The new dynamic asymmetric brace Crass Cheneau is made of special hypoallergenic polypropylene, 2 to 3 mm. of thickness, semi-transparent when applied on the patient's body. Laser scanner technique or the use of plaster tape at lordosis position are required to estimate the size of the patient's body. Regarding the mechanic principles of the brace, special attention was paid to the functional importance of some vertebras that play predominant role for the maintenance of standing position (according to Delmas). Its use ranges between 12 and 16 hours/day. Its effectiveness lies to the arrays surrounding pressures to the digital preform and the cuneiform adhesions on the structure of one and only typical vertebra at the time, with their application during the construction of the brace. The arrays surrounding pressures on a deformed spine minimize the resistance of the spine at the deformed area (hump of dynamic type) as well as axial compression forces (Delmas index), disarm the mechanism of turn - side bend at the thoracic part (which accompanies the deformation of Cobb's angle in idiopathic scoliosis), as well as the mechanical resistance, limiting the amplitude of movements of the thoracic spine, as well as of the side bend (Krassa, 2006). =Flexpine brace= A Flexpine brace is a hard-and-soft type of brace for use by non-surgical scoliosis patients. It is of 4mm thickness and uses foldable urethane/plastic as its frame so that the wearer can still move his/her body. It is a customized product made of 3D printing material, with an elastic band to push the curved part of the spine. =Milwaukee brace= The Milwaukee brace was a very common brace towards the earlier part of the twentieth century in the United States. It is a largely symmetrical brace. The brace is made with a harness-like hip area and metal strips rising to the chin, where a collar is. Between the hips and chin, there are corrective thrusts given with large pads. There is little rotational correction. Today this brace is generally used for very high thoracic curves that are severe and out of range of the Boston. This brace is typically worn 20‚Äì23 hours a day. =Silicon Valley Brace= This brace is similar to that of the Rigo-Cheneau or other Cheneau type braces in that it incorporates an individualized correction designed based on the individual's scoliosis curve pattern as determined by x-ray or MRI imaging. The brace is designed in three dimensions utilizing CAD software similar to other modern braces and is manufactured out of thermoplastic allowing for further modifications based on the individual's growth over time. Based on current scientific literature, this asymmetric brace type is designed to both prevent progression as well as reduce the curve as in-brace correction correlates to treatment outcome. This brace type is typically worn upwards of 18+ hours a day in conjunction with other conservative treatment options including physiotherapy scoliosis-specific exercises such as Schroth. =SpineCor brace= The brace has a pelvic unit from which strong elastic bands wrap around the body, pulling against curves, rotations, and imbalances. It is most successful when the patient has relatively small and simple curvatures, is structurally young, and compliant‚Äîit is usually worn 20 hours a day. The patient is not to have it off for more than two hours at a time. While it is expected that patients can participate in activities as strenuous as competitive gymnastics while in brace, it also pulls down against shoulder misalignments which compresses the spine. SpineCor is marketed as a more comfortable, less restricted scoliosis brace option for adults. This brace was invented in Montr√©al, Canada and is used across the country as well as being widely used in other countries. =Sport brace= SPoRT stands for \\"Symmetric, Patient-oriented, Rigid, Three-Dimensional active,\\" which it intends to be. The brace is symmetrical, built with a plastic frame reinforced with aluminum rods. The brace corrects hip misalignments through padding. Large, sweeping, thick pads push the spine to a corrected position. To prevent overcorrection, however, the brace also has \\"stop\\" pads holding the spine from moving too far in the other direction. The brace runs from just above the chair to T3 in many instances‚Äîit is successful at correcting high thoracic curves. In front, it goes around the patient's breast and up, even to pushing against the collar bone. Though it sounds restricting, it has been tested for comfort while participating in athletics. The theory holds that the support that the brace gives will help the patient's body learn to work as though it had no curve muscularly. Then the muscles would be able to support the spine, preventing further collapse. This brace is used for all curve patterns and types, even ones considered past brace treatment by other schools. The brace is typically worn 22 hours a day, and often coupled with a physical therapy program. Bracing for other purposes =Thoracolumbosacral orthosis= A thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO), is a two-piece plastic brace supporting the spine from the thoracic vertebrae of the chest, to the base of the spine at the sacrum. The rigid lumbar or TLSO (Thoraco ‚Äì Lumbo ‚Äì Sacral ‚Äì Orthosis) is used, when regardless of surgical correction, or in some cases in place of surgical correction, spinal stability has not been fully achieved. In some cases of spinal fractures these can be managed without surgery using such a TLSO brace but this is only in the case where the type of fracture has its own inherent stability. The brace provides additional immobilization, which should safely allow condition or fracture to heal with a minimal risk of further injury. Under these circumstances, this brace must be worn for approximately several months whenever the patient is out of bed. In other cases the doctor or orthotist may prescribe such a brace to deal post-surgery immobilization, or for the longer term treatment of conditions of a more progressive nature, such as correction of scoliosis in the growing adolescent. These are described briefly below: After having undergoing complex spinal surgeries, this is especially the fusion procedures, a brace will probably be necessary. There are a number of factors determining the need for brace wear include: - the severity of any instability, the lack of good bone quality, the location of the surgery, or the nature of the deformity. In these situations, a rigid brace may be needed. Once again, the brace is specifically for immobilization and support. It should be worn whenever the patient is out of bed for more than 10 minutes. This brace will be worn for approximately several months after surgery but your doctor or surgeon will let the patient know if such a brace is necessary. Rigid braces are also used for the correction of scoliosis in the growing children and adolescents. These braces are very specific in nature and are used until the adolescent has finished growing (usually to about 16 years of age). Use of a brace does not always control the scoliosis curvature. Indeed, the curvature in very aggressive scoliosis can continue to progress despite bracing. Typically in such circumstances, surgery to correct the scoliosis could eventually be necessary despite many years of bracing. However, the brace may replace the need for surgery and this is always preferred if possible. The brace for scoliosis is a rigid plastic brace and must be worn a minimum of 18 out of 24 hours per day. Ongoing brace adjustments will needed and are necessary to maximize the scoliosis correction. If you are required to wear a brace to treat ongoing adolescent scoliosis, it will be necessary to visit the clinic or doctor or orthotist every few months. In a few circumstances, very restrictive braces that utilize thigh cuff extensions to control the pelvis are sometimes needed and this type of brace is worn to treat a very specific situation, such as a patient who has undergone pelvic fusion where the bone quality is at risk or questionable. The brace comes in a variety of forms and can be used for treating severe or unstable compression fractures as well as other injuries and conditions. =Jewett brace= A Jewett brace is a hyperextension brace that prevents the patient from bending forward too much. It is often used to facilitate healing of an anterior wedge compression fracture involving the T10 to L3 vertebrae. =Corset brace= A corset brace is similar to a traditional corset. It typically has metal or plastic stays to limit forward movement. It puts pressure over the belly to take pressure off of the spine and promote healing. =Posture Brace / Posture Corrector= A posture brace or a posture corrector is to help people improve their postures and maintain their bodies in a straight and upright position. Posture corrector realign body to its original position by straightening from ankle to knee, pelvis, and shoulders to ear.

King Menelik II of Shewa, later the Emperor of Ethiopia, and Count Pietro Antonelli of Italy, on 2 May 1889, established the treaty after the Italian occupation of Eritrea. It was signed in the small Ethiopian town of Wuchale, from which the treaty got its name. The purpose of the treaty was to promote friendship and trade among the two countries. It was a treaty to maintain a positive long lasting relationship between the two empires.Ayele, Negussie. \\"Adwa 1896: Who was Civilized & Who was Savage?\\" Ethiopian Review, vol. 7, no. 2, 30 April 1997, pp. 50. . The treaty has twenty articles written in two languages, Amharic and Italian. There were slight differences between the Italian and the Amharic version of the treaty which created miscommunications between the two countries. Specifically, Article 17 of the treaty was translated differently between the two versions. This difference in translation created disagreement and resulted in the treaty being denounced by Menelik II in 1893. When Menelik II denounced the treaty, Italy attempted to forcefully impose protectorate status over Ethiopia in the First Italo-Ethiopian War, which ended with Italy's defeat at the Battle of Adwa and the Treaty of Addis Ababa.  Background  Around the time the treaty was signed, European colonization was highly expanding in Africa. Vast territories of Eritrea and Somalia, Ethiopian bordering countries, were under the occupation of Italy. Italy desired to expand its territories by colonizing Ethiopia. Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia was highly resistant to this and agreed to establish a treaty instead. He yielded some territories of Ethiopia to Italy in return for assurance of Ethiopia's independence as well as financial and military assistance from Italy.  Articles  Article one focuses on establishing a peaceful relationship between the two countries. It states that there shall be a peace between the King of Ethiopia and the King of Italy as well as their successors and their peoples. The second article deals with forming a diplomatic relationship between the two countries. It mentions that Ethiopia and Italy shall appoint agents in the other country's consular office. Article three creates permanent boundary lines between regions of Eritrea that are under Italy's control and regions of Ethiopia. It states which regions are under the control of which empire and marks the territory limit of each empire. Article four, five, and six focus on specific regions that are located in the Italian regional zone; The monastery of Debra Bizen and Massawa, Eritrea. Article four states that the monastery of Debra Bizen shall remain under the control of the Ethiopian government but cannot be used for military purposes and Article five states that Ethiopia has to pay an eight percent port duty to import or export goods through Massawa. Article six states that the Emperor of Ethiopia can transport army from and through Massawa free of charges. Article seven declares that travel and trade exchanges between the two countries are allowed. Article eight and nine focus on the rights people from Ethiopia's territories have while they are present in Italy's territories and vice versa. Article eight says the people in the Ethiopian and Italian territories exercise the same right while present in each other's territories and article nine states that these people have the freedom to exercise their religion at the territories they are present at. Article ten deals with disputes between residents of Ethiopian and Italian territories and states these disputes are to be resolved by delegates from both territories. Article eleven mentions that if an Ethiopian resident dies in an Italian territory and vice versa, his/her properties will be given to the territory he/she belongs to. Article twelve and thirteen are regarding crimes. Article twelve states that when people commit crime, they shall be judged in their own territory despite where they commit the crime whereas article thirteen mentions that the kings of both empires are obliged to extradite people with criminal records who are sought by the government. According to article fourteen, the king of Ethiopia has the right to take any measures to fight slavery and slave trading in his territory. Menelik II opposed slavery and this article was an assurance that slavery will not be practiced in Ethiopian regions. Article fifteen validated the treaty in all territories of Ethiopia. Article sixteen sets rules and restrictions regarding future changes to the treaty. It states that this treaty can be amended after five years with a year notice before any change and articles regarding boundaries may not be amended. Article seventeen is written differently in the Ethiopian and Italian version of the treaty and is addressed in details below. Article eighteen states that the king of Ethiopia shall give preference to Italian nationalists if he has to choose to offer a privilege between a third state and Italy. Article nineteen mentions that the treaty shall be written in both languages and both versions shall present the same information. Article twenty states that this treaty shall be approved.  Disputes  The misunderstanding, according to the Italians, was due to the mistranslation of a verb, which formed a permissive clause in Amharic and a mandatory one in Italian. In the Amharic version of the treaty, Article 17 states that ‚ÄúHis Majesty the King of Kings of Ethiopia can use the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy for all treatments that did business with other powers or governments.‚Äù According to this version, the Emperor of Ethiopia is granted a choice and is not mandated to use the Italian government to conduct foreign relations. The Italian version stated that Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities, in effect making Ethiopia an Italian protectorate, while the Amharic version gave Ethiopia considerable autonomy, with the option of communicating with third powers through the Italians.Discussions include Chris Prouty, Empress Taytu and Menilek II (Trenton, NJ: The Red Sea Press, 1986), pp. 70-99; Marcus G. Harold, The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913 (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1995), pp. 111‚Äì134; and Hatem Elliesie, Amharisch als diplomatische Sprache im V√∂lkervertragsrecht, Aethiopica (International Journal of Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies), 11, (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2008), pp. 235-244. Menelik II was not in favor of this and rejected protection from Italy. Unable to resolve this disagreement, the treaty was denounced by Menelik II and the Battle of Adwa followed. The battle took place in Adwa and ended after two days with Ethiopia's victory, guaranteeing its independence.

The three- CD retrospective set was compiled with Thompson's co-operation and consent. Thompson has often been reluctant to look backwards at his career and dig through the archives, but he took the pragmatic view that if somebody wants to assemble a set of this nature they'll do it anyway and so he might as well collaborate with them if possible. He had right of veto over the selections and recorded one track (\\"Poor Wee Jockey Clark\\") especially for the project. About a third of the selections are live, and five had never been released on any official Thompson release. Some of the material was donated by collectors of Thompson recordings. The set extends chronologically from 1969, when Thompson was a member of Fairport Convention, through to 1992. However, it is not sequenced in chronological order. Notable inclusions are * A live version of \\"Can't Win\\" with an extended guitar solo * \\"From Galway to Graceland\\", a Thompson song that had never made it onto a commercial Thompson release * A live version of \\"A Heart Needs A Home\\" from 1975 * Solo, live versions of \\"Jennie\\" and \\"Devonside\\" * An unreleased recording, thought to have been lost, of \\"A Sailor's Life\\" by Fairport Convention * Three tracks from the unreleased, Gerry Rafferty-produced version of the Shoot Out the Lights album The set includes a booklet with details of each recording, some rare photographs and essays by Greil Marcus and Leslie Berman.

The topography of the terrain is either flat or sloped. The surface of these bugyals is covered with natural green grass and seasonal flowers. They are used by tribal herdsmen to graze their cattle. During the winter season the alpine meadows remain snow-covered. During summer months, the Bugyals present a riot of beautiful flowers and grass. As bugyals constitute very fragile ecosystems, particular attention needs to be given for their conservation. Some of the notable bugyals are: Auli near Joshimath, Garsi, Kwanri, Bedni, Panwali and Kush Kalyan, Dayara, Bagji Bugyal and Munsiyari. Auli Bugyal View of Auli Bugyal Auli Bugyal during winter Bedni Bugyal Auli Bugyal in Chamoli district, a highland pasture in the Garhwal Himalaya is known as the \\"Heaven Terrace\\". It lies in an elevation range of with ski slopes located at an elevation of . On either side of the bugyal there are coniferous, oak and deodar forests which limits the wind velocity to acceptable for skiing. It is in the backdrop of Nanda Devi (), Kamet (), Mana Peak (), Dunagiri (), Hathi Parbat (), Bethantoli () and Ghora Parbat peaks of the Himalayas. The trek to Auli passes through lush vegetation of apple orchards and oak forest. The ski slopes are said to better than those at Gulmarg. During the winter months (January to March) the slopes are covered with a mantle of snow which is spread over a width of , and has a thickness . It is a skiing resort with modern skiing equipment. It is the venue of skiing festivities and the annual national championship of skiing held during February and March. It is away from Joshimath. A ski-lift system exists here which is believed to be the longest cable car () from Joshimath to the top most station at Gorson. It is the only location where artificial snow making system is provided to ensure that snow is present on the slopes for skiing. There are also two snow beaters which are used to make the snow slopes fit for skiing. As it is a winter sports centre and Vayudoot two airports have been planned in the region. R. V. Vernede, the British Deputy High Commissioner of the district during the British Raj had built a hut known as ‚ÄúVernede‚Äù here at an elevation of . It is under the control of the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Limited, which also provides for all skiing gear at site. Auli Bugyal is a very large alpine meadow which has expanse of grass land that covers several hundred acres of land, towards the sides of a wide ridge; Bedni Bugyal lies beyond this ridge. The meadows have vegetation of anemones, Potentilla, lousewort, wild Salvia and thistles. Grazing by cattle and sheep is extensive. There are many trails that pass through the meadows. Bedni Bugyal Bedini Kund in Bedni Bugyal Meadows of the Bedni Bugyal in Chamoil district, are at an elevation of . Alpine camps are established here for the pilgrims to visit the Rup Kund ('Kund' meaning \\"lake\\"), which is covered with snow for 10 months in a year. From this camp to its west, views of the Himalayan peaks of the Gangotri, the Trishul and the Nanda Ghunti provide a scenic backdrop. This budyal also has a small lake called Bedini Kund. It is an artificial lake built with a concrete dyke by reclaiming a marshy wetland. There are two shrines here, one a small temple of Nanda Devi and the other a shrine for Latu. The temple is built with stones without using any mortar but moss growth is seen in the crevices. The Nanda Devi temple has two small carved stone images of the goddess and a pure white conch shell. Bedni and Rup Kund are approached from Karnaprayag. Medicinal herbs are found here.

It has also been planned as a skiing resort. It is approached from Uttarkashi, up to village Raithal or village Barsu by road and further by trekking. There is another relatively new, short (only 5.5 Kms) and very convenient trek route from Village Nateen (near Raithal), and this route is not only short but is also full of amazing views. Other Bugyals On the Gangotri-Kedarnath trekking route the notable bugyals are Panwali () and Kush- Kalyani. Gorson Bugyal () is near Joshimath. In the alpine meadows of Uttarakhand other bugyals are Rajrambha, Marjhali, Rajthor, Darmithor, Bishanthor, Galpari, Sankalpa, Yangchari, Moth Bugyal and Shibu Gwar.jerai bugyal in almora district. Conservation issues Bugyal is a fragile ecosystem and it is essential to maintain a balance between ecology and environment. In this context a court case was filed by the public objecting to erection of the prefab houses and by introducing non-biodegradable matter in the upper meadows of the bugyals by the tourism departments. It was averred that the peace and tranquility of the bugyals was getting affected. The court had ordered that the polluter must pay for the damage to environment based on absolute liability principle, which covered payment of damages to the affected people but also to compensate for all costs for restoration of the degraded environments.

He previously served from 1996 to 2018 in the New Jersey General Assembly, where he represented the 15th Legislative District. He also served as the prosecutor for Lawrence Township. He defeated businessman Paul Perez to become Mayor of Trenton in 2018, earning 52 percent of the vote in a runoff election on June 12 since no candidate won the 50 percent threshold or more in the May 8 election. Early life Gusciora was born in Passaic, New Jersey and raised in Jamesburg, where he attended public schools and graduated from Jamesburg High School in 1978. Gusciora's father, Walter, worked at the New Jersey Department of Health in Trenton and the City was an integral part of his childhood. As a teenager, Gusciora worked for his family's company, Aardvark Pest Control, and in his free time, he spent time visiting Trenton's museums and famous restaurants. He received a B.A. from The Catholic University of America (CUA) in Politics/International Relations and worked his way through college by working at the Library of Congress. After graduation, he worked on Capitol Hill in the congressional offices of U.S. Representatives Andy Ireland (D-FL) and the late Mike Synar (D-OK). Gusciora was awarded a J.D. in 1988 from the Seton Hall University School of Law. Legislative career In 1995, Gusciora beat Joseph Constance, a former Mercer County Freeholder and deputy police chief of Trenton Police Department, who received support from the National Rifle Association and campaigned against New Jersey's teachers' union. At the time, Republicans outnumbered Democrats 53 to 27 in the New Jersey State Legislature, and Constance received the momentum of the State's shift towards moderate Republicanism under popular Governor Christine Todd Whitman. Gusciora's victory maintained New Jersey's 15th Legislative District as a Democratic stronghold. Gusciora has been the Deputy Majority Leader since 2008, and was the Assembly's Assistant Minority Leader from 1998-2001. He currently serves as Chairman of the Assembly Regulatory Oversight, Federal Relations, and Reform Committee, and is a member of the Assembly Financial Institutions and Insurance and Assembly Labor Committees.Assemblyman Gusciora's legislative web page, New Jersey Legislature. Accessed December 28, 2016. He is a former Chairman of the Environment and Solid Waste Committee. Gusciora authored the \\"Paramount Safety\\" Law that changed the legal standard in child custody cases to protect the health and well being of the child when abuse has occurred. He is the author of a law that streamlines services for people with developmental disabilities through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education. He is also the original prime sponsor of legislation that would allow patients to sue HMOs for malpractice and the \\"Senior Gold Prescription Discount Act,\\" which expanded the state‚Äôs prescription drug program for seniors. =2011 redistricting= The redistricting plan adopted following the 2010 U.S. Census moved Gusciora's hometown of Princeton Borough out of the 15th district and into the heavily- Republican 16th. Gusciora immediately announced that he would put his Princeton home on the market and move to Trenton, some away. Trenton was the largest city in the old 15th district and remained the largest city in the newly configured 15th district. =2014‚Äì2015 Legislative session= In the 2014-2015 legislative session, Gusciora sponsored fourteen bills and co- sponsored thirty-four bills. Gusciora co-sponsored legislation creating the option to make a voluntary contribution for the support of local libraries on gross income tax returns, establishing a program to provide assistance to qualified veterans in in-patient and out-patient treatment programs to travel to in-state medical counseling, and requiring school bus drivers and school bus aides to attend a training program on interacting with students with special needs. Similarly, during this legislative session, Gusciora co- sponsored several key criminal justice reform bills: \\"The Opportunity to Compete Act\\" establishing certain employment rights for persons with a criminal record, requiring the New Jersey Department of Corrections to make reports containing information concerning treatment and reentry initiative participation, extending \\"Overdose Prevention Act\\" immunity provisions to certain professionals and professional entities, and permits needle exchange programs to obtain standing order for opioid antidotes. =2016‚Äì2017 Legislative session= In the 2016-2017 legislative session, Gusciora sponsored twenty-eight bills and co-sponsored thirty-nine bills for a total of sixty-seven bills which were signed into law. Gusciora sponsored legislation to authorize medical marijuana for qualifying patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, require that certain inmates with detainers be provided access to drug treatment programs, and exempt homeless individuals from paying fees for non-driver identification cards. Gusciora co-sponsored \\"New Jersey Housing Assistance for Veterans Act,\\" a pilot program to assist veterans with housing modification and rehabilitation as well as a bill to permit small, women-owned, or minority-owned businesses located in designated regional centers or planning areas to qualify for loans from the New Jersey Economic Development Agency (EDA) as if located in a designated urban center. Role as mayor =Youth Initiatives= On September 13, 2018, the Mayor's Office announced that the City's initiative \\"Trenton Production and Knowledge Innovation Campus\\" (TPKIC) was awarded the Innovative Challenge grant by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. The City partnered with Princeton University, Rider University, The College of New Jersey, Thomas Edison State University, and Mercer County Community College to build the vision behind the application, which seeks to support start-up businesses, local creators, students and faculty at partner colleges and universities, and Trenton Public Schools students and recent graduates. On January 16, 2020, Gusciora announced the launch of the Trenton Youth \\"WIN\\" App, a mobile application, which is designed to connect City youth with access to essential services. The City of Trenton, in conjunction with the County of Mercer and our Continuum of Care partners, accepted the pledge to prevent and end youth homelessness in 2020. As part of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, the City of Trenton has developed community partnerships to promote, educate, and commit to eliminating homelessness within the Capital City. The WIN application has been identified as a crucial way to establish channels of communication with youth who may feel embarrassed when going to a governmental agency. Mayor Reed Gusciora stated ‚ÄúThe success of this application will not be measured by our ideas, but by our impact. Community stakeholders have been key supporters and we will need the help of all community partners in promoting this.‚Äù =Housing and Economic Development= Within the first 6 months of holding office, Gusciora reported that his administration had received $17 million in new public and private grant funding and that there were pursuing $19 million in grants and aid. Gusciora also stated that $6 million in Community Development Block Grants (from 2011-2018), from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, was in the process of being unfrozen. On January 21, 2020, Gusciora stated that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had decided to release funds to the Capital City because of Gusciora's re-hiring of key positions needed for the appropriate management of federal funds. While most of the funding was used to pay back the City for past projects, the rest will go into public facility renovations and improvements for senior centers. In September 2019, Gusciora touted the results of Trenton's monthly public property auction as the largest and most successful in the City's history. On that day alone, 86 City-owned properties, valued at a collective $3.3 million, were auctioned off, and went back on the tax rolls. Around the same time, Gusciora and the Trenton Housing Authority (THA) won $1.3 million in Choice Neighborhood Planning and Action Grant funds, distributed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop a comprehensive neighborhood transformation plan for Donnelly Homes. In December 2019, Ordinance 19-80 and 19-79, legislation that Gusciora designed and advocated for was passed by the City Council. The legislation authorized sidewalk caf√©s (without City approval) and the distribution of alcohol for brunch on Sunday mornings earlier (earlier than neighboring municipalities). =Public Safety= On October 15, 2019, Gusciora announced that the City had been awarded $85,000 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 2019 Port Security Grant Program. The funds subsidized the purchase of 3 watercraft with engines, dive rescue equipment, and additional supplies. =Health and Human Services= In November 2019, Gusciora shared that the City of Trenton's Department of Health had won a $95,000 grant \\"Strengthening Local Public Health Capacity Grant Operations\\" from the New Jersey Department of Health. The funds are being utilized to supplement Gusciora's efforts to reduce the number of residents affected by vaccine-preventable illnesses. =Veteran's Issues= In November 2019, Gusciora collaborated with veteran Willie Smith and a student leader at Trenton Central High School to win Governor Murphy's \\"We Value our Veterans Community Award\\" for City initiatives to help City veterans access medical care, find employment, and locate permanent housing. =COVID-19 Response= Gusciora's published a document \\"COVID-19: Trenton Testing Status Report,\\" which outlined steps that his administration had taken to reduce the fatality rate of COVID-19 in the Capital City. The report was the first of its kind written by a municipality in New Jersey and published publicly. At the time of the report, the City's fatality rate of those infected with COVID-19 was 2.8% whilst the State of New Jersey's fatality rate was 7.4%. Gusciora outlined a set of proactive steps that the City had taken to increase the amount of testing, secure personal protective equipment, and coordinate with other governmental agencies.https://www.trentonnj.org/DocumentCenter/View/4947/COVID-19-Trenton- Testing-Status-Report- One of Gusciora's policies, created a business loan program for City small businesses, who could apply for up to $20,000 in emergency loans. The Trenton Emergency Loan Program utilized existing funds from the City's Urban Enterprise Zone and exceeded State and County programs set up to assist businesses with their economic recovery. =Executive Leadership= In July 2019, Gusciora announced that he had been selected as one of 40 mayors to participate in the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative, which is an initiative founded by Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg Philanthropies and three-term mayor of New York City as well as Harvard University. The mission of the program is to inspire and strengthen city leaders as well as equip them with the tools to lead high-performing and innovative cities. Politics Gusciora is a supporter of gay rights and same-sex marriage.Abdur-Rahman, Sulaiman. \\"Gay New Jersey Assemblyman Reed Gusciora's message to LGBT youths: It gets better\\", The Trentonian, October 24, 2010.

On Governor Chris Christie's opposition to a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in the state, Gusciora stated \\"Govs. Lester Maddox and George Wallace would have found allies in Chris Christie over efforts by the Justice Department to end segregation in the South\\", and \\"[Christie] would have been happy to have a referendum on civil rights rather than fighting and dying in the streets of the South.\\" Christie responded, \\"What I said was I‚Äôm sure that civil rights advocates would have liked to have this as another option but it was not available to them, yet you have numbnuts like Reed Gusciora who put out a statement comparing me to George Wallace and Lester Maddox.\\" The two later amended their differences.

Plot summary The protagonist (Larry) is burdened with deep guilt and regret after discovering that his estranged sister has committed suicide. He recounts one fateful day, long ago, when the two were children playing in their family's barn. With their parents not home, they played a forbidden game where they would take turns climbing to the top of a very tall ladder in their barn, and leap off into a huge haystack. The ladder was already old and unsafe but that was part of the thrill. On his last turn, Larry realised that the ladder was on the point of letting go. By the time he landed in the hay, Kitty was already climbing up again. The ladder broke and left her clinging to the last rung. Larry desperately piled hay below her. When Kitty couldn't hang on any longer, he told her to let go, and she did. The hay broke Kitty's fall and saved her life, leaving her with only a broken ankle. Larry was astonished when Kitty told him that she hadn't looked down before letting go, so she didn't know about the hay. She simply trusted him to save her. Larry tells of how his sister grew up into a striking beauty. She was supposed to attend business college but, in the summer after graduation, she won a beauty pageant and ended up marrying one of the judges. After the marriage failed, Kitty moved to Los Angeles, landing some roles in B-movies and some glamour modeling shoots, and married again, only to have this marriage fail as well. As she aged, Kitty ended up working as a call girl. Larry was too wrapped up in his own affairs to come to her aid. Part of the problem was refusing to acknowledge she had grown up: \\"To me, my sister was a girl with pigtails, still without breasts.\\" Larry now reminds himself of his failure to realize the importance of family by preserving a newspaper article of his sister's suicide; \\"Call Girl Swan Dives to her Death\\", and the final letter she sent to him two weeks before she died, which said \\"I've been thinking about it a lot lately... and what I've decided is that it would have been better for me if that last rung had broken before you could put the hay down\\". Larry states that those words would have been enough to make him come running. Unfortunately, he had neglected to tell his sister he'd moved, and the letter was not forwarded in time. Connections to other books Larry relates that the farm where he and his sister grew up was in Hemingford Home, Nebraska. This is the town that Mother Abagail lives in during The Stand. It is also the town next door to Gatlin, the location of \\"Children of the Corn\\", and appears in It to introduce Ben Hanscom. It is mentioned in Cell. \\"1922\\" from Full Dark, No Stars also takes place in Hemingford Home.

Marks is the longest-serving mayor in Tallahassee's history. He was elected to three consecutive terms as the city's Mayor, spanning nearly twelve years. He won a third term in 2010, but declined to seek re-election for a fourth term in 2014. He was succeeded by Andrew Gillum on November 21, 2014. Marks was Tallahassee's fifth African-American mayor but the first to be elected. Biography Marks' great-grandfather, Oliver Lewis Coleman, founded Coleman College, a now defunct historically black college in Gibsland, Louisiana, in 1887. Coleman College closed in 1952. He received his B.S. in 1969 from the Florida State University School of Business and his Juris Doctor in 1972 from the Florida State University College of Law. He and his wife, Jane, have a son, John Marks IV (born c. 1976). Career Marks served eight years on the Florida Public Service Commission Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) and spent the last two as its chairman, after being appointed in 1979 by Governor Bob Graham. He served on the FPSC during the divestiture of AT&T; and was instrumental in the implementation of the Federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA). Before being appointed, he served as an Administrative Law Judge on the Commission. He is a partner in the Tallahassee -based Marks & Marks law firm. He has been an adjunct professor at FSU's College of Law, teaching utility regulatory law and a faculty member of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' National Association of Regulatory Commissioners utility rate school. Mayor of Tallahassee On January 4, 2003, Marks' predecessor, then- Tallahassee Mayor Scott Maddox, was elected Chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. Marks announced that he would remain Mayor of Tallahassee until late February 2003, when a special mayor election would be held to choose his successor. Marks, a former state public service commissioner, entered the 2003 race for Mayor to succeed Maddox. On February 4, 2003, Marks placed first in the mayoral election with 43% against three other candidates. His closest opponent, John Paul Bailey, a Republican Tallahassee City Commissioner and former police officer, placed second with 27% of the vote. City Commissioner Steve Meisburg placed third with 26%, while two other candidates, Tony Davis and Richard Junnier, each received 2% of the vote. Since no candidate garnered more than 50% in the initial election, a runoff election between Marks and Republican John Paul Bailey was held on February 25, 2003. Marks defeated Bailey by a 2-to-1 margin in the runoff. Marks received 19,118 votes (67.10%), while John Paul Bailey garnered 9,374 votes (32.90%).

Surname history  The Bossong family is of Frankish origin.Sketch of the Bossong Family and it's Arms by W.E. Hennessee This is neither Teutonic nor French, but a separate race, almost extinct today. When William the Conqueror of Normandy invaded England in 1066, early variations of the name were in his invading army. For their services in the conquest of England, they were awarded large estates in County Norfolk where the family may still be found. 300px They were likely Huguenots or Walloons as records indicate they fled Catholic persecutions during the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1572 the family suffered the persecutions of many families and refused to accept the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. To avoid this persecution, many families left the domains of the French King and fled to County Kent England and Holland. Again in the latter part of the 17th century, those who remained in France suffered persecution and fled. Genealogical researcher Heinrich Herzog notes that the family name can be found in the Habsburgs Low Countries.A Contribution to the History of the Lambrecht Line of the Botzon Family by Heinrich Herzog During the Thirty Years' War, the Lambrecht Wallonians fled in 1621 from approaching Spanish soldiers, for example, to Bergzabern, a small town which belonged to the neutral principality Pfalz- Zweibr√ºcken. In 1635, they escaped again from imperial troops choosing Annweiler and Bischweiler in Alsace which both belonged to Pfalz-Zweibr√ºcken, Hanau on the river Main, and possibly to Malmedy. In the first three places, there are found bearers of the name Botzon. Starting in the 1640s, Johann Botzon is mentioned often in the council minutes of the city of Kaiserslautern. The Bossong surname has existed in and around the town of Kaiserslautern in the Rhineland-Palatinate for the past several hundred years. The earliest known cited person with the surname Bossong was Johann √Ñgidius Bossong, who was born approximately 1642 in Schallodenbach.Kirchenbuch, 1683-1961, Katholische Kirche Schallodenbach (BA.

Their capital was at Aix-la-Chappell (Aachen)First Europe Tutorial / The Applied History Research Group / The University of Calgary / August 1996 in present-day North Rhine- Westphalia, near the borders of Belgium and the Netherlands. The Bossong family seat was in the town of Bussang which lies in present-day Lorraine. Although most of the Bossongs found in Schallodenbach and surrounding farm villages were Catholic, some early church records suggest that Calvinist Bossongs lived in Heiligenmoschel. As noted earlier in this article, it appears early Bossongs were Huguenots or Walloons. In Europe today, variations of the name can be found in several countries from the western and southern parts of the former Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation - Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and England.  Various spellings  The spelling of the name changed over the years, and may have started as Bandeson. Variations of the spelling include Baudeson, Baudeschon, Baudisson, Boudecon, Boudosson, Bodecon, Bodeson, Bootson, Bodson, Botson, Botzon, Botzong, Bozon, Boson, Bossung, and Bauzon.  Immigration to the United States  Along with about 1.2 million other Germans, many Bossongs emigrated from Europe in the late 19th century while war ravaged central Europe. The most popular immigration to the United States for the Germans was New York.

He played college football at Northern Arizona University. Early life Lang graduated from Eisenhower High School in 1986. He was an All- league selection at running back as a senior. In track, he anchored the 4 √ó 100 metres relay team that finished third at the California state finals. He accepted a football scholarship from Northern Arizona University. As a sophomore, he had 47 carries for 240 yards and 14 receptions for 96 yards. As a junior, he started the first four games, tallying 146 rushing yards and 114 receiving yards, before suffering a knee injury that sidelined him for the rest of the season. As a senior, he led the team both in rushing with 94 carries for 521 yards and in receiving with 41 receptions for 447 yards. He became the first player in school history to have a game with 100 yards rushing and receiving, rushing for 189 yards (including a 70-yard touchdown) and registering five catches for 112 yards (including an 80-yard touchdown), against the University of Nevada, on November 18. He finished as the team's leading rusher (521 yards) and receiver (447). He also was a sprinter on the track and field team. Professional career =Los Angeles Rams= Lang was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the 12th round (328th overall) of the 1990 NFL Draft, after dropping because he had to miss training camp while serving a 120-day prison sentence for receiving stolen property. He would end up missing the season due to these issues. In 1991, his speed and versatility allowed him to earn a roster spot playing special teams. He collected 8 special teams tackles and averaged 16.2 yards-per-kickoff return. In 1992, although he had never played the position before entering the NFL, he was named the starting fullback in the sixth game of the season, replacing an injured Robert Delpino. He finished with career-highs in rushing (203 yards on 33 carries), receiving (18 passes for 283 yards) and touchdowns (6). Against the San Francisco 49ers, he replaced an injured Cleveland Gary, posting 11 carries for 62 yards. Against the Green Bay Packers, he had a 71-yard run. Against the Atlanta Falcons, he set a career-high with 84 receiving yards on 2 receptions, including a 67-yard touchdown catch. In 1993, he suffered a knee injury in training camp and was sidelined for the first 8 games. He was a backup, registering 29 rushing yards and 45 receiving yards. In 1994, he led the team with 27 kickoff returns for 626 yards. His 23.2-yard average ranked ninth in the NFC. He also was third on the team with 10 special teams tackles. He suffered a thigh bruise in the fifth game of the season against the Atlanta Falcons, causing him to miss the next 3 contests. =Dallas Cowboys= On April 27, 1995, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys as a free agent to improve the special teams units and reunited with Ernie Zampese who was his offensive coordinator with the Rams. He was named the special teams captain and set the franchise single-season record for special teams tackles with 30, which was broken the next year by Jim Schwantz (32); the NFL started keeping the stat in 1990. He was part of the Super Bowl XXX winning team. He was not re-signed after the season and retired. Personal life Lang founded the nonprofit organization \\"Legends by Lang\\" to mentor urban youths.

The company was founded in 1880 in Boston, Massachusetts, by William Alfred Paine and Wallace G. Webber. Operating with two employees, they leased premises at 48 Congress Street in May 1881. The company was renamed Paine, Webber & Co. when Charles Hamilton Paine became a partner. Members of the Boston Stock Exchange, in 1890 the company acquired a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Wallace G. Webber retired after the business weathered a major financial crisis that hit the market in 1893.  History  =Founding and early history= In May 1881, William Alfred (W.A.) Paine (with a loan from his father) and Wallace G. Webber founded Paine & Webber as a brokerage firm in Boston, Massachusetts with a seat on the Boston Stock Exchange. With the admission of Charles H. Paine to the partnership, the firm was renamed Paine, Webber & Co. The firm would purchase a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1890. Also in the 1890s, W.A. Paine entered into a partnership with Copper Range Company and Copper Range Railroad, controlled by John Stanton. Controlled by the Paine family, Paine, Webber & Co. entered the investment banking business in the 1920s. After nearly fifty years at the head of the company, W.A. Paine died right before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. His son F. Ward Paine became head of the firm, a position he held until 1940. Following the difficult years of the Great Depression, Paine Webber merged with Jackson & Curtis, another Boston-based brokerage firm, in June 1942. In July 1879, Charles Cabot Jackson and Laurence Curtis had founded their brokerage firm Jackson & Curtis on Congress Street in Boston, not far from the original Paine Webber offices. The combined firm, Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis, operated a combined total of 22 branch offices. With its greater combined asset base, Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis had become a significant participant in the New England financial market. =1960s and 1970s= In October 1960, Paine Webber managed the initial public offering (IPO) of the Green Shoe Manufacturing Co., in which it introduced the concept of stabilization covered by an overallotment option, which has ever since been known by the colloquial name of greenshoe. The firm moved its headquarters from Boston to New York in 1963. The firm's holding company was incorporated on June 30, 1969 as PaineWebber Inc., of which Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis was its main subsidiary. In 1974, the firm completed an initial public offering of the stock of its holding company, PaineWebber Inc., and listed the company on the New York Stock Exchange. PaineWebber engaged in a number of acquisitions in the 1970s, as a wave of consolidation spread through the industry. In 1973, the firm acquired F.S. Smithers & Co., providing its first a presence in fixed income. PaineWebber also acquired Abbott, Proctor & Paine in 1970, the Abacus Fund, a closed-end investment company in 1972, Mitchum, Jones & Templeton Inc. in 1973. In 1977, the firm acquired investment research and advisory firm Mitchell Hutchins, which had been founded in 1919. Two years later, in 1979, the company acquired Blyth, Eastman Dillon & Co., which itself was the product of a number of mergers. Among its predecessor firms were Blyth & Co. which had merged with Eastman Dillon Union Securities & Co. in 1972, itself the product of the 1956 merger of Union Securities (formerly the investment banking division of J. & W. Seligman & Co.) and Eastman Dillon & Co. The acquisition added more than 70 branch offices and more than 700 professionals in addition to a strong investment banking business. =1980s= By 1980, PaineWebber had 161 branch offices in 42 states and six offices in Asia and Europe. With the acquisition of Rotan Mosle Financial Corp. in 1983, PaineWebber developed a national distribution network and with its advertising campaign \\"Thank You PaineWebber\\" developed its brand throughout the 1980s. In 1984, the company consolidated its two divisions, Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis and Blyth Eastman Paine Webber Inc., to form PaineWebber Inc. PaineWebber Group Inc. was established as the parent holding company. PaineWebber moved its headquarters from 140 Broadway to 1285 Avenue of the Americas in midtown in 1985. PaineWebber became a visible presence on Sixth Avenue. At the time, the illuminated name on the building (today UBS) was unique among investment banks, and the building hosted a ground floor gallery of art exhibitions. In 1986, the firm opened a new technology and transaction processing operation at Lincoln Harbor in New Jersey. =1990s= In 1995 PaineWebber completed the acquisition of the brokerage and investment banking firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. from General Electric Company.Paine Webber Deal for Kidder. The New York Times, December 16, 1994*Paine Webber's Plan for Kidder. The New York Times, October 18, 1994 Founded in 1865, Kidder, Peabody had been a preeminent player in investment banking and private services before becoming embroiled in insider trading scandals in the 1980s and suffering major trading losses in 1994. With a significant nationwide presence, and operating as PaineWebber Group Inc., by late 2000 PaineWebber had emerged as the fourth largest private client firm in the United States with 385 offices employing 8554 stockbrokers. In 2000, months before the merger with UBS, PaineWebber acquired southeastern brokerage firm J.C. Bradford & Co. for US$620 million. The deal was not profitable for PaineWebber, as a great number of brokers left the firm, taking their clients with them. The Bradford unit which had been \\"purchased by PaineWebber mainly for its network of 900 brokers\\" was closed. =Merger with UBS= On November 3, 2000, under the leadership of Chairman and CEO, Donald Marron, the company completed a US$10.8 billion cash and stock merger with UBS, a banking conglomerate headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.PaineWebber Merger Vote.

A DLL can be used to change the phase of a clock signal (a signal with a periodic waveform), usually to enhance the clock rise-to-data output valid timing characteristics of integrated circuits (such as DRAM devices). DLLs can also be used for clock recovery (CDR). From the outside, a DLL can be seen as a negative-delay gate placed in the clock path of a digital circuit. The main component of a DLL is a delay chain composed of many delay gates connected output-to-input. The input of the chain (and thus of the DLL) is connected to the clock that is to be negatively delayed. A multiplexer is connected to each stage of the delay chain; the selector of this multiplexer is automatically updated by a control circuit to produce the negative delay effect. The output of the DLL is the resulting, negatively delayed clock signal. thumbcenter660pxThe delay locked loop is a variable delay line whose delay is locked to the duration of the period of a reference clock. Depending on the signal processing element in the loop (a flat amplifier or an integrator), the DLL loop can be of 0th order type 0 or of 1st order type 1. Another way to view the difference between a DLL and a PLL is that a DLL uses a variable phase (=delay) block where a PLL uses a variable frequency block. A DLL compares the phase of its last output with the input clock to generate an error signal which is then integrated and fed back as the control to all of the delay elements. The integration allows the error to go to zero while keeping the control signal, and thus the delays, where they need to be for phase lock. Since the control signal directly impacts the phase this is all that is required. A PLL compares the phase of its oscillator with the incoming signal to generate an error signal which is then integrated to create a control signal for the voltage-controlled oscillator. The control signal impacts the frequency of the oscillator, and phase is the integral of frequency, so a second integration is unavoidably performed by the oscillator itself. In the Control Systems jargon, the DLL is a loop one step lower in order and in type with respect to the PLL, because it lacks the 1/s factor in the controlled block: the delay line has a transfer function phase-out/phase- in that is just a constant, the VCO transfer function is instead GVCO/s. In the comparison made in the previous sentences (that correspond to the figure where the integrator, and not the flat gain, is used), the DLL is a loop of 1st order and type 1 and the PLL of 2nd order and type 2. Without the integration of the error signal, the DLL would be 0th order and type 0 and the PLL 1st order and type 1. The number of elements in the delay chain must be even, or else the duty cycle of the clock at the intermediate nodes of the chain might become irregular. If 2N +1 was the -odd- number of stages, a 50% duty-cycle would become at times N/(2N+1), at times (N+1)/(2N+1), following the jittering of the error signal around the value corresponding to perfect lock. Calling 2N the number of stages of the DLL chain, it is easy to see that the figure above would change from a DLL to a PLL, locked to the same phase and frequency, if the following modifications were made: * dividing by two the number of stages * making one of the stages an inverting one *connecting the input of the chain of stages to its output instead of to the reference clock. The resulting chain becomes a ring oscillator with a period equal to the delay of the previous chain, and the loop locks to the same reference clock with the same level of error signal. The loop order and type are both incremented by one. It may be further remarked that, in the case where the integrator instead of the flat gain is chosen, the PLL that can be obtained is unstable. The phase shift can be specified either in absolute terms (in delay chain gate units), or as a proportion of the clock period, or both.

The Home Guards Organisation was reorganised in India in 1966 after the Sino-Indian War with the People's Republic of China, though it existed in smaller units individually in some places. Home Guards are recruited from various cross sections of the civil society such as professionals, college students, agricultural and industrial workers etc who give their spare time for betterment of the community. All citizens of India, in the age group of 18‚Äì50, are eligible. Normal tenure of membership in Home Guards is three to five years. History The Home Guard was originally raised in the erstwhile Bombay Province in 1946. Apart from Army, Navy, Air Force and other security agencies, the twin voluntary organisations - Civil Defence & Home Guards were raised to provide protection to citizens in any untoward situation. Therefore, 6 December every year is celebrated throughout the nation as Raising Day of the organisation. On that day in 1946, first Home Guards Unit was conceived and raised in erstwhile Bombay Presidency during turmoil period of civil disorders and communal riots, as a civilian voluntary force in aid of administration as an auxiliary to Police, under the stewardship of Morarji Desai, former Prime Minister.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/hg.htm in accordance with the Home Guards Acts and Rules of States/Union Territories, under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Maharashtra Home Guards was utilised by the Civil Defence which came into existence in 1952 under the name of Home Defence (New Civil Defence Act is 27 0f 1968). In view of these the Maharashtra Home Guards and the State Government could assist Central Government in organising the Home Guards and Civil Defence creditably during External aggression in 1962. On some occasions the organisation went out of its lawful jurisdiction in order to render help as during the floods in Surat in 1956; civil defence measures organised in Assam in 1962; special services rendered at the exposition of St Xavier's body in Goa in 1964, etc. They also rendered yeomen's service during several strikes of Bombay Municipal Corporation employees, and fully manned the essential services such as fire brigade, water supply and hospital services for a number of days. At this time the Home Defence was permitted to be brought to limelight by changing the Home Defence to Civil Defence. The policies of State Civil Defence Committee were based on the directives issued by Government of India. This Home Guard organisation is also active in Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Functions The functions to be performed by Home Guards are listed below: * To serve as Auxiliary to the Police and generally help in maintaining internal security. * To help the community in any kind of Emergency‚Äîsuch as on Air-raid precautions or on any natural disaster. * To function as an Emergency Force intended for special tasks directly or indirectly connected with the defence of the country. * To maintain functional units to provide essential services such as motor transport, Engineering groups, Fire brigade, Nursing and First Aid, Operation of Power supply, Water installations and Communication systems etc. * The Border Wing of 18 battalions assists the Border Security Force in preventing infiltration on the international border/coastal areas, guarding of VA/VPs and lines of communication and vulnerable areas at the time of external aggression. The 18 battalions are deployed as follows: Assam (one bn), Gujarat (4 bns), Meghalaya (one bn), Punjab (6 bns), Rajasthan (4 bns), Tripura (one bn), and West Bengal (one bn). * Marine Units function as an Indian Coast Guard auxiliary. * The Fire Wing assists the Indian Fire service. Home Guards Demonstration-Fire tender operation.-1970 Home Guards Demonstration-Fire fighting-1970 Home Guards Demonstration-First aid.-1970 Strength and Organisation The total strength of Home Guards in the country is 573,793 against which the present raised strength is 486,401 Home Guards in 25 state and the union territories. It doesn't exist in Kerala as its duties are performed by other organisations. Training Central Civil Defence training centres were established in various states to impart training to both Civil Defence and Home Guards personnel. The training consists of individual as well as team training. After Independence the task of Civil Defence training was revived only after 1962. Equipment The Home Guard is equipped with and trained to use older weapons such as the .303 Lee‚ÄìEnfield SMLE rifle, Sten and Bren guns which are manufactured indigenously by the Indian Ordnance Factories. Personnel Personnel are recruited from various people to include doctors, lawyers, teachers, employees of public and private sector organisations, college and university students, agricultural and industrial workers and others who give their spare time to their communities. All 18 to 50-year-old citizens of India are eligible for membership and normally serve from three to five years each. Members are paid an allowance when called up for service. All members, after their first three-year term of service, are eligible to be trained by the police in the maintenance of law and order, crime prevention, anti-dacoit measures, border control, disaster relief, fire prevention and firefighting, election and social welfare activities.

He was named after Groucho's brother Arthur \\"Harpo\\" Marx. Marx spent his early years accompanying his father around vaudeville circuits in the United States and abroad. When he was 10, the family moved to Southern California, where the Marx Brothers continued their film careers. Tennis career Marx was a nationally ranked tennis player before he was 18. While he was attending the University of Southern California, he won the National Freshman Intercollegiate Tennis title at Montclair, New Jersey. At the Tri-State Tennis Tournament, the event that evolved into today's Cincinnati Masters, Marx reached the singles final in 1941 before falling to Bobby Riggs. To reach the final, Marx knocked off future International Tennis Hall of Fame member John Doeg in the round of 16, Frank Froehling Jr. in the quarterfinals, and Gardner Larned in the semifinals. Riggs had blown through his competition to reach the final, and Marx gave him his toughest test of the tournament, stretching the future Hall of Famer to five sets before falling, 11‚Äì9, 6‚Äì2, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì8, 6‚Äì1. War service Marx spent four years in the United States Coast Guard during World War II serving in the South Pacific. He was assigned to the Coast Guard crewed Army Marine Ship Repair Ship Duluth which embarked an Army Marine Ship Repair Company for the repair work. Marx, a Yeoman, was aboard when the ship departed San Francisco on August 21, 1944 for Finschhafen, arriving September 24, and then arriving at Hollandia in New Guinea in early October to await departure for the invasion of the Philippines. After a very slow convoy the ship arrived October 23, three days after the landing at Leyte. Marx was hospitalized at Tacloban for malaria and when discharged was assigned to form and be master of ceremonies of an amateur show providing entertainment for those in rear areas passed by U.S.O. shows. Marx's experience aboard was recalled in his book Son of Groucho. Literary, radio, and TV career After the war he worked as an advertising copywriter, a radio gag man for Milton Berle, and a writer of Hollywood movies (including four for Bob Hope), Broadway plays and TV scripts for such hit shows as My Three Sons, All in the Family, and Alice. He and his collaborator, Robert Fisher, were head writers for Alice and wrote 40 episodes of that show. They also wrote for the short-lived situation comedy The Good Guys and four episodes of the ill-fated Life with Lucy. Marx was also co- creator of the TV series Mickey starring Mickey Rooney. Marx wrote both fiction (often humorous) and non-fiction (often show-biz related) pieces for magazines throughout his career. Along with Fisher, he co-authored the play The Impossible Years, which ran for three seasons on Broadway and starred Alan King, and Minnie's Boys, a musical about the Marx Brothers' vaudeville years that starred Shelley Winters. They also wrote My Daughter's Rated X, which won the Straw Hat award for best new comedy on the summer stock circuit, and Groucho: A Life in Revue, which won great critical acclaim and was nominated for a New York Outer Critics Circle award for best play and London's Laurence Olivier Award for Comedy Production of the Year. Other plays included The Chic Life and Hello, My Name Is.... Marx was planning a revival of \\"Minnie's Boys\\" to be co-authored by Michael R. Crider shortly before Marx's death in 2011. Marx also wrote over a dozen books, including The Ordeal of Willie Brown (1951) a humorous fictionalization of his tennis years, and Not as a Crocodile (1958) a collection of family oriented humor essays. His books also included Goldwyn: A Biography of the Man Behind the Myth (1976), Red Skelton (1979), The Nine Lives of Mickey Rooney (1988), The Secret Life of Bob Hope and the tennis-themed murder mystery Set to Kill (both 1993). His next novel, Tulip (2004) was a thriller-mystery and it was followed in 2008 by Lust For Death, a roman √† clef about a Bob Hope-like character named Jack Faith. His 1974 book on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis entitled Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime (Especially Himself) was adapted into the 2002 made-for-television movie Martin and Lewis. Marx also wrote several books featuring different takes on his relationship with his father, including Life with Groucho (1954), Son of Groucho (1972), a reworking and update of the 1954 volume renamed My Life With Groucho (1992), and Arthur Marx‚Äôs Groucho: A Photographic Journey (2001). Marx wrote the foreword to Michael R. Crider's 2007 tome, The Guy's Guide to Dating, Getting Hitched and the First Year of Marriage, a humorous look at relationships. In his 1993 book \\"The Secret Life of Bob Hope,\\" Marx stated, among other things, that Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were womanizers who would trade girlfriends.

Published in 1991, it focuses on the Second World War-era nurse Claire Randall, who travels through time to 18th century Scotland and finds adventure and romance with the dashing Jamie Fraser. A mix of several genres, the Outlander series has elements of historical fiction, romance, adventure and fantasy. With 25 million copies sold, Outlander is one of the best-selling book series of all time. Outlander won the Romance Writers of America's RITA Award for Best Romance of 1991. A television adaptation of the Outlander series premiered on Starz in the US on August 9, 2014.  Plot summary  In 1946, after working apart during the Second World War, former British Army nurse Claire Randall and her husband Frank Randall, a history professor, go on a second honeymoon to Inverness, Scotland. Frank conducts research into his family history and Claire goes plant-gathering near standing stones on the hill of Craigh na Dun. Investigating a buzzing noise near the stones, she touches one and faints; upon waking, she encounters Frank's ancestor, Captain Jack Randall. Before Captain Randall can attack her, he is knocked unconscious by a highlander who takes Claire to his clansmen. As the Scots inexpertly attend their injured comrade Jamie, Claire uses her medical skill to set Jamie's dislocated shoulder. The men identify themselves as members of Clan MacKenzie, and Claire eventually concludes that she has traveled into the past. She represents herself as an English widow who is traveling to France to see her family. The Scots do not believe her and take her to Castle Leoch, where Claire searches for a way to return to her own time. The highlanders of 1743 see Claire as a \\"Sassenach\\", or \\"Outlander\\", ignorant of Gaelic culture. Her medical skills eventually earn their respect; but the clan chieftain, Colum MacKenzie, suspects her of being an English spy. Colum sends her with his brother, Dougal, to collect rents; on the way he also solicits donations for the Jacobites, overseen by Ned Gowan, a lawyer from Edinburgh who is working for the Clan. When chance again brings her to his attention, Captain Randall tells Dougal to bring Claire to him for questioning. There is suspicion that she is perhaps an English spy. To keep Claire from Randall, Dougal has her wed Jamie, which makes her a Scottish citizen. Torn between her attachment to Jamie and the thought of Frank, Claire tries to return to Craigh na Dun. However, she is captured by Randall's men, requiring Jamie to rescue her. Upon returning to Castle Leoch, Claire continues acting as the official healer, and befriends Geillis Duncan, the wife of a local official, who shares a knowledge of medicine. Eventually Claire and Geillis are charged with witchcraft while Jamie is away, but Jamie returns in time to save Claire. While imprisoned with Geillis, Claire learns that Geillis is part of the plot to restore King James to the Scottish throne along with Dougal and that she is also pregnant with his child. Just before their escape, Claire realizes that Geillis is, like herself, from the future, when she sees a smallpox vaccine scar on her arm. Geillis also sees Claire's scar. Claire tells Jamie her real story, and he takes her to Craigh na Dun. When he offers her the chance to stay or go, she decides to stay. Jamie takes her to his home of Lallybroch, where they meet Jamie's sister Jenny and her husband, Ian. Though Jamie is still a fugitive from the British, he reclaims his position as Laird of Lallybroch, until one of his tenants betrays him and he is taken to Wentworth Prison. Claire and the MacKenzie clansmen attempt to rescue him, but they fail, and Claire is captured by Randall, who threatens to have her raped. Jamie offers himself in Claire's place, and Randall frees Claire into the woods. Claire tells Randall that she is a witch and tells him the exact day of his death, which she knows from Frank's family history. Thereafter Claire is befriended by Sir Marcus MacRannoch, a former suitor of Jamie's mother. While MacRannoch's men distract Wentworth's guards, the clansmen drive a herd of cattle through the underground halls, trampling a man. They rescue Jamie, who has been assaulted physically and sexually by Randall, and take him to MacRannoch's stronghold, where Claire tends Jamie's wounds. As soon as Jamie is able, they and Jamie's godfather, Murtagh, escape to Saint Anne de Beaupre's monastery in France, where another of Jamie's uncles is abbot. As she and Jamie emerge from a sacred hot spring under the Abbey, Claire reveals that she is pregnant. Main characters * Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser: A warm, practical and independent former combat nurse who inadvertently travels back in time to the Scottish Highlands in the mid-18th century. Though married to Frank Randall in the 20th century, she falls for Jamie Fraser in the 18th century. A gifted natural physician and an amateur botanist, Claire is an only child and orphan, raised by her archaeologist uncle. * James \\"Jamie\\" MacKenzie Fraser (aka Jamie MacTavish): A strapping young Scottish redhead with a complicated past and disarming sense of humor. Jamie is intelligent, principled, and, by 18th century standards, educated and worldly. He picks up languages very easily, and after initial conflict he falls in love with the mysterious Claire. Though he does not always know what she is doing, Jamie usually trusts Claire. * Frank Wolverton Randall: Claire's husband in the 20th century and a history professor with a deep interest in his genealogy and heritage. He worked for MI6 during the Second World War as an intelligence agent. * Jonathan Randall (aka \\"Black Jack\\" Randall): The primary villain of the story and Frank Randall's ancestor, a British army officer. According to Jamie, the ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù refers to the color of his soul. Jack physically resembles his descendant Frank, but has a sadistic sexual obsession with Jamie. * Callum (Colum) MacKenzie: Chief of the MacKenzie clan and Jamie's maternal uncle, who shelters Jamie and Claire from the English. He suffers from Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome. * Dougal MacKenzie: Callum's younger Jacobite brother, who leads the clan in battle because his older brother is disabled. It is hinted that he might be the biological father of Callum's son, Hamish. He also took Jamie as a foster son for a time as a teen. Dougal has four daughters with his wife, and a son with Geillis Duncan. * Geillis/Geilie Duncan: The wife of the procurator fiscal, who believes that she is a witch, and has knowledge of herbs and plants. Geillis is pregnant with Dougal MacKenzie‚Äôs child when imprisoned for witchcraft, which wins her a brief reprieve of her death sentence. She murders her husband, Arthur Duncan. Ultimately Claire realizes that she is a time-traveler from the 1960s. * Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser: Jamie's godfather, who is taciturn, quiet and brave, and very loyal to Jamie, whom he cares for as a son. At first he does not accept Claire, but changes his mind when he sees how much Jamie loves her. * Laoghaire MacKenzie: A young girl of sixteen who is attracted to Jamie. She sends Claire to Geillis Duncan just prior to the witch trial because she \\"loves\\" Jamie and wants him back. Development and inspiration Diana Gabaldon planned to write a historical novel \\"for practice\\", but did not have a specific setting in mind until she happened to watch The War Games, a classic Doctor Who serial, on PBS. Her eye was caught by the character Jamie McCrimmon, a young Scot from 1745 played by actor Frazer Hines. The image of the young man in the kilt stayed with her, and she decided to set her novel in 18th century Scotland. She named her male protagonist \\"Jamie\\" after the Doctor Who character (however, the surname \\"Fraser\\" was not taken from actor Frazer Hines, since the PBS station cut off the programme's credits). Gabaldon's initial plan was to write a \\"straight historical novel\\", but as she began to write the character of Claire, she says the character \\"promptly took over the story and began telling it herself, making smart-ass modern remarks about everything.\\" Gabaldon decided to make the character a modern woman and determine how she came to be in 18th century Scotland later. Gabaldon acknowledged a date discrepancy between the American version of the novel, the plot of which begins in 1945, and the British version, which begins in 1946. She explained, \\"Reay Tannahill, a Scot who kindly proofread the novel before it was published in the UK, said that 1946 would have been a more accurate representation of conditions as I described them in Scotland.\\" Gabaldon was able to rework all of the dates for the UK edition, but the American version was too far along in production to change. Reception and awards Publishers Weekly said of Outlander, \\"Absorbing and heartwarming, this first novel lavishly evokes the land and lore of Scotland, quickening both with realistic characters and a feisty, likable heroine.\\" With 25 million copies sold,Outlander is one of the best-selling book series of all time. The novel won the Romance Writers of America's RITA Award for Best Romance of 1991. Television series In June 2013, Starz ordered 16 episodes of a television adaptation, and production began in October 2013 in Scotland. The series premiered in the US on August 9, 2014. It was picked up for a second season on August 15, 2014, and for a third and fourth season on June 1, 2016. On May 9, 2018, Starz renewed the series for a fifth and sixth season. Other adaptations In 2010 Gabaldon adapted the first third of Outlander into The Exile: An Outlander Graphic Novel, illustrated by Hoang Nguyen. The same year, a 14-song cycle based on Outlander was released under the title Outlander: The Musical.

It was described in 1916 from bones found in a cave in north central Puerto Rico and a single skin specimen from 1888, and was considered extinct until observed in the wild in 1961. The current population is estimated as 1,400-2,000 mature birds. The species is currently classified as Endangered due to pressures from habitat loss.  Description  Male taking flight Puerto Rican nightjars, whose song is composed of rapid \\"whip\\" notes, are small birds about 22‚Äì23 cm in length, weighing 39-41 g. Similar to the Antillean nighthawk, the species has a mottled, black, brown and gray colored plumage which serves as camouflage while the bird is perched on the ground. Males have a black throat with a white thin horizontal line. There are white spots on the lower part of the tail which are visible in flight. Females are of a buff rather than white coloration. Puerto Rican nightjars have large, dark black eyes, a short gray bill, and gray tarsi. Like all nightjars, they possess stiff bristles around the beak to help with the capture of insects in flight.  History  The Puerto Rican nightjar was first discovered as a single skin specimen found in the Northern part of Puerto Rico in 1888, and rediscovered and correctly identified in 1916 when bones were discovered in a cave in northern Puerto Rico. The species was originally considered already extinct at the time of its discovery. Confirmation of living specimens only occurred in 1961 in the Gu√°nica Dry Forest. Detailed studies of the species started in 1969. Distribution and habitat The species is likely to have historically occurred in moist limestone and coastal forests in northern Puerto Rico, in addition to the current range of dry limestone, lower cordillera and dry coastal forest. The nightjar is presently mostly found in closed canopy dry forest on limestone soils with abundant leaf litter and an open understorey. Lower densities are present in open scrubby forests. Populations have so far been confirmed in three locations in the southwest of the island: Sus√∫a State Forest, Gu√°nica Dry Forest and Guayanilla Hills. The first nesting record of the Puerto Rican nightjar in Maricao State Forest was reported in 2005.  Ecology  The Puerto Rican nightjar feeds on beetles, moths and other insects that it catches in flight. It nests on the ground under closed canopies and needs an abundant leaf layer to hold the eggs. The peak months for nesting activity are April‚ÄìJune. The clutch is usually of 1-2 eggs, which are light brown with darker brown or purple patches. The eggs have an incubation period of 18‚Äì20 days and are primarily incubated by the male. The chicks are a cinnamon downy color and they start to fly at about 14 days after hatching. Like many ground-nesting birds, the nightjar will try to divert the attention of potential predators away from the nest by conspicuously flying away and vibrating its wings. The species may be permanently territorial.  Conservation Status  Juvenile Estimates of the breeding population of Puerto Rican nightjars in 1962 were of less than 100 pairs. In 1968, the species was added to the endangered species list of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the IUCN Red List, where it was originally classified as Threatened. It was uplisted to Critically Endangered in 1994, but downlisted again to Endangered in 2011, after the population had been assessed as small but essentially stable. Current estimates are of 1,400-2000 mature birds, which roughly corresponds to 1984 numbers. The species is legally protected throughout its range. Puerto Rican nightjars are considered to be under pressure from habitat loss due to urban development and agricultural expansion, and through predation by introduced predators such as the small Indian mongoose and feral cats, and native predators such as owls. It is possible that the large scale deforestation that occurred during the late 1800s and the beginning of the 1900s is the reason that the nightjars are no longer found on the north part of the island. Mitigating habitat impact on private lands and controlling public access to the forest reserves during their peak nesting season has been suggested as a conservation management technique for this species.

One of the principal oceans of the Palaeozoic, its sutures today stretch from Mexico to Turkey and its closure resulted in the assembly of the supercontinent Pangaea and the formation of the Variscan‚ÄìAlleghenian‚ÄìOuachita orogenies.  Etymology  The ocean located between Gondwana and Laurentia in the Early Cambrian was named for Iapetus, in Greek mythology the father of Atlas (from which source the Atlantic Ocean ultimately gets its name), just as the Iapetus Ocean was the predecessor of the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean between Gondwana and Laurussia (Laurentia‚ÄìBaltica‚ÄìAvalonia) in the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician was named the Rheic Ocean after Rhea, sister of Iapetus.  Geodynamic evolution  Evolution of the Rheic Ocean in the Early Paleozoic At the beginning of the Paleozoic Era, about 540 million years ago, most of the continental mass on Earth was clustered around the south pole as the paleocontinent Gondwana. The exception was formed by a number of smaller continents, such as Laurentia and Baltica. The Paleozoic ocean between Gondwana, Laurentia and Baltica is called the Iapetus Ocean. The northern edge of Gondwana had been dominated by the Cadomian orogeny during the Ediacaran period. This orogeny formed a cordillera-type volcanic arc where oceanic crust subducted below Gondwana. When a mid-oceanic ridge subducted at an oblique angle, extensional basins developed along the northern margin of Gondwana.Scenario from During the late Cambrian to Early Ordovician these extensional basins had evolved a rift running along the northern edge of Gondwana.; The rift in its turn evolved into a mid-oceanic ridge that separated small continental fragments such as Avalonia and Carolina from the main Gondwanan land mass. As Avalonia-Carolina drifted north from Gondwana, the Rheic Ocean grew and reached its maximum width () in the Silurian. In this process, the Iapetus Ocean closed as Avalonia-Carolina collided with Laurentia and the Appalachian orogeny formed. The closure of the Rheic began in the Early Devonian and was completed in the Mississippian when Gondwana and Laurentia collided to form Pangaea. This closure resulted in the largest collisional orogen of the Palaeozoic: the Variscan and Alleghanian orogens between Gondwana's West African margin and southern Baltica and eastern Laurentia and the Ouachita orogeny between the Amazonian margin of Gondwana and southern Laurentia.

It was a historic market town in the county of Kent. It is located north of Orpington, and south-east of Charing Cross. History The name Cray possibly derives from the Anglo-Saxon crecca, meaning brook or rivulet, though it also relates to the Welsh word craie, meaning fresh water. The name may also derive from the Latin word creta, meaning chalk, as the River Cray flows over a chalk bed. The village name derives from the dedication of the parish church to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Roman and Saxon remains have been found in the Fordcroft area. An excavation in 1960 was conducted by members of Bromley Museum in Orpington. Members of the Orpington and District Archaeological Society (ODAS) have excavated further sites that have become available. St Mary Cray developed into a market town. The privilege of holding a market on Wednesdays was granted by Edward I (1272 - 1307) f The district being an agricultural one, the small population worked on its many fruit farms and hopfields. The most famous of the early industries were the 17th-century foundries of Hodson and Hull where several famous bells were cast. Christopher Hodson made bells for Canterbury Cathedral and Oxford.3\\\\. Article by Tony Lathey in A Cray Compendium, editors Jerry Dowlen and Mike Floate, Cray 150 Publications 2014 5\\\\. London Borough of Bromley Official Guide , published by authority of the Council of the London Borough of Bromley, 1971/74 The advent of the Industrial Revolution saw brewing and paper manufacturing grow into principal industries beside the River Cray. Three mills are mentioned in Domesday (1087). From the early 1800s until the Depression in the 1930s, many local workers were employed at the Joynson and the William Nash paper mills. With the expansion of the railways, the population increased rapidly. The building of the railway viaduct across the Cray Valley is considered to be the origin in 1860 of Cray Wanderers F.C. who are London's oldest association football club. Migrant workers came to the district to help construct the giant earth embankments for what became the London, Chatham & Dover Railway. Games of football started at Star Lane, today the site of a cemetery.4\\\\. Forever Amber, Cray Wanderers FC 1860 ‚Äì 2010 The History of London‚Äôs Oldest Football Club by Jerry Dowlen, Peter Goringe and Mike Floate, Cray 150 Publications 2011, In the 1930s the farmlands of Poverest on the west side of the river were turned over to the construction of industrial and office buildings. The factories along Cray Avenue were engaged in industries ranging from paint and ink manufacture to baking and preserved foods. During and after the Second World War, Star Lane cemetery was to become the burial ground for several airmen of the RAF and Commonwealth Air Forces. Three Polish airmen were also buried here, one of them being Stanis≈Çaw Grodzicki, who was killed in an air crash over Croydon. In 1971 the St Mary Cray Action Group was founded. It erected a new village sign, at Sandway, in 1992. John Horam, then the MP for Orpington, recorded in 1999: \\"The Crays are truly a slice of Kent, on the edge of London, once rural, now full of housing and commerce.\\" Notable events =Cray Wanderers FC= St Mary Cray was the original home of Cray Wanderers FC, claimed to have been having been formed in 1860, which may be the oldest football club in London. =The Romany= St Mary Cray has the largest settled Romani groups and Irish Traveller community in the UK.\\"Working for Bromley ... making a difference\\", Recruitment Information Pack for Management Grade Posts, London Borough of Bromley Accessed 29 September 2007 In the past, hop and soft fruit farms in the area employed large numbers of itinerant workers. =Battle of St Mary Cray= On Saturday 24 April 1954 a clash between Teddy Boys or Edwardians, as they were then known, attracted attention. The Orpington & Kentish Times had the headline: \\"Gang Battle\\" at Railway Station: Edwardian Youths in Half-Hour Fight: Wooden Stakes, Sand-Filled Socks as Weapons\\". The two gangs were from Downham and St Paul's Cray, and sported stovepipe trousers, crepe shoes and drape jackets. Trouble had started earlier in the evening when a \\"rowdy\\" party of youths and a few girls from Downham Estate, Bromley, arrived at St Paul's Cray Community Centre, where a dance was being held. The paper reported \\"a knife was drawn when a member of the band objected to being jostled\\", and \\"a man had a glass of orange juice thrown in his face during an exchange of words.\\" The MC, George Couchman said: \\"I warned the crowd police were standing by and also took the precaution of the band playing calming music ‚Äì no quicksteps.\\" The crowd dispersed at 11 o'clock, but a fight broke out at the local station, and 40 youths were held over night. =Local government= St Mary Cray was an ancient parish in the county of Kent. It formed part of the Bromley Rural District from 1894 and was absorbed by the Orpington Urban District in 1934. The Orpington Urban District was abolished in 1965 and the area became part of the London Borough of Bromley in Greater London. Geography Like nearby St Paul's Cray, it has been somewhat overshadowed by the growth of Orpington, which now provides local communities with their main shopping and business facilities. Today it is mostly suburban housing, to a large amount of working class and ex traveller people. Originally the main feature of the town was its small parade of shops which was once longer than Orpington High Street. Today, it is the Nugents Retail Park on Cray Avenue which include several large stores including Marks and Spencers and Next. However, before Nugents opened, the industrial estates of both St Mary Cray and St Paul's Cray were a dominant feature on Cray Avenue and Sevenoaks Way. Many of these grew as part of the new 'light electrical industries' which were springing up. Throughout the 1950s, the area now known as The Nugent housed two large Morphy Richards factories. Their business began in the small factory which used to be by the railway embankment, on the opposite side of the road. They eventually moved out of the area in the 1960s. Other areas are now home to retail outlets such as PC World, Comet, Land of Leather, Homebase, JJB Sports, MFI, Currys, Carpet Right and Arco. These retailers list their stores as being Orpington branches. The art deco tower of the Allied Bakery, formerly Tip Top Bakeries, is a local landmark. Just along from the bakery is Lagoon Road, so named because in the 1930s there was an outdoor lido called the Blue Lagoon.

Biography =Early life and political activities= Lev Grigorievich Deutsch was born September 25, 1855 in Tulchyn, Russia, the son of a Jewish merchant father and a peasant mother. At the age of 19, he joined a Narodnik group in Kiev, and took part in the 'to the people' movement, in which young radicals dressed as peasants, and went to villages to spread socialist ideas. He avoided arrest, unlike many of the participants, but returned, disillusioned in the summer of 1875 and volunteered to join the infantry, hoping to be sent to the Balkans to fight the Turks, but in February 1876, he was implicated in helping a revolutionary named Semyon Lurie, one of the defendants at the Trial of the 193 to escape from Kiev prison, and deserted, to avoid a court martial. He joined an illegal group known as the Kiev buntari. In June 1876, Deutsch was living illegally in Elisavetgrad when a former student named Gorinovich sought to join his group. Gorinovich had been arrested for taking part in the 'to the people' movement in 1874, but was released. Deutsch believed that he had gained his release by denouncing others, and was an active police spy, and resolved to kill him. He and a fellow revolutionary, V.A.Malinka, persuaded Gorinovich to join them on a trip to Odessa, and on the way attacked him and left him for dead, though he recovered and named his attackers. Malinka was hanged for his part in attack in December 1878. This was the first act of violence committed by Russian revolutionaries during the 1870s, and made Deutsch so notorious that when a young Jewish woman was arrested as one of the conspirators who had assassinated the Tsar Alexander II in 1881, the Russian press wrongly assumed that she was Deutsch's sister. In summer 1877, he was arrested as an accomplice of Yakov Stefanovich in the Chigirin Affair and held in Kiev prison, but both men escaped in May 1878 after a fellow revolutionary, Mikhail Frolenko, had obtained a post as a prison warden and let them out one night. Deutsch escaped to Europe, but returned to St Petersburg, and - despite his past record - was a founding member of Chornyi peredel (Black Repartition), rather than the more violent and conspiratorial People's Will, who carried out the assassination of the Tsar. = Conversion to Marxism = In 1880 Deutsch and other leaders of the Black Repartition group, including George Plekhanov, Vera Zasulich and Pavel Axelrod emigrated to Geneva. Abroad, Plekhanov studied the works of Karl Marx, and persuaded the other three to join him in 1883 in creating the marxist Emancipation of Labour. All Russia's marxist parties, including the Communist Party, traced their lineage from this group. As its most experienced illegal operator, Deutsch was put in charge of smuggling Marxist literature into Russia, but was arrested in Germany in March 1884. = Arrest and exile = It was extremely rare for Russian revolutionaries to be extradited by any European government, but Deutsch was treated as a common criminal because the attempt to kill Gorinovich, and sent back to St Petersburg in a cattle truck. At this trial, he freely admitted the offence, but was denied the right to explain his reasons for it, and was sentenced to 13 years and four months in prison. In 1890, he was deported to the Kara region of Siberia, where he shared a cell with other political revolutionaries. According to his account, when Deutsch told them that he had become a Marxist -- an ideology then little known outside Germany: \\"Had I announced myself a follower of the prophet Mohammed, they could scarcely have been more surprised.\\" = Return to political activity = In 1900, Deutsch made a dramatic escape from Siberia, through Japan, the USA, Liverpool, London, and Paris, to rejoin the Emancipation of Labour League in Switzerland in November 1901. His three former comrades there had since joined Vladimir Lenin, Julius Martov, and Alexander Potresov on the six-member editorial board of the newspaper Iskra, which was riven by rivalry between the generations. Plekhanov hoped that Deutsch would take over the task of smuggling the paper into Russia from Lenin, putting the older revolutionaries back in control of the project, but his long imprisonment had taken too much of a toll for him to assume the task. Deutsch was present as an observer at the second congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1903 when it split into its Bolshevik and Menshevik factions. He sided the Mensheviks - Martov, Axelrod, Zasulich, Leon Trotsky et al. Lenin's widow recalled incident involving Deutsch, and a Bolshevik named Vladimir Noskov, as the conference was ending: \\"Deutsch was angrily reprimanding 'Glebov' (Noskov) about something. The latter raised his head and with gleaming eyes said bitterly: 'You just keep your mouth shut, you old dodderer!'\\" During the 1905 Revolution Deutsch returned to Russia but was arrested and imprisoned. However, on the way to Siberia he escaped and made his way to London, starting a period of foreign exile which lasted until the February 1917 Russian Revolution. =Exile and return= From October 1915 to September 1916, Deutsch edited a monthly newspaper in New York City called Svobodnoe Slovo (\\"Free Word\\").Vladimir F. Wertsman, \\"Russians,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 132. In 1917, Deutsch returned to Petrograd and joined George Plekhanov in editing Edinstvo (\\"Unity\\"). He also wrote his memoirs and edited a volume of documents associated with the Emancipation of Labour group. Deutsch died on August 5, 1941.  Personal life  Deutsch never married, though his memoirs show that he had very friendly and affectionate relations with the wives of other revolutionaries, such as Pavel Axelrod. It is probable that he was gay, though he may not have been actively homosexual. During his imprisonment exile in Kara, he and Yakov Stefanovitch -- the only exile ready to listen sympathetically to Deutsch's reasons for converting to Marxism -- successfully appealed to the governor to be allowed to share a room away from other political exiles. One of their contemporaries, Sergei Kravchinsky, alias Stepnyak, writing while at a time when both men were in Europe, after their escape from Kiev prison, claimed that were \\"never separated except when absolutely compelled\\" adding, \\"and then they write long letters to each other every day, which they jealously keep, showing them to no one, affording thus a subject of everlasting ridicule among their friends.\\" In London, in 1903, Deutsch, who was then aged 47, became very attached to 23 year old Leon Trotsky, whom he never referred to by name, but only as 'youth' or 'our Benjamin'. He successfully lobbied the editors of Iskra to allow Trotsky to stay in Europe, rather than be assigned to illegal work in Russia, with a high risk that he would be arrested. In his memoirs, Trotsky recorded that Deutsch \\"treated me very kindly\\" and \\"stood up for me\\" and that they were \\"bound by genuine friendship\\" but that he \\"never had and never could have any political influence over me.\\" Footnotes Other sources consulted * Leopold H.

Teleradiology is the transmission of radiological patient images, such as x-rays, CTs, and MRIs, from one location to another for the purposes of sharing studies with other radiologists and physicians. Teleradiology is a growth technology given that imaging procedures are growing approximately 15% annually against an increase of only 2% in the radiologist population. Teleradiology allows radiologists to provide services without actually having to be at the location of the patient. This is particularly important when a sub-specialist such as an MRI radiologist, neuroradiologist, pediatric radiologist, or musculoskeletal radiologist is needed, since these professionals are generally only located in large metropolitan areas working during daytime hours. Teleradiology allows for trained specialists to be available 24/7. Teleradiology utilizes standard network technologies such as the internet, telephone lines, wide area network, local area network (LAN) and the latest high tech being computer clouds. Specialized software is used to transmit the images and enable the radiologist to effectively analyze what can be hundreds of images for a given study. Technologies such as advanced graphics processing, voice recognition, artificial intelligence and image compression are often used in teleradiology. Through tele radiology and mobile DICOM viewers, images can be sent to another part of the hospital, or to other locations around the world. Reports Teleradiologists can provide a Preliminary Read for emergency room cases and other emergency cases or a Final Read for the official patient record and for use in billing. Preliminary Reports include all pertinent findings and a phone call for any critical findings. For some Teleradiology services, the turnaround time is extremely rapid with a 30-minute standard turnaround and expedited for critical and stroke studies. Teleradiology Final Reports can be provided for emergency and non-emergency studies. Final reports include all findings and require access to prior studies and all relevant patient information for a complete diagnosis. Phone calls with any critical findings are signs of quality services. Teleradiology Preliminary or Final Reports can be provided for all doctors and hospitals overflow studies. Teleradiology can be available for intermittent coverage as an extension of practices and will provide patients with the highest quality care. Subspecialties Some teleradiologists are fellowship trained and have a wide variety of subspecialty expertise including such difficult-to-find areas as Neuroradiology, Pediatric Neuroradiology, Thoracic Imaging, Musculoskeletal Radiology, Mammography, and Nuclear Cardiology. There are also various medical practitioners who are not radiologists that take on studies in radiology to become sub specialists in their respected fields, an example of this is dentistry where oral and maxillofacial radiology (Oral & Maxillofacial Radiology) allows those in dentistry to specialize in the acquisition and interpretation of radiographic imaging studies performed for diagnosis of treatment guidance for conditions affecting the maxillofacial region. Regulations In the United States, Medicare and Medicaid laws require the teleradiologist to be on U.S. soil in order to qualify for reimbursement of the Final Read. In addition, advanced teleradiology systems must also be HIPAA compliant, which helps to ensure patients' privacy. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a uniform, federal floor of privacy protections for consumers. It limits the ways that entities can use patients' personal information and protects the privacy of all medical information no matter what form it is in. Quality teleradiology must abide by important HIPAA rules to ensure patients' privacy is protected. Also State laws governing the licensing requirements and medical malpractice insurance coverage required for physicians vary from state to state. Ensuring compliance with these laws is a significant overhead expense for larger multi-state teleradiology groups. Medicare (Australia) has identical requirements to that of the United States, where the guidelines are provided by the Department of Health and Ageing, and government based payments fall under the Health Insurance Act.Health Insurance Act 1973 The regulations in Australia are also conducted at both federal and state levels, ensuring that strict guidelines are adhered to at all times, with regular yearly updates and amendments are introduced (usually around March and November of every year), ensuring that the legislation is kept up to date with changes in the industry. One of the most recent changes to Medicare and Radiology / Teleradiology in Australia was the introduction of the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme (DIAS) on the 1st of July 2008. DIAS was introduced to further improve the quality of Diagnostic Imaging and to amend the Health Insurance Act. Industry growth Until the late 1990s teleradiology was primarily used by individual radiologists to interpret occasional emergency studies from offsite locations, often in the radiologists home. The connections were made through standard analog phone lines. Teleradiology expanded rapidly as the growth of the internet and broad band combined with new CT scanner technology to become an essential tool in trauma cases in emergency rooms throughout the country. The occasional 2-3 x ray studies a week soon became 3-10 CT scans, or more, a night. Because ER physicians are not trained to read CT scans or MRIs, radiologists went from working 8‚Äì10 hours a day, five and half days a week to a schedule of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week coverage. This became a particularly acute challenge in smaller rural facilities that only had one solo radiologist with no other to share call. These circumstances spawned a post-dot.com boom of firms and groups that provided medical outsourcing, off-site teleradiology on-call services to hospitals and Radiology Groups around the country. As an example, a teleradiology firm might cover trauma at a hospital in Indiana with doctors based in Texas. Some firms even used overseas doctors in locations like Australia and India. Nighthawk, founded by Paul Berger, was the first to station U.S. licensed radiologists overseas (initially Australia and later Switzerland) to maximize the time zone difference to provide nightcall in U.S. hospitals. Currently, teleradiology firms are facing pricing pressures. Industry consolidation is likely as there are more than 500 of these firms, large and small, throughout the United States.  Nonprofit  Although teleradiology is flourishing in the developed world, few teleradiological links have been made to the developing world. Generally, barriers to the implementation of radiology services have also complicated setting up reliable links. Several examples of simple, low-cost nonprofit teleradiology solutions have been employed by Satellife and the Swinfen Charitable Trust. Established in 1987 by Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Bernard Lown, Satellife (Boston) was the first non-profit organization to own and use a low earth-orbit satellite as well as mobile computing devices such as handheld computers and mobile phones for medical data communication. Starting in 1998, Swinfen Charitable Trust, a U.K. based nonprofit organization founded by Lord and Lady Swinfen, gave healthcare personnel in remote places internet access and a digital camera, and also facilitated a low-cost telemedicine service linking doctors at hospitals in the developing world with medical and surgical consultants who gave advice at no cost. More complex solutions emerged in 2007. Operated by volunteer radiologists, T√©l√©radiologie sans Fronti√®res (Teleradiology without Borders), a Luxembourg-based nonprofit organization founded by Dr Jean- Baptiste Niedercorn and Dr G√©rald Wajnapel, started to provide teleradiology imaging services to developing countries using a professional cloud picture archiving and communications system (PACS). Today, many established private teleradiology practices such as Virtual Radiologic (vRad) are also involved in pilot programs with NGOs, reporting radiographs from rural health centres, free of charge.

Max Weber is considered an eminent founder of modern social sciences, rivaled by the figures of √âmile Durkheim and Karl Marx. Some students of Weberian thought have paid less attention to Weber's extensive and often passionate engagement with the politics of his day, particularly in the United States. However, European intellectuals have given more attention to his political thought. Most of Weber's political writings have not been published in translation, or have been translated only recently in a piecemeal form. Overview Weber's political ideas have inspired disagreement in Germany for decades. His conception of democracy has been the subject of particularly heated debate. Weber rejected the Wilhelmine regime's authoritarian political structure. He advocated parliamentary and democratic reform. Weber championed the freedoms of what he called the \\"age of the Rights of Man\\". Some find the liberalism of Weber as problematic. Raymond Aron has noted that Weber was not a \\"liberal in the American sense,\\" and not, \\"strictly speaking, a democrat in the sense that the French, the English, or the Americans gave the term.\\" Aron saw Weber to have looked to place the \\"glory of the nation and the power of the state\\" above all other things. Stephen P. Turner and Regis A. Factor have concluded that Weber rejected the philosophical basis for most Western formulations of Enlightenment liberalism. Weber conceived \\"parliamentarization\\" primarily for selecting leaders. Weber was strongly technocratic. Interpretations =Political views= J-P Mayer wrote a 1944 critique of Max Weber, entitled Max Weber and German Politics: a study in political sociology. Published in England during the war, this work never appeared in German translation. Mayer had been an archivist for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the primary book reviewer for the Vorw√§rts, the SPD party paper. He was a target of Nazi persecution, from which he escaped to England. There he became involved with the Labour Party and was a member of the faculty at the London School of Economics during the last part of the Second World War. Mayer labeled Weber's philosophy as the \\"new Machiavellianism of the steel age.\\" The conception of the state that Weber supported was viewed as a middle phase in a destructive tradition of German realpolitik‚Äîa tradition that Mayer saw to extend from Bismarck to Hitler. Mayer interpreted a \\"tragic\\" satisfaction with which Weber was seen to embrace \\"the empty character\\" of Heinrich Rickert's neo-Kantian philosophy of value. Mayer viewed Weber's value theory as a nihilistic contribution to the rise of National Socialism. Wolfgang J. Mommsen initiated debate by arguing this in the 1959 German publication of Max Weber and German Politics 1890‚Äì1920. Mommsen questioned the sociologist's liberal reputation. According to Mommsen, Weber's sociological idea of charismatic authority was evident in his political views, and was \\"close to fascist notions of plebiscitary leadership.\\" Mommsen wrote that Weber's theory of democracy \\"lent itself all too readily to an authoritarian reinterpretation\\" Mommsen also associated Weber with the rise of Hitler: \\"Weber's teachings concerning charismatic leadership coupled with the radical formulation of the meaning of democratic institutions, contributed to making the German people inwardly ready to acclaim the leadership position of Adolf Hitler.\\" Max Weber's call for the democratic reform of the Wilhelmine state, and his involvement in the drafting of the Weimar Constitution, had led German intellectuals in the 1950s to consider him as an authority who could justify the democratic character of the new Federal Republic of Germany. Mommsen's thesis, that Max Weber supported parliamentary democracy as a means to serve the power interests of the German nation-state, met a sharp response, because, in Raymond Aron's words, this removed \\"the new German democracy of a 'founding father,' a glorious ancestor, and a spokesman of genius.\\" =Politics and sociology= Weber's political views have been considered to threaten the reputation of his sociology. G√ºnther Roth, Reinhard Bendix, and Karl Loewenstein have defended Weberian sociology by arguing that it stands separate from his political convictions. They consider Weber's distinction between scientific value-neutrality and evaluative politics to support this claim. In their view, Weber's politics should be interpreted as separate from the interpretation of his sociology. This idea was rejected by Mommsen. Mommsen wrote of continuities between Weber's \\"value-neutral\\" sociology and his \\"evaluative\\" politics. The second edition of Max Weber and German Politics 1890-1920 argued that \\"values and science, in Weber's thought, were interdependent.\\" Critics were dismissed as attempting \\"to shield Max Weber's sociological works against any possible criticism based on political aspects.\\" G√ºnther Roth responded in a 1965 American sociological journal, stating that Weber was a major target for a series of critiques aimed at political sociology in general, if not at most of social science. Roth also stated that Mommsen was removed from the interest of American sociologists in Weber, and his treatment becomes questionable when he interprets Weber's sociological analysis as political ideology. Roth stated that his \\"major intent\\" was \\"not to provide an historical defense of Weber but a review of critiques as they seem to bear on the raison d'etre of political sociology.\\" He claimed that Weber \\"must appear relativist and Machiavellian to all those who, for ideological reasons, cannot recognize any dividing line between political sociology and political ideology. Weber emphatically insisted on such a distinction, while his critics refuse to distinguish between his scholarship and his politics.\\" Raymond Aron did not consider Weber's sociology to stand above politics. He viewed Weber, in both politics and sociology, to be a typical \\"power-politician.\\" Aron wrote in 1971 that Weber \\"belongs to the posterity of Machiavelli as much as to the contemporaries of Nietzsche,\\" and that \\"the struggle for power between classes and individuals\\" seemed to Weber as the \\"essence\\" of politics.

Biography Born in Ukraine, Osip Aptekman studied medicine in Kharkov from 1870.. In 1873, as the start of the 'to the people' movement, when idealistic students travelled to the countryside hoping to radicalise the peasants, he and two other students from Kharkov, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and S.N.Kulasko set up a blacksmith shop in Gherea's home village, Slavyanka. They had to abandon the project to avoid arrest. He returned to Kharkov to complete his studies. In 1874, a few months after qualifying as a surgeon, he again 'went to the people' in the Volga region, and was one of the organisers of Land and Liberty (–ó–µ–º–ª—è –∏ –í–æ–ª—è - Zemlya i Volya). When Zemlya i Volya split in August 1879, with one faction - impatient with the failure to politicise the peasantry - breaking off the form the People's Will and plan the assassination of the Tsar, Aptekman joined the future founder of Russian Marxism, Georgi Plekhanov and in organising Black Partition (–ß–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –ü–µ—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª -Cherny Peredel) grouping which insisted that the continued use of propaganda was the best means of achieving social change. He edited the group's journal. In 1880, he was arrested and sentenced to five years exile in Yakutsk, in Siberia. When his term of exile ended, he emigrated to Munich, to resume his study of medicine. He returned to Russia in 1889, to practise as a country doctor in Nizhny Novgorod region. In 1893 and 1894 Aptekman was one of the primary leaders of the People's Rights Party (Partiia Narodnogo Prava), an illegal constitutionalist populist organization.Shmuel Galai, The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 60. But later in the same decade, when Marxist ideas began to spread among the young, he broke with the Narodniks and joined what became the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. When the RSDLP split, in 1903, he sided with the Mensheviks. During the 1905 revolution, he travelled from district to district, organising armed groups of revolutionaries, until he was arrested and imprisoned. Released in May 1906, he emigrated to Switzerland. After the outbreak of war in 1914. he sided with the Menshevik Internationalists, led by Yuri Martov Having returned to Russia after the February Revolution, in 1919, aged 70, he announced that he accepted the legitimacy of the communist government.

History  Cocktail drums were first put into production in the 1940s with the Carlton combo kit, consisting of a vertical 20 inch bass drum, a snare drum, cymbal and other assorted percussion. In some episodes of I Love Lucy (1951-57), Ricky Ricardo's band featured a man playing one (according to cocktail drummer Billy Conway). Eventually the companies Slingerland, Ludwig-Musser and Gretsch began producing cocktail drums that are more similar to what is used today. The typical drum consisted of a floor tom that was 14 inches in diameter and 24 to 26 inches tall, with both top and bottom drumheads. The bottom head was struck via a foot-pedal-operated beater and tuned to achieve a bass drum sound. The top head was struck with sticks. The top head is also fitted with a snare underneath to achieve a snare drum sound. The drum's height would normally require the musician to play it standing upright with one foot operating the pedal and one foot bearing the weight of the musician's body (as opposed to a trap set that is played sitting down). This made the drum quite easy to move from place to place, as opposed to moving a snare drum, stand for the snare drum, stool and bass drum for a trap set. However the tradeoff for this ease of transportation is the practice and balance required to play the instrument that is unnecessary when playing a trap set.  Modern use  Use of cocktail sets in modern music remains relatively rare but does remain a viable alternative for drummers looking to maximize portability and/or minimize stage space normally taken by the drum set. It is also useful as an alternative to a traditional drum set for providing a \\"retro\\" or \\"off-beat\\" appearance to a group. Some more modern cocktail drums are fitted with a baffle. The baffle is of a non-resonant material to prevent the bottom head's vibration from interacting with and \\"buzzing\\" the snare, which creates a sound much closer to that of two separate drums. Others use a small snare drum that is clamped or mounted in some fashion to the cocktail drum. This leaves the top head free to be used as a tom with the snares removed. The clamp provides the musician with a secure place for the snare drum without the added inconvenience of using a snare drum stand. Using two separate drums in this manner makes both drums easier to tune and provides much more consistent sound. Holders for cymbals, tom drums, cowbells and other various percussion instruments can be mounted to the cocktail drum depending on the musicians' needs. This makes the instrument very personal and few cocktail drums today are alike. = Notable players = * Drummer Steve Jordan plays his own Steve Jordan cocktail set professionally with various groups. * Peter Erskine also plays the Yamaha Club Jordan cocktail drum.

Only a selection of pubs are listed, organised by district and postcode (in brackets). The oldest of Sheffield's pubs date back to the 18th century, although a few, notably The Kings Head in Attercliffe, operate from buildings that are considerably older. Pubs in central Sheffield (S1 and S3) The Old Queen's Head * The Old Queen's Head, opened in the mid-19th century, is run from one of the oldest Grade II* listed buildings in Sheffield, dating from around 1475. * The Museum is built on the site of the mortuary of the Sheffield Hospitals, with its vaulted ceilings still existing in the beer cellar today. The pub has gone through many name changes since its opening in 1897 when it first opened as The Museum. As the Orchard Square development was built around it, the pub changed its name to The Orchard, The Brewing Trough and The Hogshead, finally reverting to its original name in February 2005. * The Brown Bear is one of the oldest pubs in the city centre and is a traditional two-roomed pub. It is housed in a Grade II listed building that dates from the late 18th century‚Äîpredating most of the buildings in the surrounding area (which include the Town Hall). The pub features walls covered with theatre posters from the nearby Crucible Theatre and Lyceum Theatre and is one of four Sheffield Samuel Smith houses. * The Adelphi Hotel was a pub in central Sheffield on the corner of Arundel Street and Sycamore Street, where the Crucible Theatre now stands. It is there that the Sheffield Wednesday Cricket Club was founded on Wednesday 4 September 1867 as well as the Yorkshire Cricket Club on 8 January 1863. * The Frog and Parrot includes Sheffield's oldest brewery, in which the record-breaking Roger and Out beer was once brewed. The public house was refurbished into a late-night bar in 2011. * The Yorkshire Grey, closed since 26 January 2006, first opened in 1833 as The Minerva.

The oldest property deed dates from 1832 but it is not known if a pub was opened at that time. By 1852, the property was a pub then called the Kelham Island Tavern (now the name of a pub around the corner of Russell Street). It was then called The Battle of the Alma until 1981. * The Kelham Island Tavern, Russell Street, is the only pub to have won CAMRA's National Pub of the Year award twice in a row. Pubs in Highfield, Lowfield and Heeley (S2 and S8) The Sheaf House Hotel on Bramall Lane in Highfield * The Sheaf House Hotel, Bramall Lane, opened in 1816.

Pubs in Handsworth (S9 and S13) * The Cross Keys (400 Handsworth Road) is the only pub in the UK built on holy ground (that of the neighbouring Saint Mary's Church). It is a very old building, but it has not always been a public house. The original structure was built in the mid-13th century though extensive re-building and modifications have occurred over its history. Initially, it was used as a Church House for the chaplains and lay clerks attached to Saint Mary's Church. Later it was further modified and became a school and, finally, in 1804, it was granted an ale licence and became a public house. * The Turf Tavern (336 Handsworth Road) was originally attached to the old village smithy (demolished in 1926 during the construction of Laverack Street). Records show that it was already registered as a beerhouse in 1833. Pubs in Crosspool and Lodge Moor (S10) * The Three Merry Lads (610 Redmires Road) originally a farm but was converted into a pub circ. 1837. It was owned by the Marsden family and was named after their three sons. * The Bell Hagg (3 Manchester Road) was originally built as a folly (\\"Hodgson's Folly\\") in 1832. It is a 5-storey structure built into the steep hillside of the Rivelin Valley. The Bell Hagg closed permanently in 2005. * The Crosspool Tavern (469 Manchester Road). The first Crosspool Tavern had originally been Mr. Joseph Sarson's cottage and workshop. He died shortly after its conversion to a tavern in 1824. The property remained in the family for over 100 years, and Sarson's widow ran the premises until the mid-1870s. It became a meeting place for the district and had its own skittle alley. The tavern was totally rebuilt in 1930 and the last member of the Sarson family to run it retired in 1935, having held the licence for 40 years. * The Plough Inn (288 Sandygate Road) was originally constructed in 1695 but the current structure resulted from rebuilding in 1927. It became the base for the Hallam Cricket Club. * The Shiny Sheff, Crimicar Lane, Lodge Moor. Pubs in Dore, Totley and Bradway (S17) The Cross Sythes pub in Totley Village in 1997 before refurbishment The Hare & Hounds in Dore Village. * The Cross Scythes, Baslow Road, once called Ye Olde Cross Stythes, is housed in one of the oldest buildings in Totley, around 300 years old. It was probably named after the landlord's secondary profession. The pub is exactly six miles away from Sheffield and Baslow and was often referred to as Halfway House. It is an extension of an old barn facing the old village green. * The Crown Inn, Hillfoot Road, Totley. The Crown is the oldest pub in Totley and was converted to a beer house in 1727 when the main road from Sheffield to London ran past outside the establishment. The first recorded reference to The Crown Inn is in 1813 when a Dorothy Dalton ran the pub. She is said to have taken over when her husband, George, a firebrick maker, died in the 1830s. Her eldest son, Thomas, took over. In the mid-19th century, a new turnpike, Baslow Road, was built which left The Crown out of the area of patronage. The pub benefited shortly afterwards from trade provided by the men building the Totley Tunnel. In between opening times landlords generally had to supplement their income by working as scythe makers or farmers. * The Fleur de Lys (now closed), Totley Hall Lane, is large mock half-timbered building built in 1933. The new pub replaces the now roofless old pub. Two houses next to the pub were demolished in the 1980s to make place for the new residential estate and pub car park. The old pub was situated near the village where the village's stocks were, hence the former name of Totley Hall Lane, Stocks Green. The name of the pub derives from the iris of the coat of arms of the Barker family, living in Totley Hall. * The Cricket Inn, Penny Lane, Totley Bents, was originally a farmhouse. It was opened as a pub during the construction of the nearby Totley Tunnel. It is now operated as a gastropub by BrewKitchen, selling beer from Thornbridge Brewery. Cricket matches take place on a cricket ground at the rear. * The Devonshire Arms, High Street, was built in the 18th century. It stands on the site of a public water trough. It has been the meeting place of many local societies and was extended following the demand made by the Dore Village Society. The society suggested the brewery opened the rear of The Devonshire Arms as a heritage centre. The brewery, liking the idea, renovated the derelict building and used it as an extension to the pub. * The Hare & Hounds, Church Street, is an early 17th-century limestone public house in the village in Dore. The pub is divided into several rooms due to later extensions. The building was neighboured by Sam Thorpe's grocery, corn and provision dealer to the east until the store was destroyed to make place for new shops and the pub's car park. * The Dore Moor Inn on Hathersage Road, was originally The Devonshire Arms. It was in this pub that the Dore Old School board of trustees hired Richard Furness as master in 1821. The establishment was renamed The Dore Moor Inn between then and 1906. Like The Peacock on Owler Bar, The Dore Moor Inn was a popular Sunday outing venue from Sheffield by the 1850s. * The Shepley Spitfire, Mickley Lane. * The Old Mother Redcap is one of only four pubs owned by the Samuel Smith Brewery in Sheffield, the others being The Red Grouse (Stocksbridge), The Brown Bear (city centre) and The Cow and Calf (Grenoside). * The Peacock Inn, Owler Bar, Totley Moor.

Their performance at the 2004 TMF awards caused Avril Lavigne to ask them to open for her on her Japan tour. At the end of September 2005, the band took part in MTV's Road Rally, in which they had to cross the USA from West coast to East Coast, earning their way and scoring shows. After starting in Los Angeles they ended up just beating Dutch competitor Di-rect in New York. The series was aired from November to January, gathering viewers attention. The second Nailpin album \\"White Lies & Butterflies\\" was released in April 2006, while the band toured Japan for the second time. They opened for Panic! at the Disco at a show in Tilburg in March 2008. After releasing the singles \\"Worn Out\\", \\"What Are You Waiting For\\", \\"They Don't Know\\" and \\"This Coma\\" from their second album White Lies And Butterflies, Nailpin released a new record called III and the single The Ending in April 2008.

It has been largely replaced in professional laboratories by other types of impedance measuring devices, though it is still in use among radio amateurs. It was developed at Boonton Radio Corporation in Boonton, New Jersey in 1934 by William D. Loughlin.Boonton Q-Meter Type 160-A, 1946 ‚Äî HP Virtual Museum Description A Q meter measures the quality factor of a circuit, Q, which expresses how much energy is dissipated per cycle in a non-ideal reactive circuit: : Q = 2 \\\\pi \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{Peak Energy Stored}}{\\\\mbox{Energy dissipated per cycle}}. \\\\, This expression applies to an RF and microwave filter, bandpass LC filter, or any resonator. It also can be applied to an inductor or capacitor at a chosen frequency. For inductors : Q = \\\\frac{X_L}{R} = \\\\frac{\\\\omega L}{R} Where X_L is the reactance of the inductor, L is the inductance, \\\\omega is the angular frequency and R is the resistance of the inductor. The resistance R represents the loss in the inductor, mainly due to the resistance of the wire. A Q meter works on the principle of series resonance. For LC band pass circuits and filters: : Q = \\\\frac{F}{BW} Where F is the resonant frequency (center frequency) and BW is the filter bandwidth. In a band pass filter using an LC resonant circuit, when the loss (resistance) of the inductor increases, its Q factor is reduced, and so the bandwidth of the filter is increased. In a coaxial cavity filter, there are no inductors and capacitors, but the cavity has an equivalent LC model with losses (resistance) and the Q factor can be applied as well. Operation Q-meter E9-4 Internally, a minimal Q meter consists of a tuneable RF generator with a very low (pass) impedance output and a detector with a very high impedance input. There is usually provision to add a calibrated amount of high Q capacitance across the component under test to allow inductors to be measured in isolation. The generator is effectively placed in series with the tuned circuit formed by the components under test, and having negligible output resistance, does not materially affect the Q factor, while the detector measures the voltage developed across one element (usually the capacitor) and being high impedance in shunt does not affect the Q factor significantly either. The ratio of the developed RF voltage to the applied RF current, coupled with knowledge of the reactive impedance from the resonant frequency, and the source impedance, allows the Q factor to be directly read by scaling the detected voltage.

She founded the Slits toward the end of 1976. After leaving that group in 1978, she joined the Raincoats and performed on their first album, The Raincoats. Early life and punk rock career Palmolive was born in Melilla, Spain, into a family of nine children, and grew up in M√°laga with her four sisters. A teenager who chafed against the political repression and conservatism of Francoist Spain, Palmolive left for London at 17 to \\"learn about life\\".Paloma McLardy, Interview with Dr. Norma Coates, April 2019. She returned to Madrid three months later to attend university, where she participated in anti-fascist activism, sometimes getting in trouble with the police. Before long, she returned to London and lived at a hippie squat at 101 Walterton Road where she met John Graham Mellor, who went by the name of Woody. The couple was together for several years. Woody, who played in pub- rock band the 101'ers just before punk emerged in the city, changed his name to Joe Strummer when he joined the Clash. Punk's \\"explosive energy\\" and sense of radical freedom inspired McLardy. Like many others on the scene, she acquired a punk name, Palmolive, inspired by Paul Simonon's playful mis- pronunciation of \\"Paloma\\". Returning to London after a break in Scotland, Palmolive wanted to become a mime artist, but the troupe she contacted needed a drummer instead. She accepted but stayed with them for a brief time. She never played an instrument before and fell in love with the drums. Palmolive soon joined a band, the Flowers of Romance, but Sid Vicious, who was the leader of the band, kicked her out after a few weeks because she would not sleep with him. Palmolive was determined to start a band composed only of women, because [she] \\"didn't want to be playing music and writing songs and have that be dependent on whether or not I sleep with a guy.\\"Paloma McLardy, interview with Dr. Norma Coates, April 2019.Pelly, 47. Nor did she want to follow the pack blindly by pretending to embrace people and ideas just because everyone else did. She wanted to live by her own idea of punk. Palmolive attended one of Patti Smith's October 1976 shows at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. There she saw 14-year-old Ari Up throwing a tantrum, decided she'd be a great person to front a new band, and asked her to join her band that same night. Ari immediately agreed. Palmolive next asked Kate Korus, whom she knew from the time of the 101'ers, to play guitar in the band; she too agreed. The three were joined by bassist Suzy Gutsy to form the first version of the Slits. On 17 January 1977, the English tabloid News of the World published the first article about female punks in London. The Slits were featured, along with the Castrators, another all-female band. Things were not working with Suzy, so Palmolive and Ari asked the Castrator's bassist, Tessa Pollitt, to join them. The Slits, now including Tessa, performed their first gig at the Harlesden Coliseum in London on 11 March 1977 along with the Buzzcocks, Subway Sect, and the Clash. Vivien Goldman's review of the article in Sounds proclaimed that the group had \\"PRESENCE\\". Ari's \\"unfettered vocal frenzy\\" coupled with Palmolive's ‚Äúfierce percussive pounding‚Äù and the overall freedom and wildness of the band's musical and physical performance took the audience by surprise. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones (of the Clash) said Kate didn't look cool, and proposed to replace her with Viv Albertine, Mick's girlfriend. Paloma agreed, and Viv joined the band. The Slits gained immediate attention and soon opened for the Clash's 1977 White Riot tour. Palmolive's passionate drumming was key to the overall brashness of the group's performances. The group's audacity - on-stage and in the street - invited violence by men offended by their refusal of traditionally feminine attitudes and attire. The Slits‚Äô raucous on-stage behaviour belied the democratic way they wrote their songs. Members would bring lyrics, then create the music collaboratively, exchanging ideas, and devising arrangements together. Palmolive wrote the lyrics to several of the Slits‚Äô initial songs, including Number One Enemy, Shoplifting, New Town, FM, and Adventures Close to Home. By the time that these songs were recorded for release on the Slits' first album, Cut, Palmolive was no longer in the band. She was unhappy due to tensions with the rest of the band over management and creative decisions, including posing nude on the cover of Cut. Disagreements built up and she was kicked out of the band just before they signed a contract with Island Records. Her drumming, along with some of the songs she wrote while with the band, can be heard on the group's 1977 and 1978 John Peel Sessions. In November 1978, Palmolive appeared as drummer with Spizzoil in a gig at the Hammersmith Odeon, then soon joined her friend Gina Birch and Ana DaSilva in the Raincoats. Palmolive recruited violinist Vicki Aspinall into the group by hanging an ad in Compendium Books, a ‚Äúcentre for alternative thinkers.‚Äù Her drumming is characterized by Raincoats biographer Jenn Pelly as \\"more like painting, abstract- expressionist, not at all like a metronome.\\" It fitted well with the band's non-linear, non-hierarchical approach to making music. Palmolive played on the Raincoats initial EP and their first album, The Raincoats, considered a \\"feminine response to rock'n'roll hegemony.\\" She drummed for the Raincoats on a UK tour with Rough Trade labelmates Kleenex (later renamed LiliPUT after Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of the tissue paper brand, threatened legal action) in 1979. Post-punk life Palmolive left the Raincoats after that tour for a pilgrimage to India with her friend Dave McLardy. The couple moved to Spain, then back to England before relocating to the United States, where they have lived in Cape Cod, Massachusetts since 1989. At her arrival she joined a controversial Pentecostal church named Victory Chapel in Hyannis, joining their extreme right-wing. She is no longer involved with organized religion but embraces Jesus. McLardy considers herself to be a \\"punk mystic\\", an identity that influences her outlook on life and her deep concern for social welfare and environmental issues. She has taught Spanish to children in public and private schools on Cape Cod for over 16 years, having earned a BA in American Studies from Lesley University along with teacher certification. Her influence on punk and her role as an inspiration for women in music is chronicled in the documentary film Here to Be Heard: The Story of the Slits, Jenn Pelly's book The Raincoats, part of the 33 1/3 books series and the God Save the Queens: Pioneras del Punk. McLardy participates in frequent Q&A; sessions at screenings of the film and other events, and was part of a keynote panel about women and music at the 2018 Pop Conference held at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington. McLardy appeared in the 2019 four-part Epix documentary Punk. She is working on her autobiography.

Animal euthanasia Animal euthanasia (euthanasia from Greek: Œµ·ΩêŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÉŒØŒ±; \\"good death\\") is the act of putting an animal to death or allowing it to die by withholding extreme medical measures. This is often done for domesticated livestock and house pets. Animal sacrifice =Hinduism= A water buffalo about to be sacrificed by a villager in the Durga Puja festival In Assam and West Bengal states of India and Nepal some Hindu temples sacrifice goats and chickens. Occasionally water buffalos are also sacrificed. Temples following Shakti school of Hinduism are the ones where sacrifice usually takes place. There are many village temples in Tamil Nadu where this kind of sacrifice takes place. Many animals are sacrificed during the three- day-long Gadhimai festival in Nepal. In 2009 it was speculated that more than 250,000 animals were killed In 2014, 100,000 animals were sacrificed which was a decrease from previous numbers. Animals range from buffalo to rats have been sacrificed. The temple authorities enacted a ban on animal sacrifice in 2015. =Indo-European= Horse sacrifice Many Indo-European religious branches show evidence for horse sacrifice, and comparative mythology suggests that they derive from a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) ritual. =Islam= Muslims engaged in the Hajj (pilgrimage) are obliged to sacrifice a lamb or a goat or join others in sacrificing a cow or a camel during the celebration of the Eid al-Adha, an Arabic term that means \\"Feast of Sacrifice\\", also known as al-Id al-Kabir (Great Feast), or Qurban Bayrami (Sacrifice Feast) in Turkic influenced cultures, Bakar Id (Goat Feast) in Indian subcontinent and Reraya Qurben in Indonesia. Other Muslims not on the Hajj to Mecca also participate in this sacrifice wherever they are, on the 10th day of the 12th lunar month in the Islamic calendar. It is understood as a symbolic re-enactment of Ibrahim's sacrifice of a ram in place of his son. Meat from this occasion is divided into three parts, one part is kept by the sacrificing family for food, the other gifted to friends and family, and the third given to the poor Muslims. The sacrificed animal is a sheep, goat, cow or camel. The animal sacrifice, states Philip Stewart, is not required by the Quran, but is based on interpretations of other Islamic texts.Philip J. Stewart (1979), Islamic law as a factor in grazing management: The Pilgrimage Sacrifice, The Commonwealth Forestry Review, Vol. 58, No. 1 (175) (March 1979), pp. 27-31 Goat sacrifice. The Eid al-Adha is major annual festival of animal sacrifice in Islam. In Indonesia alone, for example, some 800,000 animals were sacrificed in 2014 by its Muslims on the festival, but the number can be a bit lower or higher depending on the economic conditions.Animal Sacrifice in the World‚Äôs Largest Muslim-Majority Nation, The Wall Street Journal (September 23, 2015) According to Lesley Hazleton, in Turkey about 2,500,000 sheep, cows and goats are sacrificed each year to observe the Islamic festival of animal sacrifice, with a part of the sacrificed animal given to the needy who didn't sacrifice an animal. According to The Independent, nearly 10,000,000 animals are sacrificed in Pakistan every year on Eid.Eid al-Adha 2016: When is it and why does it not fall on the same date every year?, Harriet Agerholm, The Independent (6 September 2016) Millions of animal are brought into the Middle East from north Africa and parts of Asia and killed every year on Eid al-Adha. Other occasions when Muslims perform animal sacrifice include the 'aqiqa, when a child is seven days old, is shaved and given a name. It is believed that the animal sacrifice binds the child to Islam and offers protection to the child from evil. Animal slaughter Animal slaughter is the killing of nonhuman animals, and often refers to the slaughter of livestock. Animals may be slaughtered for humans to obtain food, and also if they are diseased and unable to be consumed as food. =Cultural and religious aspects= Halal meat HalƒÅl ( ', 'permissible'), also spelled \\"hallal\\" or \\"halaal\\", is any object or an action which is permissible to use or engage in, according to Islamic law. The term covers and designates not only food and drink but also all matters of daily life.Quran 7:157 There are three ways of halal killing: slitting of the throat (dabh), plunging the knife into the dimple over the breast bone (nahr), and killing in some other way ('aqr). The name of God (bismillah) must be said before killing the animal. The killing must be swift and with no prior stunning of the animal being killed. Blood must be drained out of the carcass. Ikejime Ikejime is a method of paralyzing fish to maintain the quality of its meat. The technique originated in Japan, but is now in widespread use. It involves the insertion of a spike quickly and directly into the hind brain, usually located slightly behind and above the eye, thereby causing immediate brain death. Kashrut (Kosher) Kashrut (also kashruth or kashrus, ) is the set of Jewish religious dietary laws. Food that may be consumed according to halakha (Jewish law) is termed kosher in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term kash√©r (), meaning \\"fit\\" (in this context, fit for consumption). Shechita is the process of slaughtering prescribed by Jewish dietary laws. Qurban QurbƒÅn usually denotes the sacrifice of a livestock animal during Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holiday. Shechita In Shechita the killing must be performed by a shochet (). The process involves severing the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins and vagus nerve swiftly with a special knife which is extremely sharp. This is done with the intention of causing a rapid drop in blood pressure in the brain and loss of consciousness, to reduce the pain felt by the animal and exsanguinate it at the same time.What is Shechita? chabad.org Tza'ar ba'alei chayim Tza'ar ba'alei chayim (literally means: \\"the suffering of living creatures\\") is the Jewish principle which bans inflicting unnecessary pain on animals. This concept is not clearly enunciated in the written Torah, but was accepted by the Talmud (Bava Metzia 32b) as being a Biblical mandate. =Laboratory testing= In 2014 nearly 25million animals were killed in the United States for laboratory testing, with most being \\"designer\\" mice. =Legal aspects= Humane Slaughter Act The Humane Slaughter Act is a United States federal law formulated to decrease livestock suffering during slaughter. The act was approved on August 27, 1958. Animals killing each other The smallest animal that can kill a human is the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. N. fowleri does this by crawling up the target's nose and eating the targets' brain. Most attacks happen in moist areas like ponds or lakes. In the middle is the blowfish (fugu) that can kill animals with its toxic organs that contain tetrodotoxin. The largest animal killer is the blue whale, which is the largest animal on Earth. The blue whale mostly feeds on krill (euphausiacea) which is a small, abundant crustacean. Blue whales are almost entirely killed by killer whales and by humans. Chimpanzees wage war against rival groups, killing rival males and eating the baby chimps. Ants also wage warfare on other ants, even engaging in cannibalism. Killer plants =Deadly if consumed= Many plant based items if eaten in sufficient quantities can cause seizures, spasms, tremors, gastroenteritis, cardiovascular collapse, coma, and then death.

Some plants can kill a rodent with various methods. * Albany or Western Australian Pitcher Plant (Cephalotus) * Pitcher plant (Nepenthes northiana)kills and then digests frogs and rats * Venus Flytrap (Dionaea) * Waterwheel Plant (Aldrovanda) Hunting In North America, animals such as bear, wolf, caribou, moose, elk, boar, sheep and bison are hunted. In South America, deer and other species are hunted. In Europe, sheep, boar, goats, elk, deer, and other species are hunted. In Asia, several species of deer, bear, sheep and other species are hunted. In Australia, several species of deer and wild boar are hunted. =Big-game= Big-game hunting is the hunting of large game, almost always large terrestrial mammals, for meat, other animal by-products (such as horn or bone), trophy or sport. The term is historically associated with the hunting of Africa's \\"big five\\" game (lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and rhinoceros), and with tigers and rhinoceroses on the Indian subcontinent. Along with the big five animals, many other species are hunted including but not limited to kudu, antelope, and hartebeest. Moose, elk, bear, mountain lion, caribou, bison and deer are the largest game hunted in North America, which is where most big-game hunting is conducted today. Big-game hunting is conducted in Africa, North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. In Africa, lion, Cape buffalo, elephant, giraffe and other large game animals are hunted. =Roadkill= Animals are often killed by moving vehicles. This is known as roadkill. In one case in North Carolina in early 2016 a deer was road killed and butchered outside a restaurant. A concerned citizen took cell phone images and called the police. The restaurant owner was contacted by the police and stated that he had no intention of selling roadkill meals to his customers. Because the deer was butchered outside the restaurant the authorities decided to drop the matter. The restaurant owner also stated he was not aware of any prohibition against eating roadkill; he merely wanted to try something new. In many areas in the United States it is illegal to consume roadkill. However, it is estimated that 34 percent of U.S. states have passed laws allowing the gleaning of roadkill. Alternatives and reactions =Cecil the lion= When Cecil the lion was killed in Africa in summer 2015 by Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer it caused a worldwide commotion. Palmer went into hiding when it was alleged that his guides and he had lured Cecil out of a Zimbabwe animal preserve at which point Palmer admittedly shot Cecil with an arrow. Cecil ran off wounded for 40 hours before Palmer's guides found Cecil, admittedly shot him, and decapitated him, leaving Cecil's head and tracking collar behind. Palmer later broke silence to say he was heartbroken over the pain he had caused his dental staff. =People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals= People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is an animal rights group founded in America and is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It is led by Ingrid Newkirk. It claims to have 3million members and supporters, which would make it the largest animal rights group in the world. Its slogan is \\"animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way.\\"For its focus and claim to be the largest AR group in the world, see \\"PETA's mission statement\\", PETA, accessed May 1, 2013 * For the number of employees, see Galkin, Matthew. \\"I Am an Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA\\", HBO, 2007. =Veganism and vegetarianism= Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of all animal products, particularly in diet. Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, insects and the flesh of any other animal and may also include abstention from by- products of animal slaughter). Vegetarians, however, may consume eggs, dairy products and honey. =Ahimsa= Ahimsa is an important tenet of 3 Indian- origin religions (Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism). Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences.Stephen H.

The main plot of the ride revolves around the authorities attempting to evacuate civilians away from Kong's rampage and to Roosevelt Island. Ride experience =Queue= Guests entered the attraction through a facade recreating Pennsylvania Station as it appeared in New York City at the beginning of the 20th century. Within the six-story walls of the massive show building, guests would find themselves in an elaborate production set simulating a New York City Subway station, Manhattan's Roosevelt Island Tramway station and a surrounding city block (intricately detailed from garbage cans and graffiti covering the walls, to fully stocked storefronts). However, the queue line would frequently be updated to include modern-day movie posters and advertisements. Overhead television monitors displayed a special WWOR-TV news report of King Kong's attack, entitled \\"Kong on the Loose\\". Real-life news anchor Rolland Smith reported that the giant ape King Kong had escaped its confines and was wreaking havoc on the streets of New York. Kong had already destroyed two elevated trains and was rapidly approaching the East River with authorities seemingly powerless to stop him. Clips from the 1976 film version of King Kong, portraying the beast's rampage, played during these newscasts, as did alerts from the Emergency Broadcast System telling everyone in the city to remain indoors due to what was lurking outside. After the TV Monitors Displayed breaking news that New York City was being attacked by a giant ape, This updating did not extend to the news reports playing on the queue line's TVs, which would show commercials for shows that were current as of the ride's 1990 opening, like Out of This World and The New Lassie. As the guests proceeded through the line queue, they would continually hear about King Kong's location along with his path of destruction. By the end of Kongfrontation's run guests were bombarded with three decades at once. The queue made its way up a long ramp and ended at the elevated Manhattan station of the Roosevelt Island Tramway. =Ride= Upon arriving at the station, guests boarded a large, open-air aerial tram vehicle. There, a live guide aboard the tram informed them that they were being evacuated off of Manhattan Island and over to Roosevelt Island during Kong's attack. The tram's radio was tuned to the police emergency frequency so that guests could be informed of Kong's location in the city. The giant ape was destroying the city, he destroyed two elevated trains, buildings, houses and he was knocking down anything in his path. Authorities could do nothing to stop him, The tram traveled above the streets of downtown New York City where guests could view Kong's path of destruction. There was a water geyser from a broken fire hydrant, broken steam pipes, crashed and overturned cars, and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track. A police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio, alerting that Kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a power pole. Kong's silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram. As the tram passed the power pole, it tipped over and its electrical transformer exploded, unleashing a shower of sparks and fire, which ignited the derailed elevated subway train. Rounding a bend and nearing the East River, the tram encountered Kong hanging from the Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island, the sound of giant footsteps seeming to follow. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the view of what lay ahead. The tram operator urged the chopper to turn off the light, and in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to grab, lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small television monitors lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his way away from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat. =Photograph= Guests exited the attraction and traveled down a series of ramps into a King Kong themed gift shop called Safari Outfitters Ltd. There, a Kodak photo opportunity booth was located where guests could pose with King Kong, who appeared to grip them in front of a Queensboro Bridge backdrop. History =Construction and design= The attraction was based on the 1976 film remake of King Kong and was designed by Totally Fun Company and MCA Planning and Development. Two King Kong animatronic figures were built for the attraction and were scaled to be tall with an arm span of . The one used for the \\"street sequence\\" weighed approximately , while a lighter figure, that weighed approximately , was used for the \\"bridge sequence\\" of the ride. The Kongs were built to be both analog and digital, giving them the ability to perform sixty two separate functions. A \\"smellitzer\\" device was constructed to give the Kong figures \\"banana breath,\\" which was emitted during roars at the riders. The ride system was developed by Arrow Dynamics, who subcontracted the manufacturing out to Intermountain Lift, Inc. The soundstage show building covered an area of and a height of six floors. The slabs used to construct the exterior walls of the building are the largest of its kind ever used for construction. To make the city setting appear as realistic as possible, fifty facades were modeled after Manhattan's Lower East Side circa 1976. News reports from the TV station WWOR-TV were integrated into the ride and queue line as MCA/Universal owned the station at the time the attraction was designed. The helicopters that were used in the ride were molded from actual helicopters and were true to size. Kongfrontation opened to the public on June 7, 1990, along with the park. Replicating the newscasts from WWOR, the video in the queue monitors was real; production for the audio in the ride work and pre-show videos was handled by John Miceli, Tony Miceli, David Kneupper; Stan Winston; at the time with Magic Lantern Productions and later Soundelux, who contracted all audio and video design for the ride. Since WWOR had passed from the prior corporate owners (RKO General, a subsidiary of GenCorp, now Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings) to MCA/Universal (due to a litany of offenses dating back to the 1960s, but ultimately because RKO had withheld evidence of corporate misconduct by General Tire), there were still conflicts in the prior audio from broadcast use, as it was not cleared for location-based entertainment use, and the script was stylized for the ride experience. The announcer for the script as the WWOR reporter was provided by voiceover talent Ron Knight, who also provided voice work for many of the voices of the chopper pilots, radio dispatch, sheriffs and other characters, as well as voice-over work for two of the other premiere attractions, E.T. Adventure, and Jaws. Knight also became the national announcer for Nickelodeon for all show promotion and network branding announcements originating from the Nickelodeon Studios facilities inside the park. Reign of Kong (July 2015) Originally a scene for the Universal Studios Hollywood Studio Tram Tour, Kongfrontation has been credited as being the catalyst for the Universal Studios Florida project (which has since evolved into the Universal Orlando Resort). Universal originally envisioned the attraction as the crown jewel of the Florida park. While the attraction drew substantial crowds, it had an unreliable track record due to the complex special effects involved. Universal engineers attempted several times to improve reliability, which ultimately required removing functionality of Kong by limiting his movements and some of the background effects. The tram operators at this attraction would usually have a playful rivalry with the skippers at the Jaws attraction, sometimes challenging each other to see which attraction could get more guests. =Closure= On August 16, 2002, Universal Studios Florida announced that Kongfrontation would be closing permanently on September 8. There has never been a solid reason given by Universal for the closure, although it is speculated that high staffing, operations and maintenance costs were the main reasons. The attraction joined a list of original Universal Studios Florida attractions that have since been retired and replaced, including Ghostbusters Spooktacular, The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera, Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies, Nickelodeon Studios, An American Tail Theatre, The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show, Dynamite Nights Stunt Spectacular, Earthquake: The Big One, Back to the Future: The Ride and Jaws. On May 6, 2015, after a 13-year absence, Universal announced that King Kong would finally be returning to the Universal Orlando Resort in the summer of 2016 with the opening of an all new attraction at Islands of Adventure called Skull Island: Reign of Kong. Other uses During Halloween Horror Nights II at the park, the attraction was converted into an attraction known as Tramway of Doom, which featured appearances by the character Darkman. Guests were also permitted to walk on the ground during Halloween Horror Nights XI, in a show titled The Oozone Fright Club, where guests entered an employees only area of the queue line for the show, and then had to exit to the ground where another haunted maze awaited. The first street scene of the attraction was used as the Doom City Battlezone on the martial arts television show WMAC Masters See also *List of amusement rides based on film franchises *King Kong Encounter References External links *Kongfrontation at Orlando Rocks *King Kong: The Monster Who Created Universal Studios Florida By Peter Alexander, Totally Fun Company *Kongfrontation Photos *More Kongfrontation Photos showing the intricate detail of the ride's 1970's New York art direction Category:King Kong (franchise) Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1990 Category:Amusement rides that closed in 2002 Category:Former Universal Studios Florida attractions Category:Universal Parks & Resorts attractions by name Category:Amusement rides based on film franchises Category:Amusement rides manufactured by Arrow Dynamics Category:Animatronic attractions Category:Amusement rides manufactured by Totally Fun Company Category:1990 establishments in Florida Category:2002 disestablishments in Florida ","title":"Kongfrontation"},{"id":"3012925","text":"Clipston may refer to the following places in the United Kingdom: *Clipston, Northamptonshire *Clipston, Nottinghamshire See also *Clipstone ","title":"Clipston"},{"id":"3012929","text":"The molecular formula C16H13ClN2O may refer to: * Diazepam * Mazindol ","title":"C16H13ClN2O"},{"id":"3012930","text":"Portrait of Jacques-Jean Barre, from Album du Salon de 1840 by Jean Baptiste Marius Augustin Challamel, Paris, 1840 Ceres series designed by Jacques-Jean Barre / 1849 1850 / 3e stamp of France Jacques-Jean Barre (3 August 1793 in Paris-10 June 1855 in Paris) was the general engraver at the Monnaie de Parishttps://www.monnaiedeparis.fr/en/collections-patrimoniales/portrait-of- jacques-jean-barre-chief-coin-engraver between 1842 and 1855.

In 1990 Moore's short-lived imprint Mad Love published two of the planned twelve issues. The series was picked up by Kevin Eastman's Tundra Publishing, but the completed third issue did not print, and the remaining issues, whose artwork was to be handled by Sienkiewicz's assistant Al Columbia, were never finished. The work marks a move, on Moore's part, away from genre fiction, in the wake of the success of Watchmen. Moore weaves mathematics into a narrative of socioeconomic changes wrought by an American corporation's building of a shopping mall in a small, traditional English town, and the effects of the economic policies of the Margaret Thatcher administration in the 1980s. Publication history The planned 500-page graphic novel was to be serialised one chapter at a time over twelve issues. The series was printed on high-quality paper in an unusual square format. The first two issues were produced by Alan Moore's self-publishing company Mad Love, with writing by Moore and artwork by Bill Sienkiewicz. However, the workload for the comic was intense, and Sienkiewicz stalled. By the time he backed out of the series, the third issue was still incomplete and rising overhead crippled the production. Kevin Eastman, creator of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, stepped in and attempted to have his company Tundra Publishing publish Big Numbers. Moore and Eastman asked Sienkiewicz' assistant, Al Columbia, to become the series' sole artist and Roxanne Starr to be its letterer. Columbia worked on the fourth issue but, for reasons which remain unclear, destroyed his own artwork and abandoned the project as well.Young, Robert. \\"Zero Sum Masterpiece: The Division of Big Numbers (AKA Searching for Al Columbia)\\", The Comics Interpreter Vol. 2 #3, 2004, 8‚Äì18. Big Numbers #3 and #4 were never published, and the series remains unfinished. In 1999, ten pages of Sienkiewicz's art for Big Numbers #3 were published in the first (and only) issue of the magazine Submedia.\\"Big Numbers.\\" Submedia 1.1 (1999), p. 54. In 2009, a photocopy of the complete lettered art for Big Numbers #3 surfaced on eBay. The purchaser contacted Moore, and with his permission published scans of the art on LiveJournal. History Moore announced the series as his popularity was at a peak. The success of Watchmen had made him a star writer. Moore wanted to move away from genre fiction; Big Numbers was to have no genre, and deal with themes of shopping and mathematics. Mad Love ran into a number of difficulties: the proceeds from AARGH! were donated to defending homosexual rights; the production costs of Big Numbers were high; and Moore's polyamorous relationship with wife Phyllis and their lover Debbie Delano fell apart. Kevin Eastman's Tundra Publishing agreed to publish the rest of the series. Sienkiewicz's detailed artwork was time-consuming to produce. He hired the 19-year-old Al Columbia as an assistant, but the pressures of the project combined with personal issues led him to quit Big Numbers after the second issue's publication. Jon J Muth and Dave McKean were among the names rumoured as replacements. Ultimately the job fell to the inexperienced Columbia. Tundra tried to promote Columbia by publishing his first stand-alone comic book, Dog Head, in 1992, and put out a Columbia-drawn poster for Big Numbers. The pressure turned out to be too much for the young artist, who is said to have destroyed the artwork for the fourth issue in 1992, and was not heard from again until the publication of The Biologic Show in 1994. Plot Set in the fictional English town of Hampton, the book explores the socioeconomic changes brought about by globalisation on an insular community, represented by the building of a shopping mall by a large American corporation. Meanwhile, the community also experiences pressure from prime minister Margaret Thatcher's economic policies, including cuts to health care and welfare. Style and analysis Each page is laid out in a rigid twelve-panel grid. The all-white speech balloons are circular, rather than the more common shape. Adaptations In a 2001 interview Moore indicated that he did not believe Big Numbers could ever be completed as comics. However, he spoke of the possibility of the comic being adapted as a television series by Picture Palace Productions, as he had the whole story mapped out on a sheet of A1 paper, and five episodes written. An account of the unravelling of the Big Numbers project is included in Eddie Campbell's 2001 graphic novel Alec: How to Be an Artist.Campbell, Eddie.

Formed in 1987, it played a leading role in the ouster of the government of Siad Barre in 1991, and became a target of the Unified Task Force campaign in 1993. Following infighting, the USC later splintered into smaller groups. By 2000, with the establishment of a Transitional National Government (TNG), a process of disarmament was put in motion and some moderate ex-USC leaders were incorporated into the new interim administration.  History  With its base centered on the Hawiye clan, the United Somali Congress was founded in Rome in January, 1987. Its military wing was formed in late 1987 in Ethiopia, and led by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid until his demise in 1996. He was succeeded by his son Hussein Mohamed Farrah, by which time the Aidid faction of the organization was also known as the Somali National Alliance (SNA), often the USC/SNA. The USC was formed in response to severe acts against the Hawiye tribe by the government of Mohamed Siaad Barre. During the period of 1987 to 1991, President Barre launched massive crack downs and use of force against the Hawiye in their homeland in Southern and Central Somalia. The most notable incidents were in Central Somalia in the area near Galkacyo in November 1989 which resulted in the deaths of many civilians at the hands of the Somali National Army. These mass deaths resulted in the future USC Chairman, General Mohammed Farah Aidid quitting his post as Somali Ambassador to India and joined the USC training camps in Mustahiil, Ethiopia. Military successes by the USC would be instrumental in bringing about the ouster of the Barre government on January 26, 1991, but the USC failed to manage a political settlement with its rivals, the SNM, SPM and the SSDF, and also fragmented within its own leadership after Ali Mahdi Muhammad was declared interim President. Upon the naming of Ali Mahdi Muhammed as President, the USC split into two. The USC/SNA emerged under Mohammed Aidid and the United Somali Congress/Somali Salvation Alliance (USC/SSA) of Ali Mahdi Muhammed. The USC/SNA came under the control of Mohamed Aidid's son, Hussein Mohamed Farah Aidid after the father's death in 1996. The USC/SSA eventually came under control of the Deputy Chairman, Musa Sudi Yalahow. Both USC factions made peace with each other in August 1998, though this caused a violent split between Yalahow and Ali Mahdi Muhammed, and fighting continued in Mogadishu. Eventually both Hussein Aidid and Yalahow reconciled and joined the Somali Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC) in 2002, in opposition to the Transitional National Government (TNG). This caused a rift between the USC/SSA supporters of Yalahow and Omar Muhamoud Finnish (also known as Mahmud Muhammad Finish), who continued to support the TNG. Fighting between the two caused many deaths in Mogadishu. In 2001, Hussein Aidid founded the Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC), a new armed opposition group. Growing out of the Somali National Alliance, it was originally formed to oppose the nascent Transitional National Government (TNG) and the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA) in the 2001‚Äì2004 period. However, it eventually settled its differences with the government in 2004, with some moderate leaders incorporated into the new interim administration.

Hollmann was born in Solingen, Germany. He became interested in radio and even as a teenager subscribed to the technical magazines of the day. Late in World War I he became a prisoner of war of the French and did not return to Germany until 1920. He then studied at the Technical University at Darmstadt until he received his doctorate in 1928. Hollmann's doctoral research included the development of an ultra-short-wave transmitter and receiver for centimetre and decimetre waves. This gained the attention of Telefunken, and ultimately led to their development of the first microwave telecommunication system. In 1930 Hollmann moved to the Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Oscillatory Research in Berlin. There he continued studies in microwaves and cathode ray tubes and also worked on the ionosphere research and radio astronomy. In 1933 Hollmann became a lecturer at the Technical University in Berlin. In January 1934, Hans-Karl von Willisen and Paul-G√ºnther Erbsl√∂h started a company called Gesellschaft f√ºr elektroakustische und mechanische Apparate (GEMA). With Hollmann as a consultant, GEMA built a system using interference detection in the autumn of 1934. It operated at 50 cm wavelength and could detect ships up to 10 km distance. By 1935, they used pulse-modulation, allowing measurement of range (distance to the target), and developed the technology into two applications. For naval use, the Seetakt system used a wavelength of 80 cm. A land based version at 120 cm wavelength was also developed as Freya. Telefunken set up a radar business in 1933 based on Hollmann's work and developed a much shorter-range gun-laying system called W√ºrzburg. During World War II, Freya and W√ºrzburg worked in pairs. Freya would spot the incoming aircraft while the W√ºrzburg calculated the distance and height. In 1935, Hollmann wrote two books on microwaves, Physics and Technique of Ultra-short Waves and Seeing with Electromagnetic Waves, which were the inspiration for the development of centimetre radar in other countries despite some censorship of their contents. During the war he supervised many research institutes in occupied countries and saved many scientists from being deported to Germany. He established the Laboratory for High-Frequency Engineering and Ultrasound in Lichterfelde, Berlin. Part of their work involved making transmitters for the Navy. Here he brought in Max Bense. At this time there was speculation about a future possibility of teleporting human beings from Germany to California. His home and his laboratory were destroyed during the war. After the war he was not allowed to work on microwaves but he turned his attention to a wide range of other fields in electronics. In 1947 he accepted an offer from the US Government to work for NASA in California. In 1949 he sent Bense a copy of Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (1948), stimulating the latter's interest in cybernetics. He was married to Gisela Schimmelbusch and had three children. He died in Los Angeles in 1960.

It originally aired on April 3, 2002. The episode parodies actor Russell Crowe's real-life altercations. In the episode, the boys must watch his show in order to see a teaser for an upcoming Terrance and Phillip movie. However, bad luck forces them to race across town searching for a working TV. Plot  Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters are at Stan's house to see Fightin' Around the World with Russell Crowe. The boys do not actually care about the show, but watch it solely to see the new Terrance and Phillip movie trailer, which will premiere during one of the show's commercial breaks. Shelly, Stan's aggressive older sister, being on her period, only allows them to watch if they bring her some tampons; the boys send out Butters to get some. Cartman thinks the TV's color is \\"saturated\\" and attempts to fix a loose cable, causing the TV to explode. After Butters returns, the boys leave to watch at Kyle's house, forcing his little brother Ike away from the TV. Their father, Gerald, reprimands Kyle for not letting Ike watch the MacNeil/Lehrer Report, forcing the boys to find another place to watch the show. Throughout the episode, several parts of Fightin' Around the World with Russell Crowe are shown. This \\"children's show\\" depicts Crowe as a muscular sailor with an exaggerated Australian accent who randomly beats people up. He sails the world with Tugger, his anthropomorphic tugboat who communicates with him by exhuming fumes, and who Crowe considers his best friend. Throughout the show, Crowe and Tugger visit several places, including Tiananmen Square in China and The Bronx in New York City. Crowe describes the locals there in a wildlife documentary style similar to such shows as The Crocodile Hunter and Man vs. Wild, then proceeds to pick fights with them. At one point, Crowe also attacks the show's editor for cutting one of the fighting scenes short. Later on, Crowe sings Tugger a song from his new album, accompanying himself on his acoustic guitar. The song is so horrible that it drives Tugger to do a suicide attempt. He is brought to the hospital and makes a full recovery. The boys discuss where they can find a television to watch the commercial breaks on. Cartman's house is being fumigated and Butters insists they cannot go to his house, so they go to Chef to watch on his new, hyper-modern plasma screen TV. To their disappointment, the trailer is not shown during the first commercial break. When Chef tries to demonstrate some of the functionalities of his new TV, he accidentally transforms it into an ED-209-like robot, which goes on a rampage through South Park. During the remainder of the episode, Chef follows the destructive television around while talking to customer service on his cellphone in an effort to deprogram the machine. The boys go to watch TV at the local bar, only to be kicked out for being underage. They then arrive at Shady Acres, South Park's retirement home, where they manage to catch the second commercial break, but the trailer is again not aired. The elderly grow annoyed with the boys and force them out by simultaneously defecating. In desperation, they try to brave the fumes at Cartman's house, but this proves unbearable. The boys decide to head back to Stan's house to use an old black-and-white television which Stan remembers having. Upon arriving at the front door, Butters realizes he never gave Shelly her tampons. Before they can enter the house, they are washed away by a large tidal wave of Shelly's menstrual blood. The boys then resort to watching TV with a group of crack-addicted homeless people, only to be attacked by Chef's rampaging television-robot which blasts away the device. With nowhere else to go, the boys ask Butters why they cannot watch at his house. Butters explains that his parents are out of town and he does not have a babysitter. Stunned for a few seconds by this revelation, they hurriedly rush to Butters' house (with Stan saying: \\"We'll kill Butters later!\\"), arriving just in time to view the last commercial break, wherein the trailer is finally shown. The trailer is anti-climactic: it features a textual announcement in the form of words flying at the screen, followed by a few seconds of Terrance and Phillip at a ranch wearing cowboy hats and farting. It shows almost nothing of the actual film. Nevertheless, the boys are ecstatic over finally getting to see the trailer after all. Meanwhile, Chef is still on the phone with the customer service line, unsuccessfully trying to stop his TV. Inspiration and production Between 1999 and 2002, Russell Crowe was involved in a few public altercations, which are spoofed in the South Park episode. In 1999, Crowe was part of a midnight brawl with multiple people outside a bar in Coffs Harbour, Australia, which was caught on security camera. In 2002, Crowe fought with businessman Eric Watson inside Zuma, a Japanese restaurant in London. Actor Ross Kemp leaped in to separate the two. During the 2002 BAFTA awards, Crowe quoted a poem by Patrick Kavanagh during his acceptance speech of the award for his performance in A Beautiful Mind. Upon broadcast, the poem was cut out due to time constraints and copyright issues. This angered Crowe and led to a confrontation between him and producer Malcolm Gerrie, during which Crowe \\"was abusive and behaved very unreasonably.\\" The South Park episode contains a reference to this incident during the scene in which Crowe attacks his editor, saying, \\"My fighting is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle!\\" In the DVD commentary for the episode, Trey Parker noted that, by 2002, Crowe had gotten himself into fights on three different continents, which led to the idea of Fightin' Around the World with Russell Crowe, since Crowe had literally fought all over the world. Parker said that the initial inspiration for the episode, however, came from a personal experience he and Matt Stone had with the actor. Parker and Stone became acquainted with Crowe at an award show around the time that the duo got awards for Bigger, Longer & Uncut. They described Crowe as \\"a really cool guy\\" accompanied by easy-going \\"Aussie\\" friends. One day, the two were invited to a studio by Crowe, who was finishing his album and asked the duo to listen to it and provide feedback. Flattered, they accepted the invitation. However, when they arrived, about eight of Crowe's acquaintances were also there. Crowe then proceeded to play a CD of the album, which seemed completely mixed and finished already. No one in the room seemed willing to comment on the songs, and it soon became apparent to Parker and Stone that Crowe simply wanted everyone to sit there and listen to the album. Parker said that while Crowe was \\"a very talented actor,\\" he was a poor musician, describing his record as \\"Bon Jovi meets Hepatitis B.\\" At one point, a song came along which featured handclapping. Parker, trying to think of something constructive to say, suggested that Crowe mix out the handclaps. \\"And literally, the place just got quiet,\\" Parker said, with all attendees supposedly in shock that Parker would dare to critique Crowe. According to Parker, Crowe then nonchalantly took a drag of his cigarette and said, \\"Well, maybe I'll mix them off the version I give to you.\\" After the album was finally over, Robbie Robertson showed up at the studio, and Crowe started the album all over again. Exhausted and unwilling to listen to the album a second time, the duo got up and left. Despite this uncomfortable incident with him, Parker and Stone stated that there were no hostile feelings between them and Crowe, describing him as generally kind to them and reiterating that he was \\"an extremely talented actor.\\" They remained on good terms, with Crowe even writing the duo a letter to congratulate them on the success of their movie Team America: World Police in 2004. In July 2005, three years after the episode first aired, Crowe was involved in a highly publicized incident in which he was arrested for throwing a telephone at a concierge of the Mercer Hotel in New York City. The event reinforced his reputation for having a short fuse. \\"The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer\\" is the only South Park episode to take place in real time, i.e. the fictional events in it take up just as much time as the episode lasts. Even the beginnings and the endings of the commercial breaks of the Russell Crowe show within the episode's universe coincide with the actual commercial breaks of the South Park show in real life. Home release \\"The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,\\" along with the other 16 episodes from the sixth season, were put on a three-disc DVD set called South Park: the Complete Sixth Season, which was released in the United States on October 11, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10. References External links * The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer.

It had a population of approximately 7,600 in 2013. General The city of Staufen im Breisgau lies in the Land district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald (Breisgau-Upper Black Forest) in the German State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The City of Staufen has approximately 7,700 inhabitants and forms, together with the community of M√ºnstertal, Black Forest, a community administrative unit. It is noted in history and culture for its association with Dr Faustus who, according to one source,The Zimmern Chronicle, ca. 1565 died in or near Staufen around 1540. Geography Staufen lies at the foot of the Black Forest at the exit from the M√ºnstertal. The Black Forest valley of Neumagen goes here directly over into the Rhine plain. The piedmont of the Black Forest is less distinct. North of the valley exit, the steeply rising old castle ruins dominates; to the southwest begins the hilly landscape of the Markgr√§flerland. Staufen lies on the border between two natural and economic areas: the Rhine plain up to the piedmont with its cultivation of grain, vineyards and vegetables; and the Black Forest, with its cattle and wood, and, until the 19th century, silver mines. Geothermal drilling controversy Cracks at the historic Town Hall due to damage from geothermal drilling. To the left, a piece of fake tape reading Staufen darf nicht zerbrechen! (Staufen must not fall apart!), protesting the damage.Tom Scott - The German Town That's Literally Breaking Apart, Youtube Since 2008, the centre of the city has reported to have risen some ,Jens Lubbadeh, Spiegel.de \\"Eine Stadt zerrei√üt\\", Der Spiegel, 15 November 2008 . (Partial translation) after initially sinking a few millimeters.Bojan Pancevski, \\"Geothermal probe sinks German city\\", The Daily Telegraph, 31 March 2008. This has caused considerable damage to buildings in the city centre, including the historical town hall. The cause for this geological change has been identified as a drilling operation conducted in the summer and autumn of 2007 to provide geothermal heating to the city hall. The drilling perforated an anhydrite layer and caused high-pressure groundwater to come into contact with the anhydrite, which then began to expand. By 2010, some sections of town had risen by .Hans Christof Wagner, \\"Risse in Staufen: Pumpen, reparieren und hoffen\\", Badische-Zeitung, 17 October 2010 In July 2013, no end to the rising process was in sight.Franz Schmider, \\"Kein Ende der Hebungen in Staufen in Sicht\\", Badische-Zeitung, 13 July 2013 \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- Data from the TerraSAR-X radar satellite before and after the changes have confirmed the localised nature of the situation. \\"A geochemical process called anhydrite swelling has been confirmed as the cause of these uplifts. This is a transformation of the mineral anhydrite (anhydrous calcium sulphate) into gypsum (hydrous calcium sulphate). A pre-condition for this transformation is that the anhydrite is in contact with water, which is then stored in its crystalline structure\\". Infrastructure Staufen is located next to the M√ºnstertal railway which runs from Bad Krozingen to M√ºnstertal, Black Forest.

He was a major force in the development of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Education and early years Spitzer was born in White Plains, New York, in 1932. He received his bachelor's degree in psychology from Cornell University in 1953 and his M.D. from New York University School of Medicine in 1957. He completed his psychiatric residency at New York State Psychiatric Institute in 1961 and graduated from Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research in 1966. Spitzer wrote an article on Wilhelm Reich's theories in 1953 which the American Journal of Psychiatry declined to publish.Spitzer, Robert L. \\"The Story of Robert L. Spitzer's Paper, 'An Examination of Wilhelm Reich's Demonstration of Orgone Energy'\\", The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice, Vol. 4, No. 1, Spring‚ÄìSummer 2005. Career Spitzer spent most of his career at Columbia University in New York City as a Professor of Psychiatry until he retired in 2003. He was on the research faculty of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research where he retired after 49 years in December 2010. He has been called one of the most influential psychiatrists of the 20th century.\\"[A]rguably the most influential psychiatrist of the twentieth century\\" in: and \\"without question, one of the most influential psychiatrists of the twentieth century\\" in: and \\"has been justly called one of the most influential psychiatrists of the twentieth century\\" in The Lancet's obituary described him as \\"Stubborn, sometimes abrasive, and always eager, Spitzer's work was guided by a strong sense of ethical fairness\\". A colleague at Columbia has described him as an \\"iconoclast\\" who \\"looked for injustice\\". = Screening and Diagnostic Tools = Spitzer was a major architect of the modern classification of mental disorders. In 1968, he co-developed a computer program, Diagno I, based on a logical decision tree, that could derive a diagnosis from the scores on a Psychiatric Status Schedule which he co- published in 1970 and that the United States Steering Committee for the United States‚ÄìUnited Kingdom Diagnostic Project used to check the consistency of its results. Spitzer was a member on the four-person United States Steering Committee for the United States‚ÄìUnited Kingdom Diagnostic Project, which published their results in 1972. They found the most important difference between countries was that the concept of schizophrenia used in New York was much broader than the one used in London, and included patients who would have been termed manic-depressive or bipolar. He developed psychiatric methods that focused on asking specific interview questions to get at a diagnosis as opposed to the open-ended questioning of psychoanalysis, which was the predominant technique of mental health. He codeveloped the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), a screening technique used for diagnosing bipolar disorder. He also co-developed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PRIME-MD) which can be self-administered to find out if one has a mental illness.Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB. \\"Patient Health Questionnaire Primary Care Study Group. Validation and utility of a self-report version of the PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study\\". JAMA. 1999;282:1737‚Äì44. The portions of PRIME-MD directed at depression (PHQ2 and PHQ9) have since become accepted in primary care medicine for screening and diagnosis of major depression as well as for monitoring response to treatment.Am Fam Physician. 2012;85(2):139-144.Manea, Laura L (01/2015). \\"A diagnostic meta-analysis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) algorithm scoring method as a screen for depression.\\". General Hospital Psychiatry (), 37 (1), p. 67. = Position on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders = In 1974, Spitzer became the chair of the American Psychiatric Association's task force of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders the so- called, DSM-III which was released in 1980. Spitzer is a major architect of the modern classification of mental disorders which involves classifying mental disorders in discrete categories with specified diagnostic criteria but later criticized what he saw as errors and excesses in the DSM's later versions, although he maintained his position that the DSM is still better than the alternatives. In 2003, Spitzer co-authored a position paper with DSM- IV editor Michael First, stating that the \\"DSM is generally viewed as clinically useful\\" based on surveys from practicing professionals and feedback from medical students and residents, but that primary care physicians find the DSM too complicated for their use. The authors emphasized that given then- current limitations in understanding psychiatric disorders, a multitude of DSM codes/diagnoses might apply to some patients, but that it would be a \\"total speculation\\" to assign a single diagnosis to a patient. The authors rejected calls to adopt the ICD-9 because it lacked diagnostic criteria and would \\"[set] psychiatry back 30 years,\\" while the ICD-10, closely resembled the DSM- III-R classification. In 2013, a definitive autobiography of Spitzer, The Making of DSM-III¬Æ: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry, was published by author and historian Hannah S. Decker. Spitzer was briefly featured in the 2007 BBC TV series The Trap, in which he stated that the DSM, by operationalizing the definitions of mental disorders while paying little attention to the context in which the symptoms occur, may have medicalized the normal human experiences of a significant number of people. In 2008, Spitzer had criticized the revision process of the DSM-5 for lacking transparency. He has also criticized specific proposals, like the proposed introduction of the psychosis risk syndrome for people who have mild symptoms found in psychotic disorders. =On homosexuality= Spitzer led a successful effort, in 1973, to stop treating homosexuality as a mental illness.Psychiatrist Who Played Major Role In Destigmatizing Homosexuality Dies : The Two-Way : NPRRobert Spitzer, 83, Dies; Psychiatrist Set Rigorous Standards for Diagnosis - The New York Times It was partly due to Spitzer's efforts that homosexuality was \\"removed\\" (i.e. renamed as Sexual Orientation Disturbance) in 1974 DSM-II: \\"By withdrawing it from the manual, homosexuality was legitimized as a normal difference rather than a psychiatric behavior. This early powerful statement by institutional psychiatry that this is normal sped up the confidence of people in the movement.\\" Alison Snyder. Robert L Spitzer. Obituary. The Lancet. Volume 387, Issue 10017, 30 January‚Äì5 February 2016, Page 428. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00182-3. In 2001, Spitzer delivered a controversial paper, \\"Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation?\\" at the 2001 annual APA meeting; he argued that it is possible that some highly motivated individuals could successfully change their sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. A Washington Post article indicated that Spitzer held 45 min telephonic interviews with 200 people who claimed that their respective sexual orientations had changed from homosexual to heterosexual. Spitzer said he \\"began his study as a skeptic,\\" but the study revealed that \\"66 percent of the men and 44 percent of the women had arrived at what [Spitzer] called good heterosexual functioning,\\" defined as \\"being in a sustained, loving heterosexual relationship within the past year, getting enough satisfaction from the emotional relationship with their partner to rate at least seven on a 10-point scale, having satisfying heterosexual sex at least monthly and never or rarely thinking of somebody of the same sex during heterosexual sex.\\" Spitzer also found that \\"89 percent of men and 95 percent of women said they were bothered only slightly, or not at all, by unwanted homosexual feelings\\" but that \\"only 11 percent of the men and 37 percent of the women reported a complete absence of homosexual indicators, including same-sex attraction. ... Some 43 percent of the sample had been referred to Spitzer by 'ex-gay ministries. ... An additional 23 percent were referred by the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality.\\" Spitzer has stated that his research \\"shows some people can change from gay to straight, and we ought to acknowledge that.\\" Considering how difficult it had been to find 200 participants, and that they were considered the best cases of conversion therapy, Spitzer concluded that although change could occur, it was probably very rare.In Dr. Robert Spitzer's Own Words, TruthWinsOut.org The APA issued an official disavowal of Spitzer's paper, noting that it had not been peer reviewed and stating, \\"There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of reparative therapy as a treatment to change one's sexual orientation.\\"Article Two years later, Spitzer's paper was published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. Two thirds of the reviews were critical, and the publication decision sparked controversy, with one member of the publication's supporting organization resigning in protest. The paper has been criticized for its sampling methods and criteria for success.Analysis of Dr. Spitzer's study of reparative therapy, ReligiousTolerance.org In a 2005 interview, Spitzer stated, \\"Many colleagues were outraged\\" following the publication of the study. Spitzer added, \\"Within the gay community, there was initially tremendous anger and feeling that I had betrayed them.\\" When asked whether he would consider a follow-up study, Spitzer said no and added that he felt \\"a little battle fatigue.\\"Leblanc, Douglas. Interview of Robert Spitzer. \\"Therapeutically Incorrect: Atheist psychiatrist argues that gays can change\\", Christianity Today, 29 March 2005. While Spitzer has said that he has no way of knowing whether the study participants were being honest, he has also indicated that he believed that the interviewees were being candid with him. In a 2012 interview, Spitzer said he asked to retract the study and stated that he agreed with its critics: : \\"In retrospect, I have to admit I think the critiques are largely correct,\\" he said. \\"The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more.\\" He said he spoke with the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior about writing a retraction, but the editor declined. (Repeated attempts to contact the journal went unanswered.) In a letter to Kenneth J Zucker, editor of Journal of Sexual Behavior, Spitzer wrote: Awards Spitzer received the Thomas William Salmon Medal from the New York Academy of Medicine for his contributions to psychiatry. Personal life and death Spitzer was married three times, his first two marriages ending in divorce. He was born Jewish and considered himself an atheist.Charles Laurence, 'Going straight', Sunday Telegraph, 12 October 2003, Pg. 19. Spitzer died on December 25, 2015 in Seattle, having recently moved there from New Jersey. His wife stated his death was due to heart problems. Besides his wife and collaborator, Dr Janet Williams, he was survived by his five children (Gideon Spitzer- Williams, Ezra Spitzer-Williams, Noah Spitzer-Williams, Daniel Spitzer and Laura Spitzer), and five grandchildren.

He became the World Champion in Men's Singles in Yokohama, Japan in May 2009, defeating three-time World Champion Wang Liqin 4‚Äì0. His other notable accomplishments include being a three-time World Cup Champion in 2007, 2008 and 2010, a singles silver medalist at the 2004 Summer Olympics, 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. In January 2010, he was replaced by Ma Long as the #1 rank on the official ITTF world rankings. He was previously ranked #1 on the official ITTF world rankings for 27 consecutive months, from October 2007 to December 2009. In April 2011, he was again the top ranked male player in the world. He is known to execute the Reverse Penhold Backhand (RPB) with exceptional skill. During his career, he has appeared twelve times in major world competition finals, which is a record. In men's singles, he has won the Asian Championship, Asian Cup, Asian Games, and Chinese National Games at least once. Wang Hao retired from the national team by the end of 2014.http://tabletennista.com/2014/12/wang-hao-officially-retired-from-the- national-team/ Equipment Wang Hao used a DHS Hurricane Hao blade(Special Blade for Wanghao : It's called N656) with a DHS Neo Skyline III Blue Sponge for forehand and Butterfly Sriver topsheet on Bryce sponge for his backhand. Playing style Wang uses a penhold grip. He is representative of a new wave of penhold players, having good attacking and defensive skills off both wings of the table. The greater freedom of the wrist involved in a penhold grip allows Wang Hao to generate large amounts of spin on the forehand side. Compared to most pen-hold players on the professional circuit, Wang Hao uses the reverse-side for almost all shots on the backhand side, with the small exception of balls placed very slow and short within the table during serves. This style of using the reverse-side exclusively for the backhand was considered to be improper, and when he first joined the national team most players did not think highly of him. Personal life Wang Hao and Yan Boya met in 2010 and they married in 2013.http://tabletennista.com/2013/8/wang- haos-love-at-first-sight/ The same year, they had a son, Wang Ruiting.

Swing Parade of 1946 was filmed over a period of 24 days between July 30 and August 25, 1945.Swing Parade of 1946 at threestooges.net 42-year-old Curly Howard had suffered a series of minor strokes several months prior to filming, and his performances in their Columbia shorts at that time were often sluggish and lethargic. By the time of Swing Parade of 1946, he had lost a considerable amount of weight, and had difficulty maintaining his trademark falsetto voice. However, he appears somewhat more healthy and animated in this film, possibly due to The Stooges' supporting roles being less strenuous than in the shorts, where Curly was in virtually every scene.Lenburg, Jeff; Howard Maurer, Joan; Lenburg, Greg; (1982). The Three Stooges Scrapbook, p. 77, Citadel Press. He is also billed as \\"Jerome Howard\\" in the credits, for the first time in many years. Director Nicholas Ray worked uncredited on the screenplay. This was Ray's only collaboration with the Three Stooges.

The league embraced workers, peasants, students, and intelligentsia. It had its first affiliates at factories, plants, collective farms (kolkhozy), and educational institutions. By the beginning of 1941 it had about 3.5 million members from 100 nationalities. It had about 96,000 offices across the country. Guided by Bolshevik principles of communist propaganda and by the Party's orders with regards to religion, the League aimed at exterminating religion in all its manifestations and forming an anti-religious scientific mindset among the workers.Compare: Across the Revolutionary Divide: Russia and the USSR, 1861-1945 by Theodore R.

The League's slogan was \\"Struggle against religion is a struggle for socialism\\", which was meant to tie in their atheist views with the Communist drive to 'build Socialism'.

It published newspapers, journals, and other materials that lampooned religion; it sponsored lectures and films; it organized demonstrations and parades; it set up antireligious museums; and it led a concerted effort telling Soviet citizens that religious beliefs and practices were wrong and harmful, and that good citizens ought to embrace a scientific, atheistic worldview.Daniel Peris, Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of the Militant Godless Cornell University Press, 1998, Origins and formation The newspaper Bezbozhnik (Godless, Atheist) (1922‚Äì1941), founded and edited by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, played a significant role in the League's establishment, and had a wide network of correspondents and readers.Paul Dixon, Religion in the Soviet Union, first published 1945 in Workers International News, and can be found at: http://www.marxist.com/religion-soviet-union170406.htm Bezbozhnik appeared first in December 1922, and the following year a Moscow monthly for industrial workers Bezbozhnik u Stanka (The Godless at the Work-Bench, AKA Bezbust) formed the like-minded Moscow Society of the Godless in August 1924. In addition to the newspaper Bezbozhnik, the Central Soviet of the League of Militant Atheists published the illustrated magazine Bezbozhnik and the scientific and methodological journal Antireligioznik. The scientific society ¬´Ateist¬ª arose in 1921 in Moscow. It published the magazine Ateist from 1923 to 1931. This magazine published mainly works translated from foreign languages. Since 1931, the magazine Voinstvuiuschii ateizm, a periodical of the Central Soviet of the League of Militant Atheists, began to be published.

Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of the Militant Godless 1st Edition. / Cornell University Press, 1998/ p. 74 The Moscow group tended to support the leftist side of the debate on how to destroy religion (i.e. in favour of attacking religion in all of its forms rather than moderation), and in 1924 it attacked Yaroslavsky, Anatoly Lunacharsky and Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich for differentiation between different religions, instead of genuine godlessness. It accused Yaroslavsky of attacking only the clergy rather than religion in general. Yaroslavsky protested this and affirmed that all religions were enemies of socialism including the Renovationist schism in the Orthodox church, but that the methods of struggle against different religions should vary due to the large number of loyal Soviet citizens with religious beliefs who should be re-educated as atheists rather than treated as class enemies.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 51 Bezbozhnik argued that it was an oversimplification to treat religion solely as a kind of class exploitation to be attacked, forgetting the complex nature of religions, as well as the individual believers. The CPSU Central Committee supported Yaroslavsky's viewpoint on this issue, although this debate remained unresolved at the Union that came in 1925. The Moscow group merged with the Society of Friends of the Godless Newspaper (associated with Bezbozhnik) in April 1925 to form the All- Union League of the Godless at its first congress.Sabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union.

Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti- Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 50. The 1926 All- Union Conference on Antireligious Propaganda voted in favour of Yaroslavsky's views on the antireligious campaign, but the debate still continued. The Moscow group argued that the antireligious struggle should be led only by the party and the industrial proletariat, as opposed to the whole nation which Yaroslavsky wanted to mobilize to conduct the antireligious campaign. In 1929, when the resolutions that would set the tone for the intensive persecution of the next decade were set and Yaroslavsky's victory in the power struggle had been completed, there were a few last attacks made on Yaroslavsky and the organization for minimizing the class-enemy thesis in attacking religion, of having few workers and peasants in its ranks, of using archaeology instead of aggressively attacking religion, of being indifferent to transforming the school system into a fundamentally antireligious atmosphere and of opportunistically citing works by non-Marxist Western bourgeois atheists in publications.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 53. In response, Yaroslavsky claimed that they had supported antireligious education for years, but in contrast to the leftists who simply wanted to attack religion, he was working to replace the popular religious ideology with that of dialectical materialism. He also pointed out correctly that Lenin had used the works of 18th century French atheists and other bourgeois atheists to assist in the campaign to disseminate atheism in the USSR. He admitted that the effect of their efforts up to that point was less than he had hoped, which he implicitly blamed on the Moscow branch for their lack of cooperation, lack of support from the party and some branches of the Komsomol, and a ban operating on their activities in Ukraine, as well as an inadequate finances.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 54. Yaroslavsky, Stalin's loyal aide in the secretariat and one of the founding editors of Kommunist, came out on top despite the Moscow group's resistance in an effort to retain autonomy and the support for that group from the daily Komsomol'skaia pravda. The problems that Yaroslavsky outlined in his response were addressed in 1929 at the second congress. The CPSU Central Committee delegated to the LMG full powers to launch a great antireligious attack with the objective of completely eliminating religion from the country, granting them the right to mobilize all public organizations. In 1929, the Second Congress changed the society's name to The Union of Belligerent (or Militant) Atheists. At this Second Congress of Atheists, Nikolai Bukharin, the editor of Pravda, called for the extermination of religion \\"at the tip of the bayonet.\\"John Koehler. The Soviet Union's Cold War against the Catholic Church. Pegasus Books, 2009, p. 6. There, Yaroslavsky also made the following declaration: > It is our duty to destroy every religious world-concept... If the > destruction of ten million human beings, as happened in the last war, should > be necessary for the triumph of one definite class, then that must be done > and it will be done.Alfred McClung Lee, Elizabeth Briant Lee. The Fine Art > of Propaganda. Octagon Books, 1972, p. 90. The Central Council chose Yaroslavsky as its leader; he occupied this post continuously. The League of Militant Atheists sometimes took a violent approach to those who would not accept the League's message. For example, \\"bishops, priests, and lay believers\\" were \\"arrested, shot, and sent to labour camps.\\" =Atheistic periodicals published in various languages= File:Bezbozhnik newsparer 18-1923.jpglanguage ‚àí Russian.

Laisvoji mintis (newspaper) Authority on antireligious methodology The debate on how to best exterminate religion was argued among the Soviet leadership, until in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when it was resolved by Stalin who condemned the extremes of both sides, and Yaroslavsky followed suit. The do-nothing approach of the rightists who thought religion would die away naturally and the leftist approach to attack all forms of religion as class enemies were both condemned as deviations from the party line. Yaroslavsky argued against the leftists (who had earlier criticized him) that if religion was simply a class phenomenon there would be no need to combat it if a classless society was truly being produced. He affirmed that an all-sided attack on religion was needed, but did not subscribe to the leftist deviation that had been condemned. The League not only attacked religion but also attacked deviations from what it saw as the proper line to combat religion in the USSR and, in effect, set the 'proper' line to follow in this sphere for party membership. Early Marxist beliefs that religion would disappear with the coming of a tractor (Leon Trotsky had made this claim) were ridiculed by the League. The popularity of religion among nationalistic intellectuals was pointed out by Lukachevsky (LMG) and he claimed that if religion was only rooted in ownership of property, it could not explain the growth of the renovationists.Izuchenie sotsial'nykh kornei religii v SSSR' (M.: 1930) pp. 5-14. The League occupied the leadership role in the antireligious campaign of the Communist Party.Vorontsov, I., Leninskaia programma ateisticheskogo vospitaniia v deistvii (1917-1937 gg.). Leningrad: Izdatel'stvo LGU, 1973. p. 112. It employed the powers given to it by the CPSU Central Committee at the 1929 congress to dictate orders to schools, universities, the Soviet Armed Forces, the trade unions, the Komsomol, the Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization, the Soviet press, and other institutions for the purpose of its antireligious campaign. It criticized many public institutions (including the Communist Party) for failing to adequately attack religious belief and instructed them on how to be more effective. The People's Commisariat of Education was heckled and Glavnauka, the Chief Administration for Science and Scholarship was also singled out for criticism. A spokesperson for the latter tried to justify their behaviour to the LMG by claiming that they had reduced the total number of historical buildings under its protection (mostly ancient churches and monasteries) from 7000 to 1000, by destroying them.'Stenogrammy Vtorogo plenuma TsS SVB', Antirelioznik, Moscow, p. 116. The League concerned itself with the issue of active believers who had infiltrated its own membership and who were trying to prove their loyalty to the regime or even undermine the antireligious work of the League. League members who suspected each other of harbouring religious beliefs secretly discussed their concerns in the early years. The League also had to address the issue of atheists in its membership who may have sympathized with the religious believers and who may have had doubts about what they were doing. In answer to these, the League adopted a policy that any League member who entered a church (to conduct antireligious work by checking on the strength of believers or numbering them) had to first receive local branch approval beforehand in order so that he did not give the impression that he was going to the church to pray.Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin‚Äôs Press, New York (1961) p. 7. In contrast the League in Tashkent actually tried to translate the Quran into Uzbek so that more Muslims could read it, in hope that when Muslims were able to read what the Quran actually said, they would reject its content as fallacious.Froese, Paul. \\"'I am an atheist and a Muslim': Islam, communism, and ideological competition.\\" Journal of Church and State 47.3 (2005) All members of the Komsomol were obligated to join the League, and it directed all members of the CPSU to support the League's work.I.

The extreme character of the line to be taken against religion is described: > All religions, no matter how much they 'renovate' and cleanse themselves, > are systems of idea... profoundly hostile to the ideology of... socialism... > Religious organizations... are in reality political agencies... of class > groupings hostile to the proletariat inside the country and of the > international bourgeoisie... Special attention must be paid to the > renovationist currents in Orthodoxy, Islam, Lamaism and other religions... > These currents are but the disguises for more effective struggle against the > Soviet power.

In 1932 the Second Plenum of the LMG Central Council was ordered by Stalin to adopt an antireligious five-year plan with the intention of eliminating the Church and its influence in the USSR.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 64 Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, there was a \\"government-sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism\\" conducted by the Communists, with the LMG at the forefront of this campaign.Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival, by Christopher Marsh, page 47. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011.Inside Central Asia: A Political and Cultural History, by Dilip Hiro. Penguin, 2009. Many priests were killed and imprisoned. Thousands of churches were closed, some turned into hospitals.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.494\\" 1929 Congress In addition to what is stated above, the 1929 Congress also issued a number of other orders that would form the basis of the LMG's activities (as well as the character of the antireligious persecution throughout the country) in the following decade. At its 1929 Congress, it admitted that there had been some growth in sectarian groups, but claimed that this was local rather than national phenomena. They said, however, that lay religious activists exceeded one million and that all of the religious communities including the old Orthodox had begun to adopt modern methods and were attracting youth. It determined therefore that the fight against religion needed to be pressed, although it still, as Yaroslavsky had said for years, warned against extreme antireligious ultra-left attacks.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 56 At the same meeting it demanded that no holidays should be allowed to coincide with important Church feast days; this policy was carried out in the same year. The resolutions at the meeting called for local LMG branches to effect total public ostracism of the clergy. They ordered that priests should not be invited to private homes, donations to churches should discontinue, and that trade unions should be pressured not to perform any work for churches. The party would adopt this resolution a year later. The congress also criticized the armed forces for failing to conduct adequate antireligious education among its soldiers. The organization had set up cells in the armed forces in each unit beginning in 1927. In a study done on a unit in 1925, it was found that 60% of recruits were religious believers at the time of recruitment, while only 28% remained believers at the end of their service.G. Struchkov, 'Antireligioznaia rabota v Krasnoi armii', Voinstvuiuschee bezbozhie v SSSR za 15 let, M. Enisherlov, A Lukachevsky, M. Mitin (eds), M.: Gos. antirel., izd., 1932, p. 418 This data may have ignored the phenomena of soldiers who hid their religious convictions during their service and thus have some inaccuracy. These experiences nevertheless played a role in the LMG's approach to combatting religion in the military in the following decade. The 1929 Congress called on public institutions to treat antireligious propaganda as an inseparable part of their work and to provide regular funding for it.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti- Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 58 The congress eliminated preferential treatment for different sects and declared unrelenting war against them, but contained the moderating statement to differentiate between the rank-and-file believers and the leadership, the latter of which were considered fully conscientious class enemies of the state. The congress resolutions stated that religious temples should be shut only with the agreement of the majority of the working populace. There were, however, no qualifications for this majority to include religious believers associated with the given religious structure. This allowed the practice to be conducted in the following years wherein a meeting would be organized under pressure at which believers who attended would be risking their social status and would often find themselves in a minority, which would allow for a vote to close the structure. The LMG would take advantage of rifts between different believers, including that between the Orthodox and Renovationists, in order to get either side to vote for the closure of each other's religious structures.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti- Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 59 The congress called on antireligious education to be instituted from the first-grade up. Two years later, further calls would be made by leading antireligious propagandist N. Amosov to institute antireligious education among pre-school children.Amosov, N., Antireligioznaia rabota na poroge vtoroi piatiletki. Moscow: Gosudarskoe antireligioznoe izdatel'stvo, 1932, p. 30. This congress received much larger coverage in the Soviet press than the previous congress, although it was overshadowed by the German Communist congress that occurred at the same time.Kolarz, Walter.

The LMG's hold over the Komsomol is reflected in the latter's programme at its 10th congress that state 'The Komsomol patiently explains to the youth the harmfulness of superstitions and of religious prejudices, organizing for this purpose special study circles and lectures on antireligious propaganda.Dimitry V.

The Communist party at the time had 1.8 million members.Paul Froese. Forced Secularization in Soviet Russia: Why an Atheistic Monopoly Failed. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 35-50. Almost half of the LMG's membership, however, resided in the vicinities of Moscow and Leningrad, which led to the LMG then creating 'cells' across the country in order to reach rural citizens for atheist propagation. The LMG alleged massive growth in the Central Asian republics in the 1930s. The Central Asian Muslims, who had a long history of encountering Christian missionaries attempting to convert them away from Islam, were considered to pose a special issue for LMG activists who were told by Yaroslavsky that > A careless approach to the matter of antireligious propaganda among these > people can call up memories of this [Tsarist] oppression and be interpreted > by the most backward and the most fanatical part of the Muslim population as > a repeat of the past, when Christian missionaries reviled the Mohammedan > faith. Under the LMG's guidance, 'Godless collective farms', were formed.Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin‚Äôs Press, New York (1961) p. 10. Yaroslavsky in 1932 thought that the campaign would be successful, when he said: > There can be no doubt that the fact that the new state of the USSR led by > the communist party, with a program permeated by the spirit of militant > atheism, gives the reason why this state is successfully surmounting the > great difficulties that stand in its way - that neither \\"heavenly powers\\" > nor the exhortations of all the priests in all the world can prevent its > attaining its aims it has set itself. The enthusiasm of its new members was notably poor, however, as its dues were left unpaid and only a minority appeared to have great interest in antireligious work.John Curtiss, The Russian Church and the Soviet State, 1917-1950 (Boston: Little, Brown, 1953) p. 205; F Oleschuk, O zadachakh antireligioznoi propagandy (M.: 1937) p. 16. The League printed masses of antireligious literature. These would mock religious belief.Robert Service, A History of Modern Russia, from Nicholas II to Putin p 136 The weekly Bezbozhnik reached 500,000 copies per issue in 1931. The monthly Bezbozhnik, grew from 28,000 in 1928 to 200,000 in 1931, dropped to 150,000 after 1932, climbed to 230,000 in 1938 and went down 155,000 in 1939. The Bezbozhnik u Stanka consistently ran 50,000-70,000 copies per issue, however, it changed from a monthly to a fortnightly in 1929 and continued to produce until it was closed in 1932. Yaroslavsky's scholarly monthly for the LMG central committee 'Antireligioznik' (The Antireligious) appeared in 1926, and reached 17,000 circulation in 1929 (it was a 130-page publication), 30,000 in 1930 and 27,000 in 1931. Its material was often repeated over different issues and it was more primitive in its scholarly material than it had been intended. It was reduced to 64 pages in 1940, and produced between 40,000 and 45,000 in 1940-41 before it was finally cancelled.Curtiss, The Russian Church, p. 205. N. Amosov, Antireligioznaia rabota na poroge utoroi piatiletki (M.: Gos. antir. izd., 1932) p. 11; Yaroslavsky, 'Zadachi antireligioznoi propagandy', Antireligioznik, no. 5 (May 1941) p. 2; Bol'shaia sovetskaia entsiklopediia, 3rd edn, vol. 3 (Moscow 1970) p. 225; A Lukachevsky, '10 let zhurnala \\"Antireligioznik\\"', Bezbozh., no.2 (Feb. 1936) p. 8. The League also printed antireligious textbooks. An 'Antireligious Textbook for Peasants' was produced between 1927 and 1931, with a circulation of 18,000 for the first edition and 200,000 for the sixth. A similar textbook for urban people was created in 1931, followed by a universal amalgamated textbook. LMG member, I. A. Shpitsberg began publishing a scholarly journal in the late 1920s called Ateist. It was changed to Voinstvuiuschii ateizm (Militant Atheism) in 1931 and it was published by the LMG central council. In 1932 it was swallowed up by Antireligioznik. From 1928 to 1932, a journal for peasants named Derevenskii bezbozhnik (The Rural Godless) was produced. It was alleged to be so \\"popular\\" among the peasantry that it was 'read to tatters', and contradictorily it ceased publication in 1932. The supposedly popular nature of the atheist propaganda was also contradicted by cases of reported lynchings of antireligious propagandists and murder of LMG agitators.Vorontsov, I., Leninskaia programma ateisticheskogo vospitaniia v deistvii (1917-1937 gg.). Leningrad: Izdatel'stvo LGU, 1973. pp 130-34 In a similar vein, in 1930, the LMG leadership advised that social surveys of believers in school classes where the majority of pupils were believers was harmful, and that such data should not, as a principle, be used.A. Lukachevsky, Izuchenie sots, kor. rel., Moscow, 1930. p. 19. Another such anecdote can be found in the 1929 Moscow religion survey, in which 12,000 industrial workers were surveyed anonymously and only 3,000 returned the survey, of which 88.8% claimed to be atheists, and it was then declared that 90% of Moscow industrial workers were atheists.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 63. The anti-religious activists remove the large (5000 kg) bell from the St Volodymyr's Cathedral central Kiev USSR (now Ukraine). The non-serial LMG literature grew from 12 million printed pages in 1927 to 800 million in 1930 (making up at least 100 million pieces of printed antirelgious literature).Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 10. In 1941 sixty-seven books and brochures of antireligious propaganda were printed with a total circulation of 3.5 million copies.John Curtiss, The Russian Church and the Soviet State, 1917-1950 (Boston: Little, Brown, 1953) p. 205; F Oleschuk, O zadachakh antireligioznoi propagandy (M.: 1937) p. 205. Up to 1940 there were about 2000 titles published every year.Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edward E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years. ME Sharpe inc., 2002, p. 82. A textbook produced by the LMG in 1934 admitted the existence of sincere believers among the intellectuals; however, Yaroslavsky in 1937 claimed that all scholars and scientists who believe in God were insincere deceivers and swindlers. The League trained a massive number of antireligious propagandists and other workers. This work included lecture cycles. The League of Militant Atheists attempted to \\"control and exploit the Proletarian Freethinkers,\\" a group founded by socialists in 1925, in order to diminish the influence of religion, particularly Catholic Christianity, in Central and Eastern Europe.Dennis J. Dunn. The Catholic Church and Russia: Popes, Patriarchs, Tsars, and Commissars. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 85. The League of Militant Atheists aided the Soviet government in killing clergy and committed believers.Peter N. Stearns. The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern World. Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 278. The League also made it a priority to remove religious icons from the homes of believers.Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, 2004, p. 40 Under the slogan, \\"the Storming of Heaven,\\" the League of Militant Atheists pressed for \\"resolute action against religious peasants\\" leading to the mass arrest and exile of many believers, especially village priests. By 1940, \\"over 100 bishops, tens of thousands of Orthodox clergy, and thousands of monks and lay believers had been killed or had died in Soviet prisons and the Gulag.\\"Theodore R. Weeks. Across the Revolutionary Divide: Russia and the USSR, 1861-1945. John Wiley & Sons, 2011. The LMG had reduced the number of religious communities of all faiths from 50,000 in 1930 to 30,000 by 1938 and 8,000 by 1941. The last figure includes, however, 7,000 communities in the annexed western territories (so that only 1,000 actually remained in the rest of the country).Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 68. Disbandment The climate of the campaign against religion was changing in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The regime slowly became more moderate in its approach to religion. Yaroslavsky, in 1941 warned against condemning all religious believers, but said that there were many loyal Soviet citizens still possessing religious beliefs. He called for patient and tactful individual work without offending the believers, but \\"re-educating\\" them. He claimed that religion had disappeared in some parts of the country but in other parts (especially in the newly annexed territories) it was strong, and he warned against starting brutal offensives in those areas.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti- Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 66. He alleged that there were very few attempts to re-open churches and that this was a sign of the decline in religion. He branded those who tried to re-open churches as \\"former kulaks\\" and \\"falsifiers of figures\\".Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 67. This report was contradicted, however, by the LMG's own figures (based on the 1937 census) that found perhaps half the country still held religious beliefs, even if they had no structures to worship in any longer and they could no longer openly express their beliefs. An answer to this report was found when Nazi Germany invaded in 1941. Churches were re-opened under the German occupation, while believers flocked to them in the millions. In order to gain support for the war effort (both domestic and foreign), Stalin ended the antireligious persecutionLetters from Moscow, Gleb Yakunin and Lev Regelson and the LMG was disbanded. Internal pressure to end the persecution came from the need to win the loyalty of religious Soviet citizens for the war effort, while external pressure came from the Allies, who would not support Stalin if he continued the campaign.Altnurme, Riho. \\"'Religious cults', particularly Lutheranism, in the Soviet Union in 1944-1949.\\" Trames 6.1 (2002) All LMG periodicals ceased to publish by September 1941. Its official disbandment date is unknown, but traced somewhere between 1941 and 1947. Yaroslavsky turned his attention to other pursuits. In 1942, he even published a positive article about Orthodox writer Dostoevsky, describing his alleged hatred of the Germans.

Its three songs were originally written and recorded for their eleventh studio album Abacab (1981), but they were not included on the album's final track selection. 3√ó3 reached on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, its tracks were included on the international edition of the band's live album Three Sides Live (1982). The lead track, \\"Paperlate\\", peaked at on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Production All songs were recorded during the session for Abacab. A bootleg demo tape exists of the band playing an entire session of songs for Abacab, with the three songs from this EP also included.Abacab Complete (bootleg) (1980) For the song \\"Paperlate\\", Collins used the horn section of the band Earth, Wind & Fire. Collins has often used the group for other projects, including Collins' debut solo album, Face Value.Classic Albums: Face Value VH-1, 1999 A music video was also created utilizing the band's 27 May 1982 appearance on Top of the Pops.Genesis: The Video Show (DVD), 2005 According to \\"Connolly & Company\\", \\"You Might Recall\\" is a song about a lost love. Collins wrote the song \\"Me and Virgil\\" in the form of a story (a technique he would return to with the 10-minute epic \\"Driving the Last Spike\\" on 1991's We Can't Dance). He has called the song \\"a dog\\", and cites \\"Me and Virgil\\" as one of his worst ever pieces of writing. According to Collins, the group was trying to do something similar to the work of The Band, but \\"we couldn't.\\" Packaging and artwork Collins stated that the packaging for 3√ó3 was a throwback to The Beatles' first EP release in 1963, entitled Twist and Shout. The front cover photo is similar to the Beatles' EP cover. The liner notes and design of the back cover were done by the man who was in charge of designing the Beatles' EP, Tony Barrow. \\"these cheeky chappies from Guildford ... treasure these three audio-visual representations...\\" are parts that Phil recalls. The title itself is also a nod to The Rolling Stones, who released both an EP titled Five by Five and an LP entitled 12 X 5. Collins recalls that the album's cover and interior text received negative reviews from a reviewer who was not alive when the original Beatles EP was released, thereby misunderstanding the parody. Critical reception The response to the EP was mixed. Dave Thompson of AllMusic gives it three stars out of five, citing \\"Paperlate\\" as the EP's selling point. Thompson describes \\"Paperlate\\" as \\"a horn-honking romp with just the ghosts of '60s soul playing around its chorus and a buoyancy that fed readily into the mood of the UK charts of the day.\\" Thompson called \\"You Might Recall\\" and \\"Me and Virgil\\" \\"somewhat calmer\\", describing \\"Me and Virgil\\" as \\"introspective\\", and \\"You Might Recall\\" as \\"the latest in the band's long line of bubbly romantic numbers.\\" Connolly & Company says that \\"Paperlate\\" featured a \\"peppy horn section,\\" and that \\"You Might Recall\\" \\"recalled Mike Rutherford's earlier contributions (\\"Alone Tonight\\", \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\").\\" Connolly also says that Three Sides Live was worth buying for just \\"Paperlate\\". Upon its release, 3√ó3's lead song was \\"Paperlate\\", and the EP debuted at No. 30 on the UK charts, peaking at No. 10 later on. Because the EP market never took off in North America, Atlantic Records instead decided to release its three songs as part of Three Sides Live for its initial release, while the UK had live music. \\"Paperlate\\" peaked at No. 32 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and No. 2 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart. As of 1994, however, Three Sides Live was remastered and reissued with the extra live material internationally. Later releases 3√ó3 never saw a CD release. However, its tracks appeared on the world edition of Three Sides Live. The three tracks, plus the songs \\"Evidence of Autumn\\" and \\"Open Door\\" (B-sides from the Duke sessions) make up the non-live side 2 of the second LP. In addition, two of its three tracks, \\"Paperlate\\" and \\"You Might Recall\\", appeared on the box set Genesis Archive 2: 1976-1992 (2000); however, \\"Me and Virgil\\" was not added due to Collins' dislike for the song. The track was made available on the bonus CD of the boxed set Genesis 1976-1982, in a modern-day remixed version. The original mix remains out of print. \\"Paperlate\\" was also issued as a B-side to the single \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\".

One of the founders of the state of West Virginia during the American Civil War, he served in the United States Senate representing first the Restored Government of Virginia and became one of the new state of West Virginia's first two Senators.Otis K. Rice, West Virginia: The State and its People (Parson, West Virginia: McClain Printing Co, 1972) pp. 199-201 Early and family life Willey was born in 1811, in a log cabin near Buffalo Creek and the present day Farmington, West Virginia, in Marion County. He was raised on Paw Paw Creek in Monongalia County. He could only attend school for about two months because his family needed him to work on the farm, but he was determined to get an education. On Christmas Day 1827, the 17 year old with his belongings wrapped in a handkerchief, began walking from his home to Madison College (later Allegheny College) in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He worked hard, and even tutored other students, graduating six months ahead of schedule in June 1831.Rice, pp. 199-201 Having gained many friends who were ministers or other church folk, Willey returned to what was then still Virginia. He moved to Wellsburg to read law under the guidance of western Virginia sectional leader Philip Doddridge.George Mason Atkinson and Alvaro Franklin Gibbens, Prominent Men of West Virginia (Wheeling: W.L.Catlin 1890) p. 158 et seq. He later received honorary degrees from Alleghany College, Augusta College and West Virginia University.Atkinson and Gibbens, p. 160 In 1834, Willey married Elizabeth Ray, with whom he had six children before her death a few years before his: Mary E. Casselberry (d. 1862); Sarah B. Hagans, William P. Willey, Julia E. McGrew, Thomas R. Willey, Louisa A. Willey and John B. Willey.http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/willeywaitman01.html Career Admitted to the Virginia bar in September 1832, Willey moved to Morgantown to establish a private legal practice. He became active in politics, especially in the Whig Party, and in 1840 was an elector for the William Henry Harrison/John Tyler ticket, although he also lost election to become a delegate to the Virginia General Assembly. In 1841, voter elected Willey Clerk of the County Court of Monongalia County, and re-elected him several times; Willey served until 1852. He was active in local politics, served in a variety of positions, and was a popular speaker for the literacy society and temperance campaigns. As one of four delegates representing Marion, Preston, Monongalia and Taylor Counties at the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, Willey argued in favor of universal suffrage for white men, and also believed that eastern Virginian elites dominated political power in the state. His speech \\"Liberty and Union\\" brought him broader attention. In 1852, Willey became the Whig candidate for Congress, but lost. In 1859 Willey became the Whig delegate for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, but lost. The following year he campaigned for Everett and Bell of the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 Presidential election. His candidates lost badly, and Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected president. American Civil War and West Virginia statehood Elected a member of the Virginia Secession Convention in 1861 (representing Monongalia County alongside J.M. Heck and Marshall M. Dent), Willey warned fellow delegates about the ravages of civil war. Although Willey voted against secession several times during the convention, the ordinance of secession eventually passed and Virginia seceded on April 17, 1861.Virginia Memory, Union or Secession, How delegates voted Although conservative (and a slaveowner), Willey actively participated at the First Wheeling Convention, which ultimately led to West Virginia statehood (although Willey had been among those who blocked John S. Carlile's proposal for immediate statehood). He did not seek election to the Second Wheeling Convention in June which established the Restored Government of Virginia, although he would soon be elected one of the new state's first two U.S. Senators (alongside Carlile). In April 1863, Willey was one of the targets of the Confederate Jones-Imboden raid to destroy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks and capture the Restored Government of Virginia at Wheeling. However, when Jones' troops moved into Kingwood and Morgantown, their attempt to destroy a suspension bridge over the Monongahela River failed and Willey escaped in a fast buggy into Pennsylvania, although the raiders continued to Fairmont and destroyed the library of Gov. Francis Pierpont.Otis K. Rice, West Virginia: The State and its People (Parson, West Virginia: McClain Printing Co, 1972) p.181 The Restored Government of Virginia elected him to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy of Senator James M. Mason, who had joined the Confederate cause. Willey (a Republican) became one of the first two U. S. Senators from West Virginia (1863‚Äì1871) (alongside Peter G. Van Winkle). On May 29, 1862, Willey presented the petition to Congress for the creation of West Virginia. In part because of a published abolitionist address by Rev. Gordon Battelle, it was accepted only after Willey offered an Amendment acceptable to Radical Republicans, which provided for emancipation of slaves under 21 years of age on July 4, 1863, upon their reaching 21 years of age. Previously, Willey (who had domestic slaves) had argued for compensated emancipation. That compromise secured adoption of the West Virginia statehood bill.http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/10/this-day-waitman-t-willey- edition/ Because of his federal position (although he drew the short term of 2 years), Willey participated only from the sidelines in West Virginia's Constitutional Convention at Wheeling. However, he did vote to remove President Andrew Johnson from the Presidency, although that impeachment failed by one vote (and his fellow Senator Van Winkle voted the other way). After Willey won and served one full term, he retired from Congress in 1871, and became a delegate to the West Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1872.Atkinson and Gibbens However, his political career ended as Democrats regained political power in the new state.Rice p. 201 In 1872, Willey also was elected to General Conference of the Methodist Church, but declined to serve. He did serve as a delegate-at-large to the National Republican Convention in 1876, and to the Methodist General Conference of 1880. In 1882, he accepted a temporary appointment as Clerk of the County Court in Monongelia County after the incumbent died, and voters elected him to a full six-year term in 1884. Death and legacy Waitman T. Willey died on May 2, 1900 at 88 years of age, after the deaths of his wife and one of his daughters. He was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Morgantown.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=7619402 His son William became a professor at West Virginia University in Morgantown, and during his lifetime, Willey had tutored many men who became judges and leading members of the West Virginia bar. Although the Waitman T. Willey House that he built in 1839-1840 had been in a semi-rural setting, 78 lots were divided around it after his death, and the surrounding area became the Chancery Hill Addition within the industrializing city. The house still exists; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and renovated in 2012.http://www.morgantownmag.com/morgantown/April-May-2012/The-Waitman-T- Willey-House/ References Bibliography * External links *Waitman T.
