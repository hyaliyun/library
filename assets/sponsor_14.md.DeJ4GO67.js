It replaced Rufford Old Hall as their residence in 1760. From 1920 to 1987 it was used as a hospital and has subsequently been restored and converted for residential use. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1986. History The portico entrance in 2010. Rufford New Hall was built in 1760. The country house was built by Sir Robert Hesketh and enlarged by his grandson around 1798-9 when the Heskeths left Rufford Old Hall. Heskeths lived at Rufford New Hall until 1919. The hall is built in brick which was formerly stuccoed. It has a low- pitched hipped slate roof concealed by a low parapet. The two storey symmetrical frontage has a five-bay facade with an Ionic portico of unfluted columns over a wide doorway with a fanlight. The hall has four 15-paned sashed windows on the ground floor, with five 12-paned windows on the first. Some spout heads bear the initials of Sir Thomas Dalrymple Hesketh and the date 1811 and one is dated 1822. The entrance hall has a cantilevered or flying stone staircase and landing on three sides with wrought iron balusters and is lighted by a domed oval skylight. The main hall has columns and pilasters made from Scagliola marble. =Hospital= Rufford New Hall was bought by Lancashire County Council in 1920 and converted for use as a hospital. Rufford Pulmonary Hospital opened on 6 August 1926. It had 50 beds to treat patients with tuberculosis. Subsequently, it was used by the NHS as a pre-convalescent hospital until its closure in 1987. The convalescent hospital was administered by Ormskirk and District General Hospital. Rufford Park The Heskeths created Rufford Park around the hall, with a deer park, a ha-ha, and leisure gardens surrounded by a stone wall. Rufford Park extended from the boundary with Holmeswood to the boundary with Croston and Mawdesley. The area was divided by the Liverpool-Preston Turnpike Road (the A59 Liverpool Road). The development of the park resulted in cottages being demolished and their inhabitants relocated in the village. The park is screened by trees and contains an ice house, a rose garden, a restored ornamental garden, lake, and plantations. The southern part of the park is designated a Biological Heritage Site, and is home to bats, red squirrels and other species of animals, shrubs and rare fungi. =Ice house= The ice house is a Grade II listed building, one of three survivors in the district. The building was renovated when the main hall was restored and is protected and maintained by the estate. It is circular, built in sandstone, brick and earth with a domed roof above an underground chamber entered through a brick passage. Surrounding the ice house is a ha-ha forming a complete circle about in diameter. In winter ice was taken from the frozen lake to the ice house for storage for the rest of the year. =Lodges= Gate posts at Rufford New Hall in 2010. Rufford New Hall had three lodges, which can be seen on the 1847 Ordnance Survey map. Holmeswood Lodge was constructed in the early 19th century on Holmeswood Road. Hesketh Lodge was constructed in the early 19th century as the main entrance lodge. It was named after the original owners. It is a single storey building and is stuccoed with stone dressings. Croston Lodge is the north entrance lodge on the A59, Liverpool Road, built in 1798. It is a single storey brick building with a slate roof. Springwood Lodge is the former gamekeeper or gardener's cottage. Restoration Restored garden doorway in 2010. The hall and north wing were restored and converted into apartments and mews houses. The stone cantilevered staircase with the Hesketh family crest, the Georgian belvedere tower and the oval glass dome on the roof have been retained. The hall retains its Ionic colonnades and portico. The stable block has been converted to mews cottages. The formal gardens, ornamental ponds, lawns and tennis courts have been restored. The majority of trees around the hall are protected by a Tree Preservation Order and include many species, the rarest being a handkerchief tree.

Among the initial group of journalists were Gabriel García Márquez, Rodolfo Walsh, Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, Rogelio García Lupo, Leonardo Acosta and Carlos María Gutiérrez. Prensa Latina had its license revoked in the United States in 1969, after the Cuban government closed down Associated Press and United Press International offices in Havana.

Tiron (died 1306 × 1307), Abbot of Arbroath and Bishop of Dunblane, was a late 13th-century and early 14th-century churchman in the Kingdom of Scotland. Little is known about Nicholas until he appeared on 21 November 1299, holding the position of Abbot of Arbroath in a charter of that abbey; the last attestation of his predecessor Henry can be dated to 16 October 1296, so that Nicholas must have become abbot sometime in between these two dates.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 4. As Abbot of Arbroath, he was a canon of Dunblane Cathedral, and entitled to participate in episcopal elections. Bishop Alpín had died sometime between 1 October 1299 and 15 October 1301, and the new election to the bishopric became deadlocked.Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, pp. 85-6; Dowden, Bishops, p. 200; Watt, Dictionary, p. 522; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100. Several canons had emerged as candidates, and it seems to have been decided that all candidates should proceed to the papal see to request judgment from the Pope.Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, p. 86; Dowden, Bishops, p. 200. As it happened, Abbot Nicholas was the only candidate to travel to the papacy; as Cockburn commented, \\"An abbot could face the heavy expense; no poor canon of the Cathedral could\\".Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, p. 86. When no other turned up, the Pope authorised Nicholas' provision, and he was consecrated by Theodoric, Bishop of Palestrina, on 13 November 1301.Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, p. 86; Dowden, Bishops, p. 200; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100. Nicholas' short career as bishop is not well recorded. In the events of the early Wars of Scottish Independence, Nicholas' role is unclear and aside from some appearances in the charters of Coupar Angus Abbey, his name is largely absent from the evidence. He appears for the last time, in papal documents, on 26 January 1306 and was dead a good time before 11 December 1307, when his successor Nicholas de Balmyle was consecrated as bishop in France.Dowden, Bishops, p. 201; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 100-1.

The main character and her friends are wild, crazy \\"Jang\\" teenagers whose lifestyle is full of reckless behaviour, promiscuous sex, repeated suicide (on dying they are reborn), and a constant search for thrills. Over the course of the story, the nameless narrator fails to relate to her seven Jang friends but finds herself, feels emotion, and learns love. Synopsis=Setting= On a desert planet in the distant future, humanity inhabits three domed utopian cities: Four-BEE, Four-BOO, and Four-BAA. Humans have no responsibilities; their daily needs are served by quasi-robots which even run the government through a Committee. Young humans known as \\"Jang\\" are rigidly expected to do whatever they please, indulge in various forms of drugs, have sex (as long as they marry first, even if it is just for the afternoon), and live for their own pleasures. They can visit, have their dreams constructed for them, buy or steal anything they want at will, and even sabotage the city (though the robots instantly repair any damage). Robots handle everything, and nothing is left for the humans to do. Nor can they die in any meaningful sense; when they do, they are resurrected in a body customised to their wishes.Lee, Tanith. Don't Bite the Sun. 1st Ed. New York : Bantam Books, 1976. Print. =Technology= People can change bodies every thirty \\"units\\" (days) or commit suicide if they want a change before the allotted time. They can be male or female, and body designs can get very fanciful, with wings and antennae frequently worn. They can travel by bird plane or bubbles on waterways, or teleportation through a Body Displacer. Travel between the cities is by sky-boat, a large floating cruise vessel, or sandship, a cruiser that hovers just off the ground. News is transmitted via \\"flashes,\\" perhaps on public screens at various points in the cities and on viewscreens in private homes. \\"Picture-Vision\\" is an endless transmission of artistic images on film, both live-action and animation, usually plotless erotica; when the narrator tries to create an animated Picture-Vision piece in her search for work, she's told it's good, but has too much of a story to it. Android or quasi-android animals are common as pets, but real animals are also not unusual. Children go to hypno-school to learn complex math that will never be used again except in meditation, all while completely asleep. The cities are completely climate-controlled. Consumer goods and services are paid for through emotional energy; one goes into a pay booth and expresses fervent, enthusiastic gratitude, often aided by drugs. Outside the domes, however, lies uninhabitable desert, plagued with sandstorms, volcanic eruptions, and furry, long-eared, egg-laying beasts that wander the great expanses. =Plot= The book opens with the narrator visiting Hergal, a close friend, after his fortieth suicide-by-birdplane. Offended by his insensitivity, she kills herself, then, in a new body, embarks on a series of mundane attempts to amuse herself, including stealing a white fluffy desert animal that she keeps as a pet, programming elaborate dreams for herself, having unsatisfying sex with her peers, and employing a wide variety of legal drugs. Incapable of making emotional connections with anyone, she finds her life increasingly unsatisfying, though her demanding and difficult pet does interest her. Soon after going through the mundane rituals of her life the narrator feels like she should not be a Jang teenager any more. However, the quasi-robots who run the city determine that she is not ready to become an older person. Soon she tries looking for a useful job, but to no avail: robots and computers perform every useful task. She then attempts to have a child, but is unable to find a suitable partner, tries to have a child with herself by taking a male body, and ends up causing the child to die. Unable to fill the emptiness she feels, she joins an expedition to explore the deserts outside the city. During this expedition, the narrator realises the beauty of life outside of the domes and she gains a strong emotional connection with her stolen pet. However, it is then accidentally killed, devastating her. Upon returning to the city, she is still unable to make lasting emotional connections with her peers. She considers death and wonders if she really belongs in the city or somewhere else. =Drinking Sapphire Wine= In this sequel, the narrator has spent the past several years in male form and studying ancient history, learning the art of swordsmanship as a pastime. His friend Danor returns from the city of Four BAA; their circle of friends gathers to welcome her, and the narrator deceives them and escapes with Danor to his home. Danor has had an illegal affair with an older person, Kam, whom she still loves. Infuriated at the trick, another circle member, Zirk, challenges the narrator to a duel. The narrator's superior skill wins the bout, but he commits the supreme crime by killing Zirk (even though Zirk is resurrected). The narrator is tried, convicted, and sentenced to exile outside the domes. Demanding a refitted sandship, a luxury cruiser ordinarily used to travel between cities, the narrator (now female) tries to reconnect with the desert, including befriending local wildlife. A little \\"Grey-Eyes\\" creature falls into the food/water processor, and while it's unharmed, the processors explode. When the resulting spout of water irrigates the surrounding desert into blooming life, the narrator decides to cultivate the \\"garden\\" and demands equipment from the city, whose \\"news flash\\" teams create a documentary with her permission. Danor and Kam arrive, having chosen exile even before the film so they can be together; Jang teens soon follow, and the quasi-robot government forms a plan to quell the rapidly growing out-dome community. Tanith Lee, Drinking Sapphire Wine. DAW, 1976. Characters=Jang= * Danor – A friend of the narrator's who loses the ability to \\"have love\\" successfully and becomes celibate, surrounded by adoring fans. Predominantly female. She later finds connection and joy with Kam, an Older Person, but their relationship is forbidden. * Hatta – An unusual character. Unlike the other Jang members, Hatta is not obsessed with outward beauty but instead focuses on individualism, going so far as to always be physically ugly. Loves the narrator and wants her to accept him for his inward beauty. * Hergal – A young Jang male fascinated with suicide, sex, and ecstasy. Bird-plane enthusiast. * Kley – A friend of the main character, tending to be sadistic and bullying as a woman, shy and retiring as a man. * Zirk - A member of the narrator's circle, although they dislike each other. As a female, usually small, delicate and twee: as a male, usually huge, muscular, short-tempered and loud. * Lorun – The epitome of a Jang male. The narrator falls in love with him while she searches for a suitable parent for her child- to-be. * Sarl – Lorun's Jang friend. * Narrator – The main character, predominantly female. She has only known the Jang way of life, but tires of it and wants more out of life. As a female, she often chooses exotic beauty; as a male, favors robust, competent bodies or slender \\"poetic\\" forms. * Thinta – Predominantly female and one of the narrator's close friends, she is fussy and anxious but has a warm, caring demeanor. She loves cats and would like a more catlike body but is told this is impossible. Her name is an anagram of \\"Tanith\\". =Older people= * Glar Assule – A self-styled archaeologist who sets out to explore desert ruins on an expedition (a glar is a professor or teacher). * Narrator's Makers – Both male older people who created the Narrator and looked after her until after she graduated from hypno-school. * Kam - An older male from BAA who develops a committed bond with Danor. A very steady, knowledgeable, resourceful but romantic character, he favors blue and violet colors. =Other= * Pet – The pet is a possession of value for the main character. It has white fur, whiskers and orange eyes. It resembles a dog, but has six legs. * Quasi-Robot – The Quasi-Robot is an android, a robot that has human qualities and may even pass for a human. * Quasi-Robot Medicine Man – The Quasi-Robot Medicine Man is there when the main character wakes up in Limbo. Another assists her when she asks to be examined to see if she is ready to graduate to Older Person status. * Grey-Eyes - Technically named binnimasts, they are desert animals, yellow with brown ruffs and grey eyes, look adorable, and travel in groups. The narrator attempts to make a pet of one.

Fantastic fiction can be a way of describing an imperfect world that can provoke social change. Women writing science fiction as part of the New Wave “recuperate[d] female archetypal roles that have fallen into stereotypes; … recover[ed] a lost matriarchal tradition in myth and history … deal[t] explicitly with woman-centered issues such as rape and gender inequality … and … reenvision[ed] traditional fantasy from a feminized perspective of caring and community.” Don't Bite the Sun formed part of a projected trilogy (with Drinking Sapphire Wine and an unwritten third novel); such long novels and multibook series became increasingly common during the 1970s. Don’t Bite the Sun features considerable technology developed in the 1970s, including robots, game rooms and virtual reality, and compact computers.Nakate, Shashank. \\"Technology in 1970s.\\" Buzzle.com. Buzzle.com, 27 2012. Web. 18 October 2012. Tanith Lee also credits feminist writers such as Elizabeth Bowen and Angela Carter as significant influences during her early career.\\"Innsmouth Free Press.\\" Innsmouth Free Press. Innsmouth Free Press, 17 November 2009. Web. 15 October 2012. While she did not consider herself a feminist author during the period in which she wrote Don't Bite the Sun, she later acknowledged her feminist influencesClute, John, and Peter Nicholls. \\"Feminism.\\" Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993. Print. The New Wave fascination with soul-crushing dystopian worlds is apparent in Don't Bite the Sun but is subverted into an apparent soul-crushing utopia. Lee planned a third book, about the dome city of Four BII which hadn't even been mentioned in the first two books Reception Don’t Bite the Sun has received largely positive reviews on online sources such as Amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com, and Goodreads.

As its name implies, it is native to the island of Socotra, Yemen. Although it is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List, its population is considered to be stable. Description The Socotra buzzard measures 45 cm in length. Adults typically have yellow-white abdomen and breast. They display fine brown streaking on their throat and breast, with the streaking being heavier on breast, abdomen, flanks, and thighs. Certain individuals display a white throat and upper breast. The species exhibits short, compact wings with a length of approximately 358 mm, a tail length of 188.5 mm, and a tarsus length of 65.19 mm. There is little difference in plumage between adults and juveniles, the main difference being in the intensity of the streaking on the underparts Taxonomy Although the species has been observed for more than 110 years, it wasn't recognized as an official species until 2010. Prior to that, it was assumed to be the same species as B. buteo. There has been much debate about the taxonomic position of the Socotra buzzard. It is genetically closest to the taxa rufinus and bannermani, but its plumage is most similar to the taxa trizonatus/oreophilus. Habitat and Distribution Buteo socotraensis is found only on the island of Socotra, Yemen. The species lives in foothills and plateaux of the island, as well as places where one can find deep ravines. It is usually found at altitudes between 150–800 m. The species requires cliffs to nest, as it does not seem to be dependent on trees. As such, it has been observed that it might compete for nesting grounds with other bird species such as vultures, ravens, and falcons. According to the most recent population surveys, it has been suggested that there are fewer than 500 individuals on the island. Behaviour=Vocalizations= Only one sonogram has been made of B. socotraensis, and because of such a small sample size, this behavioural trait has not been included in its taxonomy. Its call is very similar to other species of the same genus, namely Buteo rufinus, B. buteo, and B. oreophilus . A key identifying characteristic of the species' call is the short period (<1 second) between calls. Its call has a frequency of 2.2 kHz, a similar but different frequency than other species in the same taxa. =Diet= The island of Socotra island has very scarce population of mammals, making the Socotra buzzard's diet consist of mainly reptiles and invertebrates. Its opportunistic hunting style makes it unlikely that it hunts on other species of birds. =Reproduction= Aerial tumbling and talon grappling have been observed as behaviour during breeding season, which usually occurs in September–April, with egg laying in September–January. They build their nests on cliffs or crevices, and their broods have been observed to range between 1-3 nestlings. Both male and females have been observed tending to their young, and remaining present during the post-fledging period. Nests have been found at altitudes of 150-650m, in shaded areas to protect them from the sun during the day.  References External links * Clements, J. F., T. S. Schulenberg, M. J. Iliff, B.L.

The novel was Lee's first published novel for adults, and also the first novel in The Birthgrave Trilogy. Inspired by Lee's own personal dreams from her early twenties, the story follows a nameless protagonist through various towns on a journey to discover who she really is and what she is capable of. The Birthgrave received mostly positive reviews and was nominated for the 1975 Nebula Award for best novel. Setting The book opens in the heart of a dormant volcano and takes place in a brutal ancient world transformed by genocidal pestilence, war, fierce beauty, and cultural devastation. This world has an early medieval culture with “decadent imperial civilizations,” small city states, nomadic groups, constant little wars and skirmishes and conquests, swords and primitive cannons, multiple religions worshipping various deities, and powerful but mysterious magic. Although the main setting is mostly medieval, Karrakaz's world is later revealed to be just one of many planets visited by the mysterious “hollow star” exploration spaceship. Synopsis The novel begins with the unnamed narrator awakening inside a volcano with no idea who she is. The story follows her quest to discover her past and her true identity. Compelled by a mysterious entity called “Karrakaz,” the narrator sets off in search of a glistening jade that may hold answers to her questions. After emerging from the volcano, the narrator encounters a village that reveres her as a goddess due to her healing powers and her inhuman face, which she considers hideous. The leader of this village, a bandit-king named Darak, persuades the narrator to join him on his expeditions to raid a merchant caravan, trade for weapons, explore a cursed, ruined city, and compete in a deadly chariot race, leading to Darak's demise. She continues to the cities of the White Desert and becomes the goddess of a decadent civilization fighting for the deceitful sorcerer-conqueror Vazkor, who uses the narrator as his instrument of power. However, thanks to Vazkor, the narrator learns about her people, a long-lost omnipotent civilization of Old Ones who once ruled the world as cruel, arbitrary gods. In the end, she also kills Vazkor. Leaving the cities, she is enslaved by a tribal krarl, gives birth to Vazkor's son, wanders onward, battles a dragon, and encounters a spaceship from a distant advanced civilization. The spaceship computer reveals the narrator's forgotten past. Karrakaz, the entity that spoke to her in the volcano, is actually part of herself—her lost name—and she was a princess of the Old Ones, who were wiped out by a plague at the height of their power. She sought refuge within a volcano temple and lay dormant for 16 years. Ultimately, her guilt at the evil of her race caused her to create Karrakaz as an alternate personality commanding her to destroy herself. In the end, at peace with herself, Karrakaz discovers the jade she sought in her own forehead, and learns that behind the mask, her face is not hideous, but unimaginably beautiful. Characters * Narrator: The heroine, an amnesiac member of an ancient race with incredible powers, always masked. * Karrakaz: a mysterious voice that speaks to the narrator, urging her to die. * Darak: Leader of the bandits and hill people, an excellent charioteer, and the narrator's lover. * Giltt, Kel, and Maggur: The narrator's first bodyguards/followers. * Asutoo: part of the tribe called The Dark Ones.

Background When writing The Birthgrave in 1975, Tanith Lee changed her genre to adult fiction and focused on planetary romance. The novel was inspired by Tanith Lee's experience of waking up from a dream in her early twenties haunted by mental images of a white female curled up inside of a live volcano, images which led to a fascination with the protagonist and later to the opening paragraph in the novel. With the publication of The Birthgrave by DAW, Tanith Lee entered the science fiction field, and her career rapidly took off thanks to the emotional depth of her narrative and her female protagonists. = Writing process = The Birthgrave was written by Tanith Lee around the age of 22; her mother typed the manuscript. Much of the novel is based on Lee's own dreams where she was in the place of its narrator, which she describes as, ”we rose from fire and from death, fell deep into passions of love, raced the chariots…and withered and regained our destiny.\\" When she first dreamed of the book's heroine, Lee described her as “white as ice, unknown to me as the back of the moon\\". Lee usually doesn’t plan out her stories, often starting with creating the characters and “just writing” the story around their personalities. The process of writing, Lee stated in a 2009 interview, usually takes about two weeks for her novels. Tanith Lee's influences when writing mainly come from music, literature, film, and prominent public figures. The Birthgrave was Lee's first adult novel, but was initially rejected by many publishers until it was picked up by DAW Books of America, launching her career After reading fantasy novelist Jane Gaskell's “The Serpent” and noticing that she didn’t stick to the typical Real World setting, Lee was influenced to do just the same. She was also very fascinated by Gaskell's take on sexual romance and psychology and how she flowed the two different writing styles into one [14]. DAW was very interested in her story and chose to publish her, which turned out to be quite the success[15].  Creation  Lee had just finished a year at art college and had been taking minuscule jobs, such as waitressing and shop work. She had been in a bookstore, looking through books published by DAW, whom she admired. She then had a thought of why not taking a chance and sending one of her own stories to DAW to be published. That story was “The Birthgrave” and its creation came from her very own imagination. The opening scene was formed from the mental image of a woman being curled up in a ball inside a volcano, which was based on a strange awakening Lee had in her early twenties After reading fantasy novelist Jane Gaskell's “The Serpent” and noticing that she didn’t stick to the typical Real World setting, Lee was influenced to do just the same. She was also very fascinated by Gaskell's take on sexual romance and psychology and how she flowed the two different writing styles into one DAW was very interested in her story and chose to publish her, which turned out to be quite the success. Critical reception Following its publication in 1975, The Birthgrave was met with favorable reviews, and continues to be widely praised today . Critics have praised its “genius”, emotional depth, uniqueness and Lee's immense talent at creating a fluent and imaginative map for the reader through a sword and sorcery epic plot. \\"Many of exciting conventions included show blood-and-thunder pulp fantasy without making the reader feel cheated. That is, I did not feel as if I'd been lied to -- being promised a sword-and- sorcery story and then given something else entirely.\\" Critics reveal that the author effortlessly sustains both ultramodern and primeval genre's integrity of the world she has created, no matter how unusual or unique her writing approach may be. Its literary elements succeed within the service of The Birthgrave's story and its authentic characters, which embellish her cross- genre ability. Although some have objected that the plot is repetitive and predictable, critics are near-unanimous in praising the prose and the memorable female protagonist, who is the first in a series of widely praised protagonists in Lee's writing.  Themes  Critics have noted numerous themes in The Birthgrave, particularly the theme of power. Within the different societies the narrator encounters, the image of a healer recurs. The narrator takes on the role of the healer in these societies and then abuses her ranking and her use of power to control the societies. While the narrator travels through the different societies, gender issues affect the narrator while she stays in these societies. The narrator also struggles with self-discovery, trying to find out who she was and how her race became extinct. The Washington Post noted Birthgrave as novel featuring \\"vigorous heroines, often a warrior or a sorceress” who eventually finds herself as she travels on her quests.  Writing style  Critics have highly regarded Tanith Lee's writing style; her style crosses new boundaries in a fantasy setting. Lee's writing focuses mainly on fantasy and science fiction.Haase, Donald. The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2008. Print. Her writing features very complex writing and emotions.\\"Book Review: The Birthgrave Trilogy.\\" Milliebot Reads. N.p., 19 July 2015. Web. 05 Oct.2015. Her books often show a “sword and sorcery” genre with battling for oneself and battling for love. Her style is able to capture the reader and is often described as having “the talent and ability for painting with words”.Scheidler, Tim. \\"The Birthgrave: Pretty Good.\\" Fantasy Literature Fantasy and Science Fiction Book and Audiobook Reviews RSS. Fantasy Literature, n.d. Web. 05 Oct. 2015. Readers and viewers have also described Tanith Lee's writing, especially for The Birthgrave, as having “hidden humor”.

Plot summary=Part One= Azhrarn, Prince of Demons, falls in love with the mortal boy Sivesh and raises him in Azhrarn's kingdom, the Underearth. Sivesh longs for the surface of the earth and ultimately for the sun, which is fatal to Azhrarn. Even Azhrarn's creation of a beautiful woman, Ferazhin, does not satisfy Sivesh. Eventually Sivesh remains on earth and Azhrarn tricks him to his death. A grotesque minor demon called a Drin makes seven of Ferazhin's tears into a necklace. Azhrarn takes it to the earth, where desire for it creates mischief, as he hoped. It finally comes into the hands of the blind poet Kazir, who intuits its nature and enters the Underearth. Azhrarn offers to let him meet Ferazhin if he can name anything Azhrarn needs. Kazir shows him in a song that he needs humanity, his plaything. Kazir and Ferazhin spend a happy year together, till Azhrarn causes Ferazhin's death, but Kazir brings her back with a song. =Part Two= Azhrarn overthrows a vainglorious king. Zorayas, one of the king's daughters, survives but is horribly disfigured by injuries. After suffering humiliation and rape and learning her parentage, she ruthlessly regains her father's kingdom. To avenge herself on Azhrarn, she tricks him into remaining above ground after sunrise in a dome simulating the night sky, but releases him when he makes her peerlessly beautiful. Becoming used to getting whatever she likes, she wants a collection of diamonds that are cursed if stolen. They are owned by two brothers. She makes one of them fall in love with her and give her the diamonds, but then she spurns him and he dies. The surviving brother gives her a magic mirror that makes her fall in love with her image; when she tries to embrace it, she annihilates herself. =Part Three= Azhrarn tries to seduce an engaged girl and is rejected. In retaliation, after her groom impregnates her on their wedding night, he has a Drin turn the groom into a monster. Furthermore, another demon separates the male part of her daughter's soul from the female part, and has the male part animate a still-born baby far away. The baby girl, Shezael, grows up beautiful but passive, while the baby boy, Drezaem, grows up wild, victorious in every fight, and unmatchably virile. When Shezael comes into possession of a strand of Drezaem's hair (attached to a traveling minstrel's harp), she searches for him, unaccountably finding the way and surmounting every obstacle. Azhrarn tries to keep them apart, but at last they join each other and he gives them his blessing. The monstrous bridegroom is restored to humanity and named Qebba by a magician, Kaschak. At first a good servant, he comes to resent Kaschak and fights him with the magic he has learned. Kaschak cannot destroy him but imprisons him on a remote island, where Qebba's hate increases without limit. When he dies, he becomes a disembodied spirit, Hate, who causes all kinds of violence over the earth. Eventually humankind is about to become extinct, so Azhrarn, remembering Kazir's song, sacrifices himself by exposing himself to sunlight and thus overcomes Hate with love. Without Hate and the Prince of Wickedness, humanity enters an Age of Innocence, but Azhrarn is reborn, ending it. Reception Susan L.

It won the British Fantasy Award for best novel of 1979. Plot summary Unlike Night's Master, which is told as separate stories, Death's Master is a continuous narrative. The lesbian queen Narasen is forced by a curse to become pregnant in order to save her city. After fruitless sex with many men, she realizes that she cannot lift the curse till she has sex with a dead man. She makes a pact with Uhlume, Lord Death, and brings this about. Her child, Simmu, is beautiful and can change easily from male to female. Narasen is assassinated. Simmu, only a few days old, sees Death come for Narasen and forms a permanent hatred for death. Simmu is raised by the minor demons called Eshva, then by priests at a temple. Zhirem, the son of a king and one of his wives, is made invulnerable by his mother. This arouses suspicion and hostility, and he is sent to the same temple as Simmu. The two become friends and briefly lovers (while Simmu is female). Zhirem becomes angry at Simmu for this corruption. Azhrarn, the Prince of Demons, rejects Zhirem's offer of service, increasing his bitterness, but takes Simmu as a lover and makes her forget Zhirem. He starts Simmu on a quest to gain immortality. Narasen, in Death's kingdom, defies Uhlume and begins a power struggle with him. Simmu and Azhrarn learn the location of a well on the flat earth directly under the well of the gods' water of immortality in \\"Upperearth\\". The earthly well is guarded by walls and by nine beautiful virgins whose intactness symbolizes the inviolability of the well. One of the virgins, Kassafeh, rejects the illusions intended to make her time as a guardian paradisal. Simmu goes through the wall and enters each virgin's bed as a woman but seduces each one as a man. He ends with Kassafeh, who becomes his ally. The virgins being deflowered, the upper well cracks, and Simmu and Kassafeh collect some of the water of immortality in a flask. They each drink a drop. As they travel to the east to found a city of immortals, a rogue named Yolsippa unknowingly drinks a little water from their flask. They grudgingly accept him. With help from the demons, they build the beautiful city of Simmurad and bring the most brilliant people of the time to be immortal there. However, with no fear of death, the people of Simmurad stagnate. Zhirem, shipwrecked, sinks to the bottom of the sea and becomes a captive of the sea people. By forming a relationship with their princess, he learns their magic and escapes to land. Now named Zhirek, he uses magic for selfishness and cruelty. At the suggestion of Azhrarn, who is bored with Simmurad, Uhlume makes Zhirek his agent to destroy it. Zhirek enters the city, magically creates and kills an insect to introduce death there, and raises the sea to flood the city. Kassafeh and, by a fluke, Yolsippa escape and become Uhlume's representatives. Zhirek takes Simmu away and tries to consign him to everlasting torment. However, Simmu eventually becomes an Eshva. Zhirek, overwhelmed with guilt and hate, becomes an ascetic living on a pillar. Narasen takes on most of Uhlume's work of giving death to the dying.

The Flat Earth floats amid formless chaos; the sun and moon rise out of the chaos in the east, travel across the upper ethers of the world, and then descend back into chaos in the west. What happens to the sun and moon while in chaos is not clear. The cosmology of the books is composed of four \\"layers\\": the Underearth, which is the realm of demons; the Flat Earth itself; the Upperearth, which is the realm of the gods; and the Innerearth, the realm of the dead. The Underearth is a place of fantastic, awful, sorcerous beauty and wonder. It is most often reached through the shaft of a gigantic extinct volcano; this shaft is guarded by three gates: the first is made of agate, the second is made of blue steel, and the third gate is made of black fire. There is only one city in the Underearth – Druhim Vanashta, the city of demons. It is made of precious minerals, gems, and metals and is beautiful, though its inhabitants are cruel and wicked. The Flat Earth appears to include temperate, sub-tropical, and tropical zones, including many deserts. Since \\"polar\\" regions would be impossible on a flat world, they are not mentioned in the series. There are many seas, but bodies of water large enough to be called \\"oceans\\" do not appear to be present. The Upperearth is an ethereal realm not visited by humans, and infrequently visited by demons. It is a blue, cloudy realm, with hazy mountains ever at the horizon but impossible to reach. One feature is a glass well that contains the water of immortality; it is guarded by two \\"angelic\\" beings. The Upperearth is inhabited by \\"gods\\" – extremely powerful, ethereal beings that are invisible, formless, genderless, and absorbed in their own magnificent thoughts. They are utterly unconcerned with the affairs of humanity, except for one or two occasions when they meted out a terrible, world-altering punishment.  Characters *Azhrarn, called \\"Azhrarn the beautiful\\", Night's Master, or Prince of Demons. Azhrarn is the ruler of the demonic Underworld and lord of all three castes of demons. Azhrarn is the most powerful of the Lords of Darkness, being the personification of wickedness (though the demons are also said to have invented love). In the mythology of the Flat Earth, Azhrarn is said to have existed before the gods created humankind, whereas the other Lords of Darkness are personifications of lesser human fears and weaknesses. Azhrarn's role in the series varies between protagonist and worker of random cruelty. In appearance, Azhrarn is an unspeakably handsome man with pale white skin, night-black hair and eyes, and black clothes. His touch provokes ecstasy. He often takes on disguised human forms or the form of a black eagle, and his black robes often unfurl in a manner suggestive of eagle's wings. Azhrarn's home and capital is the city Druhim Vanashta. *Uhlume – called Death's Master, or Lord Death. Uhlume is the personification of death. He did not exist before the creation of humankind, as demons and gods (the inhabitants of the world before humans) are deathless. In appearance, Uhlume is a beautiful man with polished jet-black skin, milk- white hair and eyes, and white clothes. He does not relish his role as bringer of death, finding it rather boring. Uhlume also lives in the Innerearth, in a featureless, colorless desert. The only other inhabitants are the ghosts of mortals who struck bargains with him during their normal lives and are thus condemned to spend a certain time on this plane after their deaths. Eventually, he abdicates much of his role to the woman Narasen, who was a warrior queen during her lifetime. *Chuz, called \\"Chuz the Mad\\", or Delusion's Master. Chuz is the personification of madness, and like Uhlume, did not exist before the creation of humankind. Of all the Lords of Darkness, Chuz is most likely to change shape, appearing as a beggar, servant, priest, and so on. His \\"true\\" form is that of a man who is handsome and young on his right side, and withered, ugly, and demonic on his left side. His right hand is entirely demonic: the fingers are brass snakes, and the thumb is a black beetle. Chuz typically wears white gloves and a damson-colored robe embroidered with sharp fragments of glass. He carries dice that have no markings, and the jawbones of an ass. Chuz does not have a realm; he wanders the world at will, both spreading and attracted to madness. * Kheshmet, called \\"Fortune's Master\\". Kheshmet is the personification of fate. He appears as a king dressed in orange and gold robes, and carries a wooden staff and a large, sullen lizard. Like Chuz, he may vary his form as needed, and does not have a realm. Instead he travels where threads of fate lead him. It is not clear if he determines fate, or merely appears where strange fates occur. He plays only a minor role in the series (unless he is covertly responsible for various events). * Azhriaz, also known as \\"Delusion's Mistress\\" and \\"Night's Daughter\\". She has also called herself or been called Soveh, Sovaz, and Atmeh. Azhriaz is the daughter of Azhrarn and a mortal woman named Dunizel. Although mortal, Dunizel was not merely human; she was infused at conception with the magical energy of the sun itself. Azhriaz is thus part demon, part human, and part solar being. Azhrarn created her with the intention of sowing mischief and woe upon the world, specifically to teach humans the folly of worshiping the gods, but she is initially unwilling to accept this role and eventually abandons it. For much of her life she and Chuz are in love. She accepts death, and her reincarnation appears in Night's Sorceries. In appearance, Azhriaz is a beautiful woman with milk-white skin, sapphire-blue eyes, and night-black hair. She appears to be about seventeen years of age, and often wears all black.

The Silver Metal Lover, published in 1981, is the first in the series. Metallic Love, published in 2005, is the second novel. The Silver Metal Lover=Plot summary= Robots have replaced human labor on earth, causing massive unemployment in a world devastated by pollution and natural disasters. Then Electronic Metals releases a new line: performing artists and sexual companions designed to entertain human partners. Jane, a rich, lonely, and insecure 16-year-old, meets one, the minstrel Silver, and falls passionately in love, despite revulsion at the idea of preferring a mechanical man to a human. She gives up everything she has known for him, and discovers herself. Silver becomes more and more \\"human\\" in loving her—a clever illusion created by his programming. Or is it? This unstable society can't afford any evidence that some robots might be indistinguishable from humans. Tragedy is inevitable. =Adaptations= A graphic novel of the Silver Metal Lover, adapted by Trina Robbins, was published by Crown Books in 1985 but later went out of print.

IT’S ALIVE! TO PUBLISH TANITH LEE’S THE SILVER METAL LOVER BY TRINA ROBBINS,\\" Comic Crusaders (January 2, 2018). Singer Julia Ecklar, in her album Divine Intervention (released in 1986), recorded a song titled \\"Silver\\" which is based on Lee's novel. The song is from Silver's point of view about Jane's feelings for him, basically being a tune about an impossible love. Just as in The Silver Metal Lover, there are hints about Silver also caring for Jane (although the song also implies that Silver is not capable of love). Ecklar plays off of the uncertain relationship between the two characters: the melody is soft and romantic despite its conflicting lyrics. Metallic Love=Plot summary= As an orphan growing up in the slums, Loren read her clandestine copy of Jane's Story over and over, relishing every word. But Loren is no Jane. Savvy and street-smart, Loren could never be stirred by a man of metal, her passion never ignited by an almost-human - even one designed for pleasure. Still, when the META corporation does the unthinkable and brings back updated versions of robots past-Loren knows she must see Silver. And just like Jane, it is love at first sight. But Silver is now Verlis. If he was perfection before, he is now like a god. Yet he is more human than his creators think - or fear. While Loren doesn't quite trust him, she will follow her twice-born lover into a battle to control his own destiny - one that will reveal to her the most astonishing illusion of all. Series Tanith Lee expressed interest in writing a third novel in the series, titled The Tin Man, which would return to the story of Silver and Jane. However, Lee died in 2015 and the status of this potential story at the time of her death remains unknown.

As a result, sufferers of gephyrophobia may avoid routes that will take them over bridges, or if they're a passenger, will act very apprehensive when the driver driving them is passing over a bridge. Some possible explanations of gephyrophobia may be the fear of driving off the bridge, the fear of a gust of wind blowing one off the bridge, or the fear that the bridge will collapse if they try to cross it (a fear that the bridge lacks structural integrity). The fear overlaps with acrophobia (the fear of heights) as gephyrophobia tends to be exacerbated in taller bridges as compared to those closer to the water or ground beneath. Dr. Michael Liebowitz, founder of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, says, \\"It's not an isolated phobia, but usually part of a larger constellation ... It's people who get panic attacks. You get light- headed, dizzy; your heart races. You become afraid that you'll feel trapped.\\" It is a situational phobia. As of 2008, the New York State Thruway Authority would lead gephyrophobiacs over the Tappan Zee Bridge. A driver could call the authority in advance and arrange for someone to drive the car over the bridge for them. The authority performed the service about six times a year. The Maryland Transportation Authority previously offered a similar service for crossing the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, but that role is now filled by private companies. The Mackinac Bridge Authority, which oversees the Mackinac Bridge, which connects Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas, will drive one's car across its span for any needy gephyrophobiacs. Some thousand drivers take advantage of this free program each year.Tom Carr, Record-Eagle Leslie Ann Pluhar had her Yugo blown off that bridge. Later investigation showed the driver had stopped her car over the open steel grating on the bridge's span and that a gust of wind through the grating blew her vehicle off the bridge, although this is not supported by recorded wind speed measurements taken on and around the bridge at the time of the accident. The term gephyrophobia comes from Greek γέφυρα (gephura) meaning \\"bridge\\"γέφυρα, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and φόβος (phobos) meaning \\"fear\\".φόβος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus In media Gephyrophobia is the main plot in \\"The Bridge\\" episode of The Middle. The character Brick is plagued by the phobia. In 1965's A Charlie Brown Christmas, Lucy references gephyrophobia (albeit with a slight mispronunciation) when attempting to diagnose Charlie Brown's problems at her psychiatric help stand. The term is referenced in the 2012 book The Silver Bridge Disaster of 1967, an account of the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge across the Ohio River, connecting Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio. Gephyrophobia is referenced in \\"The Car\\" episode of the second season of This Is Us.

This was an important social congregation where the marriages of Maithil boys and girls are fixed up according to the reading of horoscope by the Panjikars ( Registrars ).Fairs The gathering is organised in an orchard covering 22 bighas of land that was donated by the Maharaja of Darbhanga.http://www.hindu.com/2004/06/22/stories/2004062209300300.htm accessed on Jan08, 2008  History of Saurath village  Original name of the village, as mentioned in 'Tithi Nirnaya' is Saurashtra. This village was originally named Saurastra, literally a cultural and intellectual centre of sau-rastra, nations associated with Janaka, the ancient king of Mithila. Janak is mention in the Ramayana epic as father of Maithili Princess Sita. Tradition has it that the svayambara (self-chosen form of marriage) of Janaka's daughter, Sita, took place in this village. The presiding God of this village is Somanath or Shiva. There is an interesting story which links Saurath to Somnath Temple In [sourastra], Gujarat. According to folk tradition, in AD 1025, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked the famous temple of Somnath, looted the fabulous wealth of the temple, and destroyed it completely. It is believed that Lord Somnath appeared in the dream of the two Maithil Brahman brothers, Bhagirathdutta Sharma and Gangadutta Sharma, and asked them to take His lingam away. The two brothers, following God's instruction, went to Dwarka and brought the lingam to Saurath and kept the lingam in hiding for a long time. Later the lingam was duly enshrined. Somanath temple at Dwarka is situated in a region known as Saurashtra. In the 18th century a Maithil king constructed here the temple of Somnath.http://www.ignca.nic.in/viir0004.htm accessed on 8 Jan 2008 This story is mentioned in the introductory chapter of the official District Gazetteer of Darbhanga (1964, when Madhubani district was part of Darbhanga) by Roy Choudahary, available in all major libraries of India.  Saurath Sabha or Sabha Gachchi  Mithila King Harisinghdeva (1310–1324) introduced Panji Prabandh in Mithila. This applied to Brahimins and Kayasthas. Panji Praband gave rise to an elaborate system of genealogical records, which is known as Panji. This was considered a major social reform at that time and was enforced through royal patronage and supervision.Anthropology of Ancient Hindu Kingdoms: A Study in Civilizational; Author - Makhan Jha It was proposed that to facilitate marriage and to curb evil practices associated with the fixing of marriages, the marriage people should be allowed to meet father as well as the prospective grooms so that the marriage could be fixed in front of everyone. The Maharaja of Mithila once again sanctioned this idea and accordingly 14 villages were identified to hold such sabhas: Saurath, Khamgadi, Partapur, Sheohar, Govindpur, Fattepur, Sajhaul, Sukhasaina, Akhrarhi, Hemnagar, Balua, Baruali, Samsaul, and Sahsaula. While Saurath maintains the tradition, all other villages have discontinued holding such Sabha.  Tradition of Saurath Sabha  Almost every year, during suddha or auspicious days for the settling of marriages, thousands of Maithil Brahmans gather at Sabha Gaachchi in Saurath. The Panjikaras (the person maintaining \\"Panji\\" or genealogical record) plays a very important role in fixing of marriage since it is obligatory for every person desirous of marriage to get a certificate called asvajajanapatra (non-relationship) from a panjikara, stating that there is no \\"blood relationship\\", as per the prescribed rules of prohibited degrees of relationship, between the bride and groom. There is a fixed sitting place – dera – for every village in the sabha. The timing and number of days etc. are decided in a general meeting of the scholars and pandits of Mithila in accordance with the traditional astrological almanac– Pachanga. Usually it is held for seven to 15 days every year or sometimes twice in a year during the auspicious period (months). After reaching at the dera the father or guardian of a bride starts searching for a suitable groom with the help of his relatives and a ghatak (middleman). The negotiation takes place in a complete democratic manner since it is held in open, in sight and hearing of everyone around. The grooms also arrive at their respective deras along with their parents.Article - Chaupal As Multidimensional Public Space for Civil Society in India - K K Mishra However, ladies are not allowed in Saurath Sabha.

The popular English Hymnal of 1906 was considered too 'High church' by many people, and a new book on broader lines was indicated. It was initially to be called Songs of the Spirit but in the end the title was changed to Songs of Praise, from the hymn by J. Montgomery, \\"Songs of Praise the angels sang\\". Musically, it deliberately omitted several Victorian hymn tunes and substituted \\"modal\\" tunes by Shaw and Gustav HolstGrove Music and descants by Vaughan Williams and by Martin Shaw's brother Geoffrey Shaw. It was hoped by the editors that the book would be found suitable for childrenPreface to Songs of Praise, 1925 edition and this proved to be the case. Many educational authorities used the book, and the national character of Songs of Praise was established and the book was adopted by a number of churches. Education Authorities and others began to press for the inclusion of extra hymns. By 1929 the question of enlargement had become urgent, and a special committee was formed to do the work. As well as the three editors it included Canon Briggs, Mr Noel Burghes, Canon Dwelly, Dr R.C. Gillie, Mrs Maxtone Graham (Jan Struther) and Mr. W. Charter Piggott. Mrs Martin Shaw acted as secretary. In 1931 this second, enlarged edition was published, which included for the first time the hymn \\"Morning Has Broken\\".

Where every genre is represented: pop, country, hip hop, rock etc. The database is updated constantly with new releases. Where a song lives in the universe (i.e. where it is positioned in the database's grid) is determined by patterns in its melody, harmony, chord progression, rhythm, beat, pitch and so on. Songs with similar patterns are close to each other and form groups; songs that are vastly different end up far apart. Recent hit songs only account for a small number of these groups.

Founded in 1973 by Rabbis Chaim Davis and Gershon Weisenfeld, and further developed by Rabbi Meir Stern who replaced Rabbi Wiesenfeld when the latter became ill before the yeshiva's opening, it developed into one of the leading yeshiva gedolas (advanced Talmudic institutions) in the United States and revitalized the small Orthodox community of Passaic. History In 1973 Rabbi Shneur Kotler, rosh yeshiva of Beth Medrash Govoha, Rabbi Nosson Meir Wachtfogel, mashgiach ruchani of Beth Medrash Govoha, and Rabbi Dov Lesser supported the idea of opening a community kollel in Passaic. These Gedolim chose Rabbi Chaim Davis, founder of the Toronto Community Kollel, and Rabbi Wiesenfeld, then a rosh mesivta (head) of Beth Hatalmud Rabbinical College, to head the new institution. In mid-1973, however, Rabbi Wiesenfeld became seriously ill and was replaced by Rabbi Meir Stern. Rabbi Wiesenfeld died at age 49 on 24 September 1981. The Yeshiva Gedola of Passaic opened with 10 unmarried students in the yeshiva section and 10 married students in the kollel section. By the mid-1980s enrollment had reached nearly 100 students. In 1989 the yeshiva relocated to its own campus, including a beth midrash (study hall), dining room and dormitories. The growing yeshiva, together with the installation of an eruv and a mikveh, turned Passaic into a more desirable location for Orthodox Jewish families. Passaic's close proximity to New York also appealed to breadwinners who commuted to New York daily. Beginning in the mid-1980s, more and more Orthodox families began moving to Passaic. As of 2006, the Jewish community had mushroomed to 1300 families in a two-square- mile area, with a net gain of 80 families per year, making it the second fastest-growing Jewish community behind Lakewood, New Jersey.

He began his senior career at Celtic before going on to play for Barnsley, Carlisle United and finally Greenock Morton. Archdeacon played on the left-wing for the majority of his career, although dropped back into a more defensive role in his later years. Playing career Archdeacon began his career with local side Gourock United before signing for Celtic in August 1982. A left-sided player, he generally played in an attacking role wide left for Celtic. At 18 years of age, Archdeacon made his first team debut for Celtic in April 1984, coming on as a substitute and scoring in a 4–2 win over Motherwell at Celtic Park. Due to regular winger Davie Provan's illness in season 1985–1986, Archdeacon began to play regularly for the Celtic first team at that time. This run of first team action saw the young winger make 23 league appearances that season, scoring 3 goals.Celtic FC Statistics 1985/1986 Over the next three years a variety of factors dented his confidence however, and despite his undoubted skill on the ball he failed to become a first team regular at Celtic Park.Barnsley past players He did however experience the joy of scoring against Rangers, capitalising on carelessness between Rangers full- back Jimmy Nicholl and goalkeeper Chris Woods by nipping in between them and toe-poking the ball from 15 yards into an empty net. It was Celtic's third in their 3–1 win in April 1987. Archdeacon made a handful of appearances at the start of the following season, the club's Centenary season (1987–88), and he scored direct from a free kick in a 3–2 win over Falkirk in October 1987. However, the arrival of new signings Frank McAvennie and, in particular, Joe Miller, saw Archdeacon drift out of manager Billy McNeill's plans as the season progressed. Whilst at Celtic, Archdeacon won a Scottish Premier Division League Championship winner's medal in 1986 and made a single appearance for the Scottish under-21 team the same year against West Germany.Jack Rollin, Guinness Soccer Who's Who, Guinness, 1994, p. 9 He also made a second-half appearance as a substitute for Mark McGhee in the 2–1 defeat against Rangers in the 1986 Scottish League Cup Final. In June 1989 Archdeacon moved to Barnsley for £80,000 he and became a fixture for the Yorkshire club in the following seasons. He made 233 league appearances for the \\"Tykes\\", scoring 23 goals. Barnsley were an established side in England's second tier at that time (Division Two until 1992 when it was re-branded Division One on the formation of the FA Premier League), never quite succeeding in gaining promotion although they narrowly missed out on a play- off spot in 1990-91 on goal difference. Archdeacon left the club in 1996 to join Carlisle United and was a regular member of the team during a season and a half there. He picked up a winner's medal in April 1997 when his side defeated Colchester 4-3 on penalties to win the Football League Trophy. Late in 1997 former Celtic team-mate Billy Stark paid £100,000 to take him to Greenock Morton and Archdeacon played for and captained his home town side until his retirement through ankle injury in 1999. Retirement Since retiring, Archdeacon worked for a time as a Youth Team coach with Celtic and currently works with the U13's at the Academy. He has turned out for the Celtic legends team. His son Mark Archdeacon is currently playing in the Scottish Junior Football League with Dalry Thistle after spells with Motherwell, Brechin City and Clyde.

In February 1919, he volunteered for the of the Lithuanian Army. In June of the same year he started education at the War School of Kaunas.

In 1926 he became a captain.

The only opportunity to prevent Soviets from deporting the whole Ciunis family to Siberia was to donate most of the family estates to the state and join the Soviet military. In September 1940, he was assigned to the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 259th Rifle Regiment of the Red Army (RA). In December of the same year he was assigned to the 619th Artillery Regiment of the 184th Rifle Division, and became chief of the chemical warfare company. In June 1941, Ciunis became chief specialist of the 179th Rifle Division for chemical warfare. As Operation Barbarossa started, German Army Groups North and Centre invaded the Lithuanian territory.

As the events of war progressed, Ciunis found himself retreating with the remains of the RA 29th Rifle Corps to the depths of Russia. In August 1941, he was sent to the Soviet officers' academy „Bыстрел“ () in Solnechnogorsk. Afterward he became a professor at the 2nd war academy in Omsk.

It was written around 1604 (the exact date of completion is not known) and published in 1626 by a press in Zaragoza (without Quevedo's permission), though it had circulated in manuscript form previous to that. Purpose of the work The only novel written by Quevedo, it is presented in the first person singular and chronicles the adventures of Don Pablos, a buscón or swindler. Pablos sets out in life with two aims: to learn virtue and to become a caballero (gentleman). He fails miserably in both.Henry Ettinghausen, “Quevedo's Converso Picaro,” MLN, Vol. 102, No. 2, Hispanic Issue (Mar., 1987), 241. El Buscón has been considered a profound satire on Spanish life, but also as a literary exercise for Quevedo, in that he was able to utilize word-play and verbal flourishes and his skill as a literary caricaturist. El Buscón also propounds the notion that children of parents without honor will never be able to achieve honor themselves. C. Brian Morris has written that Quevedo pursues Pablos with a series of \\"desgracias...encadenadas\\" (\\"linked calamities\\").C. Brian Morris, \\"The Unity and Structure of Quevedo’s ‘Buscón’: ‘Desgracias encadenadas’\\", Occasional Papers in Modern Language, no. 1 (Hull: University of Hull, 1965). James Iffland describes these \\"linked calamities\\" as a \\"torturously up and down, bouncing trajectory which marks Pablos's career from the outset.\\"James Iffland, Quevedo and the Grotesque (Boydell & Brewer, 1982), 76. Quevedo satirizes Spanish society, but also attacks Pablos himself, who attempts throughout the novel to achieve a higher station in life and become a gentleman. Such aspirations from the lower classes would only destabilize the social order, in Quevedo's eyes. Quevedo punishes Pablos for attempting to better himself. \\"For Pablos, human society is the only reality. He knows no other. He is young, innocent, a little foolish.\\"Terence E. May, Wit of the Golden Age: Articles on Spanish Literature (Edition Reichenberger, 1986), 125. Eventually, Pablos is driven to become a pícaro, or rogue. The work also incorporates autobiographical elements. In 1608, Quevedo dueled with the writer and fencing master Luis Pacheco de Narváez as a result of Quevedo criticizing one of his works. Quevedo took off Pacheco's hat in the first encounter. They were enemies all their lives.Destreza Translation & Research Project: Famous Duels Luis Pacheco de Narváez y Quevedo, historia de un odio In El Buscón, this duel is parodied with a fencer relying on mathematical calculations having to run away from a duel with an experienced soldier. Quevedo makes an early references to the effects of syphilis when he puns in his Buscón:wikisource:es:Historia de la vida del Buscón: Libro Primero: Capítulo III: continues with [...] porque se le había comido de unas búas de resfriado, que aun no fueron de vicio porque cuestan dinero;: \\"[...] because it had been eaten by the bubons of a cold, which were not of vice because they cost money;\\". about a nose entre Roma y Francia meaning both \\"between Rome and France\\" and \\"between dull and eaten by the French illness\\". = Linguistic significance = Picaresque works are valuable linguistically because they record the argot of many sectors of society -both the language of the antihero and the criminals the antihero meets on his travels.Christopher J. Pountain, A History of the Spanish Language Through Texts (Routledge, 2000), 159. Quevedo's novel gives a considerable amount of information about Germanía, or Thieves' cant. Structure and plot A portrait of Quevedo. In terms of its structure, it is divided into three books. Book One is divided into seven chapters; Book Two is divided into six chapters; Book Three has ten chapters. One scholar has argued that the structure Quevedo adopts is not one of randomness and Pablos the focus around whom a series of satirical characters and situations group. Instead, \\"Buscón has a unity and coherence created by something other than the hero's presence, for an orderly train of misfortunes, which connects network of recurring motifs...\\"C. Brian Morris, \\"The Unity and Structure of Quevedo’s ‘Buscón’: ‘Desgracias encadenadas’\\", Occasional Papers in Modern Language, no. 1 (Hull: University of Hull, 1965), 6. These motifs include the closely related themes of family, filth, and legal and lawless cruelty.Morris, \\"The Unity and Structure of Quevedo’s ‘Buscón’, 6. = Book One = Pablos is first introduced as a child. His father, Clemente Pablo, is a barber and a thief. His mother, Aldonza, is a prostitute and a witch. It is implied that she is a Morisco; Pablos writes: Sospechábase en el pueblo que no era cristiana vieja (\\"It was whispered in town that she was not an old Christian [i.e. a \\"new Christian,\\" a recent convert to Christianity].\\")Francisco de Quevedo, Vida del Buscón, llamado Don Pablos (Barcelona: Editorial Juventud, 1968), 43-4. Pablos' brother, also a thief, was flogged to death in prison. Pablos wishes to go to school, and his parents agree to let him go. At school, he befriends a boy named Don Diego Coronel, but Pablos suffers various setbacks there. Pablos decides to neither return to school nor home, and remains as the friend and companion of Don Diego, who also decides to leave school. Diego’s father, Don Alonso, decides to make both boys wards of a man named Dómine Cabra, in Segovia. The two boys suffer from hunger at the hands of Cabra. When another boy dies of starvation, Alonso removes both boys from the school and sends them off to Alcalá to study. On their way there, they stop at an inn, where Pablos is mocked and hazed by a group of students. At Alcalá, since Pablos is not a gentleman, he is separated from Don Diego, and is hazed and beaten by some university students. During the night, he is beaten again by four students who shared a room with him. Pablos then acts out, killing some pigs that did not belong to him, and puts on a party, tricking his landlady into giving him two chickens. He also robs some sweets from a local merchant and some swords from the rector and a justice of the peace. His friends laugh at his antics. Pablos then receives a letter that his father has been hanged and his mother imprisoned. For his part, Don Diego receives a letter from his father stating that he does not wish for his son and Pablos to be friends. The friends separate, and Pablos decides to meet with a relative and receive an inheritance due to him as a result of his father’s death. = Book Two = On his way to Segovia to claim his inheritance, Pablos encounters a slightly mad engineer. They converse on various topics, including King Philip III's recent edict expelling the Moriscos from Valencia. Many villages were totally abandoned as a result, and local aristocrats were complaining that the new laborers were fewer in number and were not as familiar with local agricultural techniques. They stay at an inn, and Pablos encounters a teacher there, who attempts to give him a lesson. Pablos and the engineer part ways. The next day, Pablos comes across an old cleric, also mad, and they eat dinner at an inn. They also part ways. Pablos continues on his journey, coming across a soldier with terrible wounds, as well as a hermit. They reach Cercedilla. They play cards and the hermit tricks Pablos and the soldiers, thus getting all of the winnings. Pablos parts ways with the three, and meets up with his uncle, Alonso Ramplón, in Segovia. There is a great dinner at his uncle’s house, and everyone gets drunk, except for Pablos. While everyone is sleeping off the drink, Pablos goes for a walk. When he returns, he kicks out all of the partygoers except for his uncle, with whom he discusses his inheritance. Pablos takes leave of his uncle, and heads for Madrid, and encounters a man who claims to be a gentleman who has visited the royal court. The alleged hidalgo gives Pablos lessons on how to behave himself at court, how to lie, how to take advantage of certain situations. = Book Three = Pablos and the alleged gentleman arrive at the house of Don Toribio Rodríguez Vallejo Gómez de Ampuerto y Jordán, who also claims to be a gentleman. At this house, Pablos encounters various cheats and liars, a cofradía de pícaros y rufianes (confraternity of rogues and ruffians). Pablos, still wishing to become a gentleman, is dressed in rags and patched-up clothing. He is subsequently arrested and thrown into prison, along with his new-found friends. Pablos befriends the jailer, who decides not to flog him. The jailer eventually liberates Pablos and dines with him; Pablos claims that he is a relative of the jailer’s wife. His friends, however, are flogged and exiled to Seville. Pablos changes his name to “Ramiro de Guzmán,” and goes to an inn. Pablos decides to pretend to be rich in order to win over the daughter of the innkeeper, Berenguela de Rebolledo. Berenguela falls for his lies and tells Pablos to visit her at night by climbing the rooftop and entering her room in this manner. Unfortunately, the roof collapses. The innkeepers wake up, and, infuriated, beat him and have him thrown into jail. They whip him in jail, until he is liberated by two men, one from Portugal, the other from Catalonia, who also had their sights set on Berenguela. The two men try to arrange a marriage between Berenguela and Pablos, but Pablos encounters some rich, elderly women. Renaming himself again as “Don Felipe Tristán,” Pablos arrives at the villa where the two women reside. One of these old women, however, has three nieces, all single, and wants Pablos to marry one of them. He falls for Doña Ana, the most beautiful of the three. As they picnic, a gentleman approaches, who is none other than Don Diego. He spots Pablos without being noticed himself. Pablos plays cards with all the ladies, and wins a lot of money. The next day Don Diego confronts him, and has his old friend beaten. He is arrested by a justice of the peace and taken to an inn. Pablos remains there, until he takes to the road again with a new career: that of a beggar. He meets another beggar, Valcázar, who teaches him in this new profession. Pablos earns some money and buys new clothes, a sword, and a hat, and takes off to Toledo, where no one will recognize him. Pablos meets up and joins a group of comedic actors, and Pablos works as a script writer for them. He takes on another new name, “Alonso el Cruel.” He writes some poetry as well. The leader of this band of actors, however, is apprehended by the police. The group is dispersed and Pablos abandons this profession and falls in love with a nun. He goes to mass frequently to see her; the nun ignores him. He travels to Seville, where he joins a group of thieves. The thieves go out to drink and eat together, and become intoxicated. When they return home, they are stopped by the police, who kill one of the thieves. The others disperse and are not caught, but Pablos and the other thieves decide to try their luck in the Indies, to see if their luck will change. Pablos tells us, at the end of the novel, that things in the Americas went even worse for him there.Henry Ettinghausen, \\"Quevedo's Converso Picaro,\\" MLN, Vol. 102, No. 2, Hispanic Issue (Mar., 1987), 241.

It is directed by Prachya Pinkaew, with martial arts choreography by Panna Rittikrai. It also stars Hiroshi Abe and Pongpat Wachirabunjong. Plot Zin is the Thai lover of Yakuza boss Masashi. Zin was previously the girlfriend of Thai gangster No. 8, who was jealous of her relationship with rival gangster Masashi. After Zin chooses Masashi, he shoots his own toe as a symbolic gesture and forbids Zin from ever seeing him again. Zin asks Masashi to go back to Japan, as they would not be able to be together safely. He begrudgingly leaves. Soon after, Zin finds herself pregnant and moves into a new place to get away from No. 8. She has a daughter named Zen who is soon found to be autistic. As Zen gets older, Zin one day decides to tell Masashi about his daughter by writing him a letter. No. 8 finds out that Zin is in contact with Masashi and is furious. He visits Zin and cuts off one of her toes to remind her that she is forbidden from seeing Masashi. Zin is forced to move again to a house shared by a Muay Thai Kickboxing school. Zen becomes infatuated with martial arts and from a young age, and learns martial arts by mimicking the moves she sees being performed by the school's students, as well as the martial arts movies that she sees on television, among them Bruce Lee and Tony Jaa films. She also has uncanny reflexes and is able to catch balls thrown at her without even looking. One day when coming home from work, Zin sees a little boy named Moom being picked on in the streets. Feeling sorry for his plight, she takes him in. Zin then falls ill with cancer and does not have the money to pay for chemotherapy treatments. Zen and Moom attempt to make the money needed to pay for them by having people throw balls at Zen as a street performance act. However, they are not able to earn enough to keep up with the treatments. One day Moom discovers a list of debtors in an old notebook from the days when Zin was a high-interest moneylender under No. 8. In order to get money to pay for her mother's cancer treatment, Zen and Moom decide to collect on the debts. The first attempt to collect the money turns violent, and Zen uses her copied martial arts skills to fight back. This leads to further confrontations with various criminal gangs and, eventually, No. 8. No. 8 learns that Zen is collecting debts for the sake of Zin's treatment, and Zin finds out what Zen and Moom have been doing for money when her toe is sent to her as a message. She realizes there will be retaliation from No. 8, and sends Moom to mail a letter to Masashi asking for help. Moom is captured by No. 8's gang, but No. 8 has the letter mailed anyway, because he wants to deal with both Zin and Masashi. Masashi receives the letter in Japan and leaves the Yakuza for the sake of his family. When Moom does not return, Zin goes to confront No. 8 to save Moom and try to reach a solution, bringing Zen with her. The meeting turns into a fight in which both Zin and No. 8 are wounded and No. 8 takes Zin hostage. Zen fights through many of No. 8's crew to get her mother back and faces Thomas, a capoeirista boy with Tourette's who proves to be a match for her until she adapts to his erratic fighting style. Zen's father, Masashi, eventually makes it to the battle, but while he and Zin are fighting No. 8's men Zin is mortally wounded by No. 8. Angered by what has happened, Zen continues to battle through No. 8's men until she catches up with No. 8 and throws him off the third story of a building to his death. She returns to her mother only to find her dead. Masashi comforts his long lost daughter and adopts her.

He played for California from 2007 to 2010. High school Riley was born on January 27, 1987, to parents Rhonda and Faustin Riley in Portland, Oregon. He attended Beaverton High School, where he played football. Riley was considered the top player in Oregon as a senior by Rivals.com and SuperPrep magazine. He was named Portland metro area player of the year after passing for 2,580 yards with just six interceptions on 239 attempts. He was team MVP and vice president of his class as a junior and senior. College career=2007= Riley made his first career start for the injured Nate Longshore in California's homecoming game against Oregon State. Riley passed for 294 yards, two touchdowns, and rushed for a touchdown but California lost the game when he scrambled instead of throwing the ball away to set up a field goal to tie the game. Riley did get credit for putting Cal in a situation to win after being down 31-21 late in the fourth quarter.BAD NEWS, BEARS: SHOT AT NO. 1 GONE Riley took over for Longshore in the second quarter of the 2007 Armed Forces Bowl. He passed for 269 yard, 3 touchdowns, and rushed for a touchdown, helping the Bears turn a 21-0 deficit into a victory. Riley was the game's MVP.Riley an armed force for Bears off the bench =2008= Riley competed with Longshore for the starting quarterback job, winning the position for the first four games. He led the Bears to wins over Michigan State at home, throwing for 202 yards and two touchdowns. He only played during the first half of the Bears' 66-3 rout of Washington State, which allowed the backup players to get some starting time. The win resulted in the Bears breaking into the Top 25 at #23, but they were upset in College Park, Maryland on September 13 by the unranked Maryland Terrapins. With the Bears' offense stifled by the Terrapins' defense for three quarters, Riley threw three touchdown passes in the fourth quarter for 423 yards on 58 attempts, a school record for the most pass attempts. Riley looks to pass during the 2008 Big Game Two weeks later, he started against Colorado State at home on September 27, during which he threw for 59 yards and one touchdown pass. With Cal up 21-0, Nate Longshore stepped in at quarterback in the third quarter and threw for two touchdowns in the fourth. This resulted in the starting quarterback position being reopened by head coach Jeff Tedford for the following week against Arizona State on October 4. Longshore was picked as the starter and led the Bears to a 24-14 victory. On October 18, Riley stepped in at quarterback in the fourth quarter during an away game against the Arizona Wildcats. He was unable to lead a comeback, throwing for 97 yards and one interception, and the Bears fell to the Wildcats 42-27. Riley got the start the following week against the UCLA Bruins, his first since Colorado State nearly a month prior. He threw for 153 yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter, in the 41-20 victory. Riley also got the start the following week against the Oregon Ducks. He sustained a concussion after being hit in the first quarter when he failed to slide while trying to gain a first down and did not return to the game. Longshore stepped in and led the Bears to a 26-16 upset over #23 Oregon. The following week against USC, Riley took over in the second half but was unable to lead the Bears to an upset of the #6 Trojans. Riley got the start the following week against Stanford for the 111th Big Game. He threw for 101 yards, including three touchdown passes, in the Bears' 37-16 victory over the Cardinal and reclaiming of the Stanford Axe. Riley's three start run ended when Longshore was picked over him to start the 2008 Emerald Bowl against the Miami Hurricanes, which the Bears won 24-17. Riley was expected to compete for the starting quarterback position in 2009 with redshirt freshman Brock Mansion. =2009= Riley calls out signals at the line of scrimmage against Eastern Washington on September 12 Riley was named the starter for the 2009 season a week before the team's season opener against Maryland, a contrast to 2008 when head coach Jeff Tedford alternated between him and Nate Longshore. On September 5, Riley threw for 298 yards and four touchdowns against the Terrapins, each to a different receiver. The following week against Eastern Washington he threw for 151 yards and a score, also getting his first rushing touchdown of the season. At Cal's first away game on September 19 against Minnesota, he passed for 252 yards. Riley struggled the following week against Oregon, being sacked four times and held to 123 passing yards. Although was replaced in the fourth quarter by Beau Sweeney, the Bears could only muster a field goal to Oregon's 42 points. Riley fared slightly better against USC on October 3, throwing for 198 yards and an interception. However, the Bears were again blown out in a 30-3 loss. Two weeks later against UCLA, Riley bounced back, leading the Bears to a 45-26 victory in which he threw for 205 yards and three touchdowns. He followed this up with a 229-yard and three touchdown performance against Washington State, the worst team in the conference. Riley played perhaps his best game of the season against Arizona State in Tempe. Cal narrowly defeated the Sun Devils 23-21, with Riley throwing for 351 yards and a pair of touchdowns. On November 7, despite passing for 200 yards and a touchdown, Cal sustained its fifth straight loss to Oregon State. In Cal's final home game against #18 Arizona, the Bears upset the Wildcats 24-16. Riley threw for 181 yards and a touchdown, being intercepted twice. Cal entered the Big Game against Stanford as the underdog on November 21, hanging on to pull off a 34-28 upset in which Riley threw for 235 yards and a touchdown. The regular season ended for Riley on a sour note, with an upset by Washington in which he was sacked five times, despite throwing for a score and 215 yards. Against Utah in the Poinsettia Bowl, Riley passed for 214 yards in the 37-27 loss. He accounted for all three of Cal's turnovers and was sacked four times. =2010= Riley entered the 2010 season as the Pac-10 Conference leader in wins and touchdown passes. He was named to the watch list for the Manning Award on July 22. Despite an inconsistent performance in 2009, he retained the starting quarterback job. In the season opener against UC Davis on September 4, Riley threw for 258 yards and three touchdowns, following this up with 197 yards and four scores, all to different receivers, the following week against Colorado. On September 17 he had 277 yards, a touchdown and three interceptions in a loss to Nevada in Reno, while throwing for 116 yards and an interception in a narrow loss to Arizona on September 25. On October 9 against UCLA, he threw for 83 yards and a touchdown, while scoring himself on a rushing touchdown. Riley sustained a season-ending injury to his left knee when he was hit low during an October 30 road game against Oregon State and had to be helped from the field. He did not return to the game. Junior redshirt Brock Mansion was the starter for the remainder of the season. Post college career Riley was invited to participate in the San Francisco 49ers' Local Pro Day in April 2011. He also tried out for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League. Riley signed with the Lions on May 27, but was later cut by the team on June 5. Riley now works in medical sales in San Francisco.

Boomsma (born 18 November 1957, Huizen, The Netherlands) is a Dutch biological psychologist specializing in genetics and twin studies.  Education  * Secondary education: Willem de Zwijgerlyceum, Bussum * Bachelor's: Vrije Universiteit in Psychology, cum laude, 1979 * Master's: Vrije Universiteit in Psychophysiology, cum laude, 1983 * Master's: University of Colorado at Boulder in Biological Psychology/Behavior Genetics, 1983 * Ph.D.: Vrije Universiteit (thesis: Quantitative Genetics of Cardiovascular Risk), cum laude, 1992  Career  After receiving her Ph.D., Boomsma received an appointment as an assistant professor at the Vrije Universiteit in the Department of Psychonomics. In 1994 she became associate and in 1998 full professor and head of the Department of Biological Psychology.  Twin studies  Boomsma has built a database of over 75,000 twins and family members in The Netherlands, which has been used for dozens of twin studies. The twins and their families have undergone periodic testing over a period of decades, providing a mass of longitudinal data for statistical analysis. A large number of participants have also provided DNA, blood, and urine samples for testing. Her research has primarily focused on better understanding the influence of heredity on various physical and mental diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, pediatric bipolar disorder, and depression. This work has been reported in over 1000 published papers and one book and has led to many awards for Boomsma.  Research  Twin studiesClassical Twin Studies and Beyond, www.nature.com provide a way to understand how genotype affects an observable characteristic (called a phenotype). In short, identical (monozygotic) twins carry the same alleles for 100% of their genes whereas fraternal (dizygotic) twins will carry different alleles at 50% of the genes for which their parents had different genotypes. So if some characteristic (say, depression) that is observed in one identical twin is always observed in the other one, but this does not hold for fraternal twins, then one can conclude that heredity plays an important role in causing the condition. Boomsma has been a pioneer in collecting a broad spectrum of data (e.g., medical histories, IQ tests, MRI scans) and biological material (e.g., DNA and RNA samples, blood and urine samples) from thousands of twins and analyzing them to determine the role of genetics in characteristics as varied as adult height, brain volume, intelligence, migraine headaches, anxiety, drug addiction, and love of coffee. Her results span a wide range of behavioral characteristics, including discovery of the surprisingly large genetic component to feelings of loneliness,Heredity May Be the Reason Some People Feel Lonely, Science Daily the fact that first borns have higher IQs than their younger siblings,First- Born Babies More Intelligent than their Siblings, Medguru and the increased influence of genetics on body weight as children grow older.Body Size in Five- Year-Old Twins: Heritability and Comparison to Singleton Standards, Twin Research and Human Genetics  European Research Council Advanced Grant  In 2008, the European Research Council began awarding grants of about 2.5 million euro (about $3.5 million) to the top scientists and scholars in Europe via a competition that covered all academic disciplines. Due to the large amount of money and complete lack of bureaucracy and restrictions, these were extremely competitive, with a very strong applicant pool and a 13% acceptance rate. Boomsma received one of the ERC grants for a project on the genetics of mental illness. Her research is focusing on three themes: * Neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD, anxiety, depression) and cognition * Depression, anxiety, substance use, abuse, and dependence * Depression, migraine, obesity, and cardiovascular disease The goal of this research is to use her twin database and biological specimens to try to determine which genes play a role in causing these conditions.

A sequel, to be written and directed by Bruce Carson, was announced in 2017.  Plot  In the small town of Pakoe, Shannon Davis is beheaded by a man wearing swimming goggles and a burlap sack. Investigating this homicide and a previous one are new sheriff Carl Carson, and mortician Walt Parker. As the bodycount rises and the killer begins taunting the police, suspicion falls on Charlie Puckett, a disfigured gardener who wears a mask similar to the serial killer's. Charlie is brought in for questioning, but he refuses to talk, so Carson requests help from Walt, who had served alongside Charlie in the Vietnam War. Walt gets Charlie to confess, but Carson has doubts about his guilt, so he sets a trap which flushes out the real killer - Walt. Carson explains that he had looked into Walt's history, and discovered that he had dismembered a civilian in Vietnam, though the charges were dropped. When Carson mentions that Charlie was released from custody, Walt panics, and reveals that Charlie is just like him; Charlie helped him kill the Vietnamese girl, and is the one who murdered all of the Pakoe victims after Shannon Davis. Carson leaves to look for Charlie, while the detained Walt is allowed to call home. Walt's daughter Tanya informs him that Jenny, his stepdaughter, has left to explore the abandoned barn that Charlie was living in. Fearing for Jenny's safety, Walt escapes custody. Charlie reaches the barn (after killing several people, and wounding Carson) and corners Jenny, who is saved by Tanya. As the sisters flee Charlie, they accidentally shoot their father with Carson's gun, though as a last act Walt saves his daughters by setting Charlie on fire. The next day, Carson and his men scour the lake Charlie that ran into, but the search is called off by the district attorney, who prematurely closes the case, content with stating that Walt was responsible for all of the murders. As the sheriff laments that it is not over, Charlie is shown picking up a female hitchhiker on the outskirts of town.

Consolidating with other school districts was considered, but it was determined that joining Peoria Public Schools District 150 would require annexation into the city of Peoria, and that neither the Elmwood or the Glasford school districts had the capacity to take on the 570 students in the area. A group of educators and other citizens decided that the only solution was to build a high school. A public election on February 5, 1949, voted District 310 into existence; and, on March 14, the board of education first met and elected its officers.

It is recorded as Freschena circa 1115 and as Freschenei circa 1150. The name is Viking, meaning 'freshwater island' (Old English Frescan ēa).Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.188. In 1885 Kelly's reported two Wesleyan chapels, one built in 1804. The chapel built in 1839 is Grade II* listed. It recorded that Friskney parish was a centre for brick making and the catching of shrimps and cockles. In the early part of the 19th century, much of the land was wetlands or swamp, where wildfowl were caught by use of decoy ponds. One of these ponds is now a listed ancient monument. The swamp was drained in the early 19th century and the land converted for arable cultivation. Governance Friskney is part of the electoral ward called Wainfleet and Friskney.

Friskney, with its surrounding farmland, is the largest village by area in the UK, and one of the largest in Europe. Community The Grade I listed Anglican church is dedicated to All Saints. The original church was constructed in the late 12th century; it had elements added up to the 15th. Restoration to the chancel was carried out in 1849. During an extensive restoration in 1879, Norman and Early English Gothic architectural fragments were discovered. The lower stage of the tower, with large lancet windows, is Early English, as is the second stage. The two upper stages are 15th-century, as is the font. In the north aisle is an incised stone slab to John de Lyndewode (rector, 1374) and a mutilated effigy of a 14th-century knight, likely damaged during the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation.Cox, J. Charles (1916) Lincolnshire pp. 130-132; Methuen & Co. Ltd During the 1879 restoration, a series of faded wall paintings were revealed between the arches of the arcades.

He is an attorney, and she is a translator of books. Their existence is affected not only by their disintegrating relationship but by the threats of urban crime and vandalism that surround them everywhere they turn, leaving them feeling paranoid, scared, and desperately helpless.

She asked Grade to fund the film which she did for minimal payment and a share of the profits; Grade agreed. He says the budget was so low he managed to recoup his money. Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote \\"I must confess that Desperate Characters left me, if not unmoved, then unenriched. It's as if its cheerlessness had been bottled straight, without the additive that transforms recognizable experience into art...In every respect, the screenplay is a vast improvement over Gilroy's Pulitzer Prize-winning The Subject Was Roses. Its literary style, however, is similar, and it's a style to which I...find it difficult to respond. His characters talk in great chunks of theatrical exchanges, and monologues, which not only deny the splendid accuracy of the situations and the settings, but also somehow make me suspicious of the integrity of the characters. This is especially true of the supporting characters, who are always telling us too much, remembering too many details out of the past, nudging us for sympathy and never letting us discover them at our own speed...I have a feeling that the director has perfectly served the writer. That is to say that Gilroy has realized the movie he intended to make. I wish I liked it more.\\"The New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as \\"a terribly interesting and well-acted movie that does not deserve some of the criticism it's getting...Kenneth Mars offers a deeply felt, complex performance...Shirley MacLaine, as his wife, achieves one of the great performances of the year. She proves that we were right, when we saw her in films like The Apartment, to know that she really had it all, could go all the way with a serious role. Watching Miss MacLaine and Mars work together is enough to justify the movie, whatever you think of its urban paranoia.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review TV Guide rates it 3½ out of a possible four stars and calls it a \\"well-written if somewhat stagey character study [with] one of Maclaine's best performances.\\"TV Guide review Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic called this \\"a film of authenticity, of delicately realized intangibles: small-scale about large issues, truthful without settling for honest-to-God TV fact.\\" He lists it as a \\"top film worth seeing\\" in late 1971. 9/25/71, Vol. 165 Issue 13, p24-34, 2p Awards and nominations *21st Berlin International Film Festival: ** Silver Bear for Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine, co-winner with Simone Signoret) ** Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement (winner) ** Silver Bear for Best Screenplay (winner) ** UNICRIT Award (Frank D.

History  Chos Malal was founded on 4 August 1887 by Colonel José Olascoaga. It developed as a control point for policing the movement of cattle with a view to the suppression of cattle raiding. The city was the capital of the Territorio del Neuquén until 1904 when the capital and administrative buildings were moved to Neuquén, capital city of the Confluencia Department, the arrival there of the railway having provided an economic boost which helped the city of Neuquén to grow very rapidly. =Toponymy= The name Chos Malal derives from Mapuche words meaning \\"yellow corral\\" – from the distinctively yellow colour of the sedimentary flagstone rock that predominates in the hills surrounding the city.  Geography  Chos Malal is located between the Neuquén River and Curi Leuvú river in the Cordillera del Viento. It is surrounded by conifer forests, mostly of Araucaria trees.

The firm specializes in air disaster litigation and has represented plaintiffs in most major aviation disaster litigations. According to the New York Times, Lee Kreindler, a named partner of the firm, was \\"considered the founder of air disaster law.\\"New York Times, February 19, 2003. Firm practice areas also include maritime and general torts, business litigation matters and class-action securities cases. In the non-aviation area, the firm is currently representing former professional football players in the NFL concussion litigation, plaintiffs in the Fresenius dialysis drug litigation, victims of the BP oil spill, plaintiffs in the Toyota class-action and also plaintiffs in various major securities cases, including the AIG and Countrywide litigations.  Aviation Accident Law Treatise and New York Law of Torts Treatise  Kreindler partners Brian Alexander, Justin Green and Daniel Rose continue to edit and update Kreindler Aviation Accident Law, the longtime leading treatise on aviation law, first written by Lee S. Kreindler in 1963, and published by Matthew Bender. Firm partners also authored and currently edit the New York Law of Torts, published by West Group, which is a leading treatise on New York tort law.  Notable litigation = Pan Am Flight 103 = Aviation lawyers at Kreindler & Kreindler LLP represented victim families from the 1988 Lockerbie disaster. They won liability and damages verdicts in cases against Pan American World Airways on the basis that the airline was guilty of 'wilful misconduct' for allowing a bomb to be smuggled on board their aircraft. The litigation against Pan American was a close call, after winning the trial, the firm won the defendants appeal to the Second Circuit on a 2–1 vote. In 1996, the firm sued Libya for sponsoring the terrorist attack and later settled the case against Libya for 2.7 billion dollars. James Kreindler and other lawyers from the firm won the Public Justice 2009 Lawyer of the Year award for their work on the case. = TWA 800 = The firm represented victims from the TWA 800 disaster and Lee Kreindler (d. 2003) was one of the first to claim that the disaster was caused by mechanical problem, and not a missile or bomb. He argued that vital safety checks were not enforced, saying; \\"The mandate requires a full engine survey. This one was re-certified immediately, without a survey. It was stamped and approved in a day.\\" Mr. Kreindler was appointed to chair the plaintiffs committee charged with prosecuting the action and the firm, along with other members of the committee, successfully prosecuted the action. The action gave rise to a notable ruling when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the crash had not occurred on the \\"high seas\\" as that term is defined in the law and that therefore the restrictive Death on the High Seas Act did not limit plaintiffs' damages. TWA 800 ultimately caused Congress to modify the Death on the High Seas Act to provide for non-economic damages. = Swissair 111 = The firm represented victims from the Swissair 111 disaster and Lee Kreindler was appointed as chair of the plaintiffs' committee. The cases were consolidated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and assigned to Chief Judge Giles, who oversaw the litigation and mediated the cases. Swissair ultimately settled, offering compensation in a move described by news sources such as the BBC as 'unprecedented'. = 9/11 = The firm represented many of the 9/11 victims, both in the victims' compensation fund and in litigation against the security companies and airlines. The firm took a leading role in challenging, unsuccessfully, what it claimed was a de facto cap on payments in the VCF, based on the regulations and comments made by VCF Special Master Kenneth Feinberg. The firm also brought litigation against the terrorists and individuals and entities it claimed were terrorist sponsors. This included a lawsuit for several billion dollars against Iraq, based on an allegation that Iraqi officials were aware of plans to attack America. = Continental Connection Flight 3407 = Attorneys at Kreindler and Kreindler LLP continue to represent families of victims of the 2009 crash of Buffalo- bound Colgan Air Flight 3407 (marketed as Continental Connection). The crash, which killed 50 people, was the most recent fatal accident of a commercial airliner in the U.S. until the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 on July 6, 2013 in San Francisco. The disaster raised significant issues regarding commuter airline safety and has resulted in the FAA proposing or implementing several rule changes. Complicating the litigation surrounding the 2009 crash is the April 2012 bankruptcy filing by Colgan Air's parent company Pinnacle Airlines Corporation. The presiding judge, Chief U.S. District Judge William M. Skretny set a March 2014 trial date for the approximately 15 suits still pending as a result of the crash. = Asiana Flight 214 = The firm is representing multiple victims of the July 6, 2013 crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Aviation attorneys at the firm are handling the cases of all three Chinese teenagers who died, as well as 12 injury cases involving U.S., Chinese and Korean residents. Tragically, 16-year-old injured passenger Ye Mengyuan was run over and killed by one of the San Francisco Fire Department trucks during the emergency response. Video shot by the San Francisco Fire Department at the scene later revealed that the Chinese student was in plain view and located by several firefighters before being accidentally covered in firefighting foam and later run over twice, by two different emergency vehicles. On January 10, 2014, it was announced that Kreindler & Kreindler would be filing a lawsuit on behalf of Ye Mengyuan's family against the city of San Francisco. Because litigation arising from international aviation accidents is governed by the Montreal Convention, lawyers at the firm will be determining the most appropriate venue for the filing of lawsuits for other passengers on the flight.http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23741529/asiana- flight-214-victims-lawsuit-amounts-will-vary See also * Montreal Convention * Warsaw Convention * Lockerbie * TWA Flight 800 * Swissair Flight 111 * American Airlines Flight 587 References Category:Law firms based in New York City Category:Aviation law Category:Law firms established in 1950 ","title":"Kreindler &amp; Kreindler"},{"id":"15117919","text":"1914 advertisement by Henry Lemoine & Co.

Life Lemoine was born in Paris, where he was a pupil of Anton Reicha, a successful piano teacher. In 1816 he took over his father Antoine Marcel Lemoine's music publishing business. His father had founded the company in 1772, and it still exists today under the name of Éditions Henry Lemoine.Henokiens Association, Editions Henry Lemoine Lemoine was the publisher for Frédéric Chopin, among many others. In 1844 he also published Hector Berlioz's Traité d'orchestration. He worked with Ferdinando Carulli to publish a solfège textbook by Adolphe Danhauser called Solfège des Solfèges, which is still in print. In 1850 Lemoine, then blind, turned over his company to his son Achilles Lemoine. Lemoine's compositions are today generally regarded as unimportant. His piano method and harmony textbook, however, are still of much interest to students of the instrument. He composed a lot of etudes of all levels. Compositions Lemoine wrote a number of works of music education (including Études infantines), an extensive collection of piano pieces called Bagatelles and Recreations Musicales.

A principle in the approval process of ICANN Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) states that Cyrillic two- character top-level domains should not exclusively use characters that could be confused with Latin characters of identical or similar shapes—not just those containing the seven letters а, е, о, р, с, у and х, but originally also proposed ccTLDs such as .бг (Bulgaria) due to its visual similarity to .br,General remarks on Cyrillic IDNs , ICANN Generic Names Supporting Organization wiki, revision dated 22 June 2008 ; accessed 24 September 2008. although in 2016 thetop-level domain .бг was launched. As such, GNSO sought to avoid the direct transcription of \\"ru\\" into Cyrillic, \\"ру\\", and common abbreviations for Russia (), such as \\"ро\\", in order to avoid confusion with the Latin ccTLDs .py (Paraguay) and .po ( unassigned). In English sources .рф can be romanized as .rf, but the latter is not a valid domain for Russia. Later, other countries have won approval of two or three letter Cyrillic ccTLDs such as .укр, .срб, .мон, .қаз, .бел, .мкд and .бг. Early preparations The preparation, development, and technical testing of the domain started in 2007 by registrar RU Center. Пресс-конференция «Итоги развития российского национального домена RU в 2007 году» (Press conference: The outcome of the development of the Russian national domain RU in 2007), ccTLD.ru, 24 December 2007; accessed 8 January 2008. The domain delegation process started in November 2009 as an application to ICANN under the new Fast Track IDN ccTLD process. The domain is expected to be launched in 2010. In preparation for a launch, RU Center opened a sunrise registration period for Russian trademark owners from 25 November 2009 to 25 March 2010. General public registrations are planned starting 20 April 2010 through June 2010 using a Dutch auction process, and at a fixed price beginning in July 2010. In January 2010 ICANN announced that the domain was one of the first four new non-Latin ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process. In a press release in December 2007, Alexei Lesnikov of RU-Center suggested that an auction for domain names could be highly successful, as was the case with a similar domain name auction on the .su ccTLD. With comparisons being made with an equivalent Chinese TLD of .中国, it was anticipated that take-up of a Russian Cyrillic TLD could outstrip demand for the Latin alphabet equivalent, .ru. As of 2014 however, .ru has five times as many registrations as .рф. First use The top-level domain became operational on the Internet on 13 May 2010.

This effect resembles that of cocaine, although dimethocaine appears to be less potent. Just like cocaine, dimethocaine is addictive due to its stimulation of the reward pathway in the brain. However, dimethocaine is a legal cocaine replacement in some countries and is even listed by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) under the category “synthetic cocaine derivatives”. The structure of dimethocaine, being a 4-Aminobenzoic acid ester, resembles that of procaine. It is found as a white powder at room temperature. When a product sold online in the UK in June 2010, advertised as dimethocaine was tested, it was found to in fact be a mixture of caffeine and lidocaine, and the lack of any dopaminergic stimulant ingredient in such mixes may explain the limited recreational effects reported by many users. Other samples tested have however been shown to contain genuine dimethocaine, and one branded \\"bath salt\\" product containing primarily dimethocaine as the active ingredient, was noted to have been particularly subject to abuse by intravenous drug users in Ireland.An overview of new psychoactive substances and the outlets supplying them  History  Dimethocaine was originally synthesized by the Hoffmann-La Roche company in 1930. It was sold under the market name larocaine. During the 1930s dimethocaine gained popularity in the US as a local anesthetic. Just like cocaine and procaine, it was used during surgery, primarily in dentistry, ophthalmology and otolaryngology. However, in the 1940s, it was removed from the market because of its psychoactive effects and risk of addiction. Nowadays dimethocaine is abused for these psychoactive effects. It is sold as a cocaine surrogate to circumvent legislation issues.  Pharmacology = Pharmacodynamics = Dimethocaine and structurally related local anesthetics such as cocaine and procaine inhibit the uptake of dopamine (DA) by blocking dopamine transporters (DAT). The dopamine transporter controls the dynamics of the neurotransmitter dopamine. This neurotransmitter controls many functions including movement, cognition and mood. Drugs such as cocaine and dimethocaine induce dopamine overflow by inhibiting dopamine transporters and thus creating a euphoric effect. In addition to inhibiting dopamine uptake, dimethocaine was also shown to inhibit the binding of CFT, a different dopamine uptake inhibitor. These inhibitory properties are responsible for the stimulatory effects of dimethocaine on the central nervous system. Both in vivo and in vitro measurements of dopamine transporter activity showed that dimethocaine is a potent and efficacious dopaminergic reuptake inhibitor (also called a dopamine indirect agonist). These effects were mainly observed in the nucleus accumbens, a region in the basal forebrain. Comparison of the pharmacological potencies of different local anesthetics revealed the following potency order: cocaine > dimethocaine > tetracaine > procaine > chloroprocaine Furthermore, the administration of dimethocaine has been shown to lead to antinociceptive responses at nontoxic doses in mice. These responses are suggested to be at least partially caused by the effects of dimethocaine on the central nervous system. A memory impairing effect observed in mice after administration of dimethocaine has been proposed to be a result of a non-anesthetic mechanism of action. = Pharmacokinetics = When inhaled, dimethocaine starts working in 10–30 minutes, with highest effects at 60–120 minutes and until 4–6 hours there is a period of action with the ‘after-effects’. The after effects include fatigue and slight mental impairment.  Metabolism  The exact metabolic pathways of dimethocaine have not been researched, but the different metabolites have been examined in Wistar rats. After administration of dimethocaine, different metabolites have been found and identified in their urine. Due to these metabolites, different metabolic pathways could have been postulated. The main phase I reactions are ester hydrolysis, deethylation, hydroxylation of the aromatic system, or a combination of these three. The main phase II reactions are N-acetylation, glucuronidation and a combination of both. Different cytochrome P450 isozymes are involved in the initial steps of human metabolism. The N-acetylation is catalyzed by the NAT2 isozyme.  Efficacy and side effects  Just like cocaine, dimethocaine inhibits the uptake of dopamine in the brain by interfering with the dopamine transporters. The potency of these drugs is linked to their affinity for the dopamine transporters, and their potency to inhibit dopamine uptake. In studies with rhesus monkeys the affinity of dimethocaine for dopamine transporters is smaller than that of cocaine, whereas dimethocaine's potency to inhibit dopamine uptake is similar. This means that more of dimethocaine is needed to reach a similar response. The peak effects occurred within 10 to 20 minutes after the injection and decreased to baseline levels within an hour. Dimethocaine is often abused as a legal substitute for cocaine. The drug is administered intravenously or nasally, because ingestion would lead to rapid hydrolyzation. Its positive effects are euphoria, stimulation, increased talkativeness and mood lift. However, because the drug acts similar as cocaine, it has comparable negative side effects. These side effects include: tachycardia, difficulty with breathing, pain on the chest, vasoconstriction, insomnia, paranoia and anxiety. Dimethocaine probably poses larger health issues than cocaine. This is due to the fact that more dimethocaine must be administered to produce the same euphoric feeling, resulting in larger risk for the negative effects.  Toxicity = Humans = Cocaine and other local anesthetics are known to produce cardiotoxicity by blocking sodium channels. However, no reports have been published of these same effects of cardiotoxicity associated with dimethocaine. There has been little research about toxicity of dimethocaine in humans, and therefore the exact lethal or pharmacological doses are unknown. = Animals = For mice, the dose at which acute toxicity occurs for intravenous administration is 40 mg/kg and for subcutaneous injection (injection in the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis) this is 380 mg/kg. The lethal dose of dimethocaine for a mouse is 0.3 g per kilogram body weight. An abdominal constriction test was performed in mice, using doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of dimethocaine which were administered subcutaneously. This test showed induced dose-dependent antinociceptive responses, which are processes that block detection of a painful or injurious stimulus by sensory neurons. Impairment of memory processes was found to be a toxic effect in the elevated plus-maze test in mice.  Legal status  Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying Dimethocaine as a hazardous substance, on September 25, 2019.

It was published in 1910 as the tenth prelude in Debussy’s first of two volumes of twelve piano preludes each. It is characteristic of Debussy in its form, harmony, and content.  Musical impressionism  This prelude is an example of Debussy's musical impressionism in that it is a musical depiction of, or allusion to, an image or idea. Debussy quite often named his pieces with the exact image that he was composing about, like La Mer, Des pas sur la neige, or Jardins sous la pluie. In the case of the two volumes of preludes, he places the title of the piece at the end of the piece, either to allow the pianist to respond intuitively and individually to the music before finding out what Debussy intended the music to sound like, or to apply more ambiguity to the music's allusion.Lobanova, Marina, trans. Kate Cook, Musical Style and Genre: History and Modernity (Routledge, 2000), 92. Because this piece is based on a legend, it can be considered program music.  Legend of Ys  This piece is based on an ancient Breton myth in which a cathedral, submerged underwater off the coast of the Island of Ys, rises up from the sea on clear mornings when the water is transparent. Sounds can be heard of priests chanting, bells chiming, and the organ playing, from across the sea.Hutcheson, Ernst, The Literature of the Piano (New York: Knopf, 1981), 314. Accordingly, Debussy uses certain harmonies to allude to the plot of the legend, in the style of musical symbolism. To begin the piece, Debussy uses parallel fifths. The first chord of the piece is made up of sonorous Gs and Ds (open fifths). The use of stark, open fifths here allude to the idea of church bells that sound from the distance, across the ocean.DeVoto, Mark. \\"The Debussy Sound: colour, texture, gesture.\\" The Cambridge Companion to Debussy. Ed. Simon Trezise. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 190. The opening measures, marked pianissimo, introduce us to the first series of rising parallel fifth chords, outlining a G major pentatonic scale. These chords bring to mind two things: 1) the Eastern pentatonic scale, which Debussy heard during a performance of Javanese gamelan music at the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris,Trezise, Simon. \\"Chronology of Debussy's Life and Works.\\" The Cambridge Companion to Debussy. Ed. Simon Trezise. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), xv and 2) medieval chant music, similar to the organa in parallel fifths from the Musica enchiriadis, a 9th-century treatise on music.Potter, Caroline. \\"Debussy and Nature.\\" The Companion to Debussy\\". Ed. Simon Trezise. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 141. The shape of the ascending phrase is perhaps a representation of the cathedral's slow emergence from the water. After the beginning section, Debussy gently brings the cathedral out of the water by modulating to B major, shaping the melody in a wave-like fashion, and including important narrative instructions in measure 16: Peu à peu sortant de la brume (Emerging from the fog little by little). This shows Debussy at his closest manifestation of musical impressionism.DeVoto, Mark. \\"The Debussy Sound: colour, texture, gesture.\\" The Cambridge Companion to Debussy. Ed. Simon Trezise. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 190. Then, after a section marked Augmentez progressivement (Slowly growing), the cathedral has emerged and the grand organ is heard at a dynamic level of fortissimo (measures 28–41). This is the loudest and most profound part of the piece, and is described in the score as Sonore sans dureté (Sonorous but without harshness). Following the grand entrance and exit of the organ, the cathedral sinks back down into the ocean (measures 62–66) and the organ is heard once more, but from underwater. To attain these effects that reflect images of the castle, most performers use specific techniques with regards to pedaling and articulation to affect tone color. For example, some performers use their full body weight to depress keys to create a rich sound. Also performers create a ringing bell sound by instantly releasing pedaled notes. Finally, the cathedral is gone from sight, and only the bells are heard, at a distant pianissimo.  Musical analysis =Form= The overall form of this piece can be loosely attributed to a ternary ABA form, which splits nicely into sections at the written key change so that A encompasses the beginning to measure 46, B encompasses measures 47–71, and AI encompasses measure 72 to the end. Each larger section can be further divided into smaller sections and themes, which are arranged to give the piece a roughly symmetrical structure. The A section can itself be divided into three smaller sections: a1 (m. 1–15), a2 (m. 16–21), and a3 (m. 22–46). The introduction of the piece (a1) features the G major pentatonic collection in ascending block chords evocative of organum chant with many parallel fifths. This motif repeats itself twice, but each time the bass moves down a single step, so that the first repeat of the motif takes place over an F in the bass and the second repeat over an E. This changes the collectional center of the opening to the relative E minor pentatonic. The top note of this motif, an E, is held in octaves and repeated, evoking the sound of church bells. This leads to a brief section within a1 where a new theme is presented in C# minor, weaving around the bell tone E’s. At m. 14, the initial pentatonic theme returns, but this time over a C in the bass. This is the first hint of the true tonic of the A section and the piece overall. The a2 section begins at m. 16 with a shift in key to B major and a new rhythmic drive introduced by 8th note triplets in the left hand. This stands in stark contrast to the slow, open quarter and half note lines of the a1 section, though the right hands still features similar ascending quarter note chords. In m. 19, a slightly modified version of this material is presented in E-flat major. The melodic material in both the B major and E-flat major sections utilize the respective pentatonic modes of those keys. This section builds to the arrival at the a3 section. The beginning part of a3 (m. 22–27) builds on a G dominant 7th chord and returns to utilizing more open- sounding half note and quarter note lines. This builds up to the climax of the piece at m. 28, where the main thematic material of the A section, hinted at throughout the preceding material, is presented in C major fortissimo. The thick block chords played with both hands evoke the sound of an organ. While the majority of this theme is presented in the C major diatonic mode, the addition of a B-flat in m. 33–37 briefly changes the mode to C mixolydian before returning to ionian (major). The ending measures of a3, 42–46, serve as a transition into the B section of the piece. The B section features a modulation to C# minor and presents the corresponding melodic material from the A/a1 section. This material is expanded and builds up to a climax within the B section at measure 61. As the music recedes down from this climax, one of the most interesting sonorities of the piece is presented in m. 63 in the form of dominant 7th chords with chordal planing. The roots of these planing chords follow the key signature but the quality of each chord remains dominant. This gives way to a 4-measure transition (m. 68–71) to the final AI section. The AI section is something of a mirror image of the original A section. The C major theme that was originally presented in the final (a3) section of A returns at the beginning of AI, this time pianissimo, not scored quite as thickly, and in a lower register over an oscillating 8th note figure in the bass. This gives way to the final small section of the piece (m. 84–89), which is a mirror to the introduction of the piece (a1). The rising pentatonic figuration seen at the beginning appears here, this time in the tonic C major. The piece ends on a C major chord with an added scale degree 2. The nearly symmetrical ABA form helps illustrate the legend that Debussy is alluding to in the work, and his markings help point toward both the form and the legend. For example, the first section is described as being “dans une brume doucement sonore,” or “in a sweetly sonorous fog.” Then, at measure 16, the markings say “peu à peu sortant de la brume,” or “little by little emerging from the fog.” This change in imagery (as well as the accompanying change in tonality) could represent the cathedral emerging from under the water. At measure 72, the marking says “comme un écho de la phrase entendue précedemment,” or “like an echo of the previously heard phrase,” which could be like the cathedral which had emerged gradually getting farther away and perhaps returning into the water. =Thematic/motivic structure= In this piece, Debussy composes the music using motivic development, rather than thematic development.Reti, Rudolph. The Thematic Process in Music. (New York: Macmillan, 1951), 205. After all, “Debussy mistrusted [thematic] development as a method of composition.”Lockspeiser, Edward. Debussy: His Life and Mind, volume 2. (MacMillin, 1965), 231. Fundamentally, the entire piece is made up of two basic motifs, with the first motif existing in three different variations, making 4 fragments in total (not counting the inversions and transpositions of each).Reti, Rudolph. The Thematic Process in Music. (New York: Macmillan, 1951), 195. The motifs are: 1) D-E-B ascending; 1a) D-E-A ascending; 1b) D-E-G ascending; 2) E-C# descending. Debussy masterfully saturates the entire structure of the piece with these motifs in large- and small-scale ways. For example, motif 1 appears in the bottom of the right-hand chords on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarter notes of measure 14 (D-E-B), and again in the next three quarter note beats (D-E-B). Not by coincidence, motif 1b is heard in the 4th, 5th, and 6th quarter note beats of measure 14 (B-D-E). Motif 1 is heard on a broader scale in the bass notes (dotted whole notes) in measures 1–16, hitting the notes of the motif in inversion and transposition on the down-beats of measures 1, 15, and 16 (G-C-B). Also within measures 1 through 15 are two occurrences of motif 2 (G in measure 1, E in measure 5; E in measure 5, C in measure 15.) Motif 1 is also heard in a soprano voice from measure 1–15: The high D in measures 1, 3, and 5; the soprano E octave that occurs 12 times from measures 6–13; the high B in measures 14 and 15. Throughout all of this motivic repetition, transposition, and inversion, the themes (longer phrases made up of the smaller motifs) stay very much static, with only occasional elongation or shortening throughout the piece: The rising pentatonic theme in measure 1 (theme 1) repeats in measure 3, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 84, 85, and with a slight variations in measures 28–40 and 72–83. A second theme (theme 2), appearing for the first time in measures 7–13, repeats in measures 47–51.Reti, Rudolph. The Thematic Process in Music. (New York: Macmillan, 1951), 196–199. =Context= This prelude is typical of Debussy's compositional characteristics. It is a complete exploration of chordal sound that encompasses the entire range of the piano, and that includes one of Debussy's signature chords (a major tonic triad with added 2nd and 6th scale degrees).DeVoto, Mark. \\"The Debussy Sound: colour, texture, gesture.\\" The Cambridge Companion to Debussy. Ed. Simon Trezise. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 190. Third, it shows Debussy's use of parallel harmony (the section beginning in measure 28, especially), which is defined as a coloration of the melodic line. This is quite different from simple melodic doubling, like the 3rds in Voiles, or the 5ths in La Mer, which are not usually heard alone without a significant accompanimental figure. Parallel harmony forces the chords to be understood less with functional roots, and more as coloristic expansions of the melodic line.DeVoto, Mark. \\"The Debussy Sound: colour, texture, gesture.\\" The Cambridge Companion to Debussy. Ed. Simon Trezise. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 187. Overall, this prelude, as a representative of the 24 preludes, shows Debussy's radical compositional process when viewed in light of the previous 200 years of classical and romantic music. =Parallelism= Debussy’s La cathédrale engloutie contains instances of one of the most significant techniques found in the music of the Impressionist period called parallelism. There are two methods of parallelism in music; exact and inexact. Inexact parallelism allows the quality of the harmonic intervals to vary throughout the line, even if the interval sizes are identical, while exact parallelism the sizes and qualities remain the same as the line progresses. Inexact parallelism can give a sense of tonality, while exact parallelism can dispel the sense of tonality as pitch content cannot be analyzed diatonically in a single key.Connie Mayfield, Theory Essentials (Cengage Learning 2012), 483 Debussy uses the technique of parallelism (also known as harmonic planing) in his prelude to dilute the sense of direction motion found in prior traditional progressions. Through application, tonal ambiguity is created that is often seen in Impressionist music. It can be noted that it took some time for Impressionist music to be appreciated, but the critics and the listening public eventually warmed up to this experiment in harmonic freedom.McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Claude Debussy, (1998): Accessed March 17, 2015. www.mhhe.com/socscience/music/kamien/student/olc/29.html  Arrangements  Various arrangements and transcriptions of the piece exist. A transcription for solo organ was made by Léon Roques and Jean-Baptiste Robin in 2011 (recording Brillant Classics 94233). It was arranged for orchestra by Leopold Stokowski as The Engulfed Cathedral and released in a recording in 1930. It appears in a cover version on the album Grand Guignol by John Zorn's band Naked City. Sections of Debussy's piece are also used in the introduction and final of Renaissance's song At the Harbour, from their 1973 album Ashes Are Burning. Isao Tomita arranged the piece for electronic synthesizer as part of his Snowflakes Are Dancing recording of 1973–1974. John Carpenter used it as sound track in his 1981 science fiction movie Escape from New York. The composer Henri Büsser made a transcription for orchestra of this piece in 1921, while composer Colin Matthews arranged it for the Hallé Orchestra in 2007.

Board of Education, with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. The formation of the Alliance for School Choice represented the merger of three organizations: the American Education Reform Council, Children First America, and the American Education Reform Foundation. Clint Bolick, who was part of the legal team that argued the Zelman v. Simmons-Harris school voucher case before the U.S. Supreme Court, was appointed as the Alliance's first president in 2004. Bolick resigned his position at the Alliance in 2007 to take a new post at the Arizona-based Goldwater Institute. On January 16, 2007, the Alliance's board of directors announced the appointment of Charles R. Hokanson, Jr., a former official at the U.S. Department of Education, as the organization's new president. Hokanson became president of the organization in April 2007 and the organization subsequently moved its headquarters to Washington, DC. In November 2008, Hokanson left the organization and was replaced by the organization's chief of staff, John Schilling, who serves as interim president.  Activities  The Alliance shares offices, staff and resources with Advocates for School Choice, which is a 501(c)(4) organization that promotes the benefits of school choice programs. Alliance activities include assisting affiliate organizations in states, hosting informational events, working with parent activists and community leaders to enact and implement state programs, and publishing two magazines, the School Choice Digest and the Activist. The Alliance has also engaged in litigation efforts on behalf of parents. In October 2008, the Alliance announced the development of a new campaign designed to recruit 10,000 supporters of school choice. Individuals who registered on their site received free bumper stickers and magazine subscriptions. www.letparentschoose.org See also *Bradley Foundation *Carrie Walton Penner *Charter School Growth Fund *Heritage Foundation References External links  * Alliance for School Choice * Organizational Profile – National Center for Charitable Statistics (Urban Institute) Category:Education policy organizations in the United States Category:Organizations established in 2004 Category:Educational charities based in the United States Category:Charities based in Washington, D.C.

He studied in the same year with the future deputies and state dignitaries Vasile Bârcă and Pantelimon Erhan. He was interested to study in a college of exact sciences and was enrolled at the faculty of physics and mathematics of Dorpat University (Estonia), but after a year of studies he transferred to the Saint Petersburg Imperial University, the faculty of physics and mathematics, which he graduated from. with a 1st degree diploma. He had a recommendation for postgraduate studies. During the student years in Petersburg, at his own initiative, the association of Bessarabian students from Petersburg was established.  Career  After graduating from the university he competed successfully as a private lecturer and worked at several private schools in Petersburg, teaching physics, mathematics and astronomy.Antonina Inculeț, Emanuel Bădescu, \\"1918. Ion Inculeț la Academia Română \\", Magazin Istoric, no.11/2000 In 1917 he was an MP in the Petrograd Soviet from the Socialist Revolutionary Party. After getting his PhD in 1915, Inculeț worked as a physicist at the Meteorological Observatory, while at the same time, he wrote for the Basarabia newspaper of Constantin Stere. In April 1917 he returned to Bessarabia, as emissary of the President of the Provisional Government Alexander Kerensky, in front of a group of 40 Bessarabians, students and teachers from Petrograd, in order to deepen the conquests of the February Revolution. He was elected to the first parliament of Bessarabia, \\"The Council of the Country\\", together with other Bessarabians from Petrograd, from the side of the peasants’ MPs. Initially, Inculeț's political conception was one of political transformation within a democratic and renewed Russia. However, after the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd through the October putch, Inculeț evolved into an alliance with Romania. = President of the Moldovan Parliament = Sfatul Țării, a representative body was formed on November 21, 1917, and Inculeț is chosen in unanimity its president. The first session of Sfatul Țării was held on , and chose Ion Inculeț as its president. Gherman Pântea, the former minister in the Government of the Democratic Republic, and future mayor of Odessa characterized the Inculeț's activity as follows: \\"On November 21, 1917 the Country Council was opened, a body that would speak on behalf of Bessarabia and decided its fate. Ion Inculeț was elected president of this parliament unanimously. He met all the qualities to be given this honor: he was calm, skillful, reassuring, and especially extremely patient. (...) Mr. Inculeț in all the circumstances has proved a perfect calm and cold blood. No hasty decisions, no reckless step. The big day was approaching - the day of the Union - but Inculeț was thinking of the peasant's fate. He often said, \\"If the God would help us with the unification and with the radical agrarian reform, that would mean, to give land to the peasants, I would be the happiest man.\\"\\" = President of Moldavian Democratic Republic = Ion C. Inculeţ On , Sfatul Țării proclaimed the Moldavian Democratic Republic, with Inculeț as president.Ion Nistor, p.282 = Union of Bessarabia with Romania = On January 6, 1918, the Bolsheviks took over the attempt to take over the Power in Chișinău and Ion Inculeț and Pantelimon Erhan send a telegram to Iasi requesting that the Romanian Army be withdrawn from Bessarabia. He was accused by the Moldovan Bloc, together with Pantelimon Erhan and Gherman Pântea, of a pro-Russian attitude, the latter two resigned. On January 24, the Country Council proclaimed the independence of Bessarabia with the majority of votes against Russia, and on , the majority proclaimed the unification with Romania, given that rumcherod and other minority factions urged the parliament to insist on keeping the relations with Russia. = After Union = After Union Ion Inculeț was minister of Bessarabia, minister of public health, minister of interior, minister of communications and the vice-president of the Council of Ministers in the Government of Romania, led by Ion G. Duca (1933-1937). In 1940, with reference to the fate of Bessarabia and the Union held 1918, he said: \\"Bessarabia was forced out of the body of Moldova, with the violation of any right and of any justice, in 1812. The autonomy promised to annexation, with the preservation of the Romanian language in all districts, was rather withdrawn. Bessarabia being slowly transformed into a simple Russian county (gubernya). For one hundred years, the persecution of Czarist Russia lasted - one hundred years of the resistance of this wonderful Moldovan people between Prut and Dniester for keeping the language, for the preservation of the national being. Never during this age has the sacred fire of national consciousness been extinguished. And once the circumstances became favorable, this fire turned into a flame, which consumed as much as possible from the obstacles that were put in the way of the Union with all Romanians.\\" On , Ioan Simionescu proposed Inculeț to be a member of the Romanian Academy and he was elected as a full member on the meeting which took place the following day. His inaugural speech was named \\"Space and time in new scientific light\\" and it talked about the importance of Einstein's 1916 Theory of Relativity. Together with Pan Halippa, Inculeț founded the Bessarabian Peasants' Party, which militated for land reform in Bessarabia. In 1923, his wing of the party joined the National Liberal Party.  Death  Inculeț died from a heart attack on 18 November 1940 and was buried at the Bellu cemetery in Bucharest. At the funeral, a speech was given by Vasile Bârcă, who said: \\"What characterizes Ion Inculeț’s life and work is his endless modesty and gentleness, his thorough preparation, accompanied by the tact and calm that characterizes him, above all, his warm love of the people, the country, and Bessarabia. of his native, whom he loved with all the powers of his mind and soul.\\" The remains of Ion C. Inculeț and his spouse, Roxana Cantacuzino, were moved to Bârnova on June 7, 1942. The tombs of Inculeț and his wife are inside the Bârnova church (built 1942-47).

In a career which lasted just over a year- from July 1952 until July 1953- he ran seven times and won five races. He was the best British colt of his generation in 1953, when he won The Derby and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He was then retired to stud, where he had little success. Background Pinza a massive bay colt standing over 16 hands was sired by Chanteur out of the mare Pasqua. He was officially bred by the notable trainer Fred Darling, but the mating which produced Pinza was actually arranged by Pasqua's previous owner, Mrs H. E. Morriss, who sent the mare in foal to the Newmarket sales in December 1949. Darling was impressed by Pasqua's pedigree and bought her for 2,000 guineas, acting through a representative as he was out of the country at the time. When Darling saw Pasqua, he was not impressed and sold her at a loss, but not before she had produced the colt foal who was later named Pinza. As a yearling, the colt was sent to the Newmarket Sales where he was bought for 1,500 guineas by the businessman and hotelier Sir Victor Sassoon. Sassoon named the colt after the Ezio Pinza after seeing the singer performing in South Pacific on Broadway. Chanteur (also known as Chanteur II) was a high class stayer who won the Coronation Cup and ran third in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He was a success at stud, siring the classic winners Cantelo (St Leger) and Only for Life (2000 Guineas). Apart from Pinza, Pasqua produced only one minor winner. Pinza was sent into training with Norman Bertie at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career=1952: two-year-old season= Pinza made his debut in a maiden race at Hurst Park in July, in which he showed some promise but finished unplaced. He reappeared two months later in a race at the Doncaster St Leger meeting which was restricted to horses sold at the Newmarket Sales, and he won by six lengths. Two weeks later, he was sent to Ascot for the Royal Lodge Stakes and started 2/5 favourite against three opponents. He finished second to the filly Neemah, having been apparently unsuited by the slow pace. On his final start of the season at Newmarket in October, Pinza won the Dewhurst Stakes by seven lengths. He was given a rating of 128 pounds in the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best two-year- olds, five pounds below the top-weight Nearula. =1953: three-year-old season= In early 1953, Pinza fell on a gravel path in training. Although the initial injuries sustained were minor, he picked up a leg infection which took a long time to heal so that it was not possible to train him for the 2000 Guineas. The colt made his first appearance of the year in the Newmarket Stakes in May. He looked to be very big (lacking fitness) before the race but recorded a four length win. As a result of his performance, the bookmakers cut his odds for the Derby from 33/1 to 8/1. At Epsom, Pinza started 5/1 joint favourite with Premonition in a field of twenty-seven, with the Queen's colt Aureole also strongly fancied. The race attracted a huge crowd, including the Queen (in her coronation year) and the Queen Mother. Ridden by the twenty-five times Champion Jockey Gordon Richards, Pinza took the lead early in the straight and went clear inside the last two furlongs to win by four lengths from the Queen's runner, Aureole. Pinza was a popular Derby winner, not only because he was one of the most fancied contenders, but also because he enabled the recently knighted Richards to win the race after 27 previous failures. Richards had already announced that he would retire at the end of the season and that the 1953 Derby would be his final one. In his next race, Pinza ran against older horses in the third running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, starting the 2/1 favourite in a field of thirteen which included the winners of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (Nuccio) and the Washington, D.C. International Stakes (Worden). He produced what was described as a \\"brilliant burst of speed\\" to win by three lengths, again beating Aureole, with Worden third. Pinza was being prepared for a run in the St Leger when he sustained a tendon injury in training. He was unable to race again and was retired to stud at a valuation on £220,000. Stud record Pinza was not a particularly successful stallion, but he did sire the winners of 218 races, worth £173,844, including Pindari, winner of the King Edward VII Stakes and £18,456. He died in 1977. Assessment and Honours In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pinza a \\"great\\" Derby winner and the fifteenth best British racehorse of the 20th Century. Timeform assessed Pinza at 137, making him the highest-rated European horse of 1953. Following the London & North Eastern Railway tradition of naming locomotives after winning racehorses, the English Electric 'Deltic' diesel locomotive, no. D9007 (55007) was named after the horse on 22 June 1961 and remained in service until 31 December 1981. Pedigree *Pinza was inbred 4 × 4 to Blandford. This means that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

For about thirty years from the mid-thirties to the mid-sixties he was one of the top players. As a member of the Great Britain national team he won the European Bridge League championships in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1963.The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge, 2nd edition. Crown Publishers, New York. 1971, p. 612. He was from London.  Early life  Gray, born Maurice Charles Harrison Gray on 13 November 1899 at Ingatestone, Essex, was the child of an English father and an American mother. Much of his childhood was spent in Paris, and he became bilingual. He was educated at Haileybury School and served in the British Army at the end of World War I. In his younger days he boxed, played rugby and tennis, rode motorcycles, but leg injuries stopped his sporting activities.Marx, Jack. 1972. Introduction to Harrison-Gray, Country Life Book of Bridge. During World War II he was a Flight Lieutenant in the RAF. Later, he became an ardent lepidopterist, breeding tropical moths at his Hampstead home. Gray later used the surname Harrison-Gray and after leaving Haileybury School he joined the family brewing business. When the company was taken over he turned to writing, at first fiction but he soon became a full-time writer about bridge.  Bridge career  Gray turned to bridge at 30 after a series of accidents at sports, including a motor-bike accident at 100 mph. Within three years he was bidding for Britain in radio matches against the US and Australia.Mollo, Victor. 1967. The Bridge Immortals. Faber, London. Page 79 et seq. Gray participated in the development of the Acol System of bidding, He was captain of the winning Acol team in the years before World War II, the other team members being his partner, S.J. (Skid) Simon, Jack Marx, Iain Macleod and Colin Harding: a stellar group indeed. Gray was also instrumental in helping, in 1938, to unite the two warring bridge organisations, the British Bridge League (founded in 1931) and the National Bridge Association (founded in 1933). After the war the line-up of the British teams generally included Boris Schapiro, Terence Reese, Kenneth Konstam, Leslie Dodds, and Edward Rayne, initially with Gray as captain. These teams won the European title three times running. In London, 1949, the England team of Gray, Konstam, Reese and Schapiro defeated the American team of Crawford, Rapee, Stayman and Leventritt by 2,950 points over 96 boards for the Crowninshield trophy. A British team captained by Gray, but without Reese and Schapiro, were defeated by the US in the first Bermuda Bowl. To summarise, Gray was European champion in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1963. He led Britain in the Bermuda Bowl in 1950, and played in the World Pairs 1962, World Team Olympiad 1964 and the European Championships in 1958. He won the Gold Cup seven times, and many other national events. The first time, in 1937, was with the original Acol team; the last time in 1968 was with Tony Priday, Nico Gardener, Albert Rose and the Sharples brothers: also a star-studded team.The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge. Editions 1–4, Crown, New York, 1964–1984. Editions 5–6, ACBL, Memphis, 1994–2001. Like many other players of his day, Gray played rubber bridge almost daily. He used his bridge columns to champion the losing trick method of evaluating hands for suit contracts. Gray was bridge editor of the Evening Standard and Country Life for many years.Ramsey, Guy. 1955. Aces All. Museum Press, London. Page 42 et seq. = 1951 withdrawal = In 1951, Gray's career as an international was interrupted for about seven years after he withdrew from the trials at an early stage, leaving his partner high and dry, and announced his retirement from international competition, without giving reasons. Thus, he did not play in the 1951 European championship, but he gave a lengthy account of it in a press report, which attacked the performance of the British team (who came third to Italy and Austria). An editorial in the English Bridge Union's official medium gave an unforgettable response: :\\"One article in particular makes us very hot under the collar and that is the one in the European Bridge Review under the name of Harrison-Gray ... We have searched closely for one single word of praise, but in vain ... Surely he could have brought out the fact that they finished joint second on VPs [Victory Points], and scored more IMPs [International Match Points] and lost fewer than any other country, and that had the result been decided on IMPs they would have been easy winners. :\\"Perhaps everything is accounted for by the statements of Mr Gray himself: ::'Although unable to make more than token appearances in the playing room [he admitted he saw only one hand out of 3,460 played through to the end] ... my impressions are gleaned from a number of reliable judges.' \\"Ingram, H. St John. 1951. Editorial. Contract Bridge Journal. December 1951, p. 6–7. This was a strange performance from Gray, especially given his motto for playing at the table, which was \\"Keep icy calm\\". The response from the British Bridge League, responsible for team selection at European and World events, was: \\"The British Bridge League have decided that Mr Harrison-Gray will not be considered for selection in the team to represent Great Britain in the European Championship in 1952.\\"Editorial. Contract Bridge Journal. January 1952, p. 7. He did not play again for Britain until Oslo 1958. According to Richard Fleet, his long-term bridge partner Jack Marx wrote after his death:Fleet, Richard. \\"The Great Sulk\\". Bridge Magazine. October 2011, p. 40. > Like many talented people, he was apt to be touchy at even implied criticism > of his talent; and disagreements on impersonal issues were apt with him to > become personal disputes. These failings perhaps accounted for his long and > sterile feud with the BBL. = Schapiro's opinion = In 1951 Boris Schapiro wrote an article giving his opinion of the top players of the day. This was his assessment of Gray: :\\"Brilliant dummy player, very good defender, inclined to overbid in competitive situations but always liable to 'slip a contract through'. Concentration poor; difficult to play against.\\"Schapiro, Boris. 1951. \\"Knights of the Square Table\\". Contract Bridge Journal. Reprinted in Hasenson (2004), p. 63. Eleven years later, Schapiro updated his article: :\\"Gray must be the best player over 60 and he is still a great force at the bridge table.\\"Schapiro, Boris. 1962. Contract Bridge Journal. Reprinted in Hasenson (2004), p. 64. Family life Gray married Stella Sonia Soltz on 1 January 1938, they did not have any children. On 24 November 1968 Gray died of heart failure at his home in Hampstead, London.Robson, Andrew. 2004. \\"Gray, Maurice Charles Harrison- (1899–1968)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Its research arm, the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, provides research to members of Congress and their staff. In February, 2016, John F. Tierney was appointed the executive director of the Council for a Livable World and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, the council’s affiliated education and research organization. For more than 50 years, the Council for a Livable World has been advocating for a more principled approach to U.S. national security and foreign policy. Policy influence and lobbying Every election cycle, the Council endorses congressional candidates who are arms control advocates and who support the Council's outlook on national security issues. Since its inception, the Council has helped elect 134 U.S. arms control advocates to the Senate and 226 to the House of Representatives. Council supporters raised over $1.6 million in 2014. Candidates seeking endorsements are required to answer questionnaires on issues and to defend their positions in interviews. The Council endorses candidates for the House of Representatives through PeacePAC. The Council endorsed both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in their first runs for U.S. Senate seats. The Council has influenced U.S. arms control and national security policies for over fifty years by working on or supporting several issues including: * Rallying support on Capitol Hill in favor of the Iran nuclear deal * Ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Conventional Forces in Europe, Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) * Establishing a U.S. nuclear testing moratorium in 1992 * Banning biological weapons and terminating chemical weapons programs * Limiting the deployment of the MX missile and B-2 bomber * Blocking deployment of National Missile Defense by the Clinton administration * Eliminating funding for the nuclear \\"Bunker Buster\\" and \\"Reliable Replacement Warhead,\\" two new generations of nuclear weapons Father Robert F.

It concerns the law of trusts and has affected much of the thinking on directors' duties in company law. It holds that a trustee owes a strict duty of loyalty so that there can never be a possibility of any conflict of interest. The case's importance derives partly from its historical context, with the South Sea Bubble. Lord King LC, who decided the case, replaced the former Lord Chancellor, Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield who was tried and found guilty of accepting bribes in 1725. The remedy of granting a constructive trust over property, and the strict approach that all possibility of a conflict of interest was to be avoided, derived from the general outrage at the time. Facts A child had inherited the lease on Romford Market near London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. There was clear evidence of the refusal to renew for the benefit of the infant.Keech v. Sandford [1558-1774] All ER Rep 230 Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Judgment The Lord Chancellor, Lord King ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote, Significance Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a stock market crash. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. The principle of strict and absolute duties of loyalty laid down in Keech was a decisive break with prior case law, seen in Holt v Holt,(1670) 1 Ch. Cas. 190 Rushworth’s Case,(1676) 2 Freem. 13 and Walley v Walley.(1687) 1 Vern 484 The influence of Keech has reached beyond the duties of trustees, into the fiduciary duties of company directors. The approach being taken in England (c.f. the position in Delaware corporate law) is that any possibility of a conflict of interest means a breach of trust.

MLB career Selected by the Cardinals in the 24th round of the 1999 amateur entry draft, Crudale played his first professional season with their Rookie League team, the Johnson City Cardinals in 1999. After moving up the Cardinals chain, Crudale made the big club out of spring training in 2002 and pitched well, with a 3-0 mark and a 1.88 ERA out of the bullpen (plus one start). Crudale spent most of the 2003 season at AAA Memphis, however, and was dealt in August to Milwaukee, who released him in spring training in 2004. Dogged by injuries, he pitched poorly for minor-league teams in the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants minor league systems later that season, ending his affiliated baseball career. (Ironically, his major league ERA was an excellent 2.09, less than half of his minor-league mark of 4.38.) Later career After leaving Organized Baseball, Crudale pitched three seasons for the independent Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League from 2005–07. Continuing his baseball career abroad, he played in Italy (De Angelis Godo Baseball) in 2007, then moved on to Taiwan with the CPBL's dmedia T-REX in 2008. He returned to Europe for his final season as a player with the Sanmarinese-Italian team T & A San Marino in 2009. In 2008, Mike briefly worked as an instructor at Turn 2 sports training facility in Collinsville, Illinois; he now coaches the DBA Crushers (12-and-under) squad in Danville, California.

The village is southeast of the Dikgatlhong Dam, which was constructed between 2008. Before work started on the dam, the government arranged for counselling services on AIDS both to construction workers and to residents of Chokwe as well as of the Mmadinare, Robelela, Matopi, Matsiloje and Patayamatebele villages.

The village is located in the eastern tip of Botswana, close to the border with Zimbabwe, and it has a primary school. The population was 735 in the 2001 census. Mabolwe village may appear to be hardly noticeable to people from other areas who enjoy the privilege of 'being original' than other areas of the country and along the A1 road enjoy. But one thing that most Batswana miss to realise is that Mabolwe area has equal opportunities to also become a tourism destination like the northern part of Botswana. It has an abundance of wildlife, wonderful ancestral hills, unique appetizing trees and is home to the much-fancied Colophospermum mopane which is a main source of the mopane worm, the caterpillar of the moth Imbrasia belina. The caterpillars are rich in protein and are eaten by people, and the sale of roasted or dried mopane worms can contribute significantly to rural economies. It looks a little well off economically as evidenced by well constructed homesteads and domestic activities here and there. In 2008 the government of Botswana found it vital to approve a border post in Mabolwe Mmamabaka which links both Botswana and Zimbabwe after a long time request from Mabolwe villagers. The construction of the project has already started but the whole process is still pending since necessary infrastructure and personnel should be provided before the border could be opened to the public. Another reason that could delay its operations, according to the former assistant Minister of Finance and Development Planning Mr Samson Guma Moyo, was the political turmoil in Zimbabwe. He said what Botswana could do in the meantime was to continue with the preparations for the opening of the border on her side. He noted that the road from Mabolwe to the border needed to be improved, which would cost a lot of money. Mr Guma also said cost of building the bridge across the Shashe River into Zimbabwe was extremely high. Had it been the initiation progressed as it was meant to, this would have highly benefited the village especially in terms of development as well as employment. History Babirwa people have moved from place to place before they finally settled in their present settlements permanently. It is hoped that this might shed light on Babirwa people of present-day Botswana. The region called Bobirwa is the area which lies between the Shashe River Tuli Block and a north–south line approximately 28 0 15 ' E. The area encompasses the villages of Bobonong, Gobajango, Mabolwe, Lentswe-Ie- Moriti, Mathathane, Molaladau, Mothabaneng, Semolale and Tsetsebjwe. Babirwa originated in Nareng which lies in the south of Bolobedi in Letswalo country around Phalaborwa. Babirwa people present at Nareng date back to between 1510 and 1599. Babirwa moved from Nareng under their chief, Tshukudu, to the Blauwberg area in the former Transvaal. It was while they were at Blauwberg that they started breaking up around the 1820s. The group that left Blauwberg headed for Zimbabwe under the leadership of Dauyatswala and his brother Makhure(a). This group was not welcomed in Mambo's country. The two brothers decided to leave the place to seek refuge somewhere else. At the last moment Makhure refused to go with Dauyatswala. Dauyatswala together with his followers moved back to the Transvaal. Makhure was given a piece of land in Zimbabwe to live with his followers. They lived for a while before they were attacked by the Ndebele of Mzilikazi, who was running away from Shaka's rule, in 1837. They fled to the present day Botswana led by Sekoba, one of Makhure's sons. Sekoba was accompanied by his brothers Makala, Mbalane and Bolamba who in most traditions is mentioned alongside Sekoba as the leader of the group. Among the group were also Sekoba's uncles, Serumola, Legong, Mphago and Maunatlala. It is not clear from the sources whether these men were full brothers or half brothers of Makhure. This group broke up with Sekoba and his followers, settling at Lephokwe while the Bolamba's group settled in the present Tuli Block. Some sources claim that Sekoba's group settled first at Gubadwe Hill near Gobajango and that is where Babirwa began spreading over the area which is today called Bobirwa, including the Tuli Block. Babirwa did not live under the authority of Sekoba for long. They broke from Sekoba and lived ill scattered, isolated settlements. Only those who were loyal to Sekoba remained with him. Sekoba's group went to settle at Majweng Hills. Bolamba and his followers settled at Zembefonyi near the present day Lentswe-le-Moriti. Maunatlala settled his people in Lepoko1e Hills in the northern part of Bobonong. Serumola moved his people and settled at Lephale Hills in the Tuli Block and Makala settled East of Mapungubwe. The people of Kgwatalala and Mbalane settled on the hill called Lekhubu-la-Mbalane in the vicinity of the present day Semolale. In their settlements Babirwa were continually attacked by the Ndebe1e forces raiding and looting their cattle. In the 1860s Khama sent his newly formed age-regiment of Mafolosa and Matshosa to Bobirwa. These age-regiments were to group Babirwa in one place(centralization). Because of the attacks and resentment of Khama' s rule, Babirwa migrated to the Transvaal and joined other Babirwa people there. They stayed in the Transvaal until 1894 when they were attacked by the Boers, where eupon Babirwa returned to their settlements in Botswana. Sekoba' s group, who were by then led by his son Madikwe, settled at Majweng Hills in the north-eastern part of the present day Bobonong. In the 1890s Malema became the leader of the people of Bolamba who settled in the region now called the Tuli Block in Zembefonyi, next to him was Mmadema at Pitseng, near Ghadi Pan, and within the same region Serumola and his followers settled at Lephale Hill. The people of Serumola must have been the ones from whom Mathathane people descend. According to oral information Mathathane village was established in the 1930s under the leadership of Serumola (M. Mangogo1a, personal communication). At the moment they are still ruled by Serumola' s grandson, Richard Serumola. Prior to their occupation of Mathathane, these people were among the Malema people who were forced to leave the Tuli Block by Khama III in 1920. In 1906 Khama III had sent his son-ill- law Modisaotsile Mokomane (one primary school in bobonong is named after him) as a chief representative to group Babirwa people and place them in one village. Modisaotsile established the present Bobonong in 1909 and was joined by other small groups which were loyal to Khama III. In 1919 Khama sent Modisaotsi1e to go and remove Malema's people from the Tuli Block to pave a way for the British South African Company's white settlers who were tosettle in the Tuli Block. Khama had ceded the area of Tuli Block in 1895 to the British government who had passed it to theBSA Company. Malema refused to leave the place reasoning that he had already ploughed hence he need to yield first and as a result Modisaotsile used force. His regiments burnt the fields of Malema's people. At some point Malema was summoned to Serowe in chains and Babirwa cattle were also confiscated. Death sentence was passed on him and everyone was ordered to kill him with a spear wherever he was spotted. Interestly Malema filed a case in court of law demanding his ancestral land back and claiming to have lost $40,000 in damages. He was represented by Mafikeng-based lawyer by the name Glucksman whom Malema promised to pay him 1000 heads of cattle if all he emerge victorious. The interpreter during the hearing of the case was Ramaeba Kwada (the writer's great grandfather). Khama died before the issue was settled but his son Sekgoma II upon being installed as a kgosi admitted that his father acted harshly. At the end out of British interests the issue was thrown away. In protest Malema fled with his people to Transvaal and returned later. Upon their return Malema settled at Molaladau in 1944 and died peacefully in 1959 as old man. Other groups; Serumola settled at Lephale Hills later Mathathane, Madema in Semolale, Mokgethi in Gobajango, Phole in Tsetsetjwe. One of Madema's sons Ngala and his elder brother Kgoboko decided to move some miles aways from their fathers kingdom and finally landed in the current day Mabolwe. On the other side was Madome Mabidi Sebola followed by his brothers Makgasane Sebola and Moseki Sebola as well as his sisters Molebowe Mankona Mathora, Makale Sebola including his half brothers Jack Sebola, Sezoo Sebola and Mosholombe. These two groups of kinsmen together with other families they came along with settled at far apart but would eventually unite as time went on to form one community. The Great Ngala eventually became Mosada meaning chief in deep sebirwa language as it was believed to have first reached the place. It is still not clear to what significance for the place to be named Mabolwe, with some people trying to come up with some unending stories to interrelate or try to make sense to what led to the naming. It is affectionately known as Mothabeng by its lovers due to its soils, which mostly have little sand. Culture Tradition is also deeply embedded as elderly people here still hold on to their traditional way of life. Mabolwe people still have a strong bond with South African who live on the other side of the border. To them, South Africa is closer to them compared to other parts of Botswana and this is evidenced by the culture that they share. Babirwa are believed to originate from South Africa where most of their relatives still live thereby enhancing continuous trips for social purposes. Most of their means of survival are centred in South Africa, for instance, medical help. Mabolwe people just like other Babirwa still speak sebirwa language which sound more like a mixture of Sepedi, Sesotho and Venda both in South Africa to give a clear indication that they originate there. Apart from language, their dances, food and traditional clothing is exactly similar to their South African counterpart. Here culture is mostly evidenced by the commitment and devotion of the village elders who defied all odds to establish a traditional troupe named BDF X1. Due to the name some people think the group is related to Major Bright's boys or Matshwenyego Fisher's platoon, but they only possess a special link to President Ian Khama. Having been formed in 1978 as Mabolwe Traditional Troupe, the group discarded the brand in 1979 to label itself BDF X1. The name was derived from the celebrations in which Khama was installed as the paramount chief of Bangwato in Serowe in 1979 where it was hired to perform. Even today the group has stuck to the name that it has now become well known in Bobirwa, a thing that usually sparks confusion whenever they are called on stage to perform. However, the strategic name often draws a huge audience and attracts a lot of cash prizes when they perform. The name is simply a tribute to Khama when he parted ways with the Botswana Defence Force and the group still nurtures and respects the day they performed for him in 1979. The group consists of 40 elderly women all in their late 50s. Alongside the ZEBRAS troupe from Mathathane, BDF X1 provides the most cherished form of entertainment, not only in Bobirwa but throughout the country. Their movements are determined by the occasion for which they are hired to perform, be it a wedding celebration, or even sometimes political rallies. In 2004, the group spent a month in China where they had been selected to perform and display Setswana culture. The group leader stressed that it broadened their horizons. “To be honest, everybody was impressed by our performance and we left behind a good image of our country. We are now flexible, even if BDF X1 football club could invite us to interact with them after the league, we are okay.” BDF X1 has also been to Zimbabwe. As old as they are Falala Ngala maintains that the time they spend at rehearsals does not in any way overstretch their schedules. “We have adjusted well to doing our personal things and going for practice.” She adds that the spirit of cooperation, commitment and a thirst to keep their culture alive is the only force behind the group's 27 years success. However, the traditional singing is often put on hold during ploughing season as it is against the Sebirwa culture to beat drums at a time when rain is needed most. During such seasons they only prepare if they had been hired to perform somewhere outside the area. During practices, every one of them strictly abides by the command from the leader. The songs they emphasize on are the ones used to pray for the rain, ploughing season and those that were sung during night outs. Members believes that they mostly sing songs that convey a useful meaning to listeners combined with beautiful dance techniques that also appeal to the audience. Youth have found it difficult to join the troupe as they often fail to withstand the intense cultural practices maintained by the group. The group does not only keep the culture through dance but also conducts initiation on young girls and gives them advice on how to handle their husbands once they are married. “We do not allow a situation where a girl can have more than one man and there is no revenge if a man is playing around. Re ba ruta gore monona ha tshwarwe madeudeu.” Currently the group survives from the little they raise from performances and weave their own dance gear that includes beads and matlhowa. They even go as far as South Africa to fetch indigenous tree fruits that they use in dance gear. However they have expressed worry that the money is too little for the 40 of them to share. They appealed to the general public to donate anything that could help them survive in their endeavour to maintain Sebirwa cultural practices. “Even a roll of material to make a uniform is more than welcome because our uniform is now torn and we are not working yet we have a passion for our tradition.” BDF X1 troupe's main concern is that they have been the backbone of the Bobirwa Trade Fair since its inception but they say the government has done nothing so far to acknowledge their presence. “We are desperately in need of donors and the government has turned a deaf ear to us.” Though a strong bond has been established with the name, BDF X1 has forwarded the name and two others to the registrar of societies to select a suitable one for them. Members said though they foresee a situation where they will be allocated a different name in their certificate, it will take them centuries to cut the umbilical cord with “BDF X1”. “All the names we submitted were suggested by Mabolwe residents and we hope we will adjust to any outcome of the Registrar of Societies. But before we change the name we wish the vice president could come to Mabolwe, where he is assured of royal treatment.” References Category:Populated places in Central District (Botswana) Category:Villages in Botswana ","title":"Mabolwe"},{"id":"15118803","text":"Robelela is a village in Central District of Botswana.

They were forcefully removed from this area by the colonial administration, acting under pressure from a powerful businessman in the name of Cecil John Rhodes, whose company - British South Africa Company (BSC), was allocated the land stretching almost the length of Limpopo river within Botswana by Khama III.

Squadron Role To test and evaluate rotary wing aircraft and their associated equipment and weapon systems to generate evidence to support recommendations for Military Aircraft Release / Release To Service or advice for Service Deviation and assist in MoD R&D; programmes. History RWTES (formerly D Sqn) was formed in September 1950 at Boscombe Down as part of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;).Collier Webb, Derek. UK Flight Testing Accidents 1940–1971. (UK 2002). The squadron came into existence as helicopters became ever more prevalent in the UK Armed Forces and consolidated test and evaluation was required. Over the years, the parent organisation has changed: A&AEE; became part of the Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation, absorbing the work of RAE Bedford and RAE Farnborough; then part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA); and on 2 July 2001 a part of RAF Strike Command (now Air Command) working in a public-private partnering arrangement with QinetiQ. Personnel RWTES is a military tri-service squadron commanded, over alternative tours, by a Royal Navy Commander and Army Lieutenant Colonel/Colonel. There are 14 other test pilots from the Royal Navy, Army Air Corps and Royal Air Force plus 3 highly experienced aircrewman. These military (or ex-military) personnel provide recent operational role experience and ensure all testing is related to current or future military operations. As well as being very experienced and above-average pilots, all test pilots are graduates of the Empire Test Pilots School (ETPS) also located at MOD Boscombe Down, or one of the other three internationally recognised military test pilot training academies in the USA or France. Typical work Any new aircraft, new equipment or modification for use in British military aircraft needs to be safe to be flown in the intended role and effective at prosecuting that role. RWTES personnel are responsible for planning, executing and reporting flight test trials for the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force. Typical trials include assessment of performance, flying qualities, airworthiness, systems and safety modifications. Recent examples are: * Bringing new aircraft into service; * Mid-life upgrades to in-service aircraft; * Improved night vision devices; * Improvements to aircraft performance; * Updated Defensive Aids Suites; * New radios and other communication devices. Trials involving new aircraft major modifications to in-service aircraft are conducted in Combined Test Teams with representatives from the manufacturer (e.g. AgustaWestland), RWTES, QinetiQ, and the Operational Evaluation Unit (OEU) of the Arm or Service (e.g. the Royal Navy's Lynx OEU). Aircraft RWTES have use of a number of aircraft, permanently based at Boscombe Down, including 2 Sea King, and 4 Gazelles.QinetiQ: Aircraft The longest serving of which is Gazelle HT3 XZ936, commissioned in May 1978 and living its entire life at Boscombe Down. Two of the Gazelles are painted in the classic A&AEE; colours of red, white and blue; they are used for continuation training and trials work as well for instruction use by ETPS. One Sea King is an \\"instrumented\\" HC4 Junglie and the other is an uninstrumented HU5. Flight test instrumentation (FTI) is fitted to some aircraft to accurately measure parameters including performance, sideslip, 'G' and control activity. Additional military aircraft are allotted to Boscombe Down for specific trials; including the AH-64 Apache, Chinook, Merlin, Puma, plus any other in-service military helicopter. Training In 1914 the Experimental Flight was established at Upavon to assess the new aeroplanes and their equipment for this revolutionary new means of warfare. The Experimental Flight expanded in the inter-war years and in 1943 a dedicated school was set up by Air Marshal Sir Ralph Sorley, the controller of Research and Development, as he was concerned by the rising number of fatalities in test flying and a lack of standardisation of flying techniques. The Test Pilots' Training Flight at Boscombe Down was formed, now called the Empire Test Pilots School, one of a succession of schools with the Empire prefix.QinetiQ: History It served the Air Forces of the British Empire and has been attended by experienced pilots from around the world. Working alongside QinetiQ The MOD conducts its flight test and military evaluation activities in a public-private partnering arrangement with QinetiQ. The Armed Forces provide specialist personnel to work in partnership with QinetiQ. For regulatory purposes the QinetiQ-MOD partnering arrangement that is approved to conduct flight testing is referred to as the Aircraft Test and Evaluation Collaboration (ATEC).

He and his sons, Charles and Samuel Jr., were one of the group referred to by historians as the Queens' Binder. Mearne was born in Reading, England and lived all of his professional life in Little Britain in Aldersgate. He passed his apprenticeship in 1646 and set up as a bookseller and publisher. In 1655, he and two others went to the Netherlands, where he probably performed a service to Charles in exile, because he was named bookbinder to the king on 20 June 1660. He was also a part owner of the king's printing house, with John Bill and Christopher Barker. In 1668, Charles petitioned to have Mearne and others admitted to the Stationers' Company. In the Stationers' Company, Mearne would serve as warden and, later, master. In 1674, he became the stationer in ordinary to Charles, and the next year he and his son were made grants for life to their position. The earliest surviving books bound by Mearne come from 1655, while many survive from his time as bookbinder to the king. His workshop produced beautiful gold tooled and onlay bindings for Charles and the royal libraries. For the chapels, gifts, and presentations of the installation of the Knight of the Garter ceremonies, Mearne's shop produced even more lavishly bound books. Many other binderies in London and elsewhere made similar luxurious bindings in the style of the day, and attributions of bindings to Mearne in older catalogues should be treated with caution. Professionally, Mearne was popular with other publishers for his work at hunting down illegal presses. While he did not perform the binding himself, personally, after his appointment, he oversaw the production and designs of his books. Samuel Mearne, Sr., died in 1683, with his son, Charles, dying in 1686, and Samuel Mearne, Jr. taking over the shop and appointments until the Glorious Revolution in 1689.

Background In 1892, the government began a project of importing reindeer from Siberia to Alaska, and teaching the natives how to raise the animals in order to have a steady and dependable food supply. The reindeer were obtained by Captain Michael Healy, who was known and trusted by the Siberian natives. Sheldon Jackson, the General Superintendent of Alaska, used his influence in the United States Congress to raise funds to purchase and care for the animals, and was placed in overall charge of training the herders. The project started with seventeen reindeer. From 1892 to 1906, cutters would cruise up the Siberian coast and barter with Chukchi for reindeer, which were then transported to a station at Port Clarence, near Nome, Alaska. In 1897, eight whaling ships were trapped in an Arctic ice field surrounding Point Barrow, the northernmost point of Alaska. The owners of the ships were concerned that the 265 men of the ships' crews would starve during the winter. They appealed to President William McKinley to send a relief expedition. McKinley asked the United States Treasury Department to organize an expedition, and they sent the USRC Bear, returned from Bering Sea Patrol, to undertake the expedition.  Expedition  In November 1897, the Bear, commanded by Captain Francis Tuttle, sailed from Port Townsend, Washington. It was too late in the year for the cutter to push through the ice, so it was decided the party must go overland, enlisting the help of natives, stopping by a reindeer station to purchase a herd of reindeer. The overland trek left from Cape Vancouver, Alaska on December 16, 1897. The expedition was led by First Lieutenant David H. Jarvis, the executive officer of the Bear; the second-in- command was Second Lieutenant Ellsworth P. Bertholf. They were accompanied by Samuel J. Call, the ship's surgeon of the Bear, and for part of the way by the enlisted man F. Koltchoff. They were also assisted by William Thomas Lopp, the Superintendent of the Teller Reindeer Station, and Charlie Antisarlook, a native reindeer herder. They traveled and carried the provisions using dog sleds, sleds pulled by reindeer, snowshoes, and skis. After , the group reached Point Barrow on March 29, 1898. The expedition brought 382 reindeer to the whalers, having lost only 66. The following summer, the Bear reached Point Barrow and the expedition officers could rejoin their ship. Recognition President McKinley recognized the achievements of the rescue in a letter dated January 17, 1899 to the United States Congress, in which he asked Congress to award the three officers \\"gold medals of honor\\" \\"commemorative of their heroic struggles in aid of suffering fellow-men.\\" He also recommended $2,500 to be disbursed by the United States Secretary of the Treasury to W.T. Lopp, Artisarlook, and the native herders who helped. In recognition of their work, Jarvis, Bertholf, and Call received Congressional Gold Medals in 1902.(P.L. 57-192, 32 Stat. 492) Note: This is not the same as the Medal of Honor. The statute reads as follows: > Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United > States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury > is hereby directed to bestow a gold medal of honor, of such design as he may > approve, upon First Lieutenant David H. Jarvis, Second Lieutenant Ellsworth > P. Bertholf, and Doctor Samuel J.

Located at the mall is one Cinemark theater and 58 retail stores. History Plans for a five-anchor shopping mall began in 1988. Gateway Mall opened in 1990 with stores including Target, Sears, and Troutman's Emporium as anchors. A 12-screen Cinemark theater was located adjacent to the food court. In 1999, a 17-screen Cinemark theater opened at the mall, and the 12-screen Cinemark became a second-run discount theater. Ross Dress for Less added a store in 2002. Kohl's built a new two-story department store at Gateway in 2006. The Troutman's later became Ashley Furniture, then Cabela's in 2011. On September 28, 2014, Movies 12 screened its final film, leaving Cinemark 17 as the only theater in the city of Springfield. In 2015, redevelopment began on the mall. It was renamed The Shoppes at Gateway and partially converted to an outdoor format. New tenants in the redevelopment include Marshalls, Petco, Ulta, and Hobby Lobby, plus a relocated Ross. In 2016, the mall was listed for sale by Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated. The mall was sold to Balboa Retail Properties in March 2016 for a then-Lane County record high of $107 million.

She defeated both the ships and the on-shore fort to win her third battle honour. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, her name was changed to HMS Kent. She served in both the First and Second Dutch Wars with distinction and was involved in the Battle of Lowestoft, which remains the most crushing naval defeat in Dutch history, and the St. James's Day Battle, a two-day-long fight which ended in a closer English victory.

Among the backing musicians that played on Kirby Stone Four albums were Jimmy Carroll's orchestra, the Kai Winding Quartet, Alvino Rey, Shelly Manne, and Al Klink. Their style, which melded swing jazz, vocalese, and early rock and roll, was referred to as \\"The Go Sound\\". They made many appearances on U.S. television shows such as The Judy Garland Show and The Dean Martin Show into the mid-1960s.

He earned his All-American Status as a linebacker in the only year that he played linebacker at \\"Linebacker U\\". Prior to his senior year, he also started 2 seasons as an offensive guard for the Lions and helped his team to 2 undefeated seasons in 1968 and 1969. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 1972 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He played with the Miami Dolphins. He was a Canadian Football League (CFL) All-Star with the Montreal Alouettes. Early years Zapiec started every game at Penn State that he was eligible for and graduated with the best record of any Penn State Player ever, 34 and 1, winning two Orange Bowls, defeating Kansas and Missouri, and one Cotton Bowl, with a win over Texas. \\"Big Daddy Z\\", as he was known by his friends and coach Paterno, started as an Offensive Guard his Sophomore and Junior Years when the Lions went undefeated in 1968 and 1969. \\"Big Z\\" was named to the All- America Blocking Team selected by Wirt Gammon of the Chattanooga Times in 1969. As an Offensive Guard he earned All-East Honors each Year and was a Honorable Mention All American Selection in 1969. He is most remembered in Penn State Annals as the lead blocker that took out Kansas All-American John Zook at the goal line that allowed Bobby Campbell to score a 2-point conversion that lead to a Nittany Lion 15-14 Orange Bowl Victory with no time on the clock. This successful try followed an errant pass on the first 2-point attempt when Kansas was penalized for having 12 men on the field. George Plimpton, author of the book and movie Paper Lion, went on to characterize Zapiec's block on Zook as the most important block in College Football, equivalent to Jerry Kramer taking out Jethro Pugh at the goal line to allow Bart Star to score in the 1967 NFL Championship. Fourteen years later NBC voted the Penn State - Kansas finish as the most exciting game in the first 40 years of televising College Football. Switching to Defense for the 1970 Season, Big Z was moved from guard to middle linebacker, a position he was destined to play after idolizing his boyhood hero Chuck Bednarik, aka, \\"Concrete Charlie\\". Bednarik was the last of the 2-way performers in the NFL leading the Philadelphia Eagles to the 1960 Championship over Lombardi's Packers when he played Center and Middle Linebacker for 60 minutes. After only playing 1 game as a middle linebacker that year against Navy in 1970, he suffered an appendectomy flying out to Colorado to play the Buffalos who went on the next day to defeat the Lions and bring to halt their 31-game winning streak. The next year, he returned to the defensive side of the ball moving to outside linebacker, captaining the Team and earning First-Team All- American Honors. Additionally, he was awarded the Chevrolet Defensive Player of the Game Award (1971 was the first year that Chevrolet gave the game award) against Iowa that year when he made 18 solo tackles in a victory over the Hawkeyes at Kinnick Stadium - still a one-game record for Penn State Linebackers. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys= Zapiec was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (93rd overall) of the 1972 NFL Draft.

Army (the football program of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York), then ranked Number 1 in the Associated Press college football poll, played the University of Notre Dame, of South Bend, Indiana, ranked Number 2, at Yankee Stadium in New York City.LaPointe, Joe. \\"Notre Dame and Army to Wake Up the Echoes\\", The New York Times, September 8, 2005. Accessed January 10, 2008. This game is regarded as one of the 20th century Games of the Century. The teams This matchup, with the national attention it received in the era before the service academies ceased to be major football powers, was usually played at a neutral site, often in New York City. =Previous matchups= The 1924 game between the schools, a Notre Dame victory at the Polo Grounds, was the game at which sportswriter Grantland Rice christened the Fighting Irish backfield—quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, halfbacks Jim Crowley and Don Miller, and fullback Elmer Layden—the \\"Four Horsemen.\\" The 1928 edition, with Notre Dame trailing Army at halftime at Yankee Stadium, was the game in which Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne delivered his \\"Win one for the Gipper\\" speech, resulting in a comeback win for the Fighting Irish. =The 1946 season= Both teams were undefeated going into the 1946 game at Yankee Stadium. Both teams averaged over 30 points per game. Army had a 25-game winning streak, last losing to Notre Dame in 1943 (26–0), but had won the last two contests between the schools by scores of 59–0 and 48–0. Army had the defending Heisman Trophy winner, Doc Blanchard, also known as \\"Mr. Inside,\\" the man who would win it that year, Glenn Davis, also known as \\"Mr. Outside,\\" and one of the nation's top quarterbacks in Arnold Tucker. Notre Dame had the quarterback who would win the Heisman the next year, Johnny Lujack, and end Leon Hart of Notre Dame won the Heisman in 1949 (the only time ever that a college football game had four Heisman Trophy winners). Both Tucker and Lujack were also outstanding defensive backs at a time when football players, college as well as professional, usually played both offense and defense. Notre Dame had defeated eventual 1947 Rose Bowl participant Illinois in Champaign, 26–6, to open the season. On October 26, they won at #17 Iowa, 41–6. The game leading up to this one was a 28–0 Irish defeat of Navy at Baltimore. Game summary Despite the high-scoring and much-hyped offenses, the game ended in a scoreless tie, with each school's best chance at a scoring drive coming back-to-back: Tucker intercepting Lujack, and Lujack then making a touchdown-saving tackle on Blanchard a few plays later. Notre Dame's defense did something no other team had ever done — it held the famous \\"Touchdown Twins,\\" Blanchard and Davis, to a total of 79 yards. As an indication of how the defense of both teams dominated, seven linemen in that game were nominated for Lineman of the Week honors in the weekly Associated Press poll. Joe Steffy, an Army guard who helped shut down the Notre Dame running game, won the honor, followed closely by Notre Dame right tackle George Sullivan and freshman lineman Jim Martin, who helped stifle Army's running attack and dropped Davis on consecutive plays for losses totaling 17 yards. Both Notre Dame coach Leahy and Army coach Blaik called the game \\"a terrific battle of defenses.\\" Aftermath Both teams would finish the season undefeated with this one tie, but it was Notre Dame that was awarded the national championship by the Associated Press, with Army coming in second.Anderson, Dave. \\"SPORTS OF THE TIMES; 'NO MORAL VICTORIES' FOR IRISH\\", The New York Times, September 14, 1986. Accessed January 10, 2008.\\"SPORTS OF THE TIMES\\", The New York Times, November 22, 1983.

The Pacific Coast Conference and the Big Nine Conference, the forerunners of the Pac-12 and Big Ten, signed the agreement to start with the 1947 Rose Bowl of matching their conference champions. The national sports writers wanted to match either Notre Dame or Army with #4 and undefeated UCLA. Instead, #5 Illinois was the first Midwestern team to go by the terms of the agreement, and routed UCLA, 45–14.Illini Rout UCLA 45-14. Urbana-Champaign News Gazette, January 2, 1947 With Blanchard, Davis and Tucker having graduated, Army's unbeaten streak would be broken the next year, by Columbia University. Notre Dame would not lose until early in the 1950 season.

It also reached the second best Spanish position in the TOP500 list of supercomputers. This computer is installed in CeSViMa, a research center of the Technical University of Madrid. Magerit was first installed in 2006 and reached the 9th fastest in Europe and the 34th in the world, the second best position of a Spanish supercomputer in the list. It also reached the 275th position in the first Green500 list published.Magerit Green500 certificate in November 2007 It is no longer among the TOP500. The second version, installed in 2011 reached the 1st position of Spain, 44th of Europe and 136th fastest of the world. It also reached the 18th position in the Green500 list. Magerit (for *Materit or *Mageterit) is the most ancient recorded name of the current city of Madrid. The name comes from the Celtic name of a fortress built on the Manzanares River in the 9th century AD, and means \\"Place of abundant water\\".  History  Computer Science School, first location of Magerit supercomputer = First steps (2005) = Magerit was created as a collaboration between Technical University of Madrid and IBM. The computer is housed in the newly created CeSViMa. This first version had only 124 nodes and was housed temporarily in the Computer Science School of Madrid. The funding was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and the Autonomous Region of Madrid. = Joining the Spanish Supercomputer Network (2006–2007) = Late 2006 CeSViMa joins Spanish Supercomputing Network (Red Española de Supercomputación or RES in Spanish) and the supercomputer was upgraded. The new configuration has 1204 nodes reaching a speed of 14 TFLOPS. This is considered the first version due to its inclusion in the TOP500 list in the 34th position, the second best position of a Spanish supercomputer in the list. In 2007 the first users from the access committee of Spanish Supercomputing Network (the agreement makes that the Network can schedule the use of the 68% of the resources) and users managed at local (CeSViMa) access committee (using the other 32%). = Migration and small upgrades (2008–2010) = CeSViMa Building in the Scientific and Technology Park of UPM, current location In May 2008, CeSViMa and Magerit supercomputer migrated to a new building in the same campus (only 500 meters from previous location at Computer Science School). The computer was upgraded: change of communication switch, storage subsystem and replacement of some blades with a new version. This upgrade increase the power of the supercomputer near 2 TFLOPS reaching 15.95 TFLOPS. This upgrade does not avoid the fall from the TOP500 list in November 2008 In this configuration the 59.7% of the supercomputer CPU time is assigned via RES access committee and 40.3% is assigned via CeSViMa policies. One year later, in 2009, the operating system and other system software was upgraded (migrating to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10) During 2010, CeSViMa acquire a new massive storage system with 1 petabyte of capacity in parallel with the own storage of Magerit. = Upgrade (2011) = In the first half of 2011, the supercomputer was fully upgraded replacing all computer nodes and interconnexion networks with the latest technologies in only one month (a record time)Nota de prensa de la UPM: Technical University of Madrid installs the most powerful supercomputer in Spain This configuration reached the 136th position in the TOP500 list and the 18th position in the related Green500 list (both widely used as the supercomputer reference ranking) becoming the most powerful supercomputer and ecological supercomputer in Spain The new distribution of use is 80% managed by CeSViMa-UPM access committee and 20% managed by Spanish Supercomputing Network. Despite of the fact that the RES managed percent is lower, the resources doned to the network increased 4–5 times. The upgrade does not include the storage subsystem (maintain the storage upgraded in 2008). There is a small upgrade planned in next few years to adapt the storage system to the new requirements.  Architecture  We can consider two versions of the supercomputer: * The original 2006 (the 124 nodes of the agreement of 2005 was included in this configuration) with a small upgrade in 2008. * The full upgrade in 2011 that makes Magerit the first supercomputer of Spain. = First version (2005–2010) = First version of Magerit Supercomputer (Photo 2009) This setup reached the second best position in the TOP500 list (34th, November 2006).

The system has a distributed storage system with a capacity of 190 TB under GPFS. The access to this shared storage is provided by a high bandwidth switch that allows peaks of 1 Tbit/s. All the nodes are interconnected with a low latency (2.6 – 3.2 μs) and high bandwidth network called Myrinet. This network is used only for MPI messages of users' tasks. Finally, an auxiliary Ethernet network is deployed for administration tasks. = Second version (2011) = Second version of Magerit Supercomputer (photo 2011) This setup converts Magerit into the most powerful supercomputer of Spain. When this setup enters in production stage in 2011, it reach the first position of Spain, 44th of Europe and 136th of the world. The system maintains the cluster architecture with 245 PS702 nodes, each one with 16 cores in two 64-bit processors POWER7 (eight cores each) 3.0 GHz, 32 GB of RAM and 300 GB of local hard disk. Each core provides 18.38 Gflops. The interconnection was replaced with an Infiniband network, a high-bandwidth (40 Gbit/s) and low latency (0.3 μs). The system maintains two independent Gigabit Ethernet for auxiliary tasks: deployment of images and access to storage subsystem. The storage system remains the same (192 TB under GPFS) with a bandwidth near 1 Tbit/s. The upgrade includes an update of the software: operating system (SLES11SP1), deployment system (xCAT, eXtreme Cluster Administration Toolkit) and all software and libraries used in the system.  Use  Magerit processes batch jobs with large processing requirements, such as models of the universe, simulations of materials and climate models. An example of project is the project Cajal Blue Brain (Spanish participation in Blue Brain Project). These jobs are organized by a queue manager. Due to the characteristic of the jobs (runs in hundred of CPUs a few days) its impossible to use more conventional access to the resources. The supercomputer must be running jobs without interrupts all the year. The use of a queue manager of batch jobs allows a global scheduling of the resources increasing the use of the resources and a fair play between users.  Access to resources  The system is available to any person, institution or company that requests access via: * Directly CeSViMa, filling the request for access forms on CeSViMa web page. * As a collaboration agreement with CeSViMa * Via Spanish Supercomputing Network. This is a competitive process. The access committee evaluates all the projects and can assign resources on any other supercomputer of the network so it can be scheduled in the 20% of Magerit resources managed by RES.

Sarangapani, (, 19 April 1903 - 16 March 1974) or Kosa as he was also known, a Tamil writer and publisher, was born in Thiruvarur, Tamil Nadu, on 20 April 1903. He received a good education and was effectively bi- lingual in Tamil and English. At 21, he went to Singapore to work as a bookkeeper, eventually becoming the manager at his firm. Sarangapani was deeply influenced by E. V. Ramasami Naicker (better known as Periyar) and his Self-Respect Movement in Tamil Nadu. He was committed to rationalism and the ideal of a modern, progressive society. Sarangapani established direct contact with the Self-Respect Movement in India when he became the agent in British Malaya (then including Singapore) for the distribution of its magazine, Kudi Arasu. These links were strengthened in 1929 and 1954, when he helped to arrange Periyar's visits to Singapore and Malaya to spread his message to local Tamils. Sarangapani was also active as a Tamil writer and publisher in his own right. In 1929 he set up the magazine Munnetram (Progress), and in 1935 he launched Tamil Murasu, which remains Singapore's only daily Tamil newspaper. He was also a founder of the Tamils Reform Association, and served as its Chairman and Secretary at various points. Through his publications and the Association, Sarangapani promoted the importance of education, as well as denouncing the Hindu caste system, superstitions and alcoholism. Sarangapani was also a champion of the Tamil language in Singapore. He was part of campaigns to make Tamil one of the four official languages of Singapore, as well as having it taught in Singapore schools from the primary to tertiary level. He also helped set up the Department of Indian Studies at the University of Malaya in Singapore. Sarangapani also urged Tamils to embrace Singapore as their home. Former Singapore President Sellapan Ramanathan has noted that In 1937, he married Lim Boon Neo, with whom he had six children (four sons and two daughters). When he died on 16 March 1974, tributes were paid to him in Tamil Nadu, the land of his birth, in Malaysia and in Singapore. In 2004, Sarangapani's birth centenary was marked in Chennai, by tributes from leading Tamil poets, and a seminar on his life and achievements.

It was based in Seattle and majority owned by Jerry Dennon and Bonnie Guitar, both of whom had been involved with Dolton Records and the careers of The Fleetwoods on that label. A split with Dolton over artistic control brought about the new Jerden label. Certain Jerden record issues were distributed by Liberty Records. The label closed after the first year's trading due to failure. Its owners went their separate ways although both ended up in Hollywood, Guitar as an artist for RCA Victor Records and then Dot Records and Dennon doing promotion work for Era Records. Dennon's career was halted by military service, but in late 1962 he resurrected Jerden as full owner. He reissued recordings from Jerden's early days, including a disc by Bonnie Guitar issued in January 1963. It was during this second life that The Kingsmen's \\"Louie Louie\\" arrived (1963) and it is this million selling disc that is the best known of all Dennon's products. In summer 1964 Jerden updated the label design with a turquoise background. In fall 1965 Jerden began a distribution agreement with ABC-Paramount Records. This agreement ended in October 1968. Panorama Records was founded in 1964 by Jerry Dennon and Piccadilly Records in 1966. Piccadilly was used as a regional testing label, releasing artists exclusively only in the Northwest. If the record tested successfully, it was sold to national labels through licensing deals. Panorama was used in a similar manner. Both labels ended in 1968. Burdette Records, founded in 1967 by Dennon, was the label that took Jerden's place for national exposure. Burdette was distributed by Tower Records, which was a division of Capitol Records. The label ended in 1971. However, in late 1994, Jerden issued a various artists CD, titled, Colossus Gold [Colossus Records songs].https://www.amazon.com/Colossus-Gold-Various-Artists/dp/B000001C0D ReferencesExternal links *HistoryLink page on Jerden Records *Jerden singles discography at globaldog.com *Jerden and associated labels discography Category:Record labels established in 1960 Category:Record labels disestablished in 1969 Category:Defunct record labels of the United States ","title":"Jerden Records"},{"id":"15119753","text":"Four Celtic inscribed stones from Beacon Hill cemetery on Lundy Celtic inscribed stones are stone monuments dating from 400 to 1000 AD which have inscriptions in Celtic or Latin text. These can be written in Ogham or Roman letters. Some stones have both Ogham and Roman inscriptions. The stones are found in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, the Isle of Man, and parts of western England (mainly Cornwall, Devon, and Lundy). Most seem to be grave- markers or memorials to a dead individual. The Celtic Inscribed Stones Project database records over 1,200 such inscriptions, excluding Runic ones. It maintains an online database of them.Celtic Inscribed Stones Project They relate to other standing stones with images, such as the Pictish stones of Scotland, or abstract decoration, such as the much earlier Irish Turoe Stone and Castlestrange Stone. The Tristan Stone in 2008 Cornwall=East Cornwall= The Tristan Stone, perhaps of c. 550, is near Fowey, having been moved from just above the harbour at Polkerris. It has a Tau cross on one face, and on another the Latin inscription: > DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT > CVNOMORI FILIVS > [Drustanus lies here, son of Cunomorus] Not far from Worthyvale in the parish of Minster is an inscribed stone (Latini [h]ic iacit filius Macari = Latin son of Macarus lies here). This stone is popularly known as King Arthur's Grave due to the erroneous identification of Slaughter Bridge with the site of Camlann. =West Cornwall= The Mên Scryfa is also inscribed in Latin, perhaps adding to a much earlier megalith. The Selus Stone (thought to date from the late 5th or early 6th-centuries); it bears the Latin inscription Selus Ic Iacet (Selus lies here). This is thought to refer to Salomon of Cornwall, otherwise known as Saint Selevan. It is preserved at St Just in Penwith Parish Church. In the south aisle of Cuby church is an inscribed stone of the 6th or 7th century (Nonnita Ercilini Rigati [...]tris Fili Ercilini).Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed.. revised by Enid Radcliffe.

Another inscription is in Ogham, perhaps partly in Irish.Pevsner (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 165 The inscriptions are both older than the carving of the upper part into a cross. An inscribed stone, dated from the sixth to eighth centuries, was found imbedded in the walls of the fifteenth-century Cubert parish church. It bears the name of \\"Cenet[o]cus, son of Tege[r]nomalus\\".See the discussion and bibliography in Elisabeth Okasha, Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain (Leicester: University Press, 1993), pp. 97-99. =Gallery= File:Inscribed Stone in South Hill Churchyard - geograph.org.uk - 261575.jpgThe inscribed stone at South Hill File:Worthyvale ogham stone closeup.jpgThe inscribed stone near WorthyvaleInscribed stone on the bank of the River Camel, about 150 metres upstream from Slaughter Bridge, near Camelford (CISP WVALE/1).

This 1.4 metre high monolith is believed to date from the post-Roman period and carries the inscription \\"CORBALENGI IACIT ORDOVS\\". The stone was first noted by Edward Lhywd in 1695 who described it as being in a field near the church. It was originally associated with a cairn of smaller stones beneath which was discovered an urn of ashes and some Roman coins. The final word 'Ordovs' of the inscription (after IACIT, \\"lies\\") is believed to refer to the Ordovices tribe of North Wales, with the suggestion that the stone was carved by local tribes in honour of a member of the Ordovices who had settled in the area. Other readings and interpretations are: \\"Cor Balenci jacit Ordous\\", interpreted as: \\"The Heart of Balengus the Ordovician lies here\\", and \\"CORBALENGI LACIT ORDOVS\\" (\\"Lacit\\" = \\"thrashed\\", rather than \\"Iacit\\" = lies), in which case it would refer to a tribal battle between the Ordovices and the \\"Corbalengi\\". Although the Ordovices are reasonably well known, no other record of a Corbalengi tribe is known. ReferencesFurther reading *R. A. S. Macalister Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum.

He currently serves as the head football coach at Wake Forest University. Clawson previously served as the head football coach at Fordham University from 1999 to 2003, at the University of Richmond from 2004 to 2007, and at Bowling Green State University from 2009 to 2013. Assistant coaching career Clawson got his start in the coaching business as the quarterbacks and running backs coach at the University at Albany in 1989. He was an assistant at Albany again in 1990, this time coaching the defensive secondary. He later went on to coach as an assistant at the University at Buffalo, Lehigh University, and Villanova University. =Tennessee= On January 11, 2008, it was announced that Clawson had been hired as the new offensive coordinator for the Tennessee Volunteers football team by head coach Phillip Fulmer. He replaced David Cutcliffe, who moved to Duke University as head coach. Clawson's stay in Knoxville was short and disappointing. Fulmer was forced to resign as head coach with 3 games left in the 2008 season. Incoming head coach Lane Kiffin relieved Clawson of his duties on December 1, 2008. With Clawson as their offensive coordinator, Tennessee suffered its worst statistical offensive season in over 30 years. Head coaching career=Fordham= Clawson got his first head coaching position at Fordham University. Although his first squad finished with 0 wins in 11 games, he gradually built the Rams into a contender, with his fourth season (2002) being his best. That year, he led them to a Patriot League title, their first conference title since 1988. Winning the conference meant that they were invited to the Division I-AA Playoffs, their first postseason appearance in over 60 years. The Rams beat Northeastern in the First Round before losing to Villanova in the Quarterfinals. His final record as a head coach at Fordham was 29–29.Fordham Coaching Records =Richmond= After Fordham, Clawson became the head coach at the University of Richmond. He served as coach from the 2004 season until the end of the 2007 season, and was the 32nd football coach at the school. His career coaching record at Richmond was 29–20. This ranks him seventh at Richmond in total wins and fifth at Richmond in winning percentage.Richmond Coaching Records At Richmond, he was awarded Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) Coach of the Year twice. Clawson is credited with re-energizing the Richmond program. After going 3–8 in 2004, the Spiders went 9–4 to win the Atlantic 10 Conference and made the playoffs the following year. In 2007, Richmond won their conference again, going 11–3 before eventually losing in the semifinals to eventual champion Appalachian State.ESPN – Clawson leaves Richmond to be Vols offensive coordinator – College Football =Bowling Green= Clawson was hired on as the head football coach at Bowling Green State University on December 12, 2008, just 12 days after being let go by Tennessee. Clawson replaced Gregg Brandon, who after six seasons was let go after a disappointing 6–6 season (including a 1–4 home record) in 2008, a season in which the Falcons were a preseason favorite to win their division. Clawson's era at BGSU started off proving he would be a disciplinarian as he dismissed senior defensive lineman Michael Ream for an undisclosed violation of team rules just months into his tenure. His first game as coach of Bowling Green came on September 3, with a win at home against Sun Belt opponent Troy. He coached his first bowl, the 2009 Humanitarian Bowl, on December 30 in Boise, Idaho. After scoring to make the lead 42–35 over the Vandals, the Vandals took over with 33 seconds left in the game. Idaho then connected on a long pass down inside the 20 and scored a touchdown to make it 42–41 with 00:04 left. The Vandals went for a gutsy two-point conversion and were successful, sealing a 43–42 and ruining Clawson's first bid at a bowl game. In January 2010, rumors began to circulate that East Carolina University was interested in Clawson for their vacant head coaching position, following former ECU coach Skip Holtz' move to South Florida. The rumors intensified following Middle Tennessee State's head coach Rick Stockstill turning down the East Carolina job. However, as of January 20, 2010, Bowling Green has stated that neither athletic director Greg Christopher or Clawson himself have been contacted by East Carolina officials. On November 7, 2012, he led the Falcons to an upset victory against division rival Ohio Bobcats 26–14. The special teams had two blocked punts and forced two bad snaps which one of them rolled into Ohio's end zone to force a safety. The Falcons took advantage of these turnovers and scored 19 points (2 Touchdowns, 1 Field Goal, and 1 Safety). With the win, BG moved into 2nd place in the MAC East Division and kept their hopes alive of winning the MAC East and better yet the entire conference. The 2013 season was Clawson's last and most successful season at Bowling Green. His Falcons posted a 10-3 record, including an 8-1 conference record. On December 6, 2013, Clawson led his team to its first MAC Championship since 1992 with a 47-27 victory over the formerly undefeated and ranked #15 Northern Illinois Huskies in the MAC Championship Game which ruined the Huskies chances of receiving a BCS bowl bid. =Wake Forest= Clawson was named head football coach at Wake Forest University on December 10, 2013.  2016  After posting 3-9 (1-7 ACC) seasons in 2014 and 2015, Clawson's 2016 team started the season by winning five of its first six games including road victories at Duke and Indiana. He led Wake Forest to its first bowl win in eight years, beating then No. 23 Temple 34-26 in the Military Bowl.  2017  Wake Forest concluded the 2017 season with a 55-52 victory over Texas A&M; in a Belk Bowl shootout at Bank of America Stadium. In the highest scoring game in program history, the Demon Deacons (8-5) edged the Aggies (7-6) in a contest that featured over 100 total points and 1,200 yards of total offense. https://godeacs.com/news/2017/12/29/Deacs_Outscore_Aggies_55_52_to_Win_Belk_Bowl.aspx  2018  The Wake Forest Demon Deacons closed out the season with a thrilling 37-34 victory over the Memphis Tigers on Saturday in the 2018 Birmingham Bowl at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. Wake Forest improved to 7-6 for their third straight winning season after seven consecutive losing campaigns. The Deacs, who were led by quarterback Jamie Newman's four total touchdowns, are winners of three bowl games in a row after coming out on top in the Military Bowl (2016) and Belk Bowl (2017). https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2812015-wake-forest-stuns-memphis- in-2018-birmingham-bowl-jamie-newman-totals-4-td  2019  In 2019, the Deacons were led by quarterback Jamie Newman, wide receiver Sage Surratt, linebacker Justin Strnad, and defensive end Boogie Basham. The Deacs started off hot going 5-0 to start the season with wins over in state foe North Carolina and against the Eagles in Boston. They were able to reach AP Top 25 status for the first time in over 10 years. After injuries sustained to veterans Strand, Scotty Washington, Luke Masterson and Sage Surratt, Wake Forest's Orange bowl hopes came to a grinding halt. Wake was able to beat in state foe Duke to become Big Four Champions, meaning wins against all three of the other power five ACC schools, NC State, UNC, and Duke. The season ended in a 27-20 loss in the Pinstripe Bowl against Michigan State, where the Deacs added on to the injured list Nasir Greer, and Rondell Bothroyd. What looked to be a very promising season was tarnished by injuries. Despite the injuries the Deacs still finished 8-5 overall, and finished 3rd in the Atlantic division. He has re-built the Deacons using a philosophy of strong recruiting classes, redshirting as many freshmen as possible, and having a strong strength and conditioning program.

Life  Marx was born in Willesden, London.1911 England Census He went to Repton School, and served as a captain in the Royal Army Service Corps during World War II. As a competition bridge player he was a genuine expert, though not the most pragmatic player. Marx was a modest man and widely loved; indeed, he was one of the few bridge players who never made an enemy. He did not, however, have an equable temperament, and that limited his career as an international player. Marx was a member of the Harrison-Gray team, and played as Gray's partner to win the European Bridge League championship for Great Britain in 1950, but he turned down the chance to play in the inaugural Bermuda Bowl world championship the same year: :\\"A moody man, subject on occasion to sudden fits of apathy ... a nervous, highly-strung man who will, quite suddenly and for no apparent reason, decline to play in a previously arranged match ... He was compelled to refuse the Bermuda Bowl match on grounds of health; and any long marathon taxes him severely.\\"Ramsey, Guy. 1955. Aces All. Museum, London, p. 112. See also pp. 114–15. Despite his temperament, Marx won the Gold Cup in 1937 and 1947, and once more in 1971 after Gray's death.The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge. ACBL, N.Y., various editions and dates.Faulkner, Gerald. \\"John CH 'Jack' Marx 1907-1991\\". Reprinted in Hasenson, Peter (ed) 2004. British Bridge Almanack. 77 Publishing. pp. 207–08. Though he never wrote a bridge book, Jack contributed many articles to bridge magazines, compèred many competitions, and appeared on many bidding panels. He held a variety of administrative positions in bridge organisations, and was a British Bridge League selector for many years.Ramsey 1955. After a stroke in the 1970s he recovered sufficiently to play regularly at the London Duplicate Club, but no longer played in major competitions. In his later years, he was known among players of a younger generation as \\"The Headmaster\\", and to the less reverent young players of a still younger generation as \\"Big Daddy Acol\\".H.W. Kelsey, Slam Bidding, Faber & Faber, London, 1973, , p. 106 Marx died in Haringey, London, in 1991.England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1916-2007 = The Acol system = Marx is often said to be the first player to devise the idea of bidding 2C over 1NT to ask for 4-card major suits, though it is known that Ewart Kempson had used it in the early thirties. Marx worked out his version in 1939, before the Stayman convention was invented, but published it only in 1946, so losing priority to the American Sam Stayman.The Stayman system itself was actually invented by Stayman's partner George Rapée. See \\"Stayman convention\\", The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge. ACBL, NY. Marx also devised a \\"Byzantine 4NT\\" that was more complex but more informative than Blackwood. His most important and lasting achievement was to co-operate with Skid Simon to build up the Acol system of bidding. Others were involved in this – Harrison-Gray, Iain Macleod, Terence Reese, Ben Cohen – but Marx and Simon were at the heart of it. They took the basic approach–forcing ideas of the American Culbertson System and modified it for greater effect when both pairs are bidding competitively.Simon S.J. 1949. Design for Bidding.Cohen, Ben and Terence Reese. 1938. The Acol Two Club: with an introduction by S.J. Simon. Leng, Sheffield. Subsequent editions were issued as The Acol System of contract bridge. Joiner & Steele, London, 1939, 1946, 1949, 1956. The other noteworthy source, according to Marx, was the 1933 writer \\"Criticus\\", whose identity is unknown: :\\"From him Acol took its characteristics of directness and aggression, [and] its reliance on broad principles supplemented by individual judgement rather than on meticulously framed rules of procedure. The composite product that resulted, though a hybrid, was a reasonably self-consistent whole.\\"Marx J. 1952. Contract Bridge Journal, December 1952.'Criticus'. 1933. Contract simplicitas. Herbert Jenkins, London. The identity of Criticus is not known. Marx accepted the version of Acol published by Cohen and Reese, originally in 1938, calling it \\"an able, lucid and faithful presentation of our ideas\\", but was most unhappy about Reese's attempt to update the system in 1952.Reese, Terence. 1952. Modern bidding and the Acol system. Nicholson & Watson, London. :\\"The universal reaction of those who have hitherto played the system ... has been one of bewilderment and dismay. What has happened, for instance, to the old Acol principle of ?\\"Marx J. 1952. Contract Bridge Journal, December 1952. p. 26. Marx objected most strongly to the section on responses to take-out doubles.Reese, Terence. 1952. Modern bidding and the Acol system. Nicholson & Watson, London. \\"Stronger responses to take-out doubles\\", pp. 91–94. Reese's text discusses (p94/5) a sequence after North makes a take-out double of West's one diamond bid and South jumps to two spades. The changes proposed by Reese included: # making the jump response to a take-out double forcing for one round unless the double was shaded, and #a subsequent jump to 4 of the agreed major by doubler would also be forcing, because a raise by doubler from two to three spades would not be passed by South. The effect of making the jump response, and later double raise, forcing would have the effect of stretching the simple suit response to a take-out double from 0–8 points to 0–11 points. The Marx counter to Reese was entirely successful: Reese's idea never became part of Acol.

It is widely believed that Alcide would have won Epsom's 1958 Derby had not probable foul play prevented him from running. A form line through Nagami, who was third in the Derby, gives credibility to the theory that a fully fit Alcide would have won the race. During this period there was an alarming amount of apparent villainy in racing and it seems likely that the broken rib that Alcide sustained in his stable after he had won the Lingfield Derby Trial was deliberate. As a two- year-old Alcide had won the Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury Racecourse and his first success in his second season was in the Chester Vase. He then romped home in the Lingfield Derby Trial and after he had recovered from his injury he won the Great Voltigeur Stakes by 12 lengths and the St. Leger by eight. He was held up in his preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup the following season, but even so was only just beaten by Wallaby II. Six weeks later he won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and retired to stud as the winner of eight races worth £56,042.

Built to meet the requirements of the French Navy, it was ordered into production but no aircraft were delivered before France surrendered to Germany in June 1940. Four remaining incomplete airframes were completed after the end of World War II, serving with the French Navy until 1954. Development The prototype Bréguet 730 in 1938. The French Navy issued a specification for a new long- range flying boat to replace the obsolete 521 Bizerte in May 1935. Bréguet designed a large four engined flying boat to meet the requirement, the Breguet 730, competing against designs by Latécoère (the Latécoère 611), Lioré et Olivier (the LeO H-440) and Potez-CAMS (the Potez-CAMS 141). The first prototype, the Br.730-01, powered by Gnome-Rhône 14N-2 and Gnome-Rhône 14N-3 engines, flew on 4 April 1938 at Le Havre. The N-2 engines were fitted at No.1 and No.3 positions and the N-3s at No.2 and No.4 positions, rotating in opposite directions. It was wrecked, however, on 16 July 1938 when it attempted to land in shallow water. Despite this setback, however, an order for four production aircraft was placed, followed by a contract for unlimited production on the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. This order was cut in early 1940 when it realised that attrition of maritime patrol aircraft was very low. Operational history No production aircraft had been completed when France surrendered on 22 June 1940, when production was suspended. It was restarted by the Vichy government, with the wing of the wrecked prototype being combined with the hull of the first production machine to produce the Br. 730 No.1, which was ready to fly when the German invasion of Vichy France prevented testing. Production of the remaining 11 aircraft continued extremely slowly under German occupation, with eight being destroyed in an Allied air raid on 6 April 1944. The Br.730 No.1 was finally flown for the first time in December 1944, after the Germans retreated from the South of France. This aircraft, named Véga, was delivered to the French Navy, who used it as a long-range transport in April 1945, with a second Br.730 (Sirius) completed in May 1946. The remaining two aircraft (Altair and Bellatrix) were completed with redesigned nose, new floats and more powerful engines, and were designated Br.731. Véga was destroyed in a crash in January 1949, with a second aircraft being destroyed in 1951. The last Br.731 was retired on 20 January 1954. Variants ;Br.730-01 :Prototype.

Jones, \\"Back From the Grave Compilations – Album A & E,\\" New Musical Express, 10/10/12. http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&title;=album_a_e_back_from_the_grave_compilatio&more;=1&c;=1&tb;=1&pb;=1 and released by Crypt Records. The series originally consisted of eight LP records released between 1983 and 1992. Volumes seven and eight were double albums. Starting in 1994, the series was reissued on compact disc. Due to the longer playing times offered by CDs, the first seven volumes were contained on four discs, save for a few tracks that were omitted. And, while all of the songs on the first four CDs are included on first seven vinyl albums, they do not necessarily correspond to the individual LPs bearing their same titles. However, the Volume 8 CD corresponds almost directly its LP double-LP counterpart, but with the addition of four bonus tracks not included on the LP. The eight vinyl albums are titled consecutively \\"Back from the Grave, Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, Volume 4, Volume 5, Volume 6, Volume 7, Volume 8, Volume 9, and Voume 10\\". In similar fashion the five CDs are titled \\"Back from the Grave, Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, Volume 4, Volume 8, and Volumes 9 & 10\\" (which are both included on one CD). There are no volumes 5, 6, or 7 for the CDs. Two separate LPs for Volume 9 and 10 were released in 2015 as well one CD, released the same year, which combines Volumes 9 and 10 onto one double-length disc. Description=The music= Unlike many garage rock compilations, the Back from the Grave series focuses exclusively on the rawer and more aggressive side of the genre. Psychedelic rock is categorically excluded. The series also includes very few pop- or folk-oriented songs. As a result, the albums are primarily populated by louder songs that are characterized by fuzztone guitars, rough vocals, and are clearly influenced by groups such as the Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, the early Kinks, and the Pretty Things. The lyrics and performances tended to focus on anger, lust, and cheating girlfriends, matching the often chaotic music. According to the liner notes, the songs were recorded by American groups, between 1964 and 1967. =Packaging= The series tends to follow the packaging format established by the Nuggets album and the Pebbles series: each volume includes detailed liner notes that include basic information about each song and group, such as origin and recording date. However, the Back from the Grave series' liner notes are very distinct. The information that they present suggests especially thorough research, often including humorous anecdotes about the artists included, information about the circumstances of the recordings, and brief biographical sketches of the groups, in addition to more basic information. The Back from the Grave series was one of the first to actively seek out bands for this sort of information, sometimes even paying royalties to bands included in the compilations.Mike Stax, Back From the Grave Volume 3 review, Ugly Things #4, 1985. Retrieved on 2009.06.18. The liner notes are also notable for their distinctive style – they tend to be highly enthusiastic, full of intentional spelling errors and slang, humorous asides and tangents. They are noticeably opinionated, and often include tongue-in-cheek insults directed at psychedelic, art rock, and commercially-oriented music.Review of Back From the Grave Vol. 1 (CD), Turn Me On, Dead Man . Retrieved on 2011.03.12. As a result, the notes convey a conversational tone. The albums also include photographs of the included groups, and the covers tend to elaborately drawn cartoons by Mort Todd that feature zombies (intended to personify the music found on each volume) emerging from graves and \\"attacking\\" various manifestations of the pop-and-progressive-oriented world that had come to musical prominence by the end of the 1980s, such as disco music and MTV. =Reception= Back from the Grave is considered one of the most important and influential garage rock compilations series ever assembled. Though it takes a much narrower approach to the genre, the tracks compiled on its ten volumes are considered to be of exceptionally high quality throughout.Mike Stax, Back From the Grave Volume 8 review, Ugly Things #15.

Such acts have little or no premeditation.  Routine activity theory  This theory focuses on the right circumstances for a crime of opportunity to occur. The three main components of this theory emphasize an offender, suitable target and the lack of a capable guardian.Looting of a store. There are four main points that influence the likelihood of someone being targeted. * Value * Inertia * Visibility * Access Value refers to how much a particular target is worth to the offender and it differs based on the person. Inertia simply refers to the size and weight of the target, which is why smaller goods are usually stolen versus bigger items. Visibility refers to the target being exposed to the offender, and thus making the target of value known to the offender. Access refers to how easily offenders can get to a target and what obstacles might impede them.  Crime Pattern theory  This theory emphasizes the environment that these crimes occur in. There are three major components of this theory. * Nodes * Paths * Edges Nodes refers to the places people travel to and from and the crime generated in specific areas, for example bars, malls, parks, where people work, and the neighborhoods in which people live. Paths refers to the paths between nodes or areas that victims and offenders frequent, crime is frequently linked to flows of people among paths such as commuter times, establishment's closing times, and school being out for the day. Edges are the outer boundaries of certain areas, where outsiders of a neighborhood usually commit crimes. Vehicle with broken window.  Rational Choice perspective  This theory focuses on the offender's ability to make choices, based on the assumption that the offenders actions are purposeful. Offenders consider the benefits and risks and make choices based on the opportunities to commit a crime.  Violent Crimes  Some violent crimes can also be considered a crime of opportunity. Variables such as whether or not female or middle-aged people are present can affect an individual's response to a perceived insult. Other variables like group size and size of the individual affect whether or not an offender may initiate a violent act. Larger groups will have the tendency to attack smaller groups and larger individuals will be more likely to attack smaller ones. Reducing opportunities and prevention: In order to reduce these types of crimes minimizing opportunities is the most common idea. Several methods are used to reduce opportunity: * problem-oriented policing * defensible space architecture * situational crime prevention All of these methods are used to reduce opportunities for specific targets.

Their fame began with Pierre, and was sustained by his son, Pierre- Imbert, and by his nephew, Claude. Pierre Drevet Pierre Drevet, the Elder (1663-1738) was born at Loire in the Lyonnais, the son of Estienne Drevet, and began his studies with Germain Audran in Lyons, continuing them with Gérard Audran in Paris. His progress was rapid, and in 1696 he was made court engraver. In 1707 he was admitted to membership in the Académie des Beaux- Arts, his reception picture being an engraving of Robert de Cotte. Hyacinthe Rigaud's portraits were in high favour at the end of the seventeenth century and Drevet was the first to encounter the difficulties of translating into black and white the natural appearance of texture and materials in the latter's oil paintings. Always engraving after oil paintings, Drevet was at times uneven, but this was arguably because the originals were uneven. His engravings were mainly the portraits of distinguished people. Among his many plates are a portrait of Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1700); portraits of Louis XIV and Louis XV, both after Rigaud; a Crucifixion, after Coypel, and a portrait of Charles II of England. During the last years of his life Drevet worked with his son and they produced plates together. He died in Paris. Pierre-Imbert Drevet Claude le Blanc, by the Younger Pierre Pierre-Imbert Drevet (22 June 1697 - 27 April 1739), called the Younger Pierre, was born and died in Paris. His father, the elder Drevet, instructed him, and he was engraving at the age of thirteen. At first he engraved after Charles Lebrun, but he soon developed a style of his own. He was his father's constant companion. In 1723 Pierre- Imbert finished his portrait of Bossuet after Rigaud. In 1724 the portrait of Cardinal Dubois was engraved; in 1730, a plate of Adrienne Lecouvreur. For his engraving of Samuel Bernard, Rigaud himself made the drawing, an unusual event in eighteenth-century engraving. Besides his portraits, Pierre-Imbert produced many religious and historical plates, chiefly of Coypel. A sunstroke (1726) resulted in intermittent mental disability, which continued for thirteen years until his death. He kept on engraving until the end. He was a member of the Académie de Peinture and the king assigned him apartments in the Louvre. Among his pupils were artists François and Jacques Chéreau and Simon Vallée. His principal works were: Presentation of the Virgin, after Le Brun; Presentation in the Temple, after L. Boullogne; portraits of the Archbishop of Cambrai (after Joseph Vivien); and René Pucelle, his last work, after Rigaud. Claude Drevet A French engraver, b. Lyons, 1705; d. in Paris, 1782. He was a nephew and pupil of Pierre the Elder and at first followed the traditions of the two Pierres, forming about him a coterie of engravers who endeavoured to keep alive their traditions. When Pierre-Imbert died, his rooms in the Louvre were given to Claude, who reportedly proceeded to squander nearly all the money left him by his uncle and his cousin. He engraved portraits of Henri Oswald, Cardinal d'Auvergne, after Rigaud, and of Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc, Archbishop of Paris, also after Rigaud.

In a career which lasted from the autumn of 1947 until September 1949 he ran seventeen times and won eleven races. He was the second best British three-year-old of his generation, when he finished second to Black Tarquin in the St. Leger Stakes. He was undefeated in his remaining seven races, defeating Black Tarquin in the 1949 Ascot Gold Cup and going on to win the Stayers' Triple Crown. After his retirement from racing he became the Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland in 1955, despite having low fertility and a relatively short career at stud. Background Alycidon was a chesnut horse bred by his owner the 17th Earl of Derby. He was sired by the outstanding racehorse and useful sire, Donatello II out of the 1,000 Guineas runner-up Aurora, a daughter of Hyperion. In addition to Alycidon, Aurora also produced Acropolis who ran third in The Derby, Agricola (Newmarket Stakes, leading sire in New Zealand), Borealis (sire of stakes winners) and others.

He made only two appearances, finishing unplaced in minor races over seven furlongs. =1948: three-year-old season= Lord Derby died in February 1948 and the ownership of Alycidon passed to his grandson Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby. As the family was in mourning, Alycidon was officially registered as being owned by Brigadier Fairfax-Ross for the early part of the season. On Alycidon's three-year-old debut he was ridden by Eph Smith in the Christopher Wren takes at Hurst Park Racecourse. The colt whipped around at the start (starting stalls were not used in Britain until 1965) and took no part in the race. After this display, Alycidon always raced in blinkers, although there appeared to be nothing irresolute about his racing. Two weeks after his \\"run\\" at Hurst Park, Alycidon recorded his first victory in the one mile Classic Trial Stakes at Thirsk Racecourse in which he was ridden by a stable lad named Shaw. In May he finished third in the Chester Vase and then won the Royal Standard Stakes at Manchester Racecourse. Alycidon was regarded as a potential Derby contender, but as Lord Derby had two other colts in the race he was re-routed to Royal Ascot for the King Edward VII Stakes. He finished third to Vic Day, being apparently unsuited by the tactics employed by his jockey T. Lowrey, who restrained the colt before attempting to produce him with a late burst of speed. More positive tactics were used in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket in July and he won decisively from the 1947 St. Leger winner Sayajirao. Later in July he won the St George Stakes at Liverpool over thirteen furlongs, partnered for the first time by Doug Smith who rode him in all his remaining race. In the St. Leger on 11 September, Alycidon started at odds of 20/1 in a field of fourteen runners in front of a crowd estimated at 500,000 which included the King and Queen. Smith attempted to make all the running on Alycidon, but was caught inside the final quarter mile and beaten one and a half lengths by the American-bred Black Tarquin. Following his St Leger run, Alycidon returned to action at Newmarket where he won the Jockey Club Cup. On his final race of the year he was sent to Ascot for the two-mile King George VI Stakes, an important international event which attracted three French challengers. Alycidon tracked his pacemaker Benny Lynch, before taking the lead half a mile from the finish and drawing clear to win by five lengths. =1949 four-year-old season= As a four-year-old Alycidon was aimed at the Ascot Gold Cup, in which he was scheduled for a highly anticipated rematch with Black Tarquin. On his debut he won the Ormonde Stakes by a length from Benny Lynch and then was more impressive when winning the Corporation Stakes at Doncaster by twelve lengths. Black Tarquin also won his prep races and was made 10/11 favourite for the Gold Cup ahead of Alycidon on 5/4. Alycidon was assisted by two pacemakers to ensure a true test of stamina and took the lead five furlongs from the finish. In the straight, Black Tarquin moved up to challenge and drew level a furlong from the finish, but Alycidon pulled away again in the closing stages to win by five lengths. His victory was notable as it came after a period in which the race had been dominated by foreign-bred horses. In July he appeared to be unsuited by the firm ground, but still won the Goodwood Cup by two lengths from Riding Mill. He completed his career with an eight length success in the Doncaster Cup in September. By winning the Ascot, Goodwood and Doncaster Cups he completed the Stayers' Triple Crown, a feat that had not been achieved by any horse since Isonomy in 1879 and was not repeated until Le Moss won all three races in 1980. Alycidon retired with a tally of 11 wins worth £37,206 in prize money (he set a record for prize-money won by a non-Classic winner). Stud record Alycidon was retired to stud in 1950 after being syndicated with a value of £120,000. His progeny enabled him to be top stallion in 1955 and he was placed in the top five on the sires list on five other occasions. He sired 19 stakeswinners for 34 stakeswins including the fine stayer Grey of Falloden (9 wins and £25,098) and other high-class fillies such as The Oaks winners Homeward Bound (£42,243) and Meld (British Fillies Triple Crown); Almeria plus these horses: *Alcide, won St Leger Stakes, King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Stakes *Alcimedes, Great Jubilee Handicap; a successful sire in New Zealand *Almeria, won Yorkshire Oaks *Gaul, won King Edward VII Stakes etc. *Gloria Nicky, won Cheveley Park Stakes, dam of Never Too Late *Khalekan, (stakeswinner and sire in Australia) *Twilight Alley, won Ascot Gold Cup After a successful early stud career, Alycidon began to suffer from low fertility and by 1962 he was getting fewer than one in three of his mares in foal. He was retired from stud duty in 1963 and was euthanized later that year. Assessment and honours Timeform gave Alycidon a rating of 138, placing him among the top twenty horses of the last sixty years. In 1949 he was rated equal with the three-year-old Abernant as the best horse of the year. Timeform described Alycidon as being \\"virtually unbeatable over extreme distances\\". In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Alycidon the twentieth best horse of the 20th century trained in Britain and Ireland, and placed him forty-eighth in their global ranking. They described him as \\"the best specialist stayer of the century\\". The Alycidon Stakes was named in honour of Alycidon in 1979, and its title was changed to the \\"Alycidon Glorious Stakes\\" in 1987, before this race was later known as the Glorious Stakes. Following the London & North Eastern Railway tradition of naming locomotives after winning racehorses, British Railways \\"Deltic\\" Diesel locomotive no. D9009 (later 55009) was named after the horse on 21 July 1961, remained in service until 2 January 1982, and is today preserved.

As a village it is politically independent of its parish. The agricultural zones of the village are separated by the main river \\"Rio Grande\\", and are famous for their fertility, because the soil comes from the bed of the river, receiving new layers of sand and organic matter every year. History Contrary to what many people think, the Nadrupe is not a recent village. Its origins go back to the 12th century, when Lourinhã was donated to his first owner D. Jordan, with French origins. The village appears first referenced in the letter given to charter Lourinhã in 1160, so that the village had same rights of the county seat. Later, the village appears in another document, when D. John III orders the first general census of the Portuguese population, in 1527. In the 20th century, the village was invaded by a surge of emigration. The flow of immigrants towards France was so great that Nadrupenses are now known as \\"The French\\". Heritage= Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Graça = Built in 1869 by the vote of the inhabitants of the village to Our Lady for this Tuesday rid of the epidemic of yellow fever. It is a very simple construction. The facade of beak, classic model, presents a window over the main door. The bell tower, on the left, has a door for the churchyard. In the works of 1989, were the half-walls of the ship and chapel lined with marble. In 2005 the church suffered a new restoration and the inclusion of a new chamber for burial ceremonies of the village. =Lavadouros= The tanks that serve this “lavadouro” (Where the woman Wash the clothes by hand) warrants were built by a benefactor of the village, Mr. Jose da Silva Junior who wanted allow better access to drinking water. For the first time, the water was seen as a common good in the villagers. Currently, there is a draft recovery of the space for leisure activities . The project is to keep the trace of the tanks and create a garden environment with multiple springs. =Fonte dos Poçinhos= The water of this spring was widely used for domestic lids. But with the arrival of the channelled water, fell into disuse. There is now a plan for the creation of an area of leisure. =Fonte de Nossa Senhora da Graça= This is by far the best-known spring of the village. It is associated with the myth that the Nossa Senhora da Graça (Our Lady of Grace) spared the Nadrupe of Yellow Fever, using the curative powers of its waters. =CruzeiroLegend= The legend says that during the Peninsular War, a French general named Nadrupe fell in love by the village, and when the French were expelled by the Portuguese-British troops, he refused to go, staying in the village and Being killed by them. Later, the population, gave his name to the village, in his honor. (Note that the village was already referred in the 12th century as Nadrupe, and the French invasions occurred in the 18th century). Climate Nadrupe, as the entire county of Lourinhã, is characterized by high humidity (about 85%) due to the proximity of the sea, and high rainfall, which causes every year transhipment river. The temperatures vary little, remaining between 18 and 25 degrees. However, the past two years there have been negative temperatures and the occurrence of snow in the winter, and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius in summer. Winds about 80 km / h are also very common. Economy Its small size does not allow for a variety of activities. However, there are the three economic sectors in the village (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary). Most inhabitants of Nadrupe is employed in the agricultural sector, dealing in most cases with fruit and vegetables. As part of the West region, the fruit \\"queen\\" is a Pera Rocha, almost exclusively exported to the United Kingdom. Related to agriculture are also the industries of canning and processing. As are examples of Louribatata and the Piklesfactory. However, the bakerie industry is also relevant. The tertiary sector is growing increasingly, are already based in the village several companies for the construction and transport. Culture Currently, all cultural initiatives undertaken in Nadrupe included the direction of ADRCN (Sport Recreation and Cultural Association of Nadrupe), created by the residents for these and other purposes. The event of greater relevance of the village is the August festival (held on the first Sunday of month, in honor of Our Lady of Grace). Linked to this festival, is also the tradition of the arc, which is the drafting of an arc with around 20m. This arc is decorated with murta Myrtus, lights and flowers and has always religious grounds. The whole arc is rebuilt every year. Every year, on May 13 (day of Our Lady of Fatima), is held in the village the contest of gardens, who dispute among themselves the title of most beautiful garden of the village. They are common in the gardens Sardinheiras and seasonal plants such as lilies (Lilium) and the Jacintos (Hyacinthus). It is also the day which makes the Christian tradition of the procession of candles. =Gastronomy= Entries: Stew of Gizzard; Olives Stuffed with tomato; Soups: Cream of seafood soup; Caldo verde; (A green broth soup made of potato will, strips of Portuguese cabbage and Slices of Portuguese sausage) The Stone Soup; Dishes: Stew of eels; Caldeirada à Nadrupe; (Stew with various kinds of fish, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, etc.) Cod of Dolores; (Secret recipe) Papas de Sarrabulho; (Stew of potatoes, heart, lungs and meat of the pig with sauce of blood) Desserts: Arrufada of coconut and chocolate; (Arrufada is a type of sweet bread) Marble cake; Soaked in orange; After the meal a Bica is usual drunk. It is also customary to drink a tea (typically Lemon or Erva Cidreira, grown in the gardens of the houses).

It was fought in January 1811 on the banks of the Calderón River east of Guadalajara in present-day Zapotlanejo, Jalisco. Almost 100,000 Mexican revolutionists contributed to the attack, commanded by Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama and Mariano Abasolo. The Royalist forces of New Spain, made up of between 5,000 and 8,000 professional soldiers, and fighting for the King of Spain, were led by Félix María Calleja del Rey, a Spanish military officer and (later) viceroy of New Spain. He was later given the title of conde de Calderón for the Spanish victory. \\"Calleja del Rey, Félix María,\\" Enciclopedia de México, v. 2. Mexico City: 1996, . The battle owes its name to the adjoining bridge, and the combatants' objective. The Battle of Calderón Bridge was the last militant episode of the first stage of the War of Independence. Overview Following Hidalgo's failed attempt to take Mexico City in October 1810, insurgent troops retreated toward Guanajuato, pursued by Royalist forces led by General Félix María Calleja. Unable to defend positions at Aculco, where Calleja's army intercepted the insurgents, Hidalgo decided to continue his army's retreat towards Guadalajara. The insurgent army, numbering approximately 100,000, took up a defensive position at the Bridge of Calderón, where the road from Guanajuato to Guadalajara crossed the Calderón River. Ignacio Allende commanded the troops at the position. Among the insurgent forces were 20,000 light cavalry, 3,000 armed with rifles, 60,000 armed with spears, slings, and arrows. Calleja's forces, which numbered between 5,000 and 8,000 but were better equipped than the insurgent forces, arrived at the Bridge on 16 January. As the battle ensued, Royalist artillery struck an insurgent ammunitions wagon, which caused it to explode. The explosion dispersed much of the insurgent force, giving victory to the much smaller but better disciplined and equipped Royalist forces. Insurgent forces fled northwards after losing the battle with Royalist troops following them. The insurgents' defeat in this battle effectively was a turning point in the War of Independence and resulted in a ten-year delay before insurgent victory and independence could be achieved. Aftermath Royal Army The battle marked the end of the first stage of the war and was noted for the fact that the insurgents fought with more passion than strategy. The insurgent forces were devastated and the events that followed would lead up to the capture and ultimately the executions of Hidalgo, Allende, Aldama and Jiménez. The insurgents fled north where, near Zacatecas, Hidalgo was divested of his military command in favour of Allende. In March they received an invitation by the New Leonese general Ignacio Elizondo to meet at the Wells of Baján (Norias de Baján) in Coahuila, hoping they would be able to purchase armaments in the United States. The first contingent arrived on 21 March with Allende, Aldama, Jiménez and Indalecio, son of Allende. They were welcomed and in an act of ambush, immediately taken prisoner. When the second contingent arrived with Abasolo, they were also captured and taken prisoner. Hidalgo ultimately arrived on horse and was personally apprehended by Elizondo. The prisoners were taken to Chihuahua where they were tried. Allende, Aldama and Jiménez were shot on 26 June, Hidalgo on 30 July and Abasolo was sentenced to life in prison in Cádiz, Spain, where he died in 1816. Calderón Bridge was declared a Mexican historical monument in 1932.

In spite of a tendency to make mistakes, Captain Christy was an outstanding hurdler and one of the best steeplechasers of all-time. His most outstanding performance was his 30-length win over Bula and other top horses in the 1975 King George VI Chase at Kempton Park; this is regarded as one of the greatest ever steeplechasing performances. Gerry Newman rode him in that race, but for most of his other successes his jockeys were Bobby BeasleyWhen Bobby Met Christy: The Story of Bobby Beasley. Declan Colley (2010). The Collins Press and Bobby Coonan.https://www.independent.ie/sport/horse-racing/sad-death-of- champion-bobby-coonan-26268577.html Throughout his career, Captain Christy was trained by Pat Taaffe, and that victory over Bula was the second time he had beaten the dual Champion Hurdle winner; he had also outgalloped him when winning the 1972 Irish Sweeps Hurdle when the race was a championship (non- handicap) event. He finished third in that year's Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham before winning the Scottish equivalent. Captain Christy's most important success came in the 1974 Cheltenham Gold Cup when, as a novice ridden by Bobby Beasley, he beat the previous year's winner, The Dikler, by 5 lengths despite making a mistake at the last fence. Later that year he won his first King George VI Chase when, ridden by Bobby Coonan, he easily beat the outstanding 3-mile chaser, Pendil, who had won the race in 1972 and 1973. In 1975 Captain Christy finished a close second under top-weight in the Whitbread Gold Cup giving over two stones in weight to the winner, April the Seventh. He also went beyond the British Isles including finishing runner-up in the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris and fourth in the Colonial Cup in the USA. Captain Christy developed a leg problem after his 1975 King George VI Chase win which effectively ended his career while still a relatively young horse.

The bulk of his art and literary works were about Texas, north- central Mexico, and his World War II experience in the South Pacific and Asia. Two of his most popular novels, The Brave Bulls and The Wonderful Country, are widely considered to be classics of southwestern American literature. Early life and education Lea was born on July 11, 1907 in El Paso, Texas, to Thomas Calloway Lea Jr. and Zola May (née Utt). From 1915 to 1917, his father was mayor of El Paso. As mayor, his father made a public declaration that he would arrest Pancho Villa if he dared enter El Paso, after on March 9, 1916 when Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico. Villa then responded by offering a thousand pesos gold bounty on Lea. For six months Tom and his brother Joe had to have a police escort to and from school, and there was a 24-hour guard on the house.Antone, Evan Haywood. – Lea, Thomas Calloway Jr. – Handbook of Texas. – Texas State Historical Association. – Retrieved: 2019-05-08Lea, – Tom Lea, An Oral History, – p.7.

Norton, a Chicago muralist, from 1927 to 1932.MS 476: Tom Lea papers. – University Library. – University of Texas at El Paso. – Retrieved: 2008-07-04 In 1927, he wed Nancy June Taylor, a fellow art student. In 1930 Norton suggested that Tom take an art tour of Europe to study the masters. He and Nancy went to Paris and saw an exhibit of Eugène Delacroix at the Louvre, and Delacroix was his \\"favorite\\". Next they traveled to Florence, Orvieto, Rome, Capri. Then, after a four-month tour, it was back to Le Havre to catch the SS Ile de France.Lea, – Tom Lea, An Oral History, – p.34–38. After the tour of Italy they moved to Santa Fe to be with other artists and be in the Southwest. When Nancy became ill (a botched appendectomy) they moved to El Paso, and Lea found work from the Federal Art Project (FAP) for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which during the Great Depression hired artists, and in Lea's case to paint murals in government buildings.J. Tillapaugh, University of Texas of the Permian Basin, \\"The Popular Culture Heritage of New Deal Muralists Peter Hurd and Tom Lea in West Texas\\", West Texas Historical Association, annual meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, February 27, 2010  Career  Lea won the United States Department of the Treasury competition for a mural commission in the United State Post Office Department Building (now the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building) in Washington, D.C., called The Nesters. His other murals included the post offices in Odessa, Texas (Stampede), Pleasant Hill, Missouri (Back Home, April 1865), and Seymour, Texas (Comanches). In 1936, his wife (in April), grandmother (in June), and his mother (in December), all died in that year.Lea, – Tom Lea, An Oral History, – p.51. In 1937 he started doing illustration work, and this led to a partnership with a friend of his father, author J. Frank Dobie. Dobie wrote about the rough life of settling the Texas frontier and Lea's illustrations are mostly of cowboys and the wild Texas landscapes. While painting a mural in El Paso Federal Courthouse (Pass of the North), he met and married his second wife, Sarah Catherine Beane (née Dighton), in July 1938. Sarah had come from Monticello, Illinois, to El Paso to visit friends. Sarah had a son, James (Jim), from a previous marriage whom Lea adopted. While painting his courthouse mural, Lea also met artist José Cisneros and they were able to connect as friends and business contacts. That same year his started his lifelong partnership with Carl Hertzog (Jean Carl Hertzog Sr.), an El Paso book designer and typographer. 1937–1938 would prove to be the antithesis of 1936, providing Lea with three lifelong partners and friends.Lea, – Tom Lea, An Oral History, – p.52,57,61. In 1940 he applied for and won Rosenwald Fellowship, but by the end of the summer of 1941, he got a telegram from LIFE asking him to go to sea with the United States Navy on a North Atlantic Patrol. In the fall of 1941, he decided to paint for LIFE as war artist and correspondent aboard a destroyer.Lea, – Tom Lea, A Picture Gallery, – p.45-46. He traveled all over the world with the United States military from 1941 to 1945. This included: China, Great Britain, Italy, India, North Africa, North Atlantic, the Middle East, and the Western Pacific. He went on deployment with the aircraft carrier USS Hornet in the Pacific Ocean in 1942, where he met the famous Army Air Corps pilot Jimmy Doolittle. Lea was on board the Hornet (September 15, 1942) when the USS Wasp was sunk by torpedoes from a Japanese submarine.Lea, – Tom Lea, A Picture Gallery, – p.64. He painted several pictures of the sinking of the Wasp. In 1943, during his visit to China, he met Theodore H. White, and he painted the portraits of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Soong Mei-ling; the head of the \\"Flying Tigers\\", and General Claire Lee Chennault. But, it was his time in the western Pacific in 1944 as a combat correspondent with the United States 1st Marine Division during the invasion of the tiny island of Peleliu that he would really make a name for himself among the readers of LIFE. \\"My work there consisted of trying to keep from getting killed and trying to memorize what I saw and felt,\\" Lea says.Steinberg, Rafael. – \\"World War II: Island Fighting\\". – Alexandria, Virginia: Time-Life Inc. – 1998. His vivid, realistic, images of the beach landing, and Battle of Peleliu, would impact both readers and himself. The Price and That 2,000 Yard Stare would become among his most famous works. (1,794 Americans died in a two-month period in what many call the war's most controversial battle, due to its questionable strategic value and high death toll.Moody, Sid. – \\"1,794 Americans Died For An Unneeded Pacific Island\\". – Associated Press. – (c/o Seattle Times). – September 11, 1994. – Retrieved: 2008-07-04Zeiler, Thomas W., (2004). – Unconditional Defeat: Japan, America, And The End of World War II. – Wilmington, Delaware: Scholarly Resources, Inc. – p.105. ) In 1947 Lea finished a graphite sketch on kraft paper of his wife called Study for Sarah in the Summertime. He had started the sketch two years earlier, about six months after he got home from the war. The life size work (71\\" × 30¼\\") was based on a photograph, taken of Sarah in the backyard of their home at 1520 Raynolds Boulevard in El Paso, that he had carried in his wallet throughout the war. An oil painting, Sarah in the Summertime (67\\" × 32\\"), was then done from the sketch. He spent longer on this combined work than any other painting.Lea, – Tom Lea, An Oral History, – p.97. After finishing his last novel, The Hands of Cantu (an account of horse training in 16th-century Nueva Vizcaya) in 1964, Lea traveled to Boston to meet with his publishers, Little, Brown and Company. He told them that he wasn't interested in another novel, so they suggested a book about his pictures. This 1968 work, A Picture Gallery, was his \\"autobiography\\", writing of why and when he did his paintings. Working on A Picture Gallery would lead him to once again focus on painting and turn away from working on literature.Lea, – Tom Lea, An Oral History, – pp.121–122.

History Held in Farnham, Surrey, the first Beerex took place in 1977, three years after CAMRA had been established, as a means of promoting traditional cask- conditioned beers from British breweries in line with CAMRA's aims, whilst raising money for charity.Lions Club Minutes, CAMRA Surrey/Hants Borders records The concept was the idea of two CAMRA members who were also members of the Farnham Lions Club. These two, Paul Blowfield and Ralph Carter, were inspired by CAMRA's Covent Garden Beer Festival (London) of 1975. They took the idea to their two organisations, who then joined with the Farnham Maltings Association to organise the first event, which pre-dated the first CAMRA Great British Beer Festival by some months.CAMRA web page The event attracted more attendees than anticipated necessitating additional supplies of beer and glasses. Originally planned as a one-off event, it has taken place every year since at the Farnham Maltings in late April or early May, still organised by the same three organisations. The 2018 event will be the 42nd and once again take place at the Farnham Maltings April 12–14.

Admission is by advance ticket only, which generally sell- out within hours of release, some months before the event.Farnham Herald reports, 1978 to 2017 The event has raised in excess of £900,000 for mainly local charities and good causes through the Lions Club of Farnham, and has been instrumental in raising awareness of traditional beers in the Farnham area which can now boast a number of independent breweries including the longer-established Hogs Back Brewery. Special half-pint glasses have been issued each year, and limited edition pint glasses for the 10th and 21st Exhibitions; these are very collectable and some reach high values.

They were first discovered in 1962, considerably after the original bacteriocins, the colicins, which were discovered in 1925. Like other bacteriocins, vibriocins are protein toxins. They can kill bacteria beyond the genus Vibrio, including other proteobacteria. They have been used for abortive classification schemes of the vibrio, particularly to type various kinds of cholera, against which they were thought to have potential as antibiotics. Their mode of action, genetics and regulation have all been studied, for at least one example. In all likelihood, however, they are as common and as diverse as the colicins, making it very unlikely that these initial experiments have fully explored the range of mechanisms and forms that the vibriocins take. In the 1970s, they were investigated, along with some colicins, as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The mode of action appears to be nuclease activity resulting in the induction of apoptosis. The research itself was the result of observing unexpected interactions between the vibriocins and eukaryotic cells.

Jerusalem Economic Corporation - Company's Profile At the time the location was at the edge of the built up area of the city, but over the years several major roads were built and accessibility to the site was improved; including: the Begin Expressway to the west of the park and Route 9 north of the park. One of the first tenants in the park was Luz IndustriesNew Headquarters for Luz Industries, Jerusalem an early pioneer of Solar thermal energy, which in the 1980s built the world's largest solar energy generating facility SEGS in the Mojave Desert.Solar Energy in Israel The first major international corporation to establish a base at Har Hotzvim was Intel, which opened its Fab 8 semiconductor manufacturing plant in 1985.Intel Jerusalem profile In the early 1990s, as Jerusalem was awarded the status of a preferred development zone for the high-tech industry, an expansion plan was initiated by the Jerusalem Development Authority. The expansion took place in three stage (known as Har Hotzvim stage b, c and d) and by the mid 2000s most of the available plots have been developed. In 2005, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, at a cost of US$80 million. It initially produced about 4 billion tablets a year, rising to 8 billion a year when the second phase of building was completed. In 2008 Intel closed its aging Fab 8 chip plant and started converting the facility to a die preparation plant. The plant was inaugurated in November 2009; the company planned to operate it on Saturdays in accordance with its business needs, requiring continuous operation of the production line. This angered the Haredi Jewish community living in nearby religious neighborhoods, who strictly observe the Sabbath laws. For several weeks they gathered every Saturday outside the building; some threw rocks at the building and the police. Eventually representatives of the Haredi community reached an agreement with Intel to keep the plant open on Saturdays, but allow only non- Jews to work. In July 2011 Haredi United Torah Judaism party in the Jerusalem city council proposed to clear the area for new residential development for their community, an offer that was firmly rejected by Jerusalem's mayor Nir Barkat In 2015 the Bank of Israel moved its headquarters and activity to the park, due to renovations in its facility in Givat Ram. Towards the end of 2018 several of the bank's divisions returned to the Givat Ram facility. In the northern edge of the park are located Jerusalem's veterinarian services.

Biography Cassetta was born in Rome, and received the Sacrament of Confirmation on 1 September 1848. He studied at the Pontifical Roman Seminary, where he obtained his doctorates in theology (10 September 1863) and in canon and civil law (24 August 1866). Cassetta was ordained to the priesthood on 10 June 1865, and later raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness. He was made referendary prelate of the Apostolic Signatura on 23 June 1878, auditor of the Vicar General of Rome on 3 April 1884, and later counselor of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith and of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office. He became a canon of the chapter of the Liberian Basilica on 23 November 1884. On 2 December 1884, Cassetta was appointed Titular Bishop of Amathus in Palaestina by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 21 December, from Cardinal Lucido Parocchi, with Archbishop Pierre Dufal, CSC, and Bishop Guillaume-Marie Sourrieu serving as co-consecrators, in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi.

A wheel route is a pattern run by a receiver or running back in American football. If a receiver runs it, they will immediately run a quick out pattern, then proceed to turn upfield in a curved pattern. Typically this route is run by an inside receiver, with the number one receiver heading inside to exploit coverage in the defense. When run from the running back position the player will run towards the sideline while looking back at the quarterback as if about to receive a pass on a flare route. The running back will then turn upfield at the sideline and run straight down the field. This route is useful when run from the wide receiver position because the defensive back will expect the ball to be thrown as the receiver makes his first turn and will bite (go for the fake) underneath the receiver (run between the quarterback and the receiver to try to prevent, block, or intercept the pass) to defend the pass and be unable to recover as the receiver turns upfield. In this respect the route is very similar to an Out-and-Up or Chair route, but without the vertical release that the Out-and-Up utilizes. The route is useful when run from the running back position because the defender will assume the ball is going to be thrown to the running back behind the line of scrimmage (the quarterback can use a pump fake to further \\"sell\\" this), and will bite underneath the running back only to have the running back turn upfield.

Work for Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya Monitor was first hired by the Muammar Gaddafi-led Libyan government in 2005 to assess the state of Libya’s economy, develop plans for economic modernization and reform of the banking system, and train leaders from different sectors of society. The work did not involve any wider political reforms in the North African nation. According to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Libya's intelligence chief which was subsequently obtained by the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition and posted on the internet in 2009, Monitor entered into further contracts with the Libyan regime in 2006 which were worth at least $3m (£1.8m) per year plus expenses. According to the memo these contracts were for a campaign to \\"enhance international understanding and appreciation of Libya... emphasize the emergence of the new Libya... [and] introduce Muammar Gaddafi as a thinker and intellectual.\\" In connection with these contracts Monitor engaged and flew to Libya several leading Western academics, including Anthony Giddens of the London School of Economics (LSE), Joseph Nye of Harvard’s Kennedy School, Benjamin Barber of Rutgers University and Michael Porter. Monitor also provided research support for a doctoral thesis which Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, submitted to the LSE. During this period Monitor also proposed a separate project to write a book for a fee of $2.45 million, to be published in Gaddafi's name and which would \\"allow the reader to hear Gaddafi elaborate, in his own words and in conversation with renowned international experts, his core ideas on individual freedom, direct democracy vs. representative democracy, [and] the role of state and religion\\". The book was never completed and Monitor later stated that the project had been a \\"serious mistake on our part\\". Monitor's work for the Libyan government, and its hiring of academics in connection with it, became the subject of increasing scrutiny and controversy after Gaddafi’s forces attacked anti-government protesters in February 2011. Questions arose about whether Monitor should have registered as a foreign lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in connection with its work in Libya. During this time details also came to public notice of the role which Monitor had played in the writing of Saif Gaddafi's thesis submitted to the LSE. This, combined with public exposure of wider connections between the LSE and Libya, resulted in the resignation of its director, Howard Davies. In March 2011, Monitor announced that it had launched an internal investigation into its work for the Libyan government. In May 2011, Monitor announced it would register some of its past work in Libya with the U.S. Department of Justice in accordance with FARA. Around the same time, Mark Fuller, Monitor Group's founder, chairman, and CEO, announced his resignation, which, according to Monitor executives, had been planned for several months. The company said it would also register for work with Jordan.

A film adaptation was released in February 2010. Lehane has said he sought to write a novel that would be an homage to Gothic settings, B movies, and pulp. He described the novel as a hybrid of the works of the Brontë sisters and the 1956 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers. His intent was to write the main characters in a position where they would lack 20th century resources such as radio communications. He also structured the book to be more taut than his previous book, Mystic River. Lehane was inspired by the hospital and grounds on Long Island in Boston Harbor for the model of the hospital and island. Lehane had visited it in the Blizzard of 1978 as a child with his uncle and family.Symkus, Ed, \\"Real local flavor on display in 'Shutter Island'\\", The Patriot Ledger, Feb. 19, 2010  Plot  In 1954, widower U.S. Marshal Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, go on a ferry boat to Shutter Island, the home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane, to investigate the disappearance of a patient, Rachel Solando (who was incarcerated for drowning her three children). Despite being kept in a locked cell under constant supervision, she has escaped the hospital and the desolate island. In Rachel's room, Teddy and Chuck discover a code that Teddy breaks. He tells Chuck that he believes the code points to a 67th patient, when records show only 66. Teddy also reveals that he wants to avenge the death of his wife Dolores, who was murdered two years prior by a man called Andrew Laeddis, whom he believes is an inmate in Ashecliffe Hospital. The novel is interspersed with graphic descriptions of World War II and Dachau, which Teddy helped to liberate. After Hurricane Carol hits the island, Teddy and Chuck investigate Ward C, where Teddy believes government experiments with psychotropic drugs are being conducted. While separated from Chuck for a short while in Ward C, Teddy meets a patient called George Noyce, who tells him that everything is an elaborate game designed for him, and that Chuck is not to be trusted. As Teddy and Chuck return to the main hospital area, they are separated. Teddy discovers a woman (in a sea cave he tried to take refuge in) who says she is the real Rachel Solando. She tells him she was actually a psychiatrist at Ashecliffe, and when she discovered the illegal experiments being run by them, she was incarcerated as a patient. She escaped and has been hiding in different places on the island. She warns him about the other residents of the island, telling him to take care with the food, medication and cigarettes, which have been laced with psychotropic drugs. When Teddy returns to the hospital, he can't find Chuck and is told he had no partner. He escapes and tries to rescue Chuck at the lighthouse, where he believes the experiments take place. He reaches the top of the lighthouse and finds only hospital administrator Dr. Cawley seated at a desk. Cawley tells Teddy that he himself is in fact Andrew Laeddis (an anagram of Edward Daniels) and that he has been a patient at Shutter Island for two years for murdering his wife, Dolores Chanal (an anagram of Rachel Solando), after she murdered their three children. Andrew/Teddy refuses to believe this and takes extreme measures to disprove it, grabbing what he thinks is his gun and tries to shoot Dr. Cawley; but the weapon is a toy water pistol. Chuck then enters, revealing that he is actually Andrew's psychiatrist, Dr. Lester Sheehan. He is told that Dr. Cawley and Chuck/Sheehan have devised this treatment to allow him to live out his elaborate fantasy, in order to confront the truth, or else undergo a radical lobotomy treatment. Teddy/Andrew accepts that he killed his wife and his service as a US Marshal was a long time ago. The ending of the novel has Teddy receive a lobotomy in order to avoid living with the knowledge that his wife murdered their children and he is her murderer. Adaptations=Film= The novel has been adapted into a film by director Martin Scorsese, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley, and Max von Sydow as Dr. Naehring. The film was originally scheduled to be released by Paramount Pictures on October 2, 2009, in the United States and Canada. Paramount later announced it was going to push back the release date to February 19, 2010; reports attribute the pushback to Paramount's not having \\"the financing in 2009 to spend the $50 to $60 million necessary to market a big awards pic like this,\\" DiCaprio's unavailability to promote the film internationally, and Paramount's hope that the economy might rebound enough by February 2010 that a film geared toward adult audiences would be more viable financially. The film opened #1 at the box office with $41 million, according to studio estimates. As of 2019, this remains Scorsese's highest box office opening. The film remained #1 in its second weekend with $22.2 million. Eventually, the film grossed $128,012,934 in North America and $166,790,080 in foreign markets, for a total of $294,803,014, becoming Scorsese's highest-grossing film worldwide until The Wolf of Wall Street. =Audiobook= The HarperCollins audiobook version of the novel is read by David Strathairn. The Audible Audio Edition version of the novel is read by Tom Stechschulte. =Graphic novel= The story has also been reworked into a graphic novel published by William Morrow, with art by Christian de Metter ().

The drama features Barbara Stanwyck, Sterling Hayden and Raymond Burr. Plot Kathy Ferguson is a San Francisco newspaper advice columnist. One day, Lieutenant Bill Doyle, a Los Angeles police detective, and his partner, Captain Charlie Alidos, track a fugitive wanted for murder to San Francisco. He meets Kathy and they fall in love. She manages to gain the female fugitive's trust and locate her. Kathy's resulting front page story leads to an offer of a big job in New York City, but she abandons her career, marries Bill and moves to Los Angeles. Her new role as a 1950s suburban wife and homemaker quickly makes her unhappy. She wants her husband to move up in the world, to become \\"somebody\\". Bill has different values. He works in order to afford a comfortable lifestyle, no more. Kathy schemes to push her husband up the career ladder without his knowledge. She arranges to get into a car accident with Alice Pope, in order to become acquainted with her husband, Police Inspector Tony Pope, head of Bill's division. Tony realizes what she has done, and why, but plays along. Her continuing ploys inevitably bring her into conflict with Sara, the captain's equally ambitious wife, and Charlie begins to find fault with Bill at every opportunity. Vicious rumors circulate about Kathy's relationship with Tony. When Bill sees a poison pen letter that Kathy has received, he rushes to work and punches his boss, Charlie, in front of two police witnesses. During the investigation, Tony shifts enough of the blame to Charlie, suggesting he reached for his gun when the visibly angry Bill burst into the room, that he can hush up the whole incident. Charlie is then transferred to another division, and Bill is given his former position as an acting homicide captain. When Alice breaks down under the years of mental strain of being a policeman's wife and is hospitalized, Tony decides to retire. When Tony comes to tell Kathy about Alice's breakdown and his plans to retire, Kathy tries to persuade him to recommend Bill for the vacancy his departure will create. During their talk, he seems to consider the idea favorably, then grabs and kisses her. She recoils at first, then embraces him. Afterward, however, he avoids her. When Kathy finally forces Tony to meet her, he says that he regrets their one-night stand and dismisses any suggestion he would recommend Bill for promotion as \\"pillow talk\\". He makes it clear that he believes that Bill is not qualified, and that he is going to recommend Charlie as his successor. This elevation of a man she hates over Bill's ambition infuriates Kathy. When Kathy accompanies Bill to the police station, she steals a gun used in a robbery and murder that her husband is investigating. Kathy then confronts Pope in his home and appeals to him once again, noting that this time she's asking not just for Bill but for herself. With Pope planning to recommend Charlie Alidos, it means that she cheated on Bill only to gain nothing and she's consumed by guilt over that. She pleads that he at least not recommend Alidos. If Pope recommends no one, Kathy argues, her husband still has a chance to get the job and she will be left with some justification for her infidelity. Pope coldly refuses so she shoots him dead. The entire police department works on Pope's murder investigation. When the murder weapon is discovered to have been a gun that the police had had in their custody and somehow lost, Bill figures out the killer has to have been his own wife since she was present at the time the gun went missing. When Bill confronts Kathy and she confesses, she tells him, \\"Now I'll know just how much of a cop you really are.\\" Bill responds, \\"The same cop, Kathy. The same cop you met in Frisco. Same cop I was 10 years ago, pounding a beat. The same cop.\\" He then drives her to police headquarters, where they walk in together and Bill reports in to secure a room to conduct questioning in the murder of Tony Pope.

When she rails against her kitchen duties, she's a '30s star railing potently against '50s conformity. Though her character turns violent, the reasons behind her anger are powerfully expressed and the film puts you on her side. This overlooked, subversive movie has a strong feminist message and an even stronger Stanwyck performance.\\"Callahan, Dan. Slant Magazine, \\"B-Noir at Film Forum,\\" film review, 2006. Last accessed: January 8, 2008. Critic Glenn Erickson liked the film's noir screenplay and wrote, \\"Crime of Passion is a fascinating film that goes head-on with the classic conception of the femme fatale character. Screenwriter Jo Eisinger wrote the delirious 1946 Gilda, noir's most romantically perverse epic, but here she dissects the murderous female from a 50s perspective. It's hard- edged, direct in its theme and both dated and progressive at the same time. Barbara Stanwyck and Sterling Hayden make an exceptional screen couple.\\"Erickson, Glenn.

In clearer English, sub specie aeternitatis roughly means \\"from the perspective of the eternal\\". Even more loosely, the phrase is used to describe an alternative or objective point of view. Spinoza's \\"eternal\\" perspective is reflected in his Ethics (Part V, Prop. XXIII, Scholium), where he treats ethics through a geometric investigation that begins with God and nature and then analyzes human emotions and the human intellect. By proceeding with sub specie aeternitatis, Spinoza seeks to arrive at an ethical theory that is as precise as Euclid's Elements. In the history of philosophy, this way of proceeding may be most clearly contrasted with Aristotle's manner of proceeding. Aristotle's methodological differences in his \\"philosophy of human affairs\\" and his natural philosophy are grounded in the distinction between what is \\"better known to us\\" and things \\"better known in themselves,\\" or what is \\"first for us\\" and what is \\"first by nature\\" (discussed, among other places, at Metaphysics Z.3, 1029b3–12), a distinction that is deliberately discarded by Spinoza and other modern philosophers.

Although the temple was founded as an institution on its present site by Pillai in 1827, little remains of the original structure he built. Narayana Pillai was a social entrepreneur and businessman, who spent most of his life in Singapore during the colonial period. Of Tamil origins, he greatly contributed to the Tamil community in Singapore. Prior to 1819, Pillai (also spelled Narayana Pillay) worked in Penang, which was ruled by the British. There, he came into contact with Stamford Raffles, a senior official of the British East India Company, who was keen to establish a new trading post at the southern end of the Straits of Malacca. This resulted in the founding of modern Singapore in 1819. In Penang, Raffles persuaded Pillai to join him and to work at his new settlement. __ Early life = Arrival in Singapore = Pillai arrived in Singapore with Raffles in 1819 on the ship ‘Indiana’, making him one of the first Tamil men to set foot there. He started his career there as the chief clerk at the government Treasury, where he verified the authenticity of currency. However, he soon moved on to become a successful entrepreneur and community leader in his own right.  Businesses  With the establishment of a modern urban settlement in Singapore, Pillai noticed a boom in building works. He wrote to his contacts in Penang to send bricklayers, carpenters and cloth merchants to Singapore. He then established the island’s first brick kiln at what is now Tanjong Pagar. Through these efforts, he also became Singapore’s first building contractor. Pillai also ventured into the cotton goods trade where he sold these at Cross Street. In time, his shop became the largest and best known in town. However, a fire in 1822 destroyed his business, leaving him in debt to British merchants who had let him large volumes of cloth on credit. Pillai struggled to negotiate with his creditors, and also secured help from Raffles when the latter returned to visit Singapore. At land he obtained in Commercial Square (now Raffles Place), he erected new warehouses and rebuilt his business from scratch, eventually paying off his debts and remaking his wealth.  Contributions  Apart from his success in business, Pillai is best remembered for his social contributions. He was keen to build a temple on the island to serve the growing Hindu population there. After some difficulty in obtaining a suitable site, he was able to acquire land at South Bridge Road for the purpose in 1823. Here, he erected the Sri Mariamman Temple in 1827, which endures today as the oldest Hindu place of worship on the island, and one of the National Monuments of Singapore. Pillai also envisioned a Hindu Institute for young boys, but this did not materialize. Nevertheless, Pillai’s standing led to his appointment by the British as the chief of the Indian population, which conferred on him powers to settle disputes within the community.  Awards  Pillay gained recognition as a leader amongst the Tamils and was appointed chief of Indians from Cholamandalaman, given the authority to settle disputes amongst the Tamils. He was one of several local figures (like Sang Nila Utama) commemorated for the bicentennial establishing of modern Singapore in 2019 with their own statues erected in Raffles' Landing near the Singapore River.

For the first half of the 20th century, they were the only organizations working for the civil rights of Alaska Natives in the territory and state. History The organization was founded in Sitka in 1912. Two Tlingit brothers were the primary organizers. The founding \\"fathers\\" included a woman.

The Alaska Native Brotherhood Hall, built in 1914 on the waterfront in Sitka, was the first facility owned by the organization. For the significance of the ANB, the hall has been designated a National Historic Landmark. and During the 1930s, the Alaska Native Brotherhood obtained at least one Civilian Conservation Corps grant from the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration to restore and preserve totem poles. One $24,000 grant enabled work with architect Linn A. Forrest, an American architect of Juneau, to construct the Shakes Island Community House and to preserve totems at Wrangell in 1937-1939 during the Great Depression. Elizabeth Peratrovich (née Wanamaker), member and grand president of the ANS, did organizing, wrote petitions, and testified to the state senate in 1945 for civil rights of Alaska Natives. She helped win passage of the 1945 state anti- discrimination act.

Wade Brammer, 1954, Kingston, Jamaica) is a reggae deejay and producer, whose career began in the mid-1970s and continued into the 1990s. Biography Born in 1954, Brammer was educated at the Alpha Boys School. After initially working under the name Prince Glen, he began working under the stage name Trinity, taken from the spaghetti western character. After working as a deejay on several Kingston sound systems, he made his debut recording in March 1976 with \\"Set Up Yourself\\" for producer Joseph Hoo Kim. \\"Words of The Prophet\\" followed for Yabby You, who also produced his debut album, Shanty Town Determination. Late in 1976, he joined up with Dillinger for the \\"Crank Face\\" single, and the Clash album, produced by UK-based producer Clement Bushay. 1977 saw the deejay in great demand, recording more than 20 singles for a variety of producers, including Winston Riley, Tommy Cowan, Joe Gibbs, and Yabby You, his biggest hit coming with \\"Three Piece Suit\\" for Gibbs, featuring Trinity toasting over a new version of Alton Ellis's \\"I'm Still In Love With You\\" rhythm, with a lyric that anticipated the move from 'cultural' lyrics to more material/carnal concerns of the dancehall era. This prompted an answer record from Althea & Donna using the same rhythm, in the form of the UK-chart topping \\"Uptown Top Ranking\\". Trinity recorded \\"Slim Thing\\" in response, but failed to match Althea & Donna's success. 1977 also saw the release of the Uptown Girl album, produced by Bunny Lee, and strong albums in 1978 in the form of Three Piece Chicken and Chips (with Ranking Trevor) and Showcase. In 1978, Trinity also performed at the One Love Peace Concert in Kingston. In the later 1970s, Trinity began producing both himself and other artists, starting his own Flag Man label. In 1979, he recorded the duet \\"Funny Feeling\\" with Dennis Brown, and joined up with Barrington Levy for \\"Lose Respect\\" and \\"I Need a Girl\\" in 1979 and 1980 respectively. Subsequent albums met with diminishing commercial success, and Trinity switched from deejaying to singing, releasing the albums Telephone Line and Hold Your Corner in 1987 under the name Junior Brammer. Trinity's younger brother, Robert Brammer, also had a successful career as a deejay, recording under the name Clint Eastwood.

He made more than 100 league appearances in six years at Ewood Park, the majority coming in seasons 1977–78 and 1978–79. He moved to Oxford United in July 1982, although he was loaned out to Halifax Town three months later and then had a temporary spell with Bury from December 1983. After not playing for Oxford during the 1983–84 season, Butcher was allowed to join Chester City on a free transfer in August 1984. He made his debut on the opening day of the new season against Scunthorpe United and went on to play 36 first-team games during the season. The following campaign saw Butcher have spells out of the side after losing out to David Kaye and Ray Cashley and he was allowed to return to Bury for another loan spell in October 1985. A month later he was back at Chester and missed just three of the final 29 games as the Blues were promoted from Division Four. The summer of 1986 saw Billy Stewart signed by Harry McNally and he was to largely be first choice ahead of Butcher in 1986–87, whose final appearance for the club was a 1–0 defeat to Blackpool on 4 May 1987. At the end of the season Butcher was released and he joined GM Vauxhall Conference side Altrincham, where he played for two years.

It consists of centered on Ozone Falls, a plunge waterfall, and its immediate gorge along Fall Creek. Because of its picturesque beauty and easy access, Disney selected Ozone Falls for filming scenes for the live action movie Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. The area is managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and maintained by Cumberland Mountain State Park. It is also part of the Cumberland Trail State Park. Geographical setting Gambler's Den, just above the gorge Ozone Falls is situated along Fall Creek, which drains a short section of the Cumberland Plateau between the Crab Orchard Mountains to the west and Walden Ridge to the east. The creek flows down from its source high in the Crab Orchard Mountains for a mile or so before steadying briefly as it enters the community of Ozone. Fall Creek enters the state natural area just after it passes under U.S. Route 70, which runs perpendicular to it. The creek spills over Ozone Falls a few hundred meters south of US-70. Beyond Ozone Falls, Fall Creek slices through a small gorge and proceeds southward for several more miles before emptying into Piney Creek. The confluence of Piney and Fall Creek occurs at a point where Roane County, Cumberland County, and Rhea County all meet. Fall Creek is part of the Tennessee River watershed. The Fall Creek that spills over Ozone Falls is not the same stream as the Fall Creek that spills over Fall Creek Falls in Van Buren County. The latter stream is part of the Cumberland River watershed. Features The Ozone Falls State Natural Area consists of Ozone Falls and the gorge immediately downstream. The gorge area around the waterfall's plungepool slopes inward from the top edge, creating a half-dome shape along the gorge's walls. Short hiking trails allow access to the waterfall's overhang and plungepool, as well as the cliffs above the gorge. The trailhead is located along US-70. History Ozone Falls, viewed from the base of the gorge Migrants crossing the Cumberland Plateau en route to the Nashville area in the early 19th century wrote of Ozone Falls in journals and letters sent to relatives back home. The waterfall was located adjacent to the Walton Road, which was part of the stage route connecting East and Middle Tennessee (the road closely paralleled what is now US-70). One traveler along this road, Elijah Haley, died while passing through the area in 1806. His widow established a tavern at what is now the community of Ozone shortly thereafter, and later helped operate the Crab Orchard Inn at Crab Orchard, a few miles to the west. The waterfall was known as McNair Falls throughout the 19th century, named after a local miller who operated a grist mill at the waterfall in the 1860s. In 1896, the community of Mammy, which had grown up around the Haley tavern, changed its name to Ozone, and the name was subsequently applied to the waterfall. The name reflected the high quality of air in the community, which may have been enhanced by the waterfall's mists. The Ozone Falls State Natural Area was established in 1973, and originally consisted of . In 1996, it was expanded to .

His reputation was built when he successfully repulsed two major Portuguese offensives on Kandy, the Battle of Danture in 1594 and the Battle of Balana in 1602, in both of which the Portuguese were humiliatingly defeated. Names and origin Vimaladharmasuriya I is referred to by four names by different sources. Rajavaliya mentions his early name as Konappu Bandara and says he is the son of a Kandyan chieftain, Weerasundara Bandara of Peradeniya. Reports of early Dutch visitors Sebald de Veert and Joris van Spilbergen mention him as Don João da Austria.Earliest Dutch Visitors to Ceylon, Nissanka Perera, S. Godage and Brothers, 2008 Joao Rebeiro mentions one Don Juan Appuhamy, a commoner who was sent to conquer the kingdom of Kandy and of Konnapu Bandara. Historians have also noted that from 1604 to 1617 there is little information available as to what happened in the Kandyan Kingdom.Kandy Fights the Portuguese, C. Gaston Perera, Vijithayapa Publications, 2007 Therefore, there is the possibility of mixing up of several personalities by later historians in reconstructing the history of that period. As per the deed given by this king to the chief commander of Campaign of Danture, his mother's name is Kosbokke Gedara Vimalu, after whom he took up his name Vimaladharmasuriya. Early life Vimaladharmasuriya I, known as Konappu Banḍāra or Galagoda Wimaladharmasurya Bandara before his ascension, was the son of a distinguished aristocrat, from Hatara kōrale (‘four districts’) (roughly equivalent to today’s Kegalla District), Galagoda Weerasundara Bandara. Vimaladharmasuriya's father was murdered by Rajasinghe l. As a result Banḍāra had to flee to Portuguese Goa where he became a Catholic convert as Dom João de Áustria. Rajasinghe l invaded Kandyan Kingdom in 1582 with the help of Veerasundara Bandara and overthrew the Kandyan ruler Karalliyadde Bandara. During the invasion, Karaliyadde Bandara was able to decamp from Kandy with his wife, younger daughter (Kusumasana Devi) and nephew (Yamasinghe Bandara). But him and his wife died on the way while his nephew and daughter was able to reach Portuguese fort at Mannar. Rajasinghe I made Veerasundara Bandara the ruler of the Kandyan Kingdom. But soon became suspicious of him. Rajasinghe I tricked Veerasundara Bandara to come to Seethawaka and killed him. Because of his father's murder Konappu Bandara secretly ran away from Kandy to the Portuguese fort at Colombo. He was sent to Goa by the Portuguese and in there he was Baptised as Dom João and learned fighting techniques from Portuguese. It was said that he attended some of the battles there with the Portuguese. The ruler appointed by Rajasinghe l for the Kandyan Kingdom was Nikapitiye Bandara who turned out to be a ruthless ruler and people were brood upon him. Reign Vimaladharmasuriya meeting with the Dutch explorer Joris van Spilbergen in 1602 King Vimaladharmasuriya is regarded by some historians as the Kandyan Kingdom's second founder, responsible for its revival. He was baptized under the Portuguese name of Dom João da Austria. In 1594 he married Princess Kusmasana Devi who, as Dona Catherina, was put forward by the Portuguese as the rightful claimant to the throne and became king. After renouncing Christianity and embracing Buddhism, Vimaladharmasuriya constructed a two- tiered shrine close to his palace in order to sanctify his capital, Kandy, and accommodate the politically-important relic of the tooth of the Buddha. The Dutch explorer Joris van Spilbergen offered an alliance to fight off the Portuguese. Following these negotiations, Sebald de Weert was officially sent by Admiral Wybrand van Warwijck to mount a joint counter-attack against the Portuguese. The alliance ended in disaster, however, during a drinking party, where the Dutch became rowdy, De Weert according to François Valentijn insulted the queen, and De Weert and all 47 Dutchmen accompanying him consequently were killed. An alliance would not be possible again until 1612, when a new envoy, Marcellus de Boschouwer, established a treaty with Senarat of Kandy, ultimately leading to the eviction of the Portuguese from the island, and about one century of Dutch rule, until the British in turn took the island. Buddhism At the time of Vimaladharmasuriya's coronation Buddhism was on the verge of disappearing from the island. The king learned that ordained Buddhist monks no longer existed on the island so he sent one of his ministers to Lower Burma and reestablished Buddhism in Kandy. By this time, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha was hidden in Delgamuwa Raja Maha Vihara in Sabaragamuwa Province. The king brought the tooth relic to Kandy and built a two-storied Temple of the Tooth near the Royal Palace of Kandy to house the relic. He also repaired many ruined Buddhist temples throughout his kingdom.Culavamsa See also * List of Sri Lankan monarchs References=CitationsBibliography= * External links * Kings & Rulers of Sri Lanka * Codrington's Short History of Ceylon Category:1604 deaths Category:Sinhalese kings Category:Buddhist monarchs Category:Converts to Buddhism Category:Converts to Buddhism from Roman Catholicism Category:Converts to Buddhism from Christianity Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Buddhism Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Place of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:Place of death unknown Category:Monarchs of Kandy Category:House of Dinajara Category:16th-century Sinhalese monarchs Category:17th-century Sinhalese monarchs ","title":"Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy"},{"id":"15121149","text":"M.

The building, which is bound by Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue between 59th Street and 58th Street, is one of the few structures in Manhattan to occupy a full city block. With 1.774 million net leasable square feet, the tower sits on the site of the former Savoy-Plaza Hotel and affords views of Central Park. It was designed in the international style by Edward Durell Stone & Associates with Emery Roth & Sons and completed in 1968. It is the 66th tallest building in New York. Currently owned by a joint venture of Boston Properties, Zhang Xin, and the Safra banking family, the GM Building remains one of New York's most recognized and expensive office properties. Rents typically exceed $100 per square foot; a 2013 transaction among minority owners valued the building around $3.4 billion while a 2017 appraisal valued it at over $4.8 billion.  History  Apple Store glass cube at the base of the building From 59th Street The building was built and developed by Cecilia Benattar, president and chief executive officer of the North American holdings of the vast British holding company London Merchant Securities PLC. =General Motors ownership= When the building opened, it housed 3,027 General Motors workers taking up roughly half the building. General Motors moved 700 of the 1,100 employees working in the building to Detroit in February 1981, reducing their occupancy to 12 floors of the building or roughly . In April 1981, General Motors announced their intention to sell the building for more than $500 million while still maintaining their corporate office space. Rather than selling the building outright, GM sold an option to Corporate Property Investors in January 1982 to buy the building in 1991. Corporate Property Investors paid $500 million for the option and received 10% 10-year notes from GM paying $50 million a year. The deal was believed to represent the largest mortgage ever for an office property in New York City. The transaction also made Corporate Property Investors the managers of the building. =Corporate Property Investors ownership= In 1990, Corporate Property Investors initiated a 3-year, $7.5 million renovation while still only managers of the building, recaulking the windows and replacing about 400 of the 43,000 exterior marble slabs. In February 1991, Corporate Property Investors exercised their option to buy the building from General Motors for $500 million. By 1995, General Motors was close to shuttering its New York City outpost and moving to Westchester county. However, after employee demand and receiving tax breaks from the city of New York, GM signed a smaller lease for , compared to the they previously occupied. The move included the closing of the first-floor GM showroom, which had occupied of retail space since the building opened. =Donald Trump ownership= In 1998, Conseco and Donald Trump purchased the General Motors Building for $878 million from Corporate Property Investors. The group received a $700 million loan from Lehman Brothers for the purchase and Trump reportedly only committed $15 to $20 million of his own money to the deal. Trump raised the controversial sunken plaza where few pedestrians had ventured, which had been criticized by Huxtable, and installed his name in four-foot gold letters. The building was home to CBS's The Early Show from 1999 to 2012. =Harry Macklowe ownership= In 2003, Trump and partners sold the building for $1.4 billion, then the highest price paid for a North American office building, to Macklowe Organization. Following the acquisition, Macklowe completed a comprehensive $150 million repositioning program which created the Apple Store space as well as of new retail space on the Madison Avenue side of the building. The property was first recapitalized in January 2005, with new senior debt of $1.1 billion, and $300 million of preferred equity from Jamestown, a German retail real estate syndicator.Macklowe Properties - The General Motors Building In December 2006, the property was recapitalized again, with $1.9 billion in new senior debt. During this recapitalization, Macklowe also repurchased all of Jamestown's preferred equity stake, leaving them as sole owners. =Boston Properties ownership= In February 2008, due to a credit crisis among lenders, the Macklowe Organization put the GM Building on the market for between $3.2 and $3.5 billion. It sold in May for an estimated $2.8 billion to a joint venture between Boston Properties, Goldman Sachs Real Estate Opportunities Fund (backed by funds from Kuwait and Qatar), and Meraas Capital (a Dubai-based real estate private equity firm). It was the largest single- asset transaction of 2008. In April 2017, Boston Properties negotiated a new $2.3 billion mortgage from a group of unidentified lenders. This loan represented the largest received by a New York City building since the $2.7 billion Wells Fargo loan to The Blackstone Group and Ivanhoé Cambridge for their purchase of Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village in late 2015. At the time, the building was appraised at $4.8 billion, making it one of the most valuable office buildings in New York City. The loan was securitized in a number of commercial mortgage-backed security transactions by multiple banks including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo, UBS, and Deutsche Bank. Design The building's design was completed the same year the 1964 New York World's Fair opened. Construction began after demolition of the Savoy-Plaza in 1965, and was completed in 1968. The façade is an expression of unbroken verticality in \\"glistening white Georgia marble\\" and sheets of glass. Both architectural firms were prolific skyscraper designers contributing to much of Manhattan's urban fabric; however, the property has been more attractive as a piece of real estate and as a home to its corporate tenants than it has to architecture critics. Paul Goldberger and Ada Louise Huxtable both criticized the building and even the first edition of the AIA Guide to New York City (1968), an unabashed apology for International Modernism, noted, \\"The hue and cry over the new behemoth was based, not on architecture but, rather, first on the loss of the hotel'sThe site had contained the Savoy Hotel, with a limestone ground-floor façade and Beaux-Arts classical style that completed the former architectural unity of the Grand Army Plaza. elegant shopping amenities in favor of automobile salesmanship (an auto showroom is particularly galling at the spot in New York most likely to honor the pedestrian).\\" Until 2015 the ground floor retail space was FAO Schwarz's (which moved from across the street, in 1986 from 745 Fifth Avenue) flagship toy store, which was featured in the film Big and which won an award for its lighting in 2005. Also in the building is the flagship Apple Store, whose entrance is a glass cube that has been likened to the Louvre Pyramid and which allows a descent into the store via glass elevator and spiral staircase. This addition was designed by Apple and the firm of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. Tenants * Banco Itaú * ContiGroup Companies * Estée Lauder Companies * Icahn Enterprises * J.C.

Due to the much lower orbital inclination of the HST compared to the ISS, the shuttle crew would have been unable to use the International Space Station as a \\"safe haven\\", and NASA would not have been able to follow the usual plan of recovering the crew with another shuttle at a later date. Instead, NASA developed a plan to conduct a shuttle-to-shuttle rescue mission, similar to proposed rescue missions for pre-ISS flights. The rescue mission would have been launched only three days after call-up and as early as seven days after the launch of STS-125, since the crew of Atlantis would only have about three weeks of consumables after launch. The mission was first rolled out in September 2008 to Launch Complex 39B two weeks after the STS-125 shuttle was rolled out to Launch Complex 39A, creating a rare scenario in which two shuttles were on launch pads at the same time. In October 2008, however, STS-125 was delayed and rolled back to the VAB. Initially, STS-125 was retargeted for no earlier than February 2009. This changed the STS-400 vehicle from Endeavour to Discovery. The mission was redesignated STS-401 due to the swap from Endeavour to Discovery. STS-125 was then delayed further, allowing Discovery mission STS-119 to fly beforehand. This resulted in the rescue mission reverting to Endeavour, and the STS-400 designation being reinstated. In January, 2009, it was announced that NASA was evaluating conducting both launches from Complex 39A in order to avoid further delays to Ares I-X, which, at the time, was scheduled for launch from LC-39B in the September 2009 timeframe. It was planned that after the STS-125 mission in October 2008, Launch Complex 39B would undergo the conversion for use in Project Constellation for the Ares I-X rocket. Several of the members on the NASA mission management team said at the time (2009) that single-pad operations were possible, but the decision was made to use both pads.  Crew  The crew assigned to this mission was a subset of the STS-126 crew:  Early mission plans  Atlantis (foreground) and Endeavour on LC-39A and LC-39B in 2008. Three different concept mission plans were evaluated: The first would be to use a shuttle-to-shuttle docking, where the rescue shuttle docks with the damaged shuttle, by flying upside down and backwards, relative to the damaged shuttle. It was unclear whether this would be practical, as the forward structure of either orbiter could collide with the payload bay of the other, resulting in damage to both orbiters. The second option that was evaluated, would be for the rescue orbiter to rendezvous with the damaged orbiter, and perform station-keeping while using its Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to transfer crew from the damaged orbiter. This mission plan would result in heavy fuel consumption. The third concept would be for the damaged orbiter to grapple the rescue orbiter using its RMS, eliminating the need for station- keeping. The rescue orbiter would then transfer crew using its RMS, as in the second option, and would be more fuel efficient than the station-keeping option. The concept that was eventually decided upon was a modified version of the third concept. The rescue orbiter would use its RMS to grapple the end of the damaged orbiter's RMS.  Preparations  Diagram showing one of the proposals for crew and equipment transfers during STS-400. After its most recent mission (STS-123), Endeavour was taken to the Orbiter Processing Facility for routine maintenance. Following the maintenance, Endeavour was on stand-by for STS-326 which would have been flown in the case that STS-124 would not have been able to return to Earth safely. Stacking of the solid rocket boosters (SRB) began on 11 July 2008. One month later, the external tank arrived at KSC and was mated with the SRBs on 29 August 2008. Endeavour joined the stack on 12 September 2008 and was rolled out to Pad 39B one week later. Since STS-126 launched before STS-125, Atlantis was rolled back to the VAB on 20 October, and Endeavour rolled around to Launch Pad 39A on 23 October. When it was time to launch STS-125, Atlantis rolled out to pad 39A.  Mission plan  The Mission would not have included the extended heatshield inspection normally performed on flight day two. Instead, an inspection would have been performed after the crew was rescued. On flight day two, Endeavour would have performed the rendezvous and grapple with Atlantis. On flight day three, the first EVA would have been performed. During the first EVA, Megan McArthur, Andrew Feustel and John Grunsfeld would have set up a tether between the airlocks. They would have also transferred a large size Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) and, after McArthur had repressurized, transferred McArthur's EMU back to Atlantis. Afterwards they would have repressurized on Endeavour, ending flight day two activities. The final two EVA were planned for flight day three. During the first, Grunsfeld would have depressurized on Endeavour in order to assist Gregory Johnson and Michael Massimino in transferring an EMU to Atlantis. He and Johnson would then repressurize on Endeavour, and Massimino would have gone back to Atlantis. He, along with Scott Altman and Michael Good would have taken the rest of the equipment and themselves to Endeavour during the final EVA. They would have been standing by in case the RMS system should malfunction. The damaged orbiter would have been commanded by the ground to deorbit and go through landing procedures over the Pacific, with the impact area being north of Hawaii. On flight day five, Endeavour would have had a full heat shield inspection, and land on flight day eight. This mission could have marked the end of the Space Shuttle program, as it is considered unlikely that the program would have been able to continue with just two remaining orbiters, Discovery and Endeavour. On Thursday, 21 May 2009, NASA officially released Endeavour from the rescue mission, freeing the orbiter to begin processing for STS-127. This also allowed NASA to continue processing LC-39B for the upcoming Ares I-X launch, as during the stand-down period, NASA installed a new lightning protection system, similar to those found on the Atlas V and Delta IV pads, to protect the newer, taller Ares I rocket from lightning strikes.

The fifth named storm of the 2003–04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Elita developed in the Mozambique Channel on January 24, 2004. It strengthened to tropical cyclone status before striking northwestern Madagascar on January 28; it was the first storm to strike western Madagascar at that intensity since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. Elita weakened to tropical depression status while crossing the island, and after exiting into the southwest Indian Ocean, it turned to the west and moved ashore in eastern Madagascar on January 31. After once again crossing the island, the cyclone reached the Mozambique Channel and re-intensified. Elita turned to the southeast to make its final landfall on February 3 along southwestern Madagascar. Two days later, it underwent an extratropical transition; subsequently, the remnant system moved erratically before dissipating on February 13. Elita dropped heavy rainfall of more than 200 mm (8 inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. Over 50,000 people were left homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces. Flooding from the storm ruined more than 450 km² (170 sq mi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. Across the island, the cyclone caused 33 deaths, with its impact further compounded by Cyclone Gafilo about two months later. Elsewhere, Elita brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi, and its outer wind circulation produced rough seas and strong gusts in Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion. Meteorological history Toward the end of January 2004, an active phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation exited the east coast of Africa and fueled convection (thunderstorms) near Madagascar, beginning on January 20\\\\. This pulse, the strongest of the season, was also responsible for generating cyclones Frank and Linda. The thunderstorms coalesced in the Mozambique Channel between Madagascar and Mozambique on January 24, fueled by a surge in the monsoon. That day, the Météo-France meteorological office in Réunion designated the system as Tropical Disturbance 06. The surge also increased wind shear in the region, which displaced the convection from the circulation. Drifting southwestward at first, the system became more defined, culminating with a marked increase in thunderstorms on January 26\\\\. That day, the MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Elita near Juan de Nova Island. On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 09S. Steered by a ridge to the west, the nascent Tropical Storm Elita turned northward over its previous path, an unusual trajectory for the Mozambique Channel. The convection fluctuated until January 28, when a curved rainband developed and quickly organized into an eyewall; this followed a decrease in wind shear. Another ridge to the northeast blocked the northward movement, and Elita turned to the east- southeast toward the west coast of Madagascar. Around 15:00 UTC on January 28, the storm made landfall at Bombetoka Bay, or about 30 km (20 mi) southwest of Mahajanga. The airport there recorded 10 minute sustained winds of 126 km/h (78 mph), and on that basis, the MFR upgraded Elita to tropical cyclone status in post-season analysis. This made Elita the first tropical cyclone to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. While Elita was active, both the JTWC and the MFR estimated an intensity of 110 km/h (70 mph) at the first landfall. Cyclone Elita rainfall map Over land, the storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression, and the JTWC temporarily discontinued issuing advisories. The center of Elita crossed Madagascar, passing near Madagascar's capital Antananarivo, and redeveloped thunderstorms in its eastern periphery. Late on January 29, the circulation emerged into the Indian Ocean near Mahanoro. A ridge to the east turned the system back to the west, allowing the system only about 24 hours over open waters. During that time, the structure reorganized slightly, and the MFR upgraded Elita to a moderate tropical storm on January 30\\\\. The storm made its second landfall near Mananjary, and crossed Madagascar a second time over the course of 24 hours. Early on January 31, Elita emerged again into the Mozambique Channel, and the JTWC began reissuing advisories. With warm waters and low wind shear, Elita re-intensified off the west coast of Madagascar, reaching moderate tropical storm status for a third time on February 1\\\\. After moving west-northwestward, the storm stalled on February 2 due to a building ridge to the north. At that time, Elita was about 140 km (85 mi) southwest of where it attained tropical storm status for the first time six days prior. The convection reorganized into a central dense overcast, but unlike its first period of intensification, no eye feature developed. Late on February 2, the JTWC assessed peak winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) - the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. Around that time, Elita moved ashore Madagascar for a third time near Morondava, which reported a minimum barometric pressure of . Due to the lack of wind observations, the MFR estimated a peak landfall intensity of 110 km/h (70 mph), although the agency noted that the storm could have attained tropical cyclone intensity again. Crossing Madagascar for a third time, Elita closely followed the trajectory of its second passage, emerging into the Indian Ocean near Manakara on February 3\\\\. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed under the influence of a strong upper-level trough. The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February 4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. For the next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February 11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February 13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system. Preparations and impact Malawi in southeastern Africa experienced the fringes of the storm, when inflow of the storm brought moisture from the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This produced heavy rainfall of over 150 mm (6 in), which destroyed more than 80 houses and a clinic in Karonga district. The Mozambique National Institute of Meteorology advised people living in Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, and Inhambane Provinces to make preparations for strong winds and rainfall. Elita impacted four provinces of Mozambique. Much of the impact was along the coast from Inhambane to Nampula. In Nampula province, over 2,000 buildings were destroyed. The most severe damage was to generally poorly built houses. In the city of Nampula, a school was badly damaged, and in Nacala-a-Velha, some residents had to spend the night of January 29 outside. The precursor to Elita dropped heavy rainfall in the Comoros and Mayotte. In the latter island, of rainfall within 24 hours produced landslides and contributed to three deaths, when the walls of a house collapsed. During its first landfall on Madagascar, Elita produced wind gusts of around 100 km/h (60 mph) on Mayotte. On Juan de Nova Island in the Mozambique Channel, the storm dropped of rainfall in just 12 hours, with recorded in one hour. The storm brought rough seas, gusty winds, and some precipitation to the southwestern islands in Seychelles. =Madagascar= Surface runoff from Cyclone Elita Throughout Madagascar, the cyclone killed at least 33 people and injured 886 others. Throughout the country, Cyclone Elita destroyed or severely damaged 12,408 homes, which left 55,983 people homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara. This forced around 7,000 people to seek shelter in either stadiums or in the remaining standing buildings. Additionally, a total of 510 schools and hospitals received major damage. The cyclone affected five of the six provinces of Madagascar, with roads and power being severely disrupted in some areas; at least 39 bridges were damaged or destroyed. Across the nation the storm damaged more than of agricultural land. Upon making its first landfall on Madagascar, Elita dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at including a 24‑hour total of 222 mm (8.74 in) in Antsohihy. Wind gusts reached over 180 km/h (110 mph) in Mahajanga near where the storm made its first landfall. A tornado also affected the city during Elita's third transit of Madagascar, which killed two people and destroyed a soap manufacturing plant. The passage of the cyclone left 5,000 people homeless in the vicinity of its first landfall. Along with power and water outages, about 90 percent of the buildings in northwestern Mahajanga Province were damaged by the storm. Much of Morondava on the west coast was flooded, after a dam near the city collapsed. Maintirano along the west coast was also damaged, as was Soavinandriana in the island's interior. In the capital city Antananarivo, 90 km/h (56 mph) wind gusts caused power outages and damaged part of the Rova, or the Queen's Palace. In Midongy Atismo in southeastern Madagascar, heavy rainfall flooded 80% of rice crop, and the corn and manioc crops were both similarly affected. These represent the staple foods of the population. Aftermath On February 13, 2004, officials in Madagascar issued an appeal for international aid. By a month after the storm, the governments of France, the United States, Germany, and Japan sent a total of $287,000 (2004 USD) in assistance. The government of France sent a plane with food, medicine, and other equipment to the affected areas. The government of Germany sent aid to be used for foods and medicines. On February 27, the government of Japan sent aid to the country, including tents, generators, and plastic sheets. Officials distributed emergency relief items to the affected areas, including rice, sugar, soap, candles, matches and water purification tablets. In Morondava in Toliara Province, the government distributed 4 tons of rice seed, while in Ambatolampy in Antananarivo Province, the government sent 10 tons of rice; additionally, the World Food Programme sent 80 tons of flour to the nation. The combined efforts of the United Nations and aid agencies repaired the schools and distributed meals to the families affected by the disaster. Workers in association with the Madagascar Red Cross set up a water system that provided about 45,000 litres (11,900 gallons) of drinkable water per day. The impact of Cyclone Elita was severely compounded by Cyclone Gafilo about two months later, which killed hundreds and left over 240,000 people homeless.

In practice, one type of scraper is often interchanged with another or with a spatula (thus scrapers are often called spatulas) for some of the various uses. Bowl scraper Long-handled scraper can be used as a bowl scraper Bowl scrapers (also known as rubber feet) are, as the name suggests, used to remove material from mixing bowls. Often, a plate scraper is used for this purpose, particularly since the long handle allows it to be used to remove contents of bowls as well as jars, such as mayonnaise jars; however, for bowls, dedicated scrapers are available, lacking the handle, and consisting of a flat, flexible piece of plastic or silicone rubber sized for convenient holding with the palm and fingers, with a curved edge to match the curvature of the average bowl. The degree of curvature can vary from a slight curvature along one edge of a rectangle, to a complex shape composed of changing radii to adapt better to bowls of different sizes. Sometimes a hole is provided in one corner, to allow for hanging the utensil, as well as for placement of the thumb to allow for more secure grip. Prices vary from below one American dollar, to as much as $20 American.Bowl scrapers sorted by price, Amazon.com The technique for use of either form of bowl scraper is essentially intuitive. Dough scraper Dough scraper Dough scrapers, or pastry scrapers, are more rigid implements, often made of a metal rectangle with a wooden, plastic, or metal handle running along one long edge not only for more comfortable grip, but also to add rigidity; some bowl scrapers, however, are designed to be stiff enough to serve a dual purpose and are sold as such. Occasionally, an implement resembling a putty knife is sold for this purpose.Triangular SpatulaPan Scraper This implement is used to manipulate raw dough, by scraping it from a surface on which it has been rolled, as well as to slice it. It can also be called a spatula. A dough scraper is a tool used by bakers to manipulate dough and to clean surfaces on which dough has been worked. It is generally a small sheet of stainless steel (approximately 3\\"×5\\" or 8 cm × 13 cm) with a handle of wood, plastic, or simply a roll in the steel blade along one of the long sides. Bakers and pastry chefs use this tool to help pick up, turn, and portion dough. When finished, the dough scraper can be used to scrape up the little bits of dough that have dried onto the kneading surface during the forming process. It can also be used in a more generic kitchen role to transfer sliced or diced foods from cutting board to pan. Additionally, the scraper is also used by pastry chefs to give sharp and smooth edges to the cakes while decorating them. This tool is known by a variety of names, including dough scraper, dough cutter, dough knife, pastry cutter, bench scraper, board scraper, and bench knife. Some modern varieties of this tool have handles of nylon or silicone and even feature both straight and curved edges. These are intended primarily for the use of scraping cutting boards and bowls rather than working dough. These uses have introduced further variants of the name, including terms such as bowl scraper or chopper, scooper, scraper. Grill scraper A grill scraper is a device used to clean cooking grills by scraping stuck particles of food from their surface. For flat surfaced grills, their design can vary from similar to a putty knife, to a more complex device with provision to protect the hands from the hot grill surface, targeted to professional cooks and chefs,Grill scrapers to even more complex modelsErgonomic Grill Scraper costing $100 American.

He served as Prefect of the Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments from 1914 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1914. Biography Filippo Giustini was born in Cineto Romano. He studied at the seminaries of Subiaco, next to the Benedictine monastery, and of Tivoli. He entered the Pontifical Pio Seminary in Rome in November 1871. Giustini was ordained to the priesthood on December 23, 1876, and then taught at the Tivoli seminary until 1878. From 1878 to 1896, he was Professor of Roman Law at the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum \\"S. Apollinare\\", from where he obtained his doctorate as well in 1880. Giustini was named Prefect of Studies at the Athenaeum on February 26, 1878, a Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on December 11, 1886, and a canon of Santa Maria in Trastevere on May 21, 1891. On June 22, 1892, he entered the service of the Roman Curia, as counselor of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. He was made a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on August 18, 1896, auditor of the Roman Rota on February 11, 1897, and later a judge of the Vatican Tribunal of First Instance. After becoming Secretary of the Sacred Congregation for Bishops and Regulars on April 28, 1902, he was made counselor of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office on the following August 27. On October 24, 1908, Giustini was appointed Secretary of the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments by Pope Pius X. As Secretary, he served as the second-highest official of that dicastery under Cardinal Domenico Ferrata. Pope Pius then created him Cardinal Deacon of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria in the consistory of May 25, 1914. Giustini was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1914 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XV, who named him Prefect of the Discipline of the Sacraments on October 14 of that same year. He also served as a member of the Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law, and as Protector of the Order of the Friars Minor, more commonly known as the Franciscans. In 1919, Giustini served as papal legate to the centennial celebration of St. Stephen of Hungary in Capua, and to the Holy Land for the celebration of the seventh centennial of St. Francis of Assisi’s visit to Egypt and Palestine. Cardinal Giustini died from pulmonary disease at 11:20 a.m., in his Roman residence. After an exposition and funeral Mass at the church of Santa Maria Nuova, he was buried in the crypt of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide at the Campo Verano cemetery.

It was designed by the Naval Air Technical Arsenal at Yokosuka, and while unimpressive during testing, it was ordered into service by the Imperial Japanese Navy and used until replaced by more capable aircraft. Development and design In 1932, the Imperial Japanese Navy had a requirement, 7-Shi, for a new torpedo bomber to replace the Mitsubishi B2M. The air arsenal at Yokosuka prepared its own design to meet this requirement, competing against designs by Mitsubishi and Nakajima. The resulting aircraft was a three-seat single-engine biplane, with a fuselage of steel tube construction and two-bay wooden wings that could fold rearwards for storage aboard aircraft carriers. It was powered by a single Hiro Type 91 W engine rated at 450 kW (600 hp). Testing proved that the aircraft had poor stability and control, and that the engine was unreliable. The competing Mitsubishi and Nakajima aircraft were even less successful however, and after modifications made by Tokuichiro Gomei of Aichi Kokuki, the aircraft was accepted by the Navy in August 1933 as the Kugisho Navy Type 92 Carrier Attack Bomber, with a short designation of B3Y1, with production by Aichi, Watanabe and the Hiro Naval Arsenal, 129 being produced by the time that production finished in 1936. Operational history The B3Y1 continued to be prone to engine problems, which frequently caused the type to be grounded. It served operationally in the early part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, gaining a good reputation for accurate level bombing against small targets. The Yokosuka B3Y was gradually phased out of operational service, being replaced by Aichi's D1A dive bomber and Yokosuka's B4Y torpedo bomber.

He was a disciple of Valentinus, with whom his system mainly agrees. His doctrines are almost exclusively known to us through a long polemic (i. 13–21) in Adversus Haereses, in which Irenaeus gives an account of his teaching and his school. Clement of Alexandria clearly knew of Marcus and actually used his number system (Stromata, VI, xvi), though without acknowledgement. Life Marcus appears to have been an elder contemporary of Irenaeus, who speaks of him as though still living and teaching. Though we learn from Irenaeus that the Rhone district was a home to the followers of Marcus, it does not appear that Marcus was there himself, and the impression left is that Irenaeus knew the followers of Marcus by personal intercourse, Marcus only by his writings. We are told also of Marcus having seduced the wife of one of the deacons in Asia (διάκονον τινα τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ), and the most natural conclusion is that Asia Minor was the scene where Marcus made himself a teacher, probably before Irenaeus had left that district; that it was a leading bishop there who resisted Marcus; and that his doctrines passed into Gaul by means of the extensive intercourse well known to have then prevailed between the two countries. The use of Hebrew or Syriac names in the Marcosian school may lead us to ascribe to Marcus an Oriental origin. The only grounds, for believing him to be of Egyptian extraction are these:—Sulpicius Severus, and others who give the history of the origin of Priscillianism, tell that one Marcus of Memphis brought the Gnostic doctrines into Spain, from whom Agape and Elpidius learned them. Jerome certainly identified this Marcus with the subject of the present article, his notion bring that Marcosian doctrine, which we know from Irenaeus to have been prevalent in Southern Gaul, naturally passed on to the adjacent province of Spain. It is not quite clear whether Jerome felt the chronological difficulties of his theory, which, however, could be easily got over by supposing that the first Priscillianists were to be regarded as having learned from Marcus, not because they had been taught by himself personally, but because they had learned from men who revered him as the founder of their sect. But since Priscillianism contains none of the points which distinguish Marcus from other Gnostics, it is safer to regard Marcus, of Memphis as a distinct personage. Teachings His system tells of 30 aeons, divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Dodecad; of the fall and recovery of Sophia; of the future union of the spirits of the chosen seed with angels as their heavenly bridegrooms. What Marcus added to the teaching of his predecessors was a system of Isopsephy similar to that of the later Pythagoreans, about mysteries in numbers and names. Marcus found in Scripture and in Nature repeated examples of the occurrence of his mystical numbers, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, thirty. Accusations Irenaeus alleges that Marcus abused his influence over \\"silly women\\" in order to gain both money and sexual favors. He is accused of having used philtres and love charms, and at least one, if not more, of his female disciples on returning to the Church confessed that body as well as mind had been defiled by him. However, it seems that most of his followers claimed to have been elevated by their knowledge and the redemption they had experienced.

They currently support hospitals and doctors in over 20 countries across Africa and Asia. Fistula Foundation is dedicated to treating obstetric fistula by covering the full cost of obstetric fistula repair surgery for poor women who would otherwise not be able to access treatment. They also provide fistula surgeon training, equipment and facility upgrades that make fistula treatment as safe as possible, and post-surgery counseling and support for healed patients. Fistula Foundation has been recognized by several organizations for its transparency and efficiency, earning a top \\"A\\" rating from Charity Watch and a four star rating from Charity Navigator for 14 years in a row, placing it in the top 1% of charities reviewed on the site. Fistula Foundation has also been selected as one of 22 charities recommended by Princeton Professor Peter Singer's organization, The Life You Can Save. The organization's cost-effectiveness was also noted by GiveWell in 2019.  History  The Fistula Foundation was founded in 2000 by Richard Haas and his daughter Shaleece Haas, who left the board in 2005. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. Since its inception, the organization has raised more than $87.6 million from donors from more than 81 countries. Until 2008, the Foundation supported only the work of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, founded by Dr. Catherine Hamlin and her husband Reginald Hamlin. In 2009, Fistula Foundation expanded its mission from funding one hospital to addressing fistula globally. Since then, they have supported projects in a total of 32 countries across Africa and Asia. The organization currently funds sites in more than 20 countries, and enables more surgeries than any other organization in the world, public or private. In 2020, they surpassed 50,000 surgeries since expanding their mission in 2009.  Focus  The current need for fistula treatment far outstrips supply. For every woman who is treated, there are an estimated 50 more women who go without, according to the Foundation and affirmed by meta-analyses. Because of this, Fistula Foundation focuses primarily on treatment, either directly through fistula repair surgeries, or by removing barriers to treatment through training of surgeons and the provision and equipping of medical facilities. Since expanding to a global mission in 2009, the organization has grown to help address the large unmet need. They now provide more support than any other organization including USAID and the United Nations. Countries where the Foundation has supported projects include Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Malawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Somaliland, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Fistula Foundation also funds surgeon training, growing the pool of skilled fistula surgeons with the ability to perform what can be a very complex surgery. The organization supported the FIGO Fistula Training Initiative, which works to build the capacity of fistula surgeons in accredited training centers using the FIGO Global Competency-Based Fistula Surgery Training Manual. The manual is the only global competency-based standard for fistula surgeon training, and was authored by a former Foundation Board Chair, Dr. Sohier Elneil.  Leadership  Fistula Foundation is led by CEO Kate Grant, who joined the organization in 2005 as its first chief executive. Under her leadership, the Foundation has grown from supporting one facility in one country to become the global leader in fistula treatment. During her tenure, the Foundation more than quadrupled its revenue and has supported more than 15 times the number of fistula treatment surgeries it supports. In 2014, Ms. Grant was the recipient of the American Marketing Association Foundation \\"Nonprofit Marketer of the Year Award.\\" The Foundation has a seven-member Board of Directors; the chair is Bill Mann. Fistula Foundation meets all Better Business Bureau Standards of Charity Accountability, and is a Top-Rated Charity on GreatNonprofits. In 2015, it was selected by the investment firm Motley Fool as their holiday 'Foolanthropy' partner, raising over $75,000. ConsumerReports published a list of recommended charities for the 2018 holiday season, naming Fistula Foundation as on of five international organizations. In 2019, the rigorous charity evaluator GiveWell said of Fistula Foundation: \\"From an initial cost- effectiveness analysis, our best estimate is that Fistula Foundation may be in the range of cost-effectiveness of our current top charities.\\" GiveWell's evaluation of the organization is ongoing.  Partnerships  The Foundation is a partner of the United Nations Population Fund’s Campaign to End Fistula. Other partners have included Direct Relief, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Society of Obstetric Fistula Surgeons (ISOFS). The Foundation was a primary funder of the Global Fistula Treatment Map. When the organization expanded to fight fistula globally in 2009, its first surgeon partner was Dr. Denis Mukwege of Panzi Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This partnership has continued ever since, and in 2018, Dr. Mukwege was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Another notable partner is Edna Adan Ismail, founder of the Edna Adan Hospital and University, former First Lady and Foreign Minister of Somaliland, and the country's first qualified nurse midwife. Fistula Foundation has received funding and support from Johnson & Johnson. The company has partnered with Fistula Foundation for the last decade, providing more than $2 million in support. In 2014, Fistula Foundation launched its first countrywide treatment network in Kenya with seed funding from Astellas Pharma EMEA. The initiative is designed to treat women, train more fistula surgeons, and build a lasting network of treatment providers. The Foundation launched a second countrywide treatment network in Zambia in 2017, with the support of Johnson & Johnson. Cumulatively, the networks in Kenya and Zambia have treated more than 7,300 women, added 12 facilities to a nationwide fistula treatment network, certified 14 new fistula surgeons at FIGO global competency level, and held over 28,101 community outreach events designed to educate communities about obstetric fistula, how to identify it and where to receive treatment.  Media  Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nicholas D. Kristof has consistently covered the Foundation's work in his New York Times column, most recently in October 2019. He first mentioned the organization in June 2005, and again in June 2006, February 2007, October 2009, December 2009, May 2010, May 2011, May 2012, June 2013, February 2014, March 2015, March 2016, and February 2018. The Foundation also continues to generate attention through Grant's articles in international publications including The Guardian, The Lancet, The San Jose Mercury News, Medium, and The Huffington Post. The Foundation was also featured in Kenyan television (CitizenTV, NTV) for celebrating the grand opening of the Gynocare Women's & Fistula Center, a hospital funded by Foundation's donors. Dr. Hillary Mabeya, co-founder of Gynocare, published an op/ed about his work as a fistula surgeon in US World and News Report in May 2018. PBS NewsHour aired a segment on Fistula Foundation's countrywide treatment network in Kenya in December 2017. The organization has also garnered coverage in The Independent, Rolling Stone, USA Today, Reuters, NewsWeek, NewsDeeply, Money Magazine, and MSN News. Fistula Foundation will be featured prominently as a top effective charity in the 10th anniversary edition of ethicist professor Peter Singer's book, The Life You Can Save. Dr. Singer's partnership with Fistula Foundation is longstanding. In 2015, Dr. Singer put on a concert with Grammy Award-winning musician Paul Simon to benefit Fistula Foundation, which raised over $150,000 for fistula care. The Foundation was a primary sponsor of the documentary film A Walk to Beautiful which won the Best Feature-Length Documentary of 2007 from the International Documentary Association as well as an Emmy for best long form documentary in 2008. The film tells the story of five Ethiopian women treated by Dr. Hamlin and her staff at the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital. PBS's NOVA is the other major sponsor of the documentary. In 2016, Comedian Louis C.K. won $50,000 for the Fistula Foundation on the Jeopardy! \\"Power Players\\" edition. Fistula Foundation was also featured in Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's book: Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide. This campaign included the popular Facebook-based game, Half the Game. Thanks to $250,000 in support from Johnson & Johnson, players of this game can help fund fistula treatment in the real world, through online actions in the game.  Allan Rosenfield Award  Fistula Foundation's Allan Rosenfield award recognized outstanding contributions of those who have left a deep and accomplished legacy for Fistula Foundation and its mission. The award was inaugurated in 2012, and is named for the late Dr. Allan Rosenfield, who served on the organization's board of directors for five years. As dean of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, Dr. Rosenfield was known globally for his pioneering leadership and myriad of contributions to the field of women's health. In 2016, Conrad Person of Johnson & Johnson was awarded for his key role in forging an enduring partnership between the Foundation and its biggest corporate sponsor. In 2017, Jerry Goldstein was honored as Fistula Foundation's longest-standing volunteer, dedicating a portion of his time every week since 2005. Several past Board Members have been presented with the award, including Larry William, Rob Tessler, Jerry Shefren, Kassahun Kebede, Linda Tripp, and Teri Whitcraft.

Lloyd-Jones was educated at Westminster School where he developed an interest in Modern History before being converted to Classics by his Headmaster, J. T. Christie.Obituary in The Times 9 October 2009 He pursued undergraduate and postgraduate studies at Christ Church, Oxford. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, during which he learned Japanese and served in the Intelligence Corps in India, turning down the opportunity to work at Bletchley Park to serve in Burma. He ended the War as a Captain. Lloyd-Jones took a first degree in Greats in 1948 and gained several University prizes. For a while he was a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and while there met his first wife, Frances Hedley, a Classics student at Newnham College, whom he married in 1953. The couple had two sons and a daughter and were divorced in 1981. In 1951 Lloyd-Jones returned to Oxford where he became the first holder of the E. P. Warren Praelectorship at Corpus. Lloyd-Jones supervised many distinguished D. Phil. students, including Martin Litchfield West. In his inaugural address as Regius Professor in 1961 he called for a reduction in the emphasis laid on composition taught to undergraduates and suggested that Honour Moderations might have to be reformed to encompass studies taken from ancient philosophy and history as well as the traditional literature and language. He contributed editions of Menander's Dyscolus (1960) and of Sophocles (1990, together with Nigel Wilson) to the Oxford Classical Texts, and editions and translations of the Aeschylean fragments (1960) and of Sophocles (2000) to the Loeb Classical Library. Lloyd-Jones was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1966British Academy fellowship record and was a member of five foreign academies, holding honorary doctorates from the universities of Chicago, Tel Aviv, Göttingen and Thessaloniki. His retirement from the Regius Chair in 1989, after twenty-nine years, was marked by a knighthood. He married his second wife Mary R. Lefkowitz, Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, in 1982, and spent his last 27 years at their home in Wellesley.

Biography Mann joined the Army from Seattle, Washington in August 1942,WWII Army Enlistment Records and by September 18, 1944 was serving as a private first class in Company H, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. On that day, in Best, the Netherlands, he single-handedly destroyed an enemy emplacement and continued to fire on the enemy from an exposed position until being wounded. Despite his wounds, he insisted on serving guard duty during the night. The next morning, during an enemy attack, Mann smothered the blast of a hand grenade with his body, sacrificing himself to protect those around him. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor a year later, on August 30, 1945. Mann, aged 22 at his death, was buried in Greenwood Memorial Terrace, Spokane, Washington.

His 1956 revue, Four Below, has been characterized as \\"the first legitimate cafe revue in New York City\\"Gavin, James.Intimate Nights, The Golden Age of New York Cabaret. New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1991. Biography Monk was born into a well-heeled and well-established family of North Carolina. After training at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, he earned his living playing piano in New York City and France, then became manager (1942) of the New York nightclub Le Ruban Bleu, owned by his associate Herbert Jacoby. In 1956, Monk left that establishment for San Francisco's the hungry i, where he did duty as master of ceremonies. Soon, however, Murray Grand, new manager of the Downstairs Room (formerly the Purple Onion), recalled Monk to Manhattan. On March 4, 1956, his opening revue, Four Below (starring Dody Goodman) was a triumph. (It was characterized as \\"the first legitimate cafe revue in New York City\\" by James Gavin, author of the 1991 book Intimate Nights, The Golden Age of New York Cabaret.Gavin, James.Intimate Nights, The Golden Age of New York Cabaret. New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1991.) At the new venue (officially: the Upstairs At The Downstairs, West 56th Street) Monk then staged a succession of revues by writers such as Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt (later collaborators on The Fantasticks), Louis Botto, Sheldon Harnick, Herb Hartig, Gerry Matthews, John Meyer and Tom Poston. Monk's annual revues established the standard for New York cabaret over the following decade: Take Five (1957), Demi-Dozen (1958), Four Below Strikes Back (1959), Pieces of Eight (1959), Dressed to the Nines (1960) and 7 Come 11 (1961). Performers hired and/or cultivated by Monk include Jean Arnold, Michael Brown, Ceil Cabot, Thelma Carpenter, Pat Carroll, Imogene Coca, Jane and Gordon Connell, Blossom Dearie and Annie Ross; collaborators and associates also included Robert Downey, Sr., George Furth, Alice Ghostley, Ronny Graham, Tammy Grimes, Ellen Hanley, Bill Hinnant, Susan Johnson, Liberace, Dorothy Loudon, Portia Nelson, Bibi Osterwald, Norman Paris, Lovelady Powell, Caspar Reardon, Rex Robbins, William Roy, Maxine Sullivan, Nancy Dussault, Sylvia Syms, Fredricka Weber and Mary Louise Wilson. Friction between Monk and owner Irving Haber prompted the former to leave and in 1962 he and Thomas Hammond opened a new nightclub — the Rendezvous Room (Plaza 9) — at the Plaza Hotel. There his troupe continued with revues such as Dime A Dozen (1962), Baker's Dozen (1964), and Bits & Pieces XIV (1964). Many unknown performers who worked at Monk's cafe revues, including Ken Berry, Ruth Buzzi, and Liz Sheridan, among others, went on to achieve varying degrees of fame. Monk's last revue at the Plaza, Four In Hand, closed on 29 June 1968 after which he retired. Monk died at age 82 in August 1995 at his home in Manhattan.Mel Gussow.

White House State Floor showing the location of the Grand Staircase. White House Entrance Hall at Christmastime during George W. Bush’s administration with the Grand Staircase on the left. The Grand Staircase is the chief stairway connecting the State Floor and the Second Floor of the White House, the official home of the President of the United States. The stairway is primarily used for a ceremony called the Presidential Entrance March. The present Grand Staircase, the fourth staircase occupying the same general space, was completed in 1952 as a part of the Truman White House reconstruction. The Grand Staircase is entered on the State Floor from the Entrance Hall. Hoban and Latrobe’s staircases Though White House architect James Hoban originally located the main ceremonial staircase at the west end of the Cross Hall, he placed a staircase in the present site of the Grand Staircase in both his initial 1793 plan and 1814 reconstruction designs. No section study exists to illustrate either of Hoban’s staircases. Hoban’s original design of the Grand Staircase at the west end of the Cross Hall was altered by Benjamin Henry Latrobe in 1803 during the administration of Thomas Jefferson. Hoban envisioned the Imperial stair form with a single central stair rising from the east to a landing on the west wall with double runs returning to the east on each side. Latrobe's alteration placed a double run on either side rising from the west to a landing on the east and a single run returning west to the second floor. McKim's new Grand Staircase Charles Follen McKim's Grand Staircase looking north, northwest seen from the Cross Hall photographed during the administration of Harry Truman before reconstruction. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt engaged architect Charles Follen McKim, of the firm McKim, Mead, and White, to reconfigure and redesign the White House. McKim’s plan removed the Grand Staircase at the West End of the Cross Hall to increase the size of the State Dining Room by more than a third. McKim relocated the new Grand Staircase in the eastern end of the Cross Hall, opposite the entrance to the Green Room in the site of Hoban's less formal east staircase. McKim's Grand Staircase adopted the Imperial stair form: a central run beginning on the south and rising to a landing on the north, with double runs doubling back to the south as it rises to the second floor. Formal in plan, its relatively narrow opening into the Cross Hall limited visibility of the President, First Lady and their official guests. McKim's Grand Staircase was entered through an arched opening with the first two steps protruding into the Cross Hall. A decorated wrought iron gate on the State Floor was normally kept closed except during state ceremonies. A pair of niches flanked the center run and the first course used a heavy crimson silk cord as a decorative railing. The stair was constructed in Joliet marble and covered in a crimson stair carpet. A lantern similar to one selected by McKim for the Entrance Hall was hung above the landing. Delano, Winslow and the Truman reconstruction A maquette made by Lorenzo Winslow showing entrance to the Grand Staircase from the Entrance Hall. In the final design the bottom stairs did not project into the Entrance Hall. A maquette made by Lorenzo Winslow exploring the structure of the Grand Staircase. Plaster model by Lorenzo Winslow for the balusters of the Grand Staircase. Years of hastily made alterations, including the structural changes made by McKim and later with the addition of an attic story during the Coolidge administration, took a major physical toll on the structural integrity of the White House. Cracks appearing in walls and ceilings, and a sagging East Room ceiling in 1948 signaled that immediate attention was needed. To save the White House, President Truman set in place a process of dismantling the interior structure, constructing a load-bearing internal steel structure, and reconstructing the interior rooms within the new framework. The chief architect of the Truman White House reconstruction was William Adams Delano with a temporary Office of the White House Architect headed by Lorenzo Simmons Winslow. Truman viewed the White House reconstruction as an opportunity to address the redesign of the Great Staircase. By January 1949 Winslow had produced a design that Truman was near to approving. It closed the Cross Hall opening and reoriented the opening of the new Grand Staircase to the east wall of the Entrance Hall. In the favored design Winslow deleted the paired Roman Doric column screen. Truman sought approval of Winslow's design from the more senior Delano. Delano was dismayed by the plans and elevations and feared that dismantling the columns and the Cross Hall opening created by McKim was a serious mistake. Delano was so concerned about the design he travelled to Washington to meet with Truman and Winslow in person to work out a solution. Winslow prepared a series of detailed architectural models called maquettes to explore the design of the Grand Staircase and how it related to the Entrance Hall and Cross Hall. The paired Doric columns were retained, and an opening in the Cross Hall looking into the Grand Staircase were unanimously agreed upon. Construction of the staircase proceeded using several cream and taupe colored marbles including Vermont Westland cream. The new Grand Staircase was framed by a rectilinear archway, with the interior side walls faced with the seals of the original 13 states. Above the opening facing the Cross Hall was a plaster arch with a spread American eagle in bas relief with a corona of 13 radiating arrows. A contrasting marble string course with triglyphs and five pointed stars projected around the stairwell at the landing. Winslow designed a custom railing with cast iron balusters that incorporated the five pointed federal star within a circle he used in the carved moulding. Decoration A stair carpet in a shade of red has been used since the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. During the Kennedy restoration, the carpet was made deeper, more crimson. A mahogany pier table with gilded caryatid supports attributed to New York cabinetmaker Charles-Honoré Lannuier is located at the bottom of the stair. Portraits of 20th century presidents and first ladies hang on the walls. An English cut crystal chandelier of the mid-19th century hangs over the first landing. In 1998 Hillary Clinton working with then Curator of the White House Betty Monkman refurbished the Grand Staircase. A new carpet for the Grand Staircase and the Cross Hall was designed incorporating a border of laurel leaves and five pointed stars within a circle, a motif found in Winslow's carved marble Truman era string course entablature and in the balusters of the Grand Staircase. A more vivid red was selected, and several shaded of yellow gold. New swag and jabot drapery in the same red and yellow- gold colors were made for the staircase and Entrance Hall.

His works combined shiny curved surfaces with contrasting black welded comb of rods that held them together, a conflict of geometric and organic forms. He also made abstract figures. He soon became one of the most noted young British sculptors, with a successful one-man show at the Grosvenor and Matthiesen Galleries in the 1960s. His work can be found in the Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Council collection and various other galleries around the world — in America, Yugoslavia, New Zealand and Australia. He refused to allow one style to dominate his sculptures, even though this often alienated him from those who had supported his earlier works. He has taught at the Bath Academy in Corsham, and as the head of painting at Winchester, a visiting lecturer at Newcastle, and a Professor of Fine Art at Leicester Polytechnic.

Life and career The adopted son of Ray Brown and Ella Fitzgerald, he was born in New York City, to Fitzgerald's half-sister Frances. Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra and many others were regular visitors during his childhood.KPFT Pacifica \\"Joe's Roadhouse\\" Broadcast December 8, 2007 After moving to California when he was 10, Ray discovered a passion for the drums and for singing. He attended Beverly Hills High School where he sang with school groups which toured at local festivals and hospitals.Official Management Site: http://www.ShellyLiebowitz.com/rbjr.aspx His father arranged for him to study with jazz percussionists Bill Douglass and Chuck Flores. Despite his jazz roots he admits that his interest in performing rock music was an act of rebellion. \\"I used to drive my parents crazy with this. I told my father a few years before he died, you know a lot of times I played that music 'cause I just wanted to see the look on your face.\\". His mother's 1964 single \\"Ringo Beat\\" was inspired by her son's interest in rock music. He moved to Seattle in 1971, studying with another drummer, Bill Coleman Sr. It was at this time that Brown began writing songs in addition to playing drums and piano. In the late 1980s Brown toured the Pacific Northwest, Canada, Alaska, Japan, Korea and Guam performing in tours for the United States Department of Defense. This is when his daughter, Alice, was conceived and born in Ketchikan, Alaska to Rebecca Judd. Like his famous parents, Brown says he loves performing on the road. He states, > \\"I love to tour. I've been able to see a lot of the world and I just > absolutely enjoyed being able to be with different types of people, > different cultures and to see the world. It's just kind of broadened who I > am as a person, which eventually will filter down into the music, the > influences.\\" > In 2001, Brown recorded his debut album Slow Down for Love on SRI Jazz, which reached the top 50 of the Gavin Report. His second album, Committed from the Heart, was released in 2003. His sound has been described as an adult contemporary pop sound layered with R&B.; Brown wrote and arranged all the songs on both albums. Additionally in 2003, Brown debuted on the Las Vegas Strip, performing five nights a week in the Le Bistro Theater at the Riviera hotel and casino. In 2007 he released the album Stand by Me. In September 2008, Ray Brown Jr. released a duets album, Friends and Family, produced by Shelly Liebowitz, on SRI Jazz, a division of SRI Records. Vocal artists on this album include Jane Monheit, Melba Moore, James Moody, Maria Muldaur, Dr. John, Dionne Warwick, Freda Payne, Sophie B. Hawkins, Paul Williams, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Dave Somerville, Kim Hoyer, and Sally Kellerman. Additional instrumental performances appear on some of the album tracks with artists David \\"Fathead\\" Newman, and jazz vibraphonist Terry Gibbs. Also included on the album is Brown's second daughter who went by the stage name 'Haylee' singing \\"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\\", which was made famous by her grandmother. There is also a bonus track with Brown's parents in a live version of \\"How High the Moon\\" with Ella Fitzgerald and Brown Jr. on vocals and Ray Brown playing bass. In 1998, Brown attended the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation ceremony honoring his mother, Ella Fitzgerald. In 2007, he appeared in a BBC documentary talking about his mother entitled Ella Fitzgerald: First Lady of Song.

The band’s early existence (1975 to 1981) was closely linked with CBGB, a music club in the Bowery, but it reformed with many of the early members in 2003 and is currently active. History=The CBGB years, 1975–1981= The Shirts had their roots in Brooklyn, where Robert Racioppo and Artie Lamonica had been playing together on and off as early as 1970. Members of the band were gradually added (including lead singer Annie Golden) in the next three years. The band got its name when Racioppo, having just broken up his existing band, asserted his desire to form a new one, and his indifference to its name: \\"call it anything ... shirts ... pants ... shoes ... The Shirts!\\" The newly named band, eventually including nine musicians, played covers at small venues in New York until, in 1975, they went to a show at CBGB featuring Patti Smith and were inspired to play there using only their original material. The Shirts auditioned for CBGB owner Hilly Kristal which resulted in the band being hired, first to open for other bands (including Television and the Talking Heads), then to play as the headliner band. As the band honed their skills and developed new songs, they played at such other local venues as Max's Kansas City. Like many of the bands championed by Kristal, their sound was actually more pop and dance-oriented than the \\"art bands\\" that became famous in association with CBGB.Lee, Steven. The Heebie-Jeebies at CBGB: a Secret History of Jewish Punk (Chicago Review Press, 2006), p. 78 Although little interest was initially shown in the band by American record labels,See, for instance, This Must be the Place: The Adventures of the Talking Heads in the Twentieth Century (HarperCollins, 2001), p. 70. The Shirts were featured on a double compilation album featuring the major bands of the CBGB scene in the mid-70s, Live at CBGB. However, Nick Mobbs at EMI (who had signed the Sex Pistols to the label) signed the band to EMI's Harvest label in the fall of 1977, and assigned Mike Thorne (who had also worked on Sex Pistols albums) to produce their first album. Largely for corporate purposes, the band was signed by EMI in conjunction with its US subsidiary label, Capitol Records, which had initially passed on signing the band. This formality would eventually have a significant impact on the band’s early history. The first album, The Shirts, was recorded in London (while lead singer Golden commuted back to the US to shoot Miloš Forman’s screen version of Hair) and released in 1978, and became very popular in Europe, the single Tell Me Your Plans charting in the top five in the Netherlands for example. The band went on to tour Europe opening for Peter Gabriel, at his request. Thorne chose to record the band’s second album, Streetlight Shine (1979), at Mediasound Studio in New York City. The resulting sound was much more eclectic than their debut album, and the album was again a financial and critical success in Europe, the single Laugh and Walk Away again charting high in the Netherlands. However, breakthrough in the US market continued to elude the band. For the third album, Capitol Records made a deal with EMI in which the band would be signed solely to Capitol. Now under Capitol’s management rather than Thorne’s, recording went poorly and the resulting album, Inner Sleeve (1980), was not properly supported by the label, only 10,000 copies being pressed. It was a signal failure for the band, and although they continued playing for another two years, the large band (nine members at its height) had been reduced to four players, and essentially broke up in 1981. =Reunions and reformation, 1994 to present= The band members, some of whom had stayed in the music business, reunited twice in the 1990s to play benefits for CBGB, which periodically suffered tax issues. Efforts were made to reform the band, which included early auditions with Golden, who had established a career in film and on stage, and two other female singers, Caren Messing and Kathy McCloskey, who had worked with Racioppo in another band. Golden ultimately decided not to join the reformed band, and Messing and McCloskey together took the female lead. The reformed band first played for the public at CBGB in May 2003, and continue to perform periodically. In 2006, The Shirts recorded and released their first album in over 25 years at the studio Thorne had opened. It was titled, Only the Dead Know Brooklyn. As of 2014, both Racippo and Lamonica have spin off projects. 'Bob of the Shirts', with Zeeek on drums, released their first album, Townie, on Rottentotoof Records. Artie Lamonica formed 'Rome 56', whose recordings are online.

It is also part of the Harris Federation. Haling Manor High School was one of only fifteen schools in the country to be awarded specialist status as a music school. History Before becoming an 'Academy' the school was named Haling Manor High School. There were two wings to the school for many years: Pampisford Wing which was originally Croydon Secondary Technical School; and the Kendra Wing which was originally South Croydon Secondary Modern School. Origins went further back to what was Waddon Secondary School. (There was a famous entry in the punishment book from that era: 'X' received 6 strokes of the cane for letting off a paper bag during an air raid' - cited by Michael Round, previously headmaster.) The first headteacher of Haling Manor was a Mr. Fox (not to be confused with Richard Fox, Head of Science and Senior Master who spent his entire career at the school) and the first Deputy Head was J.R.Piper. Michael Round replaced Fox and was headmaster 1975-1996 (21 years). His then deputy, John Troake, took over, and was succeeded by Esther Bauman, until August 2009 when the school was passed to the Harris Foundation. Up until 31 August 2009, the school was a comprehensive Secondary High School. From 1 September 2009, it became part of the Harris Federation of schools, and was renamed to Harris Academy Purley, under the leadership of Carol-Anne Alcock. Alcock had previously been the headteacher at Selsdon High School. Despite its name, the school is situated in South Croydon, not Purley. Performance The school had a GCSE pass rate of 23% achieving 5 A*-C grades (as of July 2009) including English and Maths and had one of the highest achievement rates in the capital when taking into account CVA (contextual value added) meaning that from relatively low prior attainment pupils show good levels of progress. As Haling Manor High School (Headmaster: Mr John Troake MA) 76% of all year 11 students left in 2008 with 5 A* - C grades, above the national average. 41% of all children left the school with a modern foreign language grade A*-C in 2009 again beating most Croydon schools and the national average. The school is ranked 78th in the country for CVA. This ranks the school in the top 3% of schools for the amount of progress students make. .

A recent long poem is At the Tate Modern. His translations of the Bengali poets Rabindranath Tagore and Jibanananda Das are published by Carcanet Press, and his versions in modern English of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf and the Middle English poem Pearl are with Sussex Academic Press. SAP has also published Two Loves I Have: a new reading of Shakespeare’s Sonnets and Hide Fox, and All After: What lies concealed in Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'? Biography Winter was born in 1943 and educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford and Exeter College, Oxford. He taught English in London comprehensive schools from 1967 to 1994, when he went to live in Calcutta, India (now Kolkata), returning to England in 2006. While in India he taught part-time in a variety of schools, wrote articles of literary and general interest (in particular for The Statesman of Kolkata), and translated a number of volumes of the poetry and prose of Rabindranath Tagore and the poetry of Jibanananda Das from the Bengali original (see website Publications), having learnt Bengali during the period. Back in England he continues to teach, and now does so part-time. He has never stopped writing poetry. Literary works Winter began to write poetry in 1961. His first book publication was A Miracle and the Tree with Anvil Press in 1972. While in India he wrote literary articles and general essays for the press, in particular The Statesman of Kolkata. Writers Workshop of Kolkata has brought out all his original poetry (currently 21 volumes). Winter is gradually uploading all his original poetry onto his website. Calcutta poems Winter composed a number of poems during his Calcutta life some of which have been published under the title Guest and Host. The book cover suggests they record 'the experience of being welcomed into the household of another country'. They appear to deal with the commonplace and to touch on the numinous. The volume comprises four long poems. The first is a sonnet-sequence, Guest and Host; the next, Earthquake at Kutch, is a response in five parts to the 2001 disaster in Gujarat. The Undefeated is a first- person Memoir of an old Indian Infantry Officer of the British Raj (so subtitled at the subject's request). The concluding poem, Meditation on the Goddess, is an exploration of the annual festival in celebration of the goddess Durga in the state of West Bengal. The last-mentioned poem begins: > Goddess, Durga, lightning-eyed in the dark fortnight of the moon, mother, > daughter, maiden, bride, come. Invisibly you ride a lion to the noble house > of first belonging. Mountainous it is, and river-full, and wide. Come Grant > me beauty, glory, fame and destroy my enemy. Mother Durga, who appears like > the sun at burning noon, whose sidelong looks will hurtle spears through > enemy hearts --- yet whose light rears the heart in pure leaf --- come to > us, revisiting your first-born house. We wait in joy, we wait in tears. Come > Grant me beauty, glory, fame and destroy my enemy. Translations In addition to poetry of his own, Winter has published translations of Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali (as Song Offerings), Lipika and other works. Gitanjali is Nobel Laureate Tagore's most famous volume: Winter's was the first lyrical poem-by-poem rendition of the entire Bengali original. In collaboration with Devadatta Joardar he has also translated Tagore's autobiographical essays Atmaparichay under the title Of Myself.Of Myself (Atmaparichay) by Rabindranath Tagore tr. Devadatta Joardar and Joe Winter Winter translated Rupasi Bangla of poet Jibanananda Das under the title of Bengal the Beautiful. Further versions of his of the poems of Jibanananda have been collected in the volume Naked Lonely Hand. He has also rendered 25 of the songs of Lalan Fakir into English. Winter's The Golden Boat (title derived from Tagore's Bengali volume Sonaar Tori), a wide-ranging collection of Tagore poems in English translation, has been published by Anvil Press (now with Carcanet Press). The texts of Winter's translations are available from the relevant publishers (see website). In addition versions of a few ballads of the mediaeval French poet Francois Villon and some poems from the Bengali of Rachana Kobira appear in the volumes of his original poetry, respectively Zimbabwe in August and Lalon Fakir at the Kolkata Book Fair.  Publications  Writers Workshop, Kolkata, have brought out all of Winter's original poetry in 21 books (to date). He published Calcutta Song (Sahitya Samsad Kolkata and Peridot Press UK) which is an account in prose and poetry of living in Kolkata for twelve years. He has translated a notable amount of Bengali poetry into English. This includes: Gitanjali (the full original Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore), The Golden Boat (a selection of Tagore's poems from first to last), Of Myself (Tagore's Atmaparichay, co-translated with Devadatta Joardar), Naked Lonely Hand (a selection of the poems of Jibanananda Das), Bengal the Beautiful (translation of Rupasi Bangla by Jibanananda Das), Dark (poems of Susmita Bhattacharya) and Lipika (a volume of prose poems and short stories by Tagore). Carcanet Press has his Tagore and Das translations, and Guest and Host and A Miracle and The Tree.

Women held special status in the Marcosian communities; they were regarded as prophetesses and participated in administering the Eucharistic rites. Irenaeus accuses Marcus of seducing his followers, and scornfully writes (Adversus Haereses I. 13, 4) that the whole sect was an affair of \\"silly women.\\" The Marcosian system was a variation of that of Valentinus. It retained the 30 Aeons, but called them \\"Greatnesses\\" and gave them numerical values. It kept the myth of the fall of Sophia but called it a \\"Divine Deficiency\\". Unique to it was the adaptation of the Pythagorean number theory (Isopsephy) to Gnosticism. System Marcus holds his knowledge to be the product of a divine revelation of the body of the Anthropos: =Theory of letters= Sometimes Marcus counts the number of letters in a name, sometimes he reckons up the sum total, when to each letter is given its value in the Greek arithmetical notation: sometimes he uses a method which enables him to find still deeper mysteries. Marcus points out that if we take a single letter, Δ, and write its name at full length, δέλτα, we get five letters; but we may write again the names of these at full length and get a number of letters more, and so on ad infinitum. If the mysteries contained in a single letter be thus infinite, what must be the immensity of those contained in the name of the Propator. Concerning this name he gives the following account:—When the first Father, who is above thought and without substance, willed the unspeakable to become spoken, and the invisible to become formed, He opened His mouth and emitted a Word like Himself, which being the form of the invisible, declared to Himself what He was. His name consisted of four syllables successively uttered, of four, four, ten, and twelve letters respectively. It might appear as if we were to understand as the first of these the word ἀρχή; and this name of four syllables and thirty letters seems to correspond to a description of the system of thirty Aeons divided into two Tetrads, a Decad, and a Dodecad. Each letter is one of the Aeons, and contains within itself an infinity of mysteries. Each letter makes its own sound, it knows not the sound of the adjacent letter, nor of the whole, but the restitution of all things will take place when all the letters are brought to make the same sound, and then a harmony will result of which we have an image in that made when we all sound the Amen together. This comparison shows an interesting point of agreement in liturgical usage between the Gnostics of the 2nd century and the Roman church of the time of Jerome, whose well-known words are \\"ad similitudinem caelestis tonitrui Amen reboat.\\" What is stated about the limited knowledge of each Aeon may be compared with what Hippolytus of Rome tells of the Docetae (viii. 10). =Tetrad= The Pythagorean Tetrad.Hemenway, Priya. Divine Proportion: Phi In Art, Nature, and Science. Sterling Publishing Company Inc., 2005. Marcus pushes into further details his designation of the Aeons as letters of the alphabet. There are twenty-four letters in the alphabet, and twenty-four is the sum of the letters of the names of the first tetrad: *The Unspeakable (ἄῤῥητος) *Silence (σειγή) *Father (πατήρ) *Truth (ἀλήθεια) Followed by those of the second tetrad: *Word (λόγος) *Life (ζωή) *Man (ἄνθρωπος) *Church (ἐκκλησία) These form the Ogdoad. Again, the Greek alphabet consists of nine mutes, eight semivowels, and seven vowels. The mutes belong to Father and Truth (The Unspeakable, and Silence, of course, do not count); these being mute reveal nothing to man. The semivowels belong to Word and Life, but the vowels to Man and Church, since it was a voice coming through Man which gave power to all. For the seven heavens, we are told, utter each its own vowel sound, the first A and so on; and it was the sound of their united doxology borne to the earth, which gave generation to all things on the earth. By the descent of Him who was with the Father from the nine into the seven, the groups of Aeons were equalized and perfect harmony produced. =Ἰησοῦς= In the Greek arithmetical notation eight letters are used to denote units, eight tens, and eight hundreds: total 888; but this is exactly the numerical value of the letters in the name Ἰησοῦς. Similarly, the Α and Ω is identified with the περιστερά which descended on Jesus, the numerical value being in both cases 801. Other mysteries are found in the six letters of the name Ἰησοῦς (see Episemon, below), the eight letters of χρειστός, which again added to the four of Υίος make twelve. These, however, are only the spoken names known to ordinary Christians; the unspoken names of Jesus and Christ are of twenty-four and thirty letters respectively. Either Hippolytus, or an early copyist of his, makes an attempt to solve the mystery of the unspoken names by writing at full length the letters of the name χρειστός; χεῖ, ῥώ, εἴ, ἰῶτα, σίγμα, ταῦ, οὐ, σάν; but we have here only twenty-four letters instead of thirty, so we must be content to remain in ignorance of what would seem to have been one of the most valuable secrets of this sect. =Aeons= To understand the generation of the thirty Aeons from the Ogdoad, we have only to take the first eight numbers and add them up, leaving out six—for it is the Episemon and not a letter of the usual Greek alphabet:— > 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 30 Again, we find the fall of the twelfth Aeon, Sophia, indicated in the alphabet; for Λ, which arithmetically denotes 30, the number of the Aeons, is only the eleventh letter in the alphabet. But it set about to seek another like itself, and so the next letter is M, or ΛΛ. Again, add up the numerical value of all the letters of the alphabet ending with λ and we have ninety- nine; that is deficiency, a number still counted on the left hand, which they who have \\"knowledge\\" escape by following after the one which, added to ninety- nine, transfers them to the right hand. The reader will remember Juvenal's \\"jam dextera computat annos.\\" =Episemon= Even numbers are female, odd numbers male, by the union of the first of these, 2 and 3, was begotten the Episemon, or 6, the number of Salvation. In the account of his system given by Irenaeus (I. xiv.), copied by Hippolytus (Ref. vi. 45) and by Epiphanius (Haer. 34), τὸ ἐπίσημον is repeatedly used to denote the numerical character for six; the number 6 is ὁ ἐπίσημος ἀριθμός; the six-lettered name Ἰησοῦς is τὸ ἐπίσημον ὄνομα, etc., language perplexing to the old Latin translator, who renders the word by \\"insignis.\\" A similar use of the word is found in Clement of Alexandria (Strom. vi. 16); but this cannot be called a quite independent illustration, for the coincidences are found to be such as to put it beyond doubt that Clement, in his account of the mysteries of the number 6, makes unacknowledged use of the same writings of Marcus as were employed by Irenaeus. Eusebius (Quaest. ad Marin. Mai, Nov. Pat. Bib. iv. 299), copied by Jerome or Pseudo-Jerome (Brev. in Psal. 77, vii. 198, ed. Vallars.), suggests, as a way of reconciling the difference between the evangelists as to whether the Lord suffered at the third or the sixth hour, that a transcriber's error may have arisen from the likeness of Gamma and the Episemon, i.e. apparently Γ and Ϝ. The source whence all modern writers have learned their use of the word episemon is Joseph Justus Scaliger's essay on the origin of the Ionic letters. He there quotes as from Bede, de Indigitatione, a statement of an old grammarian, who, having mentioned that the Greeks denote numbers by letters, and for this purpose join to the letters of their alphabet three other characters, goes on as follows:— > Prima est ς quae dicitur Episimon et est nota numeri VI.; secunda est G quae > vocatur kophe et valet in numero XC.; tertia est ϡ quae dicitur enneacosia > quia valent DCCCC. Here, as well as in the preceding passages, episemon is used with special reference to the character for six; but Scaliger turns into Greek the phrase \\"nota numeri VI.\\" τὸ ἐπίσημον τοῦ ἑξ ἀριθμοῦ, and seems to have inferred that the marks for the numbers 90 and 900 had equal rights to the same title; and he also gives the name Episemon to each of the six Phoenician letters said not to have been received by the Ionians, saying, for instance, that the letter ἧτα was originally an episemon, and distinguishing between the episemon of the number 6 and the digamma or episemon of Vau. He does not name his authority for this way of speaking; nor do we know that the character which was by some called βαῦ, and by others τὸ ἐπίσημον, was ever called by any one before Scaliger by the combination ἐπίσημον βαῦ. However this may be, Scaliger has been followed by all who have written on the subject since his time. The true account of these three characters seems to be that though the Phoenicians themselves did not use the letters of their alphabet for purposes of numeration, the Greeks, who derived their alphabet from them, did so in the 5th century BC; that their alphabet then still contained two of the Phoenician letters which in the next century were disused, viz., βαῦ in the sixth place, and κόππα, the Roman Q, coming after π; that these letters then took their natural place in the system of numeration, which was afterwards made complete by the addition, at the end of the letters of the alphabet, of another character to denote 900, which from its shape was at a considerably later period called σανπῖ.Hankel, Geschichte der Mathematik, p. 34; Kirchhoff, Studien zur Geschichte des gr. Alphab. The character for six had not come to be identified with the abbreviation for στ in the time of Marcus, as known through Hippolytus. In calculating the numerical value of χρειστός he counts the σ and τ separately; and he calls the former s Sigma, and the latter San. It is possible that Marcus expressly identified his episemon with the digamma, for though in Irenaeus, the reading is undoubtedly διπλο γράμματα, the context gives probability to Dr. Hort's conjecture that Marcus wrote γάμματα. He says that this number added to the number of the twenty-four letters makes thirty. Now the double letters are already included in the twenty-four, but the Digamma stands outside the alphabet, and therefore its number might properly be added to that of the letters. =Six= With regard to the properties of the number 6, Marcus and Clement were in part indebted to Philo of Alexandria, who explains (De Op. Mund. 3) that it is the first perfect number, i.e., according to Euclid's definition, one equal to the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3 which divide it without remainder (Aug. de Civ. Dei, xi. 30), the second such number being 28, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 (Orig. t. 28 in S. Joann.); that being 2 × 3 it arises from the marriage of a male and female, i.e., odd and even number; that there are six directions of motion, forward, backward, right, left, up, down; etc. Marcus observed that * The world was made in six days * In the new dispensation Jesus after six days went up to the Mount of Transfiguration * There, by the appearance of Moses and Elijah, the number of His company became six * He suffered at the sixth hour of the sixth day of the week And thence concludes that this number has the power not only of production, but of regeneration. As seven is the number of the heavens, and eight is the supercelestial ogdoad, so six denotes the material creation (see also Heracleon); and, in particular, the material body through which the Saviour revealed Himself to men's senses, and conveyed to them that enlightenment of their ignorance in which redemption consisted. Clement, if not Marcus, finds the Saviour's higher nature represented by the episemon, which is not taken into account by one who looks merely at the order of the letters in the alphabet, but reveals itself in the system of numeration. Irenaeus points out that the mysteries of Marcus all depend on the employment of the modern form of the Greek alphabet, and that they disappear when a Semitic alphabet is used. He shows also (ii. 24) that it is possible to say as fine things about the properties of the number 5 as about those of the numbers which are glorified by Marcus. Practices The Marcosians had formulae and sacraments of redemption. If so great mysteries were contained in names, it naturally followed that to know the right name of each celestial power was a matter of vital importance; and such knowledge the teachers promised to bestow. Others held that these applications could not procure spiritual redemption—only by knowledge (gnosis) could such redemption be effected. =Baptism and Trinitarian Baptismal Formula= Eusebius of Caesarea writes that the Marcosians baptised people \\"Into the name of the unknown father of the universe, into truth, the mother of all things, into the one that descended upon Jesus.\\"Eusebius of Caesarea, Ecclesiastical History iv. 11. This may show that the Trinitarian baptismal formula existed at least at that time, and probably earlier,St. Justin Martyr, 1st Apology lxi. and that the Marcosians adopted it as their own. Marcus taught that the baptism of the visible Jesus was but for the forgiveness of sins, but that the redemption of Christ, who in that baptism descended, was for perfection; the one was merely psychical, the other spiritual. Of the latter are interpreted the words in which Jesus spoke of another baptism (; ). Some conferred this redemption by baptism with special invocations; others went so far as to reject Christian baptism and to substitute a mixture of oil and water which they poured over the head of the candidate. By confirmation the Gnostics intended not so much to give the Holy Ghost as to seal the candidates against the attacks of the Archons, by which the initiated would after death become incomprehensible and invisible, and leaving their bodies in this lower creation and their souls with the Demiurge, ascend in their spirits to the Pleroma. Probably the Egyptian religion contributed this element to Gnosticism. Some of these Marcosian formulae were in Hebrew, of which Irenaeus has preserved specimens much corrupted by copyists. =Eucharist= A knowledge of astrology was among Marcus's accomplishments, and apparently some chemical knowledge, with which he gained a reputation of magical skill. The eucharistic cup of mingled wine and water was seen under his invocation to change to a purple red; and his disciples were told that this was because the great Charis (Grace) had dropped some of her blood into the cup. Sometimes he would hand the cup to women, and bid them in his presence pronounce the eucharistic words: Then he would pour from their consecrated cup into a much larger one held by himself, and the liquor, miraculously increased at this prayer, would be seen to rise up and fill the larger vessel. =Prophecy= Marcus taught his female disciples to prophesy. Casting lots at their meetings, he would command her on whom the lot fell boldly to utter the words which were suggested to her mind, and such words were accepted by the hearers as prophetic utterances.

Plot Robin Ramzinski, better known by his ring name Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, is a professional wrestler who became a celebrity in the 1980s. Now past his prime, Randy wrestles on weekends for independent promotions in New Jersey while working part-time at a supermarket under Wayne, a demeaning manager who mocks Randy's wrestling background. As a regular at a strip club, Randy befriends a stripper named Cassidy, who is, like Randy, too old for her job. After winning a local match, Randy agrees to a proposed 20th- anniversary rematch with his most notable opponent, \\"The Ayatollah\\", which could bring him back to stardom. Randy intensifies his training, which includes steroid injections. After wrestling in a hardcore match, Randy suffers a heart attack backstage and undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery. His doctor tells him that he nearly died and has to stop the steroids. Feeling that he is unable to wrestle in his present condition, Randy decides to retire and begins working a full-time shift at the supermarket's deli counter. At Cassidy's suggestion, Randy visits his estranged daughter Stephanie, whom he had abandoned when she was a child, but she rebuffs him. While helping Randy buy a gift for Stephanie, Cassidy reveals that she has a son. Randy makes romantic advances toward her, which she rejects on the grounds of her job. Later, Randy gives the gift to his daughter and apologizes for abandoning her. The two bond over a visit to a beachfront boardwalk (where he took her as a child) and agree to meet for dinner on the coming Saturday. Randy goes to Cassidy's strip club to thank her, but she once more rejects him, resulting in a heated exchange. Upset, Randy goes to see a wrestling match and finds solace in his wrestling friends. While at a bar with them, he gets drunk, snorts cocaine, has sex with a woman in the women's restroom then wakes up in her bedroom the next morning. Exhausted, he sleeps the entire next day and misses his dinner with Stephanie. He goes to her house to apologize, but she angrily tells him she never wants to see him again. At the deli counter, a patron recognizes Randy as the wrestler, though he denies it. The customer persists, which agitates Randy, who then cuts his hand on the slicer and goes into a rampage in the store, hurling abuse at Wayne and the customers. Spurred by the fan's recognition of him and with nothing left, Randy decides to return to wrestling and reschedules the rematch with The Ayatollah. He reconciles with Cassidy, though she begs him not to wrestle because of his heart condition and pleads with him to cancel the match in favor of giving the outside world a second chance. However, Randy disregards her advice and explains to her that he belongs in the ring with his fans and fellow wrestlers who, unlike the rest of society, love and respect him. As he wrestles, Randy begins to feel chest pain and becomes unsteady. The Ayatollah notices this and urges him to initiate the pin. Randy refuses, however, and climbs the top rope for his signature finishing move, a diving headbutt called the \\"Ram Jam\\". He looks over and sees Cassidy has left. With tears in his eyes he salutes his beloved fans one last time, and leaps from the top rope. Cast Rourke's performance in the film gave renewed interest to his career. * Mickey Rourke as Robin Ramzinski / Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson * Marisa Tomei as Pam / Cassidy * Evan Rachel Wood as Stephanie Ramzinski * Mark Margolis as Lenny * Todd Barry as Wayne * Judah Friedlander as Scott * Ernest Miller as Bob / \\"The Ayatollah\\" * Ajay Naidu as Medic * Wass Stevens as Nick * John D'Leo as Adam * Gregg Bello as Larry * Armin Amiri as Dr. Moayedizadeh Professional wrestlers who appeared in the film include: Andrew Anderson, Robbie E, Necro Butcher, Nick Berk, The Blue Meanie, Sabian, Nate Hatred, Ron Killings, L.A.

Production Scenes where Rourke and Wood's characters try to bond were filmed on the Asbury Park boardwalk. The Wrestler was written by Robert D. Siegel, a former writer for The Onion, and entered development at director Darren Aronofsky's Protozoa Pictures. Nicolas Cage entered negotiations in October 2007 to star as Randy. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. According to Aronofsky, Cage pulled out of the movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke as the lead character. Aronofsky stated that Cage was \\"a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.\\" In a 2009 interview with Access Hollywood, Cage denied this allegation, stating that \\"I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do.\\" When first approached for the lead role, Rourke was initially reluctant, stating that \\"I didn't really care for the script, but I wanted to work with Darren and I kind of thought that whoever wrote the script hadn't spent as much time as I had around these kind of people and he wouldn't have spoken the way the dude was speaking. And, so Darren let me rewrite all my parts and he put the periods in and crossed the T's. So once we made that change I was okay with it.\\" Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan claimed in 2012 on The Howard Stern Show that he was also offered the role of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. Hogan claims he turned down the role because he felt he wasn't the right man to portray the character. Aronofsky disputed Hogan's claims, stating on his personal Twitter page that, \\"...the role of the Wrestler was always (Rourke's) it was never Hulk Hogan's as he claims on (Howard Stern.)\\" The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008, with filming taking place throughout New Jersey in Elizabeth, Hasbrouck Heights, Garfield, Asbury Park, Linden, Rahway, Roselle Park, Dover, a supermarket in Bayonne where Rourke served and improvised with real customers,\\"'The Wrestler' Director Darren Aronofsky\\" downloaded interview/no transcript \\"TIFF Interview\\" by James Rocchi, Cinematical.com, 9 September 2008.

Retrieved on 2010-11-21. The shoot wrapped up in March. Afa Anoa'i, a former professional wrestler, was hired to train Rourke for his role. Anoa'i brought his two main trainers, Jon Trosky and Tom Farra, to work with Rourke for eight weeks. Both trainers also have parts in the film. One scene features a fictional Nintendo Entertainment System video game called Wrestle Jam '88. It starred the characters of Robinson and The Ayatollah. Aronofsky requested a fully functioning game for the actors to play. Programmer Randall Furino and the film's title designer Kristyn Hume created a playable demo with a working interface and AI routines that also featured 1980s era-appropriate graphics and music. To add more realism, the locker room scenes were improvised for Rourke and others to look as if they were actually socializing. Some of the deli scenes were improvised because Aronofsky was filming Rourke actually working there. The final match between Ram and Ayatollah was in a Ring of Honor ring. =Music= Unlike Aronofsky's previous films—which featured original scores by Clint Mansell—The Wrestler has a soundtrack of pre-recorded pop music, most of it glam metal acts such as Ratt. Clint Mansell, the composer for Aronofsky's previous films, π, Requiem for a Dream, and The Fountain, reprised his role as composer for The Wrestler. Slash played the guitars on the score. A new Bruce Springsteen song, also titled \\"The Wrestler\\", plays over the film's closing credits. Springsteen wrote the song while on tour in Europe after receiving a letter and a copy of the script from Rourke. The Guns N' Roses song \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" is played during Randy's ring entrance at the end of the film. In his Golden Globe Award acceptance speech, Rourke mentioned that Axl Rose donated the song for free due to the film's modest budget, and the film's closing credits thank Rose for this.Golden Globes – All Videos – Newest – Video . NBC.com (2010-07-19). Retrieved on 2010-11-21. Rourke had used the same song as his intro music during his stint as a boxer in the early 1990s. Randy even mocks one of Axl Rose's biggest rivals in the popular music scene of the early 1990s: Kurt Cobain. Also featured in the film are two Ratt songs (\\"Round and Round\\" and \\"I'm Insane\\"), the Quiet Riot song \\"Metal Health\\" (which is Randy's entrance song except for the last match), the FireHouse song \\"Don't Walk Away\\", the Slaughter song \\"Dangerous\\", the Scorpions song \\"Animal Magnetism\\", \\"Balls to the Wall\\" by Accept, \\"Soundtrack to a War\\" by Rhino Bucket and the Cinderella song \\"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)\\". The two Ratt tunes are actually recordings by Rat Attack, a project featuring Ratt lead singer Stephen Pearcy and guitarists George Lynch (Dokken) and Tracii Guns (L.A. Guns). The Madonna song \\"Jump\\" is played in the bar scene. The Birdman and Lil Wayne song \\"Stuntin' Like My Daddy\\" can be heard in the strip club. Also in the film is a song called \\"Let Your Freak Out\\" by independent Toronto singer- songwriter Deesha which can be heard during the strip club scene where Marisa Tomei's character is having an emotional conversation with Mickey Rourke's character. In the Toronto International Film Festival interview conducted by James Rocchi, Aronofsky credited the 1957 Charles Mingus song \\"The Clown\\", an instrumental piece with a poem read over the music about a clown who accidentally discovers the bloodlust of the crowds and eventually kills himself in performance, as a major source of inspiration for the movie. Aronofsky also said the brief reprise of Senator and Presidential-candidate John McCain's \\"Bomb bomb Iran\\" to the tune of The Beach Boys' \\"Barbara Ann\\" in the movie evolved as improvisation on the set. The Ayatollah wrestling character's persona had developed more than 20 years before but, in part through this musical moment and its connection with the character, came to still feel appropriate to Aronofsky in 2008.\\"'The Wrestler' Director Darren Aronofsky\\" downloaded interview/no transcript \\"TIFF Interview\\" by James Rocchi, Cinematical.com, Sep 9th 2008 10:02PM. Retrieved 1-26-09. Mickey Rourke appeared at WrestleMania XXV to promote The Wrestler. =Promotion= WWE helped promote it through an on-screen angle (a fictional storyline used in wrestling). This involved the heel Chris Jericho criticizing legendary retired wrestlers such as Ric Flair, who he felt were embarrassing themselves, as well as Mickey Rourke for his portrayal in The Wrestler. At the 15th Screen Actors Guild Awards, Rourke announced he would be competing at WrestleMania XXV, specifically targeting Jericho. The announcement led to a confrontation between the two on Larry King Live, which showed signs of second thoughts from Rourke. On January 28, it was announced through Rourke's spokesperson that the actor would not compete at the event, and he was soon after announced instead as a guest. Rourke was also invited to the 2009 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony the night before WrestleMania. The angle culminated the following night where Jericho faced Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, and Jimmy Snuka in a handicap match. After his victory, Jericho dismantled Flair and challenged Rourke, who finally entered the ring and punched him out. Flair then congratulated Rourke. Reception The Wrestler received universal critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 98% of critics gave the film positive reviews based upon a sample of 231 reviews, with an average rating of 8.44/10, and gave it a Golden Tomato for best drama of 2008. The critical consensus states that \\"Mickey Rourke gives a performance for the ages in The Wrestler, a richly affecting, heart-wrenching yet ultimately rewarding drama.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 80, based on 36 reviews, signifying \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Alonso Duralde, of MSNBC, said, \\"Rourke's work transcends mere stunt-casting; his performance is a howl of pain that seems to come from a very real place.\\" Todd McCarthy, of Variety, said, \\"Rourke creates a galvanizing, humorous, deeply moving portrait that instantly takes its place among the great, iconic screen performances.\\" Ben Mankiewicz, from At the Movies, said, \\"To put it simply, this is the best film I've seen this year.\\" Le Monde praised the film for melding European film style with an American plot, and stated that \\"Mickey Rourke's performance in 'The Wrestler' is a continuous celebration of the burdens and splendors of the profession of performance.\\"Le Monde review , the quoted translation from this article on The New Yorker website (One other French film critic, Philippe Azoury, praised its portrayal of \\"the American heartland\\" as what he viewed as a bleak wasteland.) Although The Wrestler was not technically in Roger Ebert's \\"Best Films\\" list, he includes a note at the bottom of his review: \\"'The Wrestler' is one of the year's best films. It wasn't on my 'best films' list for complicated and boring reasons.\\" Roddy Piper was one of several professional wrestlers to voice his approval for the film and was later featured on a Blu-ray extra commenting on its authenticity. =Professional wrestling industry reception= Prominent wrestling figures have commented on the film. During an NPR interview, Aronofsky remarked on WWE chairman Vince McMahon's feelings on The Wrestler: WWE Hall of Famer Bret \\"The Hitman\\" Hart, who was a multi-time world champion in both WWE and WCW, enjoyed The Wrestler and applauded Rourke's \\"clairvoyant\\" performance, but called the film a \\"dark misinterpretation\\" of the business. He asserted: \\"Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson was a main-eventer who sold out Madison Square Garden. So was I ...

That guy on the screen simply was Randy 'the Ram' Robinson.\\" WWE Hall of Famer \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper was said to have been highly emotional after watching a screening of the film. Aronofsky said of Piper: \\"He loved it.

Insights on the film from Roddy Piper and other former pro wrestlers can be seen in Fox Searchlight Pictures's \\"Wrestler Round Table\\", which was included on the Blu-ray release of the film. Pro wrestling manager and promoter Jim Cornette criticized the film for being an unrelentingly depressing view of the professional wrestling world, saying it was neither realistic nor accurate of the profession for most wrestlers involved in it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8F3e_1YSio&t;=0s Retrieved December 19, 2016 =Top ten lists= The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. * 1st – Matt Cale, Ruthless Reviews * 1st – Ben Mankiewicz, At the Movies * 1st – Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out * 1st – Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly * 2nd – Marc Doyle, Metacritic * 2nd – Peter Hartlaub, San Francisco Chronicle * 3rd – Anthony Lane, The New Yorker * 3rd – Marc Savlov, The Austin Chronicle * 3rd – Peter Vonder Haar, Film Threat * 4th – Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times * 4th – Ben Lyons, At the Movies * 4th – David Denby, The New Yorker * 5th – James Berardinelli, ReelViews * 5th – Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle * 6th – Ty Burr, The Boston Globe * 7th – David Ansen, Newsweek * 7th – Ray Bennett, The Hollywood Reporter * 7th – V.A.

A career nurse, Gagliardi was first elected as a Democrat in 2006 to the Colorado House of Representatives. She represented House District 27, which encompasses most of Arvada, Colorado, until her defeat in the 2010 election by Republican Libby Szabo. During her time with the House of Representatives, Gagliardi served as vice-chair for two legislative committees and successfully carried 22 bills into law, predominantly on health care, state services and education, and state fiscal issues. Following the recall attempt and subsequent resignation of Senator Evie Hudak in November 2013, Gagliardi announced her intention to be appointed to the office by the Democratic vacancy committee. The committee ultimately appointed Rachel Zenzinger Biography Born in Estherville, Iowa, Gagliardi graduated from high school in 1976 and attended Iowa Lakes Community College beginning in 1976, where she earned certification as a licensed practical nurse, a certification which she holds to this day. Gagliardi, at the time a single mother, worked full-time as a surgical nurse in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Emmetsburg Community Hospital (now the Palo Alto County Hospital). Gagliardi moved to Colorado with her boys and worked for the Children's Hospital in Denver. In 1982, she also worked for the Wallace Village for Children, before beginning a 28-year career with Kaiser Permanente. =Involvement in Arvada= A resident of Arvada, Colorado, since the mid-1980s, Gagliardi has been a member of Spirit of Christ Catholic Church since 1989, where she frequently taught Sunday school. After marrying Jack Gagliardi and having her third son, Sara Gagliardi served on boards and committees in Arvada such as the accountability committee at Vanderhoof Elementary, the parent advisory committee at Drake Middle School, and the Arvada High School Boosters. She has been involved with education policy and has worked as a Cub Scout leader, a volunteer in the city, and as the chair of the Arvada Northwest Business and Professional Women's Committee. Gagliardi's joined the Service Employees International Union Local 105 during her professional career with Kaiser, as SEIU represented 5,000 similar workers in that industry. Later in her time with Kaiser, Gagliardi worked as a union steward for Local 105, monitoring and enforcing the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the company and the workers. =Political and professional career= Gagliardi entered politics working with Colorado State Senator Martha Ezzard in petitioning for the extradition of convicted murderer Daniel Arevalo. She volunteered with Gail Schoettler's gubernatorial campaign in 1998 and as senate district coordinator for Colorado State Senator Sue Windels in 2000, before running for the State House herself unsuccessfully in 2002. She has also worked on Denver and Arvada city council races, and campaigned for protecting or expanding education funding through Colorado's Amendment 23, and later Referenda C and D. Gagliardi was elected in 2006 and served four regular sessions, spanning the 66th and 67 General Assembly of the State of Colorado, from her swearing-in date in 2007 until her successor's in 2011. Gagliardi has continued her employment as a nurse during her time at the statehouse. As Colorado's General Assembly operates between the extremes of a \\"citizen legislature\\" and a \\"professional legislature\\", a non-government job is often necessary to supplement the state's pay scale.The Colorado General Assembly: Second Edition, John A. Straayer, p. 329–333 Regular legislative sessions begin annually in January and constitutionally, they must last no more than 120 days. Though some committees do work through the interim, the period from mid-May until December allows members to keep seasonal jobs. Kaiser allowed Gagliardi to take a five-month unpaid leave of absence each year to discharge her legislative duties with the understanding that she would return after the session. Through most of her time with the House of Representatives, Gagliardi worked in a Denver-area dermatology clinic, although in 2010 she was moved into the field of oncology, where she has remained through the entire campaign season and post-election until the present. Legislative career=2006 election= In 2006, Gagliardi aided by campaign manager Allen Weisheit, faced incumbent Republican Representative Bill Crane, in a rematch of the 2002 legislative elections, in which Gagliardi had received 46% of the vote against Crane and Libertarian Gregg Miller. During her 2006 run, however, she was endorsed by the Denver Post, and, in an exceptionally close election which was not decided until provisional ballots were counted, Gagliardi eventually was declared the winner, having narrowly defeated Crane by 111 votes. This was less than one half of one percent of the total votes cast in the district. The race, being the narrowest legislative election in Colorado that year, set the stage for a series of close uphill elections for Gagliardi in a district with more registered Republicans than Democrats. =2007 legislative session= In the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Gagliardi sat on the House Health and Human Services and the House Local Government Committee. Gagliardi was the prime sponsor for 8 bills in the House and 3 in the Senate during her first session. Gagliardi's most high-profile bill during the 2007 session was also her most controversial. HB-1303 was a measure to create a statewide \\"no-junk-mail\\" registry, similar to the successful National Do Not Call Registry. After opposition by some Colorado businesses and the U.S. Postal Service, the bill was killed in a House committee, at her request, to allow the measure to be revised and reintroduced in future sessions. Following the session, Gagliardi also joined an effort to deter purveyors of spam email from operating in the state of Colorado. Gagliardi also offered an amendment to the state budget to provide additional funding for veterans homes in Colorado, and was one of the few Democrats to vote against a plan pushed by Gov. Bill Ritter to freeze property tax rates to provide additional public school funding. Rep. Gagliardi was also a co-sponsor of Senate bills to provide legal immunity to school staff who intervene to stop disruptive behavior, and an unsuccessful measure to revise rules regarding the expiration of frequent flier miles. Gagliardi sponsored a few health care measures which overlapped her personal experience, but most of her remaining bills were sunset reviews and statutory cleanup bills, as is common for incoming legislators who are learning legislative procedure. Near the start of the 2007 legislative session, Gagliardi also adopted an \\"open door\\" policy for the Capitol and invited any resident of her district to visit her office at the Capitol or shadow her during floor and committee work. She developed email and print newsletters, similar to those offered by members of Congress, for distribution to her constituents each month during her time with the House of Representatives. =2008 legislative session= In the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Gagliardi returned to the committee assignments from the previous session, sitting on the House Health and Human Services and the House Local Government Committee. Gagliardi was the prime sponsor for 7 bills in the House and she sponsored 5 from the Senate, in addition to numerous co-sponsorships. Gagliardi was joined in 2008 by chief of staff Ian Silverii, a Democrat with experience in politics and education policy. In addition to her legislative duties, Gagliardi held a series of town hall style meetings on issues of importance to her district. Gagliardi and Representative Mark Ferrandino proposed the \\"American Dream Protection Act of 2008,\\" which would have allowed judges to delay home foreclosures by 90 days, in response to the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis which was affecting Colorado and the United States more generally. After encountering overwhelming legislative opposition to the bill, which was characterized in committee as being too drastic, the bill was amended to instead increase public outreach efforts to avoid foreclosures, and more stringent notification requirements for banks when foreclosing. The bill was eventually adopted by the General Assembly, and as signed into law by Governor Ritter, the measure required mortgage holders to provide 30 days' notice to homeowners before beginning foreclosure proceedings and provide them with contact information for the Colorado Foreclosure Prevention Hotline. During the session, Gagliardi also sponsored legislation to expand funding for the Colorado Responds to Children with Special Needs (CRCSN) Program by increasing the cost of birth certificates by $0.75. This measure, once adopted, provided about $200,000 annually to the program which works to prevent birth defects and developmental disabilities, and supports those who suffer from these disabilities. Gagliardi sponsored two measures to allow Medicaid reimbursements for services provided by advanced practice nurses in Colorado; both were passed into law and signed by Governor Ritter in March 2008. She also sponsored a successful bill to revise property tax collection procedures in conjunction with tax increment financing to give local governments more budgeting flexibility through the down economy. In July, following the legislative session, Gagliardi announced a proposal to lower the age limit for blood donations to 16 throughout the state. =2008 election= Gagliardi sought a second term in the legislature in the 2008 statewide elections, facing Republican John Bodnar whose bid to unseat Labuda was endorsed by the Denver Post; the Arvada Press endorsed Gagliardi. Gagliardi was again joined by campaign manager Allen Weisheit, and as in previous elections, she was competing for a seat with voter registration numbers favoring Republicans; again her race was expected to be strongly contested. Gagliardi prevailed with just over 50 percent of the popular vote, some 1600 votes ahead of Bodnar; American Constitution Party candidate Amanda Campbell took 4 percent of the vote. =2009 legislative session= For the 2009 legislative session, Gagliardi was named to a seat on the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee and as vice-chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee. Following her re-election, Gagliardi was also nominated for the post of House Majority Caucus Chair, but the post ultimately went to Representative Karen Middleton. Representative Gagliardi was the prime sponsor of 5 bills in the House of Representatives and 7 bills in the Colorado State Senate, in addition to co-sponsoring many other bills and resolutions. Gagliardi carried House Bill 1331 in 2009 which created tax credits for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles in the state of Colorado. The credits incentivized the purchase of plug-in vehicles, hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrids, plug-in hybrid conversions, and CNG conversions. These tax credits had the dual benefits of bolstering the automotive dealership industry in Colorado and creating jobs in the field of vehicle conversion. In addition to working on lower-profile issues during the 2009 session, Gagliardi sponsored a bipartisan measure to lower the age limit for blood donations to 16. The measure was crafted through collaboration between Gagliardi, Bonfils Blood Center, and Connor Randall, a high school student from Arvada and two-time heart transplant recipient. The three stakeholders recognized that blood donations could be increased by as much as 35% if the donation age were lowered with parental consent. Gagliardi, being vice chair of Health and Human Services and a nurse, introduced the bill and co-prime sponsored the measure together with Republican Representative Spencer Swalm to showcase the bipartisan nature of the bill. Representative Swalm, a frequent donor to Bonfils and advocate for organ and tissue donation helped lobby the measure among the Republican caucus. Gagliardi leaned on her experience as a nurse in a series of letters to the editor and opinion pieces advocating for the change and encouraging Coloradans to donate blood. The bill passed and was subsequently signed into law on March 19, 2009. Gagliardi also carried a bipartisan measure with Republican Senator Don Marostica which created the Colorado Credit Reserve Program. The program leveraged $2.5 million of state funds to provide between $50 – $55 million in loans for small businesses in the state of Colorado. The bill required a large fiscal investment up-front, but will cost the state very little, even in a worst-case situation. The bill was particularly necessary during the early stages of the recession, as credit markets were inaccessible to many businesses, yet the bill's impact has continued. As of October 2010, the measure had opened credit to 167 businesses, allowed for the creation of 1,100 jobs, and become a source of net income for the state of Colorado. =2010 legislative session= In January 2010, Gagliardi was named vice-chair of the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee, replacing Rep. Ed Casso. Gagliardi was the only Sophomore legislator in the Colorado House to hold two vice-chair positions at the same time. For the 2010 legislative session, Gagliardi was the prime sponsor for 8 bills originating in the House of Representatives and 12 additional measures originating the Senate, thus making it her most legislatively-productive session. Gagliardi was joined in 2010 by chief of staff Kevin J.D. Wilson, a political independent who had served on her staff since 2008. In addition to her committee positions through 2010, Gagliardi had also worked between 2009 and 2010 on a number of interim committees, the most important of which being the Economic Opportunity and Poverty Reduction Task Force, headed by Representative John Kefalas. Gagliardi's own experiences as a struggling single parent in the 1980s helped to drive her interest in the committee's work. Tasked with cutting the state's poverty rate in half in a decade, the committee's recommendations focused on providing social services that end cycles of poverty and providing broad economic opportunities to all who live in the state. For a fourth year, Gagliardi continued to hold town hall meetings in Arvada every month on topics such as jobs legislation, alternative education and apprenticeships, the national economy, the state budget, education policy, and energy policy. She also hosted meetings with the Jefferson County School Board, job fairs, and an informational meeting on starting a new business, as well as twice-monthly informal \\"constituent coffee\\" meetings at coffee shops in Arvada. Gagliardi and her staff also adopted a policy of responding individually to emails coming from any of the district's 78,500 people. Working on the state's budget consumed much of the 2010 legislative session for most members. Colorado's projected budget shortfalls for the 2010-2011 fiscal year were substantial and obvious cuts had been made in years prior. All functions of state government had undergone cuts in previous sessions, but the ongoing reductions in state spending also threatened to defund numerous departments and functions of government. Gagliardi agreed with many additional cuts in the state's budget, but argued extensively against further reductions in spending for education, infrastructure, and \\"social safety net\\" programs. To prevent these cuts, she voted with many fellow Democrats to close tax loopholes and end certain business tax exemptions which altogether totaled more than $110,000,000 annually. Her support for these measures made her the target of attack ads and coordinated letters to the editor condemning her position as a violation of TABOR and a tax hike during a recession. Most of Gagliardi's measures were unrelated to the budget, however. Gagliardi sponsored an overhaul of the state's food stamp system, now known as SNAP with centrist Jefferson County Republican Ken Summers. The measure, House Bill 1022, underwent extensive revisions due to its contentious nature. As introduced, it would have expanded food stamp eligibility, removed an asset test, extended the certification period for food assistance, and created an outreach plan to pair private volunteer groups with the government in order to promote awareness of SNAP and to help counties deal with increased caseloads. Though the original bill proved monstrously expensive given the state's dire economic forecast, subsequent amendments brought costs under control while still preserving the core of the measure. After a lengthy period in negotiation, the measure was passed 52-10 in the House, and 22-12 in the Senate. Once signed into law, 1022 became the new backbone of Colorado's food assistance program. Gagliardi also sponsored the Colorado Health Services Corps Act of 2010 which provides loan repayment assistance to medical professionals who agree to work in poor or underserved areas of the state. Among her other bills during the 2010 session, Gagliardi also sponsored a \\"sensible government\\" bill to help minors in the foster care system register for drivers education, a measure to allow doctors to override health insurance companies when choosing oncology medicines, and a measure to register surgical technologists following the Rose Medical Center Hepatitis C Incident of 2009. =2010 election= Arvada, which contained more registered Republicans than Democrats, was one area heavily targeted by Colorado Republicans hoping to make gains during the midterm 2010 legislative elections. Gagliardi was joined by campaign managers Allen Weisheit and Elliot Goldbaum and treasurer Dave Fischer as well as a sizable group of volunteers from Arvada. Both Gagliardi and Republican challenger Libby Szabo engaged in extensive fundraising and spent similar amounts on their campaigns. Gagliardi's campaign relied heavily on face-to-face interaction, as it had in previous elections. By the end of October 2010, Gagliardi had visited 14,725 constituents at their homes, over 5,000 of which in 2010 alone. Though Gagliardi received many local endorsements, Szabo's endorsement by national Republican figures raised the race's publicity substantially. On October 15, The Denver Post endorsed Szabo's bid for Colorado's 27th House District. Later the same day the Arvada Press released their endorsements, and while they praised Gagliardi heavily for her constituent outreach, they endorsed Szabo's bid for \\"radical changes.\\" Gagliardi's campaign continued to run on her record of legislative accomplishments, despite being hammered by attack ads from her opponent, all while 527 groups poured money into the district trying change the electoral outcome. On Tuesday, November 2, 2010, Szabo defeated Gagliardi in a three-way race after emerging with 51% of all votes cast in Colorado's 27th House District. Life after politics After the end of her tenure as a state representative, Gagliardi returned to work as a nurse for Kaiser Permanente in the field of oncology. She has remained involved in Colorado politics, writing opinion pieces on public health and paid sick days, as well as periodically working with state legislators. Following the recall attempt and subsequent resignation of Senator Evie Hudak in November 2013, Gagliardi announced her intention to seek the office. Because the vacancy was created by a resignation, rather than an electoral defeat, a party vacancy committee will internally elect and then subsequently appoint a replacement to the Senate seat. Gagliardi and Arvada Councilwoman Rachel Zenzinger both announced their candidacies for the office, which will again be up for election in 2014.

His seal bears the legend: SIGILLUM HENRICI DE PERCY /SIGILLUM HENRICI DE PERCI (\\"seal of Henry de Percy\\") Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Alnwick (25 March 1273 – October 1314) was a medieval English magnate. He fought under King Edward I of England in Wales and Scotland and was granted extensive estates in Scotland, which were later retaken by the Scots under King Robert I of Scotland. He added Alnwick to the family estates in England, founding a dynasty of northern warlords. He rebelled against King Edward II over the issue of Piers Gaveston and was imprisoned for a few months. After his release, he declined to fight under Edward II at the Battle of Bannockburn, remaining at Alnwick, where he died a few months later, aged 41. Origins Henry was born at Petworth in Sussex in 1273, seven months after his father's death, saving the family line from extinction, as two older brothers had died in infancy, and all six uncles had died without leaving any legitimate heirs. He was fortunate in having the powerful John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey as his maternal grandfather. Henry was the son of Henry de Percy (d.1272), 7th feudal baron of Topcliffe, Yorkshire,Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.148 by his wife, Eleanor de Warenne, daughter of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey by Alice de Lusignan, Countess of Surrey, half sister of King Henry III.Peter Jerrome, Petworth, from the beginnings to 1660 2002 The Window Press His great-great-grandfather was Jocelin de Louvain (d.1180) who had married Agnes de Percy (d.1203), one of the two daughters and co-heiresses of William II de Percy (d.1174/5), 3rd feudal baron of Topcliffe, whose descendants had adopted the surname \\"de Percy\\". Majority & change of arms Arms of Percy (ancient): Azure, five fusils in fess orDebrett's Peerage, 1968, p.849, Duke of Northumberland In 1293, Henry came into his inheritance of estates in Sussex and Yorkshire, including Topcliffe Castle, the ancient family seat. In 1294 he married Eleanor, daughter of the Earl of Arundel. He then proceeded to change the family coat of arms from Azure, five fusils in fess orDebrett's Peerage, 1968, p.849, Duke of Northumberland (\\"Percy ancient\\") to Or, a lion rampant azure (\\"Percy modern\\"). Blue and gold were the Earl Warenne's colours and a gold lion rampant had been the Arundel's arms. Alternatively the arms are said to be the arms of Brabant. This emphasised his royal and noble connections and marked his ambition. This was also the year he went to war for the first time, summoned to fight in France, but then diverted to Wales to join Edward I in suppressing a Welsh rebellion. There he learned the grim business of medieval warfare, and command and supply of armies in the field. Marriage and progeny Henry de Percy married Eleanor FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel,Gee, Loveday Lewes, Women, art, and patronage from Henry III to Edward III: 1216-1377, (The Boydell Press, 2002), 147. and had two sons: *Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy (b.1299), who succeeded his father *William de Percy (c.1303-1355)  Knighthood and war in Scotland  The view from Stirling Castle with the present Stirling Bridge in the foreground and the Wallace Monument in the middle distance By the summer of 1295, Henry was in the north with his grandfather Earl Warenne. Edward I's deliberately humiliating treatment of King John I of Scotland and his nobles was making war inevitable. Warenne was King John's father in law, used as an intermediary by Edward. In 1294 Philip IV of France had taken back Aquitaine from the English crown and now negotiated a treaty with the Scots to wage war on Edward on two fronts. During March 1296 Edward I's army surrounded Berwick on Tweed, then the largest town in Scotland and an important seaport. It was here on 30 March that Henry Percy was knighted by the King.Alexander Rose, Kings in the North The House of Percy in British History 2002 p145 Later on the same day the town was taken and the ruthless king, apparently provoked by the inhabitants previously baring their buttocks at him, ordered the city put to the sword \\"whatever the age or sex\\" and according to the Scotichronicon 7,500 were executed.Bower, Walter, Scotichronicon, ed. D. E. R. Watt and others, 1998 Percy, under Warenne's command, was sent north to Dunbar where the castle was held by the Earls of Mar, Menteith and Ross, together with many lesser nobles. After they had beaten a Scottish force outside the castle the king joined them, and the castle soon surrendered. The rest of Scotland was occupied in the space of a few weeks and English administrators installed. King John Balliol was forced to abdicate and Warenne appointed to govern Scotland as a province. Having proved his ability Henry Percy was given the task of governing Ayr, Galloway and Cumberland, based at Carlisle Castle. With King Edward now turning his attention to affairs in France there was only a year or so of peace before the situation in Scotland began to unravel. In the summer of 1297 William Wallace murdered the English sheriff of Lanark and was joined by Robert Bruce, Bishop Lockhart, James Stewart and Sir William Douglas in the Scottish lowlands while Andrew Murray started a Highland uprising. Working closely with Robert Clifford from Westmorland, Percy confronted the other rebels at Irvine while Wallace was in central Scotland, and negotiated their submission, subduing southern Scotland for a while. Warenne then began an expedition to hunt down Wallace and Murray, finding them waiting north of the River Forth near Stirling Castle. The ensuing Battle of Stirling Bridge was a disaster for the English army. Percy and his fellow commanders could only watch helplessly from the castle as their infantry, caught on the far side of the one narrow bridge were slaughtered. Murray, however, was mortally wounded in the battle and died sometime later. The English were temporarily expelled from Scotland and on the defensive, with the Scots raiding northern England. In the following spring of 1298 King Edward returned from France and assembled a large army, including many Welsh longbow archers, to begin a new and determined assault on Scotland. They caught up with Wallace at Falkirk on 22 July where Henry Percy was part of the fourth reserve division of experienced and highly mobile cavalry.Gerard Brault, Rolls of Arms of Edward I (1272-1307) 1997 pp404-417  Baron and Scottish landowner  Early in 1299 the King granted the estates of Ingram Balliol, who had been involved in the Scottish rebellions, to Henry Percy, including land in England and south west Scotland. This not only gave him greater income and status, but also a vested interest in the continuing conquest of Scotland. The king also summoned Percy to attend parliament as a peer of the realm, making him a baron by writ. His family had previously had the courtesy title of baron because of their land holdings. Percy had proved himself an able soldier and administrator and found royal favour. The rest of the year was spent skirmishing with Scottish guerilla groups, and the following summer campaigning with the king although little was achieved other than the capture of Caerlaverock Castle after a long siege, at which he was present with his elderly grandfather Earl Warenne. The Caerlaverock Poem or Roll of Arms made at the siege by the heralds records the armorials of Warenne and Percy in a single verse, translated from Norman French into modern English thus:Howard de Walden, Lord, Some Feudal Lords and their Seals 1301, published 1904, pp.4,43 > Arms of Warenne: Chequy or and azure \\"John the good Earl of Warenne > Of the other squadron held the reins > To regulate and govern, > As he who well knew how to lead, > Noble and honourable men. > His banner with gold and azure > Was nobly chequered. > And he had in his company > Henry de Percy, his nephew (son nevou) (sic) > Who seemed to have made a vow > To rout the Scots. > A blue lion rampant on yellow > Was his banner very conspicuous\\" > Correspondence in late 1301 shows Percy at his estate at Leconfield in Yorkshire, where his wife probably lived, at a safe distance from Scottish raiding parties. In February 1303 Percy was sent north in a cavalry force led by Johannes de Seagrave which was defeated at Roslin. He then joined King Edward's summer offensive, reaching Dunfermline in early November. Robert Bruce had already changed sides to support Edward and in February 1304 most of the Scots negotiated a settlement with the English king. Henry Percy is known to have played a prominent role in the negotiations.J Brain, The Percies in Scotlandp 337 Only Stirling Castle now remained to be subdued, and was battered by catapults during the spring of 1304, while King Edward's militant queen, Marguerite of France, watched from a specially built wooden shelter. The siege culminated in the commissioning of Warwolf, a giant trebuchet which flattened the curtain walls. The defenders had tried to surrender four days earlier, but had been made to wait by the king while he tried out his new toy. In September 1305 the first joint English and Scottish parliament met at Westminster to agree a constitution for the unified state, with Percy playing a leading role in the negotiations, but Robert Bruce, a leading representative of the Scots, was already conspiring to rebel. On 25 March 1306 Robert Bruce was crowned King of Scotland at Scone Abbey, upon which Edward confiscated his lands and gave them to Henry Percy. The King now appointed Percy to command northwest England and southwest Scotland, with orders to suppress the rebellion without mercy. Bruce's army was soon defeated in battle, but Bruce escaped to wage a guerilla campaign against the English from the wild countryside of Galloway. For several years afterwards the English Barons held the castles of southern and central Scotland, but were ambushed and harried in the countryside.  A new monarch  Edward I, on his way to launch a new campaign against the Scots, died on 7 July 1307 before crossing the border. The dying Edward I, asked his assembled barons to give the succession to his only surviving son Edward. He also asked them to maintain the banishment Piers Gaveston from England. Henry Percy was not present, being left in charge of southern Scotland. The death of Edward I, with the conquest of Scotland incomplete, was a personal disaster for Percy. After years of hard fighting he now had extensive land holdings in southern Scotland, but this was of less interest to Edward II who promptly recalled Gaveston and made him Earl of Cornwall, an office of great wealth. Gaveston, a formidable tournament fighter in the melee, openly despised and insulted the old king's stalwart warriors. Edward II left Scotland in August 1307 after replacing his father's loyal and experienced commanders, Clifford, Valence and Percy who were sent home, only to be recalled to Scotland in October. By then, however, Robert Bruce had escaped from Galloway to the Highlands, and had raised new forces and taken eastern Scotland by the end of the year. In August 1308 Bruce captured Argyll, previously loyal to King Edward and then raided Northumberland. Percy and Clifford were again summoned to defend Galloway, at their own expense, against an onslaught by Robert Bruce's surviving brother Edward. They were able to hold the castles, but not the countryside. Percy had travelled south to Westminster in February that year for the king's coronation, where he would have seen Gaveston's arrogance. The ceremony was delayed for a week while the French delegation, alarmed that the king preferred Gaveston's company to that of Isabella, his 12-year-old French bride, threatened to boycott the coronation. In the event Gaveston was given precedence over the other Earls. At the following feast Gaveston dressed in an outfit of royal purple and pearls, and called the king over to sit with him, instead of with Queen Isabella. The French delegation walked out and one earl drew his sword and had to be restrained from attacking Gaveston. During the spring of 1308 the barons in parliament pressed the king to exile Gaveston, developing the Doctrine of Capacities, distinguishing between loyalty to the king and loyalty to the crown. On 16 June 1308, Gaveston was appointed Lieutenant of Ireland, to get him out of the country, with Henry de Percy as a witness.  Founding a dynasty in Northumberland  Alnwick Castle by Canaletto In 1309, Henry was able to buy Alnwick Castle from Anthony Bek, the Prince Bishop of Durham, giving him a base near to the action in Scotland and a substantial annual income of about £475 from the associated lands. To make the purchase price of £4666 he borrowed £2666 from Italian merchant bankers, the Lombard Society.Alexander Rose, Kings in the North The House of Percy in British History 2002 p184 When William Vesci had died in 1297 without a legitimate heir, Bek had been entrusted with the estates of the Vesci family on behalf of his son, the illegitimate William Vesci of Kildare. Vesci of Kildare did receive the other family lands in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and it is unclear whether he was defrauded by the greedy bishop over the sale of Alnwick. In the same year of 1297 Henry obtained a royal licence to fortify his mansion at Petworth and two mansions in Yorkshire.Peter Jerrome, Petworth, from the beginnings to 1660 2002 The Window Press p29  The return of Gaveston  By the summer of 1309 Edward II had managed to cajole most of his earls into allowing Piers Gaveston to return to England, although the most powerful earl, Lancaster, was implacably opposed. On 27 June 1309 Gaveston, restored to the Earldom of Cornwall, returned to England and soon proved as obnoxious as before, calling Lancaster \\"Churl\\" and Warwick \\"Black Cur\\".Alexander Rose, Kings in the North The House of Percy in British History 2002 p180 Henry Percy would have been preoccupied with the purchase of Alnwick at that time and generally tried to stay out of the trouble with Gaveston. At the parliament of February and March 1310 the King was forced to accept the election of twenty one Lords Ordainers to govern the country. In June the king began a campaign in Scotland in which Percy fought, although many barons senior to Percy declined to take part. Robert Bruce continued to fight a guerilla war, refusing to give battle, so little was achieved, while relations between the king and his earls further deteriorated. In May 1311 Gaveston ordered Percy to hold Perth for the summer with two hundred knights and no infantry, a dangerous task at a time when the king's army was withdrawing to England. Surviving this Percy was back in London in October.Alexander Rose, Kings in the North The House of Percy in British History 2002 p187 The barons now forced the king to send Gaveston into exile in Flanders, but he was soon recalled and was in York with his heavily pregnant wife in January 1312, with his lands restored. Percy was ordered out of Scarborough Castle and Gaveston took it over. Violence was now inevitable. In April the king and Gaveston were chased out of Newcastle by the sudden arrival of an army under Lancaster, Percy and Clifford, fleeing to Scarborough. In their haste they left behind Gaveston's wife and baby daughter and a great hoard of treasure, which it took Lancaster, Percy and Clifford four days to catalogue. Lancaster held onto this for future bargaining with the king.Denholm-Young (Ed) Vita Edwardi Secundi, Monachi Cuiusdam Malmesberiensis. London 1957. p33-36 Gaveston was soon besieged at Scarborough Castle by Percy, Clifford, and the earls of Warenne and Pembroke, surrendering after a month. Percy remained in York when Gaveston was taken south to Warwick and then executed.  Imprisonment  The king, seeking revenge for the death of his friend, stopped short of civil war with the rebel earls but made an example of the less powerful Baron Percy by confiscating his lands on 28 July 1312, and having him imprisoned by the Sheriff of Yorkshire. The earls made Percy's release a priority in their difficult negotiations with the king and he was freed in January 1313.Alexander Rose, Kings in the North The House of Percy in British History 2002 p194 and was formally pardoned in October. Gaveston's treasure was returned to the king soon after.  The final year  King Edward now prepared for a campaign in Scotland in 1314, culminating in his total defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn. Percy, along with five of the earls and many other nobles refused summonses to this campaign because it had not been sanctioned by parliament, as required by the Ordinances. There are no contemporary records of Percy being at BannockburnAlexander Rose, Kings in the North The House of Percy in British History 2002 p196 and it seems that he remained at Alnwick, defending his land against Scottish raiders. His friend and comrade Robert Clifford did go, and was killed in the battle. Within days of the battle Percy was summoned to Newcastle to prepare an emergency defence of northern England against an invasion. Instead of an all-out invasion, Robert Bruce sent raiding parties to extort money from the northern counties. Only a few months later in the first half of October 1314 Henry Percy died, aged 41, of unknown causes.

Currently, he is a full professor of sociology at the University of Sassari.  Biography  He was born in Gioia Tauro, Calabria (Italy). In the early 1990s he was involved in the foundation of the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia (DIA), a law-enforcement agency specially entrusted with fighting organized crime. Later on he became president of IASOC (International Association for the Study of Organized Crime). Finally, he was appointed honorary president of the Giovanni Falcone foundation, named after noted magistrate Giovanni Falcone, who was also a close friend of his.  Academic career He has been associate professor of applied sociology at the University of Calabria and at the University of Florence. Moreover, he was visiting professor at the Columbia University of New York City, USA. Later on he got the full professor position at the University of Sassari, where he is currently professor of sociology in the political science faculty.  Political career In 1994-1996 he was a member of the lower chamber of the Italian parliament and, between 1996–1997, of the Senate. During this period, he was appointed vice-president of the Antimafia Commission, a bicameral commission of the Italian Parliament to which he had already collaborated as consultant between 1984 and 1986. Since 2009 he is a Member of the European Parliament for Southern Italy: initially with the Italy of Values (ALDE), then \\"Parlamento Europeo: Pino Arlacchi lascia l'IDV ed aderisce al PD\\" from PartitoDemocratico.eu with the Democratic Party (S&D;).  United Nations activities  As soon as he was appointed director of UNDCP he started a worldwide campaign against drugs, the so-called \\"A Drug Free World\\". The key point of such proposal was the elimination of all opium and cocaine plantations by the end of 2008, by means of the development of alternative plantations. Such a proposal had been proposed by Arlacchi immediately after his installation at the UN office and it had been unanimously approved by the UN general assembly in June 1998. Since that time, the production of narcotic noticeably decreased, in particular in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the new war conducted by the US against the Taliban regime interrupted the program started by Arlacchi some years before. After the beginning of the war, the production of opium restarted. A review of the Arlacchi plan has been carried out in March 2009 by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The Political Declaration approved at the end of the review process acknowledged significant progresses and reconfirmed the whole strategy for another 10 years, until 2019. The most important result achieved by Arlacchi during his activity at the UN was the promotion of a UN convention against all the forms of organized criminality, that has been held in Palermo in 2000. The document of this convention came into effect in 2003.  Bibliography  Arlacchi is the author of several books and publications on the Mafia and transnational organized crime, which have been translated into many languages. He has received a number of national and international awards and decorations, in recognition of his outstanding contribution towards a better understanding of the Mafia. His publications include Mafia Business: The Mafia Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and Mafia, Peasants and Great Estates: Society in Traditional Calabria.

Version 9 December 2006 They are commonly called sailer butterflies or sailers, or more precisely typical sailers to distinguish them from the related blue sailer (Pseudoneptis). Description The head is rather broad and moderately hairy on the forehead. The eyes are large and prominent. The palpi are short, acute, slender, hairy, and do not rise above the level of the forehead. The antennae are moderately long, terminating in an elongate, gradually-formed club, flattened on its upper surface. The thorax is not robust and it is as broad as the head and slightly hairy posteriorly. The wing characters are: forewings elongate, rather truncate; costa only slightly arched; apex not acute, but well marked; hind margin slightly convex and sinuated; anal angle distinct; inner-margin convex near base, slightly concave about middle. Hindwings large, rounded; costa strongly arched; hind margin moderately dentate; inner margins only slightly convex, not covering posterior portion of the abdomen. Upperside patterning consists of white spots and bars (some species have orange or yellow bars) on a black ground colour. Underside patterns are yellowish to reddish brown, alternating with white bands The legs are rather short and stout. The abdomen is slender, much compressed and rather elongate. The head of the larva is very large and bifid on its summit. There is a pair of downy, elongate, tubercular processes, projecting laterally, on both the second and third segments—those on the third segment are much longer. There is an upright pyramidal process on the penultimate segment and the body is attenuated posteriorly. The pupa is strongly curved (thick in central portion). The head is deeply bifid.

Biology Larval food plants come from the families Fabaceae, Rhamnaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Polygonaceae, Sapindaceae, Urticaceae and Connaraceae. Adults have a \\"sailing\\" flight flapping their wings and then gliding. They frequently perch and visit flowers for nectar and damp patches where they imbibe salts and other nutrients. Adult uppersides exhibit disruptive coloration, This species has been observed to make sounds whose function has not been established.Scott, F.W. (1968). Sound produced by Neptis hylas (Nymphalidae).

The screenplay by Todd Graff, adapted from his 1988 off- Broadway play The Grandma Plays,The Grandma Plays at the New York Times takes a humorous look at a highly dysfunctional family living in the New York City borough of Queens circa 1969. Plot summary In the 1960s Pearl Berman has just returned home from her husband Jack's funeral, her grief disrupted by her many relatives animatedly discussing which parkway offered the best route to the cemetery. Pearl's family tackles any and every subject – from body odor to toilets to Tupperware to borscht – as if it's worthy of a major debate. Into a household filled with kvetchers steps Joe Meledandri, a distinguished Italian who years ago met Pearl's wayward husband in a bar and convinced him to return to her. He has desired her ever since, and now that Pearl is a widow, Joe feels the time is right to make his move. He invites her for coffee, his first step on the road to seduction. What remains to be seen is if he can overcome family objections to religious differences and if he's willing to accept Pearl's daughters: the lonely, overweight Bibby and the pretty but psychologically unstable Norma who dresses up as celebrities to escape the grief that has overwhelmed her since the death of one of her children and divorce from her husband. At her father's funeral, Norma dresses up the way Jackie Kennedy appeared at the funeral of her husband; appears as Marilyn Monroe as she serves her surviving son his breakfast; and also impersonates Faye Dunaway and Barbra Streisand among others. And those are just some of the crazy relatives that come as part of the package.

It also slathers the ethnic equivalent of corn onto every sentimental scene.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"The movie is by turns serious, satirical, bittersweet, maudlin, satirical, romantic and farcical... MacLaine is a pro and survives the material... We care about her enough, indeed, to wonder if meeting the Mastroianni character is really the best thing that could have happened to her. He doesn't often seem like a real human in this movie; he's more like an all-purpose writer's device. The odds are against any sane person being able to behave like this man... what the movie could not overcome, for me at least, is the lack of any convincing romantic chemistry between [the two].\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Variety stated, \\"A modern, absurdist sensibility informs the soap opera Used People... which harks back to '50s weepies... MacLaine's precise acting is laudatory and balanced by a very sympathetic turn by twinkle-eyed Mastroianni, in his best English-language role by far. The support ensemble is excellent.\\"Variety review Rita Kempley of the Washington Post said, \\"Used People wants to be Moonstruck with matzo balls, but it's less an eccentric romantic comedy than an icky three-layered Jewish mother joke... it's rich in character if rather trite in theme and scene.\\"Washington Post review In The New Yorker, Michael Sragow observed, \\"Life goes on — for the audience, seemingly forever — in yet another ethnic comedy-drama ... In the end, love conquers everything from religious differences to mental illness: everything, that is, except the forced eccentricity and bickering stereotypes in Todd Graff's script.\\"The New Yorker review In his review of the videotape release, Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly rated the film C- and added, \\"Everything's in italics in this Jewish Moonstruck... MacLaine honks nasally ... Mastroianni talks in spumoni aphorisms... the score oompahs with grating merriment as characters parade cutesy tics instead of human traits. With stars as gifted as Jessica Tandy, Sylvia Sidney, and Kathy Bates drowning in the tough-talking treacle, it's one of those movies that gives New York a worse name than it already has.\\"Entertainment Weekly review The film grossed $18 million in the United States and Canada and $10 million overseas for a worldwide total of $28 million. Accolades Marcello Mastroianni was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Shirley MacLaine was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

Jack had various brushes with the law, and as a result he had to leave the area for a while and became a game-keeper, his local nickname adapting itself to become 'Jack the Gem-Keeper.'

John Spier was the son of Robert Spier, described as a Writer and bank agent in Beith, owner of the Marshalland and Cuff estates, which included Bogstone, Bellcraig, Eastend of Shutterflat, and Lugton Ridge farms. Robert was descended from the Spiers of Kersland Mill, which he bought from his elder brother. Through good business acumen, he accumulated a considerable fortune of £40,000 in land and money,Spier's School Magazine, No.1, December 1888. p. 2 . In a map of 1858, the land on which the school was later built shows only the presence of two wells and the fields of the Marshalland farm, with its tree-lined hedgerows. Tom Paterson and his sister farmed Marshalland in the 1950s, and the last people to live at Marshalland were David and Mary Kerr, before the fine house and associated farm buildings were demolished in the early 1960s.Marshalland farm Foundation of the school Statue of John Spier (died 1858), honoured as founder of the school The Spier's Institution Disposition of 1869 Margaret Gibson or Spier, of Whang House, the widow of Robert Spier of Marshalland and Cuff, was herself from a local family, and she had sons who predeceased her. John Spier of Cuff died in 1858 at the age of 28 in Largs, and his brother Andrew Spier of Marshalland had died before him. Before he died, John expressed a wish for a school to be founded with the inheritance which would have been his.Reid (2001), Page 96 By a disposition and settlement dated 19 March 1869, Margaret Gibson Spier put money in trust for the founding of a \\"ragged\\" or charitable school near Glasgow, and gave instructions that construction was to begin within a year of her death. She stipulated that the school should provide places for 24 children, who were not to have pauper or tradesmen parents and were to be of any religious denomination except for Roman Catholicism. Teachers and other staff were to be dismissed if they married, were to retire at sixty with no pension from the trust, and if sick were to pay for a teacher to cover their duties. No Roman Catholics were to be employed, and the Presbyterian minister of Beith was to make weekly visits of inspection. When Margaret Spier died on 17 February 1870,The High Church, Beith.

She had also bought the lands of Bogston and Corshole from Charlotte Decker or Montgomerie in 1848, and these were part of the foundation endowment of Spier's School.Dobie (1816) She also left money for other charitable purposes, as recorded in the vestibule of Beith Kirk. In addition to the money for the school, she charged her lands of Cuff with a yearly payment of £25 to the Ministers of Beith Kirk to provide warm clothing and coals to the deserving poor of the town and parish. Locally Margaret Spier was known as 'Lady' Spier. She also appears to have wanted to build a hospital, however funds were not available from her estates for such a costly enterprise. After her death, Whang House was bought by a Thomas Miller. John Thomas Rochead of Glasgow was to have been the architect of the school, and a very specific requirement was that 'Binny' stone for Edinburgh was to be used in the school's construction, so far as possible. William Brodie was to be the sculptor of the Spier memorial statues and an Italian sculpture of the 'Graces and two cupids', favourite of John Spier, was to be permanently housed in the Spier's school board room. John Spier, Margaret's eldest surviving son, had the task of carrying out her wishes, and had different ideas. He seems to have intended that the school should also serve as a memorial to himself, and decided to site it in the parish of Beith.Spier's Trust. However, this led to disputes and delays, and an investigation by a Royal Commission, and a final plan emerged from that for a co-educational day school at Beith which would be equipped to take a small number of boarders. B. W. Cochran-Patrick of Ladyland & Woodside delivered his \\"Dedication Speech of the Spier School\\" on 28 April 1887, and in September 1887 the school's foundation stone was laid on site, in the presence of more than a thousand guests.Dane Love, Lost Ayrshire.

Fees were charged, but free education was available to local children who passed a qualifying examination and were recommended by their schoolteachers. The school administration was in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant of the County, seven representatives of the school boards, and the existing trustees as life governors, to be replaced by two heritors of the parish of Beith in due course. The boarders were always a minor element, never more than fourteen. They lived in the Head Master's house and wore kilts on weekdays and Eton suits and hats on Sundays. Fees were 50 guineas for full- time boarders; 40 for weekly boarders; and 6 guineas per annum for day- scholars.Reid, Donald L. & Monahan, Isobel F. (1999). Yesterday's Beith. A Pictorial Guide. Beith : Duke of Edinburgh Award. . P. 79. The First World War of 1914 to 1918 and the shortage of domestic staff resulted in boarding at the school coming to an end for the duration of the war. The boys were taught separately from the girls until 1893, when the extra costs of this forced a more liberal approach to emerge. In 1895, Dr J. A. Third took over from Lockhart as head. The school motto was \\"Quod verum, tutum\\", meaning What is true is safe. An initiation tradition for new boys at the senior school was to be thrown into the pond and then over the wall into Marshalland, known as being 'Ducked and Tossed'. The murder of Mary Speir Gunn happened at Northbank Cottage, Portencross, in 1913. She was a granddaughter of Margaret Gibson Spier, and the murder remains unsolved to this day. Dr Third retired in 1919, and later headmasters of the school and was succeeded briefly by Alexander Emslie (1919–1921) and then by Gilbert R. Mair (1921–1937).Reid, Donald L. (2000). Old Beith. Ochiltree : Stenlake. p. 31 The number on the school roll was 310 in 1933, and it reached a high point of over 350 after new classrooms were added. By 1932, however, the school was in financial difficulties, and in 1936, after a prolonged campaign, the county education authority took over the school.Reid, Donald L. & Monahan, Isobel F. (1999). Yesterday's Beith. A Pictorial Guide. Beith : Duke of Edinburgh Award. . P. 91. In 1937, soon after the takeover by Ayrshire, a new headmaster, Robert R. Fairley, was appointed, and he remained in post until 1963, when he was succeeded by the school's last head, David K. Conn. In 1968, there were nineteen full-time staff and four itinerant teachers in the secondary department, and two in the junior school. The senior school had three houses, to which pupils belonged, Cuff, Spier's, and Marshalland.Gardner, Margaret (2008). Oral information from an ex pupil. Eglinton Archive. The school closed on 30 June 1972, at the end of the summer term, due to the imminent opening of Garnock Academy at Kilbirnie, which took over the secondary pupils from Spier's, Kilbirnie Central, and Dalry High School. The Spier's School buildings became derelict and were eventually demolished in the 1980s. Some of the ornamental stonework was recovered after demolition and lay near the staff car park at Garnock Academy, Kilbirnie; some of the stones were built into a commemorative seat. The Spier's school rector's table and chairs, together with a stained glass window and the John Spier statue, were also at Garnock Academy. In 2016, Garnock Academy also closed, to be replaced by the Garnock Community Campus at Longbar. Some of the Spier's stones have been moved to the Spier's School grounds.

The Barrmill Road entrance is stylistically of 17th century style, comparable to those at Moray House of 1628 in the Canongate, Edinburgh. The entrance is a C Listed structure, as are the boundary walls and the two other gates. The total length of the boundary walls is 937 metres. Spier's school or college when first completed had a belltower, hall, boardrooms, 10 classrooms and school-house all designed in the 17th-century style by Campbell Douglas and James Sellars, a Glasgow architectural firm. James Sellars died before the school was completed. The old seal of the governors and a stained glass window (now in Beith Primary School) depicting the seal, shows that a \\"French middle point\\" design had originally been intended. The buildings actually constructed were also on a smaller scale than had been intended. The cost was £12,000. An Art room, gymnasium and a Science room were added in 1908, during Dr Third's time. Four Horsa classrooms were added after 1945, being built on the site of the Head Master's garden or orchard. Electricity was installed once the Ayrshire Education authority took charge, however after closure on 30 June 1972 the buildings were subject to vandalism and all the buildings were demolished in 1984. The Spier's Trust Working Group and the Regional Council made various attempts to find a new use for the buildings, even employing ASSIST, a Glasgow Architectural practice, in 1981. Many suggestions were made, ranging from Country Club to sports academy, but none were ultimately successful for this category 'B' listed building.Ayrshire Life magazine. Unique Building. March - April 1984. P. 10 -12. One proposal, The Spier's Centre, would have had facilities for show jumping, a dry-ski slope, saunas, a solarium, stables, a heritage centre, a cafe, Park Ranger's office, etc. costing £730,000.Records management Unit. North Ayrshire Council. Perceton House. The John Spier memorials were moved to the Old Kirk in Beith in the same year. The large statue of John Spier which used to stand outside the rector's office was moved to Garnock Academy. The gate piers are C-Listed and the 'tops' were known as the 'Dunces' Caps' by the pupils.Hart, Thomas. Oral Communication. January 2008. A separate 'Janitor's or Caretaker's' house existed; last occupied by a Mrs.Rae.  School sports  The Marshlands playing fields with Craig House in the background The 'High Field', old Hockey and rugby practice pitches site near the Geilsland Road side of the grounds Spier's had a great reputation for playing sports and it was the first school in Ayrshire to play rugby football, as R. Bruce Lockhart, the first headmaster, was a former Vice President of the Scottish Rugby Union.Kinniburgh, Page 96 The first game was played at Marshalland on 30 October 1890. As stated, the school had a house system, with Cuff, Marshalland and Spier; providing competition on the school sports days held in June on the Marshalland playing fields. Tennis (girls only), cricket, hockey, net ball and golf were played and a quaint game called targette was played in the early days. The Old Spierian Football Club, later the Old Spierian Rugby Club, came into existence in 1890.Kinniburgh, Page 97 The Garnock Rugby Club came into existence in 1972 as a result of the closure of Spier's and Dalry schools. G.G.H. Johnstone, a maths teacher at Spier's, had founded the rugby club for former pupils and continued his involvement until his death in 1973, at the age of 93.Garnock Rugby Club. Old Spierians, A.Frew, J. H. Bruce Lockhart, and David Shedden were capped for Scotland. The 'Marshland' (sic) playing fields are mainly used for football now and facilities are provided in the form of large metal trans-shipment containers based at the car park. A wooden games pavilion existed here in the days of the school.  The World Wars  The school had an unofficial cadet corps in 1914 and donated money to the Belgian Refugee Fund in 1915 and it also endowed a hospital bed in 1918. In the Second World War part of the High Field was converted into a potato field as part of the \\"Dig for Victory\\" initiative. Seventy Old Spierians made the supreme sacrifice and the war memorials were a central feature of the old school buildings. The memorial is now in storage at the North Ayrshire Museum in Saltcoats, awaiting a suitable location for re-erection. The school also had a Garden of Remembrance composed of a rose garden within a square of yew hedges and an internal path. This was under restoration by the YMBB youth group in 2012. ;Role of honour for World War I and World War II File:Spier's WWI Role of Honour.JPG File:Spiers WWI Role of Honour.JPG File:Spier's WWII Role of Honour.JPG File:Spiers WWII Role of Honour.JPG  The gardens and woodlands  The 'Forbidden Path' between the girls' and the boys' entrance Spier's in 2011.

There were between 50 and 100 varieties of trees within the grounds of Spier's and they used to be labelled with their botanical names.Hugh Stevenson's recollections of old Beith. The 1888 order for trees from Samson Nurseries survives and lists the trees ordered for the arboretum as 300 sycamores; 300 Scotch elm; 400 beech; 1000 Scotch fir (sic); 200 Austrian pine; 200 black spruce; 200 black spruce; 50 English elm; 200 Norway maple; 175 limes; 50 English oak; 50 turkey oak; 75 horse chestnut; 50 hornbeam; 200 weeping birch; 100 rhododendron; 100 rowans; and also ash and willows for the hedge.Eglinton Archive The walled garden area, internally divided and later used for extra classroom space, was originally an orchard and Kitchen Garden; the entrance off the Terrace Walk at the old Tennis Lawns was used by the female pupils only. The path is described as a 'wheelbarrow road' and the plans for a 'Girls Garden' leading into the Girls' Court survive. The site near the Broadstone Arch with three sides formed from a yew hedge was the World War II Garden of Remembrance and now contains a labyrinth. An order for the Kitchen Garden lists five espalier pear, six apple, one plum and two cherry varieties for the five foot high walls and twelve standard fruit trees for planting internally. In addition the Kitchen Garden contained gooseberries, blackcurrants, whitecurrants, redcurrants and raspberries. A 'Coronation Garden' was established here in 1953. The site was close to the tennis lawns which lay next to the school on the Geilsland Road side. This 1953 Coronation Garden was created with the central feature of the newly discovered \\"living fossil\\" tree, the dawn redwood. This tree is very slow growing; it was surrounded by a key shaped edged path network with other ornamental plantings. It was damaged at the top during a money raising drive to fell trees for firewood for sale. The altitude of the site is between 95 m and 100 m. The area of woodland near the back entrance to Geilsland School is dominated by a ground layer of ivy and was known as the 'Ivy Palace' to the pupils of Spier's.

The Spier's Trust also owns of grazing land adjacent to the school grounds, including the High Field of 7.25 hectares lying within the school grounds.NAC Records Management Unit. Perceton Archive. The locals know the Powgree as the Geilsland Burn and boys used to play a game of jumping across it from the Broadstone Bridge area down to Marshalland Bridge. The girls used to play in a small area nearby called the 'Fairy Glen.'Reflections on Beith and District. On the wings of time. (1994). Pub. Beith High Church Youth Group. . P. 31. Robert Aitken on his map of 1827 gives the name as Polgree Burn.Aitken, Robert (1827), Map of the Parish of Beith. A small cottage near Broadstone Bridge stood near to an old mill and was called 'Crooked Dam' as marked on the 1850s OS map. The Spier's Trust Spier's shortly before demolition The school shortly before demolition The trust was founded in 1991 by Mr Jack Spier for the administration of Spier's and for the provision of educational grants and bursaries within the local area of benefit, this being the parishes of Beith, Dalry, Dunlop, Kilbirnie and Neilston. The Trust derives its income from the investment proceeds of the capital of the Trust and from the rental derived from letting for grazing of land adjacent to the former school grounds. The Spiers Trust committee meet twice a year to give out small bursaries to qualifying local students. The Trust committee is made up of the local councillors from Beith, Dalry and Kilbirnie. The total area was . North Ayrshire Council now lease the school grounds from the Trust for a nominal rent.Guidance note on Spier's Trust Committee (Spier's Trust Scheme 1978) North Ayrshire Council. Diamond Jubilee Time Capsule In October 2011 Gateside Primary School pupils placed a 'Wish for the Future' time capsule in the Diamond Jubilee Wood site. This is registered with the International Time Capsule Society (ITCS) at Oglethorpe University in the US. It is due to be opened on 18 June 2037, in the 150 anniversary year of the school's foundation. The pupils have maps of the location and the ITCS have the coordinates. The Spier's Cholera Pit In 1829 and 1834 cholera broke out in Beith and although \\"clothes were burned, bedding fumigated, stairs and closes whitewashed, a nurse who was a veteran of the Dalry outbreak was engaged and a ban placed on entertainments at funerals.\\" There were 100 cases in September 1834, 205 people were eventually affected with 105 deaths. Some of the people were buried in the parish churchyard, but others were buried in a field, in a cholera pit close to what became Spier's School, on the little common south-west of where the Geilsland Road meets the Powgree Burn.Porterfield, S. (1925). Rambles Round Beith. P. 36. Robert Spier, the father of John Spier, was a member of the local health board.Cholera deaths in Beith The pit had a mound of soil over it at one time however the farmers gradually ploughed this down to the field level. Diamond Jubilee Wood In 2012 members of the communities of the Garnock Valley planted a new wood at Spier's to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Beith Primary School carried out the major part of the planting thanks to the Woodland Trust who donated over 400 trees. The Spier's Labyrinth and War memorial The Spier's labyrinth and the War Memorial in the Garden of Remembrance. Seventy ex-pupils from Spier's died in the First and Second World Wars. A War Memorial was located within the school, however since the demolition of the school no publicly accessible memorial has existed and the old rose garden at the 'Garden of Remembrance' has long been overgrown. In 2012 an old Spier's gatepier was collected, cleaned and placed within the old garden as a War Memorial. The group Youth Making Beith Better (YMBB) created a labyrinth around the standing stone War Memorial as a religious memorial - the 'one true path', etc. as found in several cathedrals and in other religious contexts.  Natural history  broad-leaved helleborine orchid growing in the old school grounds The grounds had previously been the farmland of Marshalland farm and the evidence from OS maps does not show the presence of any old woodland after the mid-eighteenth century. Several orchid species are present and a few of the indicators species of older woodland. Ivy dominates the ground flora near the Geilsland Road to the extent that almost all other species are eliminated. Wildlife Site status The Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) have surveyed the grounds and recorded 19 species of birds and 136 species of plants. The grounds have a rich fungal flora, partly due to the quantity of fallen timber. This is exemplified by the presence of parrot waxcap (Hygrocybe psittacina), an uncommon species. The biodiversity and other considerations have resulted in the grounds qualifying as an official SWT Wildlife Site, code NS353532. This ensures a greater degree of protection against any possibly insensitive developments that might be proposed at any future date. In 2010 a specimen of the Arran whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) a rare species unique to Scotland, was found at Spier's. In 2011 the exceptionally rare common broomrape (Orobanche minor) was discovered growing at Spier's and has been the subject of a conservation project since that date. The grounds also qualify as a Local Biodiversity Site (LBS). The Scottish Ornithologists Club (SOC) have identified Spier's as a site for birdwatching with, amongst others, tits, finches, thrushes, greater spotted woodpecker, chiffchaff, blackcap, willow and garden warbler.Birdwatching in Ayrshire and Arran. No. 28. Spier's School Grounds. 2003. An unusual bird migrant record for the school grounds in the 1920s is that of the mealy redpoll (Carduelis flammea flammea). It breeds across the northern parts of North America and Eurasia.Paton, E. Richmond and Pike, Oliver G. (1929). The Birds of Ayrshire. London : H. F. & G. Witherby. p. 19. North Ayrshire Council The grounds are regularly patrolled by a ranger from the North Ayrshire Ranger Service (District), based at Eglinton Country Park. NACs Streetscene (Grounds Maintenance) Section maintain the grounds of the parkland, mowing grass, removing fallen trees and they also use the site for In Service Training sessions. In August 2012 Elma Murray, NAC Chief Executive; Joan Sturgeon, Provost; Robert Barr, Deputy provost; and local councillors visited Spier's in recognition of the restoration carried out by community groups. A copper beech tree was planted by the provost to commemorate the visit. The Spier's Arboretum Before the Spier family built the school that bore their name, the ancient farmhouse and its lands were called Marshalland. Old maps show that apart from a small patch of woodland around the farm and outbuildings, all the rest was open fields with hedgerow boundaries, probably containing a few mature trees such as beech, ash, birch, and oak. The only other feature at that time was a track leading to the freshwater spring that contributes to the Marshalland Burn close to its source near the Geilsland Road. The original 1888 order for trees at Spier's In 1888, Spier's School was opened and thanks to the Earl of Eglinton's head gardener, aided by others such as Mr. W. F. Love, the school grounds were planted up with a specially selected list of trees and shrubs creating an arboretum. The tradition of enhancing the grounds continues to this day with memorial and celebratory tree plantings and along the way notable additions have been the exceedingly rare Arran whitebeam, the dawn redwood at the 1953 Coronation Garden, the Camperdown Elm and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Wood of 2012. The tree order from Samson's Nursery of 20 November 1888 still survives and lists seventeen tree species, but with a total of 3350 trees planted at that time, costing the sum of £9 16s 6d. A fruit trees and shrubs order for the walled garden also survives, listing a total of 371 pears, apples, plums, cherries, gooseberries, currants and raspberries, with several varieties of each. The walled garden was adapted to house additional classrooms and a gymnasium, resulting in the loss of the orchard, etc. Only a few self-seeded gooseberries and raspberries survive from the original plantings. After its closure in 1972, the school grounds received less maintenance and after the demolition of the school buildings in 1984 even the school 'footprint' itself became a woodland as native colonising trees such as willow, birch, and alder took hold there, providing however a site for the unusual and parasitic broomrape (Orobanche minor) plant, one of Scotland's rarest plants. In 2010, NAC Streetscene and the North Ayrshire Ranger Service, later joined by the Friends of Spiers (FoS), started a restoration programme that resulted in a network of all-weather and 'user-friendly' paths, followed by a survey of all 812 trees at Spier's and the removal of any deemed dangerous, many felled tree trunks and their stumps however being left as a habitat for insects, fungi, etc. Extensive tree planting projects involving schools and youth groups were complemented by the planting by NAC Streetscene of a mix of exotic tree species, together with trees selected to further enhance the diversity of the Spier's Arboretum that have been provided through FoS and their 'Memorial' and 'Celebratory' tree planting schemes. The Spier's Arboretum has a secure future with the prospect of additional species reaching maturity, such as aspen, toffee apple (katsura) tree, handkerchief tree, Wellingtonia, Wollemi pine, holm oak, walnut, fastigiate beech, sessile oak, monkey puzzle, and juniper that will give a total of around fifty tree species in the arboretum. Leaflets, Facebook, etc. A tree trail and accompanying leaflet were created in 2013 by the Youth Making Beith Better (YMBB) group to expand the information in the Spier's Old School Grounds leaflet. A Facebook page 'Spier's - Natural and Local History' exists for the benefit of visitors and supporters. The grounds have their own TripAdvisor page that attracts visitor comments and photographs. Memorials to John Spier and Spier's school The John Spier memorial, by William Brodie, now at Beith Auld Kirk. It had been in the Spier's school yard. The Spier's Commemorative Wall under construction in the former school grounds in 2010 The Spier's Memorial, now at Beith Auld Kirk, described as a \\"Monumental Shrine\\" in the RSA Exhibition of 1861, was designed by Frederick Thomas Pilkington, and sculpted by William Brodie. It was originally in the school yard, but later it was incorporated into Campbell Douglas & Sellars school building. The school is remembered in 'Spiers Avenue' on the Kilbirnie Road. Part of the unmetalled road that runs from Fairholm (Craigvue) down towards Craig House is known as Spiersland Way; the latter part is known as Roughwood Road after the farm of that name. A Spier's care Home also exists in Beith. Beith Primary school has a 'Spier's Library', a painting of the school and a stained glass window depicting the alternative design of the school, never built, but used on the Governor's official seal. It is dated 1870, 18 years before the school was completed. Gateside Primary school has a Spier's House as well as a Cuff House. The old War Memorial from Spier's is presently in storage at the North Ayrshire Museum in Saltcoats; the John Spier memorials were moved to the Old Kirk in Beith and the large statue of John Spier's was moved to Garnock Academy. Garnock Academy holds the details of the grant of a Coat of Arms to Spier's, a number of stained glass windows, a mineralogical collection and the rector's old table and chairs from the study. It may also hold the Governor's seal. Geilsland Youth Making Beith Better at the 2010 Spier's CITO Event Geilsland school from Spier's This was a half merk land, part of the 4 merk land of Marsheland, in the Barony of Braidstone. It was sold in four lots. In 1867, two of these lots were purchased by Wiliam Fulton Love, writer and bank agent in Beith. He built a handsome villa, in the domestic gothic style,Davis, Michael (1991) The Castles and Mansions of Ayrshire. Pub. privately. P. 97. and enclosed and planted with much taste, around the villa. This property is now part of Geilsland school, run by the Church of Scotland under its 'Crossreach' initiative. The name is pronounced 'Jillsland' locally. The origin of the name may refer to a gil or gyll, referring to a cleft or ravine as found at the 'Fairy Glen' where the Powgree Burn cuts through the fields. Pupils from Geilsland have helped to improve the grounds of Spier's by carrying out conservation projects. In 2015 the Church of Scotland ceased to use Geilsland as a school and it was sold to the Beith Development Community Trust Ltd.  Gateside Village  The village of Gateside lies close to Broadstone and Geilsland. It has a fine pub, primary school, plant nursery, Millennium garden, and the Isobel Patrick of Trearne Memorial Hall. Until recently it had a smithy. Trearne House stood nearby and was demolished, the site is now a large limestone quarry.  Industrial and social archaeology =The Moot Hill= The Court Hill of the Abbot of Kilwinning near Gateside village A Moot hill or Court Hill survives near Boghall in the old Barony of Beith. Dobie states that the Abbot of Kilwinning used it to administered justice to his vassals and tenants. It is a sub-oval, flat-topped mound, situated at the foot of a small valley. A number of large stones are visible in the sides of the mound. It is turf-covered, situated on a low outcrop, and is mostly an artificial work. It pre-dates the channelling of the burn which detours around it, the mound was probably isolated in this once marshy outflow of the former Boghall Loch (see NS35SE 14). It does not seem to lie in the area identified by Smith.Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. P. 81. =Quarrying= A sandstone quarry existed near to Marshalland farm and several sizeable limekilns and limestone quarries lay towards Broadstone; marble was found at Broadstone.Robertson, George (1820). A Topographical Description of Ayrshire; more particularly of Cunninghame. Irvine : Cunninghame Press, Irvine. p. 281. =Broadstone castle= The ruins of Braidstone or Broadstone Castle remained until about 1850. but when Broadstonehall Farm buildings were being rebuilt, the castle was pulled down and its stones used in the building works; the Broadstone Crags, the site of the castle, remain however. Broadstone lime kiln side wall =Broadstone or Hillhead Limekilns= The OS maps for 1858 show that the 'Hillhead Railway' ran to Broadstone quarry from Barkip Junction on the Ayrshire and Lanarkshire Railway branchline to Kilbirnie. At first sidings and a transfer system existed with a weighing machine at what was to become Brackenhills railway station, later a direct junction was laid. The line did not survive into the 20th century. The road nearby is still known as 'Reek Street'. Geology Several large fallen trees at Spier's Old School Grounds have their roots embedded in rock which is derived from an old lava flow known as a 'dike,' one of a 'swarm' that exist locally. The solid geology of the Beith area is dominated by rocks such as limestone, coal, and also whinstone, an igneous basalt. The whinstone is therefore derived from volcanic activity and often shows itself as 'dikes' which are usually linear seams of hardened lava which was originally pushed up through the overlying limestone or coal. Coal miners were greatly inconvenienced by these hard dikes. The basalt at Spier's has many distinctive holes or bubbles, known as vesicles. These formed when gases such as steam and carbon dioxide escaped as the compressive pressure got less in the molten rock as the lava reached the surface. The largest numbers of bubbles occur when the hardened skin of the lava surface prevented the bubbles from rising to the surface and bursting. Olivine crystal faces are visible, a mineral rich in silica, iron and magnesium. The size of the faces shows that the lava cooled relatively slowly, allowing the crystals time to 'grow'. Spier's is close to the limestone quarries of Broadstone, Hillhead, Middleton, Dockra and Trearne. Whinstone has been quarried along a dike at Barrmill and is still quarried (2011) at Loanhead.  DM Beith  A large Defence Munitions (DM) centre is located at Beith. The site was originally developed in 1943 as a conventional Royal Naval Armaments Depot, munitions store, for the Royal Navy. It now processes and stores Spearfish, Storm Shadow, Tomahawk and Brimstone missiles. The school lay within the 'Exclusion Zone', limiting new housing developments, etc.DM Beith Marshalland Burn This burn rises from springs within Spier's and runs under the road and field to emerge on the boundary of the Marshalland Playing Fields before entering the Powgree Burn near the old railway bridge at the 'T' junction for the DM Beith site. Polish prisoners of war in World War II used to collect their water from the Marshalland Well close to Bellscauseway and the carbonated water factory at this site may have used these waters to produce 'cooling and temperance drinks'. This enterprise was established in 1891 by Mr T. Murray and produced soda water, aerated water, seltzer, potass, magnesia, lemonade, ginger beer and ginger ale.Reid (2001), Page 68 The Lands of Roughwood The Spiersland Way is an old toll road that runs down to Burnside Cottage, probable at one time a smithy, stables and toll house near Roughwood Farm. Roughwood was a small fortified tower in the 15th century and was home sequentially to the Hammills, Sheddens, and Ralston-Patricks.  Micro-history  In 1912 several farms were held by the Spier's Trust and were subject to an official inspection by representatives of the trust. The Cuff, Marshyland, Bellcraig, Bogstone and Lugtonridge were all owned by the trust at this time.Reid, Page 84 Eglinton Street was formerly known as the Whang or Whang Street and the plot of land at No 62 was feued in 1826 from Lady Mary Montgomerie by Robert Spier. The small chapel in the grounds to the rear was apparently for the family's private use and is probably the same age as the house.

Litter was removed and an old path was cleared to allow better access to the site for local people and visitors to the area. Gateside Primary school have planted trees and bulbs donated by the community and Eglinton Country Park. Ardrossan Academy pupils have opened up new paths through the woods and the grounds. The 'Youth Making Beith Better' group carried out path maintenance and many other grounds improvements works at Spier's through their John Muir Award work. Ken Stewart of Dalry brought Wesley, his Clydesdale horse, to extract logs from the woodlands, providing a spectacle for visitors and removing fallen timber with minimal damage to the habitats. Beith Out of School Care produced publicity posters for the site and the YKG youth group had a BBQ and planted trees. Geilsland School was involved in several projects within the parklands, especially the Coronation Garden restoration.

The Cuff Gibson marriage stone at the Cuff, Gateside The Cuff farmhouse and entrance gateposts The Cuff was an estate which later became a farm, near Gateside. A marriage stone of the Gibson family gives the date 1767 and may have come from an older mansion house once situated nearby. The farm still has ornamental and functional entrance gates and gateposts from the Victorian era and magnificent lanes lined with beech trees. Margaret Gibson was an heiress, and her son John Spier was living at the Cuff at the time of his early death. The Spiers owned the Cuff estate and through Robert Spier's marriage to Margaret Gibson acquired the estate of Marshalland. References ;Notes ;Sources # Douglas, William Scott (1874). In Ayrshire.

Critical writing=Lacan at the Scene= Example of the crime scene photos in Lacan at the Scene. Lacan at the Scene is a work of non-fiction by Bond, published in 2009 by MIT Press. The book consists of interpretations of forensic photographs from twenty-one crime scenes from 1950s and 1960s England.Andrea Walker Jacques Lacan: Detective and Cyborg The New Yorker, 19 June 2009. The thesis put forward in the book is that homicide can be considered in terms of Jacques Lacan's tripartite psychological model, thus any murder can be classified as either neurotic, psychotic, or perverse.Henry Bond, Introduction to Lacan at the Scene (Cambridge: MIT, 2009) p. 1.pdf available from MIT. Retrieved, 13 January 2012. Bond's approach is closely linked to Walter Benjamin's assertion that, \\"photography, with its devices of slow motion and enlargement, reveals the secret. It is through photography that we first discover the existence of the optical unconscious, just as we discover the instinctual unconscious through psychoanalysis.\\"Henry Bond, 'Hard Evidence' in Lacan at the Scene (Cambridge: MIT, 2009) p. 23 pdf available from MIT.

Number 1, 2010., p. 116. Emily Nonko's review said, \\"Lacan at the Scene ultimately presents a complex dynamic between both psychoanalysis and medium of the camera, the way that photography permits the viewer to delve into both the murder's mind and the victim's corpse, the psychological as well as the corporeal.\\"Emily Nonko \\"the Exquisite Corpse?\\" Bomb Magazine/Bomblog, 5 February 2010 Reviewing the book for Time Out New York Parul Sehgal said: \\"While Bond’s interpretations occasionally strain credulity, his sensibility enthralls.

Daniel Hourigan, writing for Metapsychology Online Reviews said, \\"for the vast majority of the discussions in the more applied third, fourth, and fifth chapters, Lacan at the Scene enjoys a lucid and precise execution.

Characterizing his conception of street photography, in a 1998 interview, Bond said: \\"[For me street photography] is parallel to the psychoanalytic session, in that anything can be mentioned.\\" Bond began his street photography in the late-1990s and continued for approximately ten years concluding with his Interiors in 2005. Monograph books of Bond's street photography include two published in Germany – Point and Shoot (Ostfildern: Cantz) and La vie quotidienne (Essen: 20/21). =The Cult of the Street= Street fashion photographed in 1990s London.

The London Look: Fashion from Street to Catwalk (Newhaven: Yale University Press, 2004); Overview on Google books Critical response Reviewing the book for the British newspaper The Independent, fashion writer Tamsin Blanchard described the book as, \\"a rich social document of the way we dress—rather than the way fashion designers like to imagine we dress\\". Nike's Air Max MX are depicted in several of Bond's street photos. Writing in his commentary on the influence of the Young British Artists, High Art Lite, the art historian Julian Stallabrass said, \\"The Cult of the Street is telling of many characteristics of High Art Lite and its engagement with mass culture and the media. It takes as its subject not just the conventions of the street but youth and their modes of display in shops, clubs, parties, restaurants and even private homes ... they don't do much, Bond's people; they shop, of course, persistently, and present themselves to each other and the camera, dance sometimes, but the book is composed above all of an intricate fabric of exchanged glances and gazes.\\"Julian Stallabrass, High Art Lite (London: Verso, 1999), p.133. The complete section in Stallabrass is on Google Books here Writing in the British contemporary art journal Art Monthly, critic David Barrett said, \\"[In The Cult of the Street] values and meanings are constantly on the slide, be they the meaning of wearing brown instead of black, Airwalk instead of Airmax or including the subject's shoes in full-length photographs instead of cropping them. Bond sets out to document these fleeting social codes while also attempting to ride roughshod over the accepted conventions of photography.\\" =Point and Shoot= From Bond's Point and Shoot in which Robbie Williams confronts the photographer with the V sign. Bond's book of street photography Point and Shoot, was published by German fine arts publisher Hatje Cantz Verlag, in 2000; many of the images included imitate forms of photography that are derided or taboo, such as voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism; other images are grainy and suggest surveillance or CCTV images—the photographer is either an intrusive, prying, nuisance, or else reduced to an automaton-like spectator on daily life. Printed examples from the book were exhibited in both commercial and museum gallery exhibitions, including a survey—selected and organised by curator Eric Troncy—which was on display at the contemporary arts centre Le Consortium in Dijon, France, March through May 1999.Le consortium Exhibitions archive Critical response Writing in The Japan Times, in 2000, journalist Jennifer Purvis said, \\"Bond elicits a film noir quality from a city that prides itself on the worst side of its nature. It is contemporary London in all its banality and beauty, portrayed in heavy, highly contrasted black-and-white photographs that evoke nostalgia more keenly than an old movie ... the images all speak of the life, London life, captured by a peering, voyeuristic Londoner.\\"Jennifer Purvis, \\"Capturing private moments of a gritty London,\\" The Japan Times, 11 November 2000 Reviewing the book in Frieze, the critic Benedict Seymour said, \\"Bond jumbles up his subjects—street scenes, shop windows, night-clubs, posh parties, backstage fashion shows, intimate portraits and sex club sybaritics—as well as the composition, with the apparent intention of throwing our will to categorise, and so comprehend the image, into disarray.\\"Benedict Seymour, \\"Review: Henry Bond\\" Frieze, Issue 54, October 2000 In Germany, the book was awarded a Kodak Deutscher Fotobuchpreis in 2000.Photonews: Zeitung für Fotografie, Hamburg, Germany, May 2000. =Interiors Series= An example from Interiors Series, 2005 Bond's follow up to Point and Shoot, Interiors Series was published in Belgium, in 2005, by Fotomuseum Antwerp. The photographs included in the book appear to explicitly and deliberately invade the privacy of the subjects, who are captured—unaware of the presence of a photographer—at leisure, in their private dwellings. Writing in an essay accompanying the photographs, Bond said, \\"for me voyeuristic 'fixation' and the 'photographic act' have become inseparable. It is the sense of 'the illicit' that these photographs are leveraging. I must not be caught taking them, and in a way, the viewer of the photograph is included in my anti-social activity, they too are looking when they should not be.\\"Henry Bond \\"Comments on this Series,\\" in Christoph Ruys (ed.)

Critical reception In July 1990, reflecting on the East Country Yard Show and Gambler—a concurrent Goldsmiths-oriented warehouse show—in The Independent, art critic Andrew Graham-Dixon said, \\"over the past few months ... in terms of ambition, attention to display and sheer bravado there has been little to match such shows in the country's established contemporary art institutions.\\"Andrew Graham-Dixon, \\"The Midas Touch?: Graduates of Goldsmiths' School of Art dominate the current British art scene,\\" The Independent, 31 July 1990, p. 13. Writing in Artforum, art critic and curator Kate Bush said, \\"[Hirst's] Freeze anticipated a spate of do-it-yourself group shows staged in cheap, sprawling, ex-industrial spaces in recession-hit East London. Bond and Sarah Lucas's East Country Yard Show as well as Carl Freedman and Billee Sellman's Modern Medicine and Gambler, all in 1990, were, with Freeze, the shows that fuelled the myth of YBA as, paradoxically, both oppositional and entrepreneurial. Author Keith Patrick said, \\"[Following Freeze] many of the same artists showed again two years later in four artist-led exhibitions Modern Medicine, Gambler, the East Country Yard Show and Market ... although Freeze had been poorly attended and barely reviewed, these shows together became a symbol of a new artist-led entrepreneurship, a combination of calculated anarchy and an astute reading of the changing relationship of the artist to the market.Patrick, Keith (2000). \\"Foreword\\" in Sarah Bennett and John Butler (ed.), Locality, Regeneration & Divers[c]ities, Bristol: Intellect Books, 2000, p. 9 =Exhibit A= In 1991, Bond was invited by Julia Peyton- Jones to select an exhibition for the Serpentine Gallery; a curatorial project that became the 7 May – 7 June 1992, exhibition Exhibit A—a show on the theme of evidence and the scene-of-the-crime.Andrea Schlieker, \\"Preface.\\" In Bond and Schlieker (ed.), Exhibit A (London, Serpentine Gallery, 1992), p. 7.

In 1993 through 1995, Bond organised a series of screenings of experimental film and video, Omron TV. The screenings were presented in bookable-by-the-hour Soho film preview theatres—including De Lane Lea (Dean Street) and The Soho Screening Rooms (D'Arblay Street); the project included presentations of works by Merlin Carpenter, the German artist Lothar Hempel, and the Slovenians Aina Smid and Marina Grzinic.See the material held on Bond at the Artist's Film and Video Study Collection which includes printed examples of the original flyers to the screenings. The project was also presented at Moderna galerija, Ljubljana—Slovenia's national museum of modern art—in 1994.

In particular, Christov-Bakargiev states, \\"The pictures were not taken by Bond himself, and were instead collected by him at photo labs from among those rejected or never picked up by the shops' clients.\\" (p. 106).Tony White, \\"East Country Yard Show,\\" Performance, September 1990, p. 60; White states, \\"...snap-shots from the dustbins of 24-hour processing labs.\\" Bond also exhibited a collaboration with artist Sam Taylor-Wood, titled 26 October 1993, in which he pastiched the role of John Lennon as he had appeared naked, in a photo-portrait with Yoko Ono—shot by photographer Annie Leibovitz—a few hours before he was assassinated. Writing on Bond's art practice, artist and critic Liam Gillick said: \\"Bond's art is fundamentally negotiated. No apparently given element of his subject at hand is allowed to proceed while maintaining any sense of an essentialist value. While on the surface his production may appear to re-present lucidly some chosen images of the world around us, it does so with a sceptical relationship to the way meaning is encoded and interpreted by us every day.\\"Liam Gillick, \\"Keeping the River in Mind.\\" In Henry Bond/Angela Bulloch, Documentary Notes (London: Public Art Development Trust, 1996), p. 6. =Exhibition= In the early-1990s, Bond's work was included in two international survey exhibitions of contemporary art at Villa Arson, in Nice, France, No Man's Time in 1991, and Le Principe de réalité in 1993.Bond Villa Arson Archive.

The portfolio also included works by Gary Hume, Sam Taylor-Wood, and Gavin Turk. The title of the portfolio drew on a quote by the philosopher Montaigne (\\"I have gathered a garland of other men's flowers and nothing is mine but the cord that binds them.\\"). For his part, Bond supplied a text which describes a series of views in Monaco, written in the style of a tourist guidebook. The portfolio was later acquired by Tate.Tate collection: Henry Bond.

Names of famous people, places and events, as well as geographical features, are capitalised for emphasis.

To make the work the duo posed as a news reporting team—i.e., a photographer and a journalist—often attending events scheduled in the Press Association's Gazette—a list of potentially newsworthy events in London. Bond worked as if a typical photojournalist, joining the other press photographers present; whilst Gillick operated as the journalist, first collecting the ubiquitous Press kit before preparing his audio recording device.

Writing in his 1998 book Relational Aesthetics, Nicolas Bourriaud said, \\"video, for example, is nowadays becoming a predominant medium.

With her sister Emilie de Azevedo Brown, she created the Signing Time! video series to teach children basic American Sign Language (ASL), which was broadcast on public television. She produces, directs, and stars in the series, and handles much of its operations as co-founder of Two Little Hands Productions. Biography Coleman was born on October 9, 1974 to Lex and Linda de Azevedo as the fifth of nine children. Her father Lex de Azevedo is an American Mormon composer known primarily for his film scores. Lex's mother, and her grandmother is Alyce King of The King Sisters. Coleman and her father won a Pearl Award in 2007 for songs they had done for children. As Rachel De Azevedo she has been credited in several episodes of Touched by an Angel. Before moving out of the Los Angeles area, she performed with the band \\"We the Living\\" and appeared in the made-for-TV movie \\"Spring Fling\\". In 1998, Coleman and her husband Aaron discovered that their 14-month-old daughter Leah was deaf. She began learning sign language. In 2001, together with her sister, she created Signing Time! - a children's video series that teaches basic ASL to children of all abilities. In 2008, she was nominated for the \\"Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series,\\" for the 35th Annual Daytime Entertainment Emmys. In 2013, she began a campaign to crowd-fund a new children's series, Rachel & the TreeSchoolers, after it was turned down by networks for being too educational for television. As of April 2016, nine episodes in this series have been released. In 2018, Rachel Coleman became the executive director of the American Society for Deaf Children. Filmography * Signing Time!

Career Glenn had tried to qualify for the Lakeside nine times before finding success in the 2008 BDO World Darts Championship. He has been described as a \\"geek\\" by the press but he is received warmly by the crowds. His catchphrase \\"Whazza!\\" on throwing the double has resounded across the Lakeside since he won his first match there. He beat Niels de Ruiter, the number sixteen seed, in the first round of the championship by three sets to one. He had a 76.80 average compared to de Reuter's 74.04 average. This saw him through to the second round where he played Welshman and #1 seed Mark Webster. Webster was the eventual victor, winning by four sets to one. Glenn put up a fair fight in the match (and, in fact, had several opportunities to win the fourth and fifth sets due to Webster missing many attempts at doubles), coming out with an average of 80.13, just shy of Webster's 82.80. Although as Bobby George who was providing the commentary said, neither of the players played particularly good darts. Webster raised his game considerably afterwards and won the title. Although never likely to win the tournament, Moody was still a surprise hit with the Lakeside fans. Entering the stage to the strains of Bronski Beat's camp disco song 'Hit That Perfect Beat' whilst wobbling his skinny legs. Moody caused an instant reaction. His skinny frame, crooked teeth and permanent grin, provided one of the most surreal and entertaining moments in sport. Most of the crowd caught into 'Moody Mania' by chanting his surname when he won a leg, which was started by a group of friends. Soon afterwards, the whole crowd joined in. Moody has performed well in floor events in 2008, reaching the Last 32 in the Welsh Classic, the Welsh Masters and the British Open. Moody also attempted to qualify for the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts via the ITV Wildcard Qualifiers, but lost in his first match to Erwin Extercatte. Moody then failed to qualify for the 2009 Lakeside World Championship, winning two matches before losing to Paul Gibbs. Personal life Glenn is married to Lesley, a carer for the local council, and he is a house-husband who looks after son George at home. Due to his skinny build he is ironically nicknamed Mr Muscle.

Towards the close of his life he returned to Liège and was elected a lay canon of the church of St. Paul, and painted several works for the Prince-Bishop of the city. His The Glorification of the Holy Cross is in St Bartholomew's Church, Liège. A few years before he died he reportedly fell into a state of profound melancholy and had to be placed under the care of a medical man, in whose house he died. It has been argued that his colouring is pale and weak and his figures somewhat artificial. He is believed to have painted a portrait of Colbert and by some writers is stated to have been a pupil at one time of Jordaens, but this has never been verified. Gerard de Lairesse was one of his pupils.

Limberakis Gerakaris was born in Mani in around 1644. He served as a rower in a Venetian galley before becoming a pirate. After several years, he was captured by the Ottomans and imprisoned. After a failed attempt to capture Mani, the Ottoman Grand Vizier, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha, offered Gerakaris his freedom and to make him Bey of Mani in return for allowing the Turks to garrison some castles in Mani. In his brief reign, he forced several families to flee from the Mani. He soon returned to piracy and was imprisoned again by the Ottomans. However, when the Venetians invaded the Peloponnese in 1685, the Ottomans released Gerakaris and made him ruler of Mani, and in return he promised to fight for the Turks. When the Turks unsuccessfully attempted to poison him, he defected to the Venetians, who acknowledged him as Bey of Mani. In 1696, he sacked Arta because the citizens of the city had burned his property nearby. The Artans complained to the Venetian Doge, who had him imprisoned in Brescia, where he died in 1710. Early years Limberakis Gerakaris was born in Oitylo, Mani in ca. 1644. By the age of 15, he was serving as a galley rower in the Venetian navy. He is next heard of five years later, as a feared pirate. After three years of piracy, he was captured by the Ottomans and imprisoned in the Bagnio of Constantinople.Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, p. 27.Kassis, p. 31. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Grand Vizier, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha, who had successfully conquered Crete from the Venetians during the Cretan War (1645-1669), sent the pirate Hasan Baba to subdue Mani because they had assisted the Venetians in the war.Kassis, pp. 30-31. However, Baba's attack failed and Köprülü was forced to turn to Gerakaris for assistance. Köprülü offered him freedom and promised to make him Bey of Mani in return for allowing Turkish garrisons to take some Maniot castles as well as paying tribute to the Ottomans. Gerakaris accepted and was freed.Kassis, p. 31. Rule and capture When Limberakis returned to Mani, he ruled like a tyrant with the backing of the Turkish garrisons in Kelefa and Porto Kagio, although the Turks were boxed into the castles by the surrounding Maniots. He made life so difficult for his enemies, the Stefanopouli family and some other families, that they were forced into self-exile, with 700 people moving to Corsica, where they were granted asylum by Genoa.Kassis, p. 31. However, Limberakis soon fell out with the Turks and turned to piracy, raiding not only Ottoman but European ships. The Ottomans responded by capturing him during a raid in 1682 and taking him back to Constantinople, where he was imprisoned in the Bagnio.Kassis, p. 31. Return and downfall In 1684, the Venetians led by Francesco Morosini invaded the Peloponnese with Maniot assistance.Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, p. 28. The Ottomans, pressed by the Habsburgs, were unable to hold the Peloponnese, so the new Grand Vizier Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha suggested that Gerakaris be released from the Bagnio. Gerakaris accepted on the condition that he was given the title \\"His Highness, the Ruler of Mani\\" and that an amnesty was given to all the people of Greece. This was important because it was the first time the Sultan had recognised the autonomy of Mani.Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, pp. 28-29.Kassis, pp. 32-33. Limberakis joined the Ottoman army at Thebes and over the next few years launched several invasions of the Peloponnese. Limberakis, however, defected to the Venetians in 1696 after the Turks tried to unsuccessfully poison him. The Venetians pronounced him a knight of Saint Mark and continued to call him Bey of Mani. However, his disloyalty caused him to lose credibility with both the Turks and the Venetians. Later that year, Limberakis led a brutal sacking of Arta in retaliation for the Artans burning his property in Karpenisi. However, some Artans escaped and complained to the Doge, who had Gerakaris arrested and imprisoned at Brescia until his death in 1710.Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, p. 29.Kassis, p. 33.

Education and career  Richard Southwell was educated at Norwich School and the University of Cambridge, where in 1912 he achieved first class degree results in both the mathematical and mechanical science tripos.A. G. Pugsley, ‘Southwell, Sir Richard Vynne (1888–1970)’, rev. H. C. G. Matthew, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011, accessed 2 November 2013 In 1914, he became a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a lecturer in Mechanical Sciences. Southwell was in the Royal Naval Air Service during World War I. After World War I, he was head of the Aerodynamics and Structures Divisions at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough. In 1920, he moved to the National Physical Laboratory. He then returned to Trinity College in 1925 as Fellow and Mathematics Lecturer in 1925. Next, in 1929, he moved to Oxford University as Professor of Engineering Science and Fellow of Brasenose College. Here, he developed a research group, including Derman Christopherson, with whom he worked on his relaxation method. He became a member of a number of UK governmental technical committees, including for the Air Ministry, at the time when the R100 and R101 airships were being conceived. Southwell was Rector at Imperial College, London from 1942 until his retirement in 1948.Hannah Guy, The history of Imperial College London, 1907–2007, Imperial College Press, 2007. Page 749. He continued his research at Imperial College. He was also involved in the opening a new student residence, Selkirk Hall.  Scientific contribution  As a scientist, Southwell developed relaxation methods for solving partial differential equations in engineering and theoretical physics during the 1930 and the 1940s. The equations had first to be discretised by the finite difference methods. Then, the values of the function of the grids would have to be iteratively adjusted so that the discretised equation would be satisfied. At the time, digital computers did not exist, and the computations had to be done by hand. Southwell developed various techniques to speed up the calculations. For instance, in 1935, he used multiple grids for that purpose, a technique which would later be elaborated into the multigrid method.A. O. Demuren, Application of Multigrid Methods to solve Navier-Stokes Equations, NASA Technical Memorandum no. 102359 (1989).  Honours  Southwell received the following honours and recognition for his achievements: * Professor at University of Oxford (1925) * Fellow of the Royal Society (1925) * Worcester Reed Warner medal, ASME (1941) * Member of the National Academy of Sciences (1943) * Timoshenko Medal (1959) * Elliott Cresson Medal (1964) Southwell was also honoured with a knighthood.

Fight for independence at Cangallo 1814–1822 As a consequence of the discrimination of natives and mestizos in Perú, there were many executions of Peruvian indigenous leaders by the Spanish colonial authorities, the viceroyalty. In the course of the many rebellions and independence movements, the Morochuco population of the Cangallo region declared independence from colonial Spain in 1814. The Morochuco farmers then fought several battles in the region of Cangallo, among others at Matará, Rucumachay, Atunguana and Atuntoqto. The resistance against colonial troops went on until 1821. One of the Morochuco leaders became Basilio Auqui. He prepared a mud field in the plain of Seqchapampa so the Spanish cavallery would die in the mud trap which was successful on 21 November 1821 when Spanish cavallery was sent and a flight movement was simulated. As revenge for the defeat of the best colonial Spanish cavallery in the mud the Spanish intendant José Domingo Carratalá led the Cangallo attack by Spanish troops on 17 December 1821. Cangallo was razed and Spanish troops massacred the population shooting elder men, women and children. After more attacks by Basilio Auqui's units, the resistance movement under Auqui came to an end by betrayal in 1822, when the Spanish intendant Carratalá set out a head money on Auqui.

(1948) The Pattern of Soviet Domination Sampson Low, Marston & Co Pages 17-19 The signing of amnesty by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 12 August 1941, resulted in temporary stop of persecutions of Polish citizens under the Soviet occupation. Their mass persecution accompanied the 1939 annexation of the entire eastern half of the Second Polish Republic in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Pact against Poland. In order to de-Polonize all newly acquired territories, the Soviet NKVD rounded up and deported between 320,000 and 1 million Polish nationals to the eastern parts of the USSR, the Urals, and Siberia in the atmosphere of terror. There were four waves of deportations of entire families with children, women and elderly aboard freight trains from 1940 until 1941. The second wave of deportations by the Soviet occupational forces across Kresy (Polish eastern borderlands), affected 300,000 to 330,000 Poles, sent primarily to Kazakh SSR. The amnesty of 1941 was directed specifically at Polish victims of those deportations. The opportunity for evacuation of Polish civilians from the USSR came in a remarkable reversal of fortune. Following Operation Barbarossa, the USSR was forced to fight its own former ally, Nazi Germany, and in July 1941 signed the Sikorski–Mayski agreement with the Polish government-in-exile. The treaty granted amnesty for Polish citizens deported within the Soviet Union. The evacuation by General Anders lasted from March to September 1942. Well over 110,000 Poles rescued by the Polish government travelled to Iran including 36,000 women and children. However, the actual decision whom to consider Polish belonged to the Soviet side. As of 1 December 1941 the release of Polish nationals no longer included members of prewar minorities. All Polish Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Jews were considered Soviet and excluded from the amnesty. History The Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939,Zaloga, S.J.

Those who could prove they were Polish citizens had their citizenship restored (it had been annulled in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion in 1939). Yet there was no clear definition of the \\"Polish citizenship\\" and eventually the Soviets limited it only to Polish ethnicity (which de facto covered some Polish Jews, but not the Ukrainian or Belorussians who were former citizens of the Second Polish Republic).Cienciala, M.

(1948) The Pattern of Soviet Domination Sampsons, low, Marston & Co Polish refugees evacuated from the Soviet Union to Persia by General Anders, 1942 The term amnesty is criticized in Polish historiography, as it implies the Soviet Union had a legal basis for persecute Polish citizens (some of whom, for example, were persecuted for \\"treason of Soviet Union\\" - even though they had been Polish citizens in sovereign Poland, without ever breaking Polish law.Davies, N. God's Playground Volume II Page 451 ). However the Soviet Union claimed that the territories they occupied in 1939 were Russian, and by virtue of a referendum they had organised, the inhabitants of these territories were therefore Russian citizens. Whereas Polish Prime Minister Sikorski's critics in the Polish government-in-exile held the view that an \\"amnesty\\" could only be granted by a State to its own citizens and these citizens were Polish. Dr. Józef Retinger — of whom Anthony Eden had said that after Sikorski was the most important person in the negotiations — states that the blame for using the word \\"amnesty\\" rather than \\"release\\" was entirely on the Polish side and not the Russians. In his memoirs Retinger writes; \\"I am afraid that the responsibility for this lies on the shoulders of a good Polish diplomat, Mr Potulicki, who drafted this document.\\". According to Retinger, Potulicki had erroneously used the word \\"amnesty\\" and not \\"release\\" in the text of the treaty and there was no time to change the document before the signing took place. After Anders Army left Soviet sphere of influence, repressions towards the Polish citizens reintensified. Stalin effectively revoked the Amnesty on 16 January 1943 Hergt, K.

Early life Originally from a working-class neighborhood Bay View, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who also lived and worked in Madison, Wisconsin and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Wagner is probably best known as a political cartoonist. He was staff editorial cartoonist for his high school newspaper, the Bay View Oracle, in 1969-72, and a number of alternative media, college, neighborhood and special interest newspapers and magazines starting in 1972, including the UWM Post (1972–74 and 1976), the Marquette Tribune (1973–75) Minnesota Daily (1974–76 and 1997–2002), MPIRG Statewatch (1979–1987), Republican NewsRepublican News (1974-75), Hustler magazine (1977-78), Minnesota Tenants Union newspaper (1979–82), Elliot Park, Minneapolis Surveyor (1981–84), Gay-Lesbian Community Voice (1979–93), Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (1985–87), City Pages (1982–92), Madison Press Connection (1978) and others. Wagner's mentors were Bill Sanders of the Milwaukee Journal, Herb Block of the Washington Post, and Ross Lewis, retired Milwaukee Journal cartoonist. Cartooning career Wagner was influenced by Sanders to work in an acerbic \\"sledgehammer\\" style of political cartooning,\\"I Was a Teen-Age Gadfly,\\" by Pete Wagner. Minnesota Daily, October 11, 1974, P. 7. which was considered \\"too in-your-face\\" by most commercial, corporate daily newspapers (to quote an editor at one suburban Chicago paper).\\"Cartoonist continues to spark controversy,\\" by Josh Linehan, Minnesota Daily, Nov. 15, 1999. Determined to remain true to what Wagner considered the highest and best practice of the art form, rather than \\"selling out\\" by watering down his satire or drawing style, Wagner, inspired by the examples of Thomas Paine, Henry David Thoreau and I.F. Stone, forsook a career which by the time he was 20 years old held significant promise of wealth and fame to instead work for smaller but more journalistically feisty or risque alternative and college papers and magazines and to engage in radical political and cultural activism. Characterized by Isthmus as a \\"punk cartoonist\\" in a cover story about Wagner published in March 1978,\\"Pete Wagner: Cartoonist as Terrorist,\\" Isthmus, March 1978, Page One.

In 1977, Wagner was recruited by Larry Flynt to draw political cartoons on a regular basis for Hustler magazine, under the banner \\"Drawing Fire, by Pete Wagner.\\" Wagner quit less than a year later when Flynt announced that Hustler would be transformed from a pornographic magazine into a Christian publication, explaining that he did not want to \\"ruin my reputation by being associated with a religious magazine.\\"\\"Hustling For The Lord,\\" Newsweek, Dec. 5, 1977, P. 611\\"Madison Cartoonist Says He'll Quit Hustler.\\" (AP Story & Wirephoto.)

The comedic application of the \\"Tupperware Party\\" name to a student political party was the brainchild of UWM students James Rubin and Donnie Goetz.

(Columnist.) Twin Cities Reader, Aug., 1981. the 1985 Brain Trust, was involved. The Brain Trust was a collective of mostly University of Minnesota students who formed a cult-like group with Wagner that created and performed numerous myth-making actions and publications between May 1981 and June 1982. The Brain Trust resembled a highly politicized version of Andy Warhol's \\"The Factory\\" in its relationship to Wagner\\"Inside Guides: Ultra Vivid Scenemaker and Cartoonist Pete Wagner,\\" Mpls. St. Paul magazine, July 1990, pp. 52-53 (Cover Story) and collaborated with The Church of the Subgenius, publishing some of its earliest works. A history of the group is detailed in Wagner's second book, \\"Buy This Too\\". The Brain Trust's original core participants or instigators (the group denied having \\"members,\\" declaring \\"We have no members, only leaders\\"Buy This Too) were Tom Pettersen, who became a popular blues musician in Germany, Jim Hobson, whose performance and environmental art has been installed at numerous Burning Man events, Aaron Helfman, a successful Chicago designer and businessman, Theresa Blanchard, who later worked with various theaters in Minneapolis, and others.Buy This Too Wagner first encountered Pettersen and Helfman while hawking copies of \\"Buy This Book\\" at a newsstand in Dinkytown, a business district adjoining the University of Minnesota campus, in the spring of 1981. While organizing and performing theatrics that launched the Brain Trust in response to the annual appearance on campus by Brother Jed and his traveling ministry, \\"the Destroyers,\\" Wagner met Hobson and Hobson's housemates at the University of Minnesota Student Co-op, who conceived and performed as the \\"God Squad\\" and \\"C.R.A.P.\\" (Christians for the Revival of Ancient Precepts) alongside the Brain Trust.Buy This Too Wagner worked with more traditional methods of activism earlier in his career, for example when he organized ECO, the Environmental Cleanup Organization, as a junior at Bay View High School in 1969. ECO initiated recycling programs, conducted roadside litter cleanups and successfully fought the test-marketing of a non- biodegradable container by the Morton Salt company through the Milwaukee City Council between 1969 and 1972.\\"Education: The Solution to Pollution,\\" by Pete Wagner. Insight Magazine, Sunday Milwaukee Journal, June 18, 1972, P. 36. Wagner continued working as an environmental activist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he worked with Mike Walker to oppose energy waste. Wagner was a speaker for Zero Population Growth, Inc. from 1973 through 1975 in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. He served as co-chair of the Benjamin Spock for President campaign in 1972, when the famous pediatrician ran for U.S. president on a socialist platform which called for socialized medicine and a ceiling on personal annual income of $50,000. In 1974, Wagner was elected chairman of the University of Minnesota Irish Northern Aid chapter, and became a regular contributor of articles and cartoons opposing British imperialism for the Republican News in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\\"Anglo-American Press: Irishmen are Violent Men,\\" by Pete Wagner. Minnesota Daily, Feb. 6, 1975, P. 7** (Reprinted in the Irish Republican News, Belfast, April 1975)\\"British Self-Interest Sparked Irish Problem,\\" by Pete Wagner.

Writing, speaking, standup performances and publishing Wagner's political activism also has taken the form of creating and performing multimedia political comedy shows (\\"Pete Wagner! Pete Wagner!

HA! - The Twin Cities' Sorely Needed Humor Magazine\\" (published sporadically in volumes of one to fifteen issues between 1978 and 1993). Minne HA! HA!'s satire was typified by issues like \\"The Lighter Side of Total Global Nuclear Devastation.\\" Wagner's book designs were innovative for their time, influenced by the designs of Marshal McLuhan's books done by Quentin Fiore, and likened to MAD Magazine by WCCO-TV's Marcia Fleur in an interview with Wagner on \\"Newsday\\" in November 1987. Wagner also performed stand-up political comedy and satire at Dudley Riggs Brave New Workshop Theater in the 1970s and at Scott Hansen's Comedy Gallery on a regular basis in 1990. In addition to comedy and humor writing, Wagner has written numerous opinion pieces and editorials for various newspapers, including the Milwaukee Journal. Television and digital cartooning Wagner made efforts to adapt political cartooning to television beginning as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Mass Communication and Journalism in 1977, as a regular on Laird Brooks Schmidt's late-night television show on KSTP-TV in 1978–79 and in new media throughout the 1990s. He produced Public-access television cable TV shows at the Minneapolis Television Network in the early to mid-1990s with Schmidt, worked on ways to use digital media to draw political cartoons using Amiga computers from the late 1980s to late 1990s, and drew live political cartoons on KMSP-TV, Channel 9, the FOX affiliate in Minneapolis-St. Paul, on its morning news program on a weekly basis in 2004. Some of his new media cartooning efforts are posted on Wagner's website of political cartoons, most of which were drawn between 1997 and 2002 for the Minnesota Daily. Illustration and caricaturing In the 1980s and early 1990s, Wagner funded many of his activist projects with income generated by caricaturing at parties and illustrating and designing books, posters and periodicals. \\"Get Off My Brain: The Lazy Students Survival Guide\\", published by Free Spirit Publishing, was one of his most successful book designs, based on the numerous printings of the book. Cultural impact Despite the intensity and offensiveness of some of his work, Wagner developed a history of charming or winning over as friends many political enemies and targets of his attacks, something like the French philosopher, Voltaire. Bernard Casserly, editor of the Catholic Bulletin based in St. Paul, MN, wrote a scathing editorial in 1975 against Wagner in response to a cartoon about the Kenneth Edelin trial in Boston, condemning Wagner as \\"vicious,\\" \\"poisonous,\\" \\"malicious\\" and \\"sophomoric.\\" Yet Casserly wrote the glowing foreword 12 years later to Wagner's second book, \\"Buy This Too,\\" after the two became friends. Minneapolis Daily American editor Francis R. McGovern, an extreme right-wing conservative who would have fit into today's Tea Party movement, at first lambasted Wagner but later praised his use of humor to engage students to participate in political activism, and also stated that he was \\"honored\\" to call Wagner a \\"great friend\\" and \\"a damn good clown.\\" Rev. Joseph Head, an outspoken conservative activist who wrote a four-page, single-spaced, typewritten letter calling Wagner \\"A DANGEROUS ENEMY OF OUR COUNTRY!\\" in 1975,Minnesota Daily, Oct. 1975 (specific date needed) was a major participant in Wagner's \\"Generic Demonstration\\" at the University of Minnesota in 1982, and local news coverage by KSTP-TV broadcast the image of the 80+ year-old Head, in his three-cornered American Revolutionary hat and in front of his giant replica of the Liberty Bell, grinning happily with his arm around his former \\"foe,\\" Wagner.\\"Eyewitness News,\\" KSTP-TV, June 2, 1982 Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee J.

Company A, 2nd Battalion is one of several National Guard units with colonial roots. History The parent unit was constituted on 5 July 1942 in the Army of the United States as the 1st Company, 1st Battalion, Third Regiment, 1st Special Service Force, a combined Canadian-American organization. This unit was activated on 9 July 1942 at Fort William Henry Harrison, Montana, then disbanded on 6 January 1945 in France. 19th Group was constituted on 15 April 1960 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 19th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces. One year later, on 1 May 1961, the unit was allotted to the Army National Guard; 19th Group was concurrently organized from existing units in Utah with headquarters at Fort Douglas. Continuous reorganization developed over the next three decades, and by 1 September 1996, the unit consisted of elements from the Utah, California, Colorado, Ohio, Rhode Island, Washington, and West Virginia Army National Guards. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a company element from the 19th SFG was attached to TF Dagger as were several regular and National Guard infantry companies to provide FOB security and to act as a QRF. As the prospect of war grew A company, 1st Battalion, 19th SFG, were tasked with liaison roles supporting conventional forces: ODA 911 and ODA 913 were to support the I MEF; ODA 914 was divided into two elements, one supporting the 3rd Infantry Division with ODA 916 and the other supporting British Forces; ODA 915 was attached to the 101st Airborne Division; and ODA 912 was tasked with providing PSD for General Harrell, the commander of CFSOCC (Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command). p. 89 On 1 October 2005, 1st Special Forces was redesignated as the 1st Special Forces Regiment. Today's unit designation - Headquarters, 19th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces Regiment - was then established. 19th Group operators attend the same special operations training as their active duty counterparts. The unit deploys elements to conduct special, irregular, and counterterrorist operations in various places around the world. Their official motto is De Oppresso Liber (Latin: \\"From oppressed [to] free\\"), a reference to one of their primary missions to train and assist foreign indigenous forces. In September 2014, the Huffington post reported that members of the 19th SFG were deployed to Camp Ram Ram in Morocco to take part in Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara. Green Berets from the 19th SFG took part in the War in Afghanistan (2015–present); A Company, 1st BTN, 19th SFG was deployed to Afghanistan in July 2015 and several members were decorated for their actions during December 2015 and January 2016.

It is characterised by a large outlet glacier, Hoffellsjökull, and gabbro rock, which originally formed deep in the earth‘s crust but is now visible due to uplift of the area and glacial erosion. The Hoffell area is 15 kilometres from the town of Höfn. A guesthouse is located in the area with naturally heated outdoor hot tubs. Marked hiking trails are also to be found in the area.  Conservation  The Hoffell area is protected as an area with sustainable use of natural resources (IUCN category VI). It has been a part of Vatnajökull National Park since the park's establishment in 2008. The object of the area‘s conservation is to protect the habitat of several rare lichens with rare dispersion, and a few rare vascular plants. The area is also conserved for outdoor recreation.  Geology  Hoffellsjökull outlet glacier has cut through a central volcano which is named after Geitafell mountain. Geitafell volcano was active 5–6 million years ago. Mostly consisting of tholeiite basalt with minor amounts of hyaloclastite and rhyolite, the total thickness of the strata from this volcano is estimated to be 2,700 m. There are indications that Geitafell was a high mountain, possibly ice-capped even before the Ice Age. Glaciers have eroded this volcano, but signs of a huge caldera can still be seen in nearby mountains. The Geitafellsbjörg cliffs, east of Hoffellsjökull, are formed by an intrusion, mostly consisting of gabbro. Gabbro is a plutonic rock with the same chemical composition as basalt. Gabbro solidifies deep in the crust where it cools slowly, allowing large crystals to develop. This makes it coarser, harder and more resistant to weathering. Gabbro from a quarry at Geitafellstangi, on the edge of Geitafellsbjörg, has been used as cladding for the Central Bank of Iceland building in Reykjavík. Iceland spar, a variety of clear calcite, occurs in Hoffellsfjöll mountains. An object viewed through Iceland spar appears as two because of double refraction. Iceland spar was much used in optical instruments until replaced by synthetic material. In December 1910, the Hoffell farmer, Guðmundur Jónsson, was looking for sheep in Hoffellsdalur valley when he found a large number of Iceland spar fragments in a gorge on the mountainside. Along with a Reykjavík merchant, he started mining and exporting Iceland spar to countries like Denmark and Germany, where it was used in microscopes and other optical instruments. It was also used to decorate buildings in Reykjavík, where it can still be seen in the domed ceiling just inside the entrance of the main building of the University of Iceland, and in the altar of the University chapel. Production in the mine ceased in 1940.  Plants  Silver saxifrage.The mountain area east of Hoffellsjökull is the habitat of several rare plants. Silver saxifrage and green spleenwort grow in the cliffs, while the lichens Bryoria fuscescens, Bryoria simplicior, Hypogymnia tubulos, Vulpicida pinastri and Platismatia glauca inhabit the birch woods and shrubby areas. Green spleenwort, has pinnate leaves with a green midrib which distinguishes it from the maidenhair spleenwort. The low-growing green spleenwort is mostly found in south-facing rock crevices. Originally, it was only believed to exist in southeast Iceland, but has now been identified widely in east Iceland and north of Lake Mývatn. Silver saxifrage resembles pyramidal saxifrage but is much smaller and has fewer flowers. These are grouped together at the tip of the stem, five- petalled and white, while the stem grows out of a dense rosette of ligulate, white-toothed basal leaves. Silver saxifrage grows in rock fissures and occurs only in areas of Tertiary basalt lavas, which are mostly located in the east of Iceland, but also in the west and northwest.  Wildlife  Arctic foxes, field mice and reindeer live in the Hoffellsfjöll area, along with a great variety of birds. Commonly sighted perching birds include: *Redpolls (Carduelis flammea); *Redwings (Turdus iliacus); *Snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis); *Ravens (Corvus corax); *Wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe); *Wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes); and *White wagtails (Motacilla alba). Other birds often spotted are: *Ptarmigans (Lagopus mutus); *Golden plovers (Pluvialis apricaria); *Greylag geese (Anser anser); and *Fulmars (Fulmaris glacialis). Walrus teeth and sea urchins have been found on the gravel flats below Hoffellsjökull. The walrus teeth have been dated at 7,000 years old, indicating that at the end of the last glaciation, the sea extended into a fjord where Hoffellsjökull lies now.

Organized in 1855, it is part of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. Its building, completed in 1859, was designed by New York City architect J. Coleman Hart, and is one of the region's most distinctive churches, having a Gothic Revival design built out of half-timbered brick. On December 13, 1984, the church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The current pastor is Rev. Tobias Nyatsambo. Architecture and history St. Mark's is located in the village center of Ashland, on the east side of Highland Street just south of the town hall. It is a single-story building, its exterior consisting of half-timber framing filled with brick usually laid in stretcher bond, and set on a granite foundation. Stained glass windows are set in their own panel sections, and have cinquefoil arched heads and beveled surrounds. To the southeast of the main block stands a tower with an open belfry, which is topped by a hip roof that transitions into an octagonal steeple shingled with fishscale wood shingles. The Episcopal congregation in Ashland was established in 1855, and originally met in the town's union church. Planning for construction of this building began in 1857, and the first services were held on Christmas Day, 1859. It was formally consecrated in 1853, when its construction debts were paid off. The building was designed by J. Coleman Hart, an architect from New York City about whom little is known. The design is a high quality and distinctive example of Gothic Revival architecture, unusual for its use of brick and timber instead of either stone or wood framing. The building is the only known church in New Hampshire's Lakes Region built in this style. The accompanying parish house, built in 1899, is a good example of Shingle style architecture.

According to some sources he was born at Mondonico]/Olgiate Molgora in the Province of Lecco, and according to others in Pavia. It is possible that this artist is not correctly known as Ambrogio, but that his Christian name was Cristoforo. He was in the service of Lodovico Il Moro, Duke of Milan, for some years, and executed for him a medal and several pieces of goldsmith's work. He worked in Hungary in the service of King Matthias Corvinus, probably in August 1489; a later visit to the court was cut short by the King's death in 1490.http://www.invaluable.com/artist/caradosso-56zr9byht1 Later on he is heard of in Rome, working for Popes Julius II and Leo X. His will was executed in 1526 and he is believed to have died in the following year. Giorgio Vasari refers at some length to a medal struck by him in Rome, having upon it a representation of Bramante and his design for St. Peter's Basilica, and he speaks of him as \\"the most excellent goldsmith of that time, who has no equal in the execution of dies\\". He is said by some to have been responsible for the terracotta reliefs in the sacristy of San Satiro in Milan.However, others attribute these to Agostino de Fondulis. In addition to the Bramante and Moro medals, three others are attributed to him, one representing Julius II, another the fourth Duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza, and the third Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. A large number of examples of goldsmith's work in the sacristies of the various churches of Italy are attributed to Foppa with more or less uncertainty. They especially include reliquaries, morses, and crosiers. He was responsible for a papal mitre made for Pope Julius II, a drawing of which is held at the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum and was executed at the request of an English collector named John Talman. An inaccurate engraving of it by George Vertue is also in existence, and this was reproduced by Muntz in his article on the papal tiara. He declared that the pope told his master of ceremonies that it cost two hundred thousand ducats. It survived the sack of Rome through the accident of its being in a pawn shop at the time, but was deliberately broken up and refashioned by Pope Pius VI.See Thurston in the \\"Burlington Magazine\\" for October, 1895. Foppa is believed to have designed several pendant jewels, but there is uncertainty respecting his goldsmith's work, and little can be attributed to him with authority.

The Barrier Treaty made it possible for Austria to have its possessions in the Netherlands defended, whilst the Dutch Republic would not have to fight a war on its own territory. In the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht the allies conferred the conquered city of Tournai on the Netherlands for use as a barrier town.. After further ratification, the barrier towns were Veurne, Ypres, Menen, Tournai, Mons, Charleroi, Namur and the citadel of Ghent. In the War of the Austrian Succession, France conquered these towns, but at the end of the war was forced to return them to Austria by the 1748 Congress of Aix- la-Chapelle and the resulting Treaty. In 1781, the Austrian Emperor did not continue the Barrier Treaty, and the Dutch troops had to abandon the towns.

It wasn't until after his death that his work gained momentum and is now widely recognized. He is best known for his series on rural Kentucky, and series on India, San Francisco and New York shot in the 1960s and 1970s. Early life and background He was born in Greenville, New York. He studied at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. In 1955 he graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design and began work with Condé Nast. Career During his lifetime, Gedney received several fellowships and grants, including a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship from 1966 to 1967, a Fulbright Fellowship for photography in India from 1969 to 1971, a New York State Creative Artists Public Service Program (C.A.P.S.) grant from 1972 to 1973; and a National Endowment for the Arts grant from 1975 to 1976. In a career spanning late 1950s to the mid-1980s, he created a large body of work, including series documenting local communities during his travels to India, San Francisco, Brooklyn and New York shot in 1960s and 1970s. He is also noted for night photography, principally of large structures, like the Brooklyn bridge and architecture, and architectural studies of neighbourhoods quiet and empty, in the night. In 1969, he started teaching at Pratt Institute, though later in 1987, two years before his death, he was denied tenure. Gedney's work has been exhibited in numerous group shows, including Museum of Modern Art shows, Photography Current Report in 1968, Ben Schultz Memorial Collection in 1969, and Recent Acquisitions in 1971; as well as Vision and Expression, George Eastman House, and Rochester Institute of Technology, in 1972. However, he remained a recluse, had only one solo exhibition during his lifetime. Despite receiving appreciation from noted photographers of the time, Walker Evans, Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, and John Szarkowski, he remained an under-appreciated artist of the generation. He didn't manage to get any of his eight book projects published. William Gedney died of AIDS in 1989, aged 56, in New York City and is buried in Greenville, New York, a few short miles from his childhood home. He left his photographs and writings to his lifelong friend Lee Friedlander. In time, Friedlander's efforts, which had earlier led to the revival of E. J. Bellocq's works, chartered posthumous revival of Gedney's work. An extensive collection of his work, including large photographic prints, work prints, contact sheets, negatives, sketchbooks, notebooks and diaries, correspondence, and other files are housed at the Rubenstein Library, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.

It was founded in 1882 and was originally called Khedivial Sporting Club. It is located on the island of Zamalek in Cairo. History The grounds of the Gezira Sporting Club were initially carved out of the Khedivial Botanical Gardens, and as a result acacias and gardens continue to decorate the area. After the land had been formally leased to the British military command in 1882, club rules were licensed and the land was divided into several recreational playing grounds. At first, the club was for the exclusive use of the British Army. Membership was restricted to applicants elected by the committee, on the recommendation of two members, although British army officers were automatically enrolled. There were about 750 members. The entrance fee was E£ 2. The various subscriptions were as follows: * Life members: E£50. * Resident members (married): E£5. * Resident members (unmarried): E£3.6. * Country members (those living outside a radius of 23 kilometers from the Cairo Post Office in Attaba Square): E£2. Guests could visit the club whenever accompanied by those members by purchasing Day Passes for 50 Egyptian pound. In 1906, the club members asked the Egyptian government for ownership, but their request was refused. Instead, they were granted a 60-year lease. The exclusive character of the club continued until after World War II. In January 1952, the club was nationalized and became a public club. By this point, most members of the Gezira Sporting Club were Egyptians, but the club's members were from society's elite. As a result of nationalization, the ethos and structure of the club were to be altered during the Nasser regime. Half of its eighteen- hole golf course were given over to a youth club built by the Egyptian government on the club premises (making it a nine-hole course). Much of what was deemed as a traditionally aristocratic asset was nationalized for the benefit of the poorer majority. These actions made the Egyptian president at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser, loved and popular among the middle and lower classes of Egypt. During Anwar Al Sadat's presidency, a new elevated highway (the 6th October Bridge) was built over the remaining nine-hole golf course and six-furlong racecourse causing the size of the club to further erode. Despite suffering vandalism, the Gezira Sporting Club still offers most of the sports and games practiced by its founders: golf, tennis, squash, croquet, horse riding and cricket. What had started as a British military club evolved into one of Egypt's greatest outdoor attractions. Over the next five decades Gezira Sporting Club remained both a landmark and one of Cairo's greatest assets continuing to this day. As of 2012, membership was estimated to consist of 43,000 families. BasketballGolf ; About the courseGezira Sporting Club, Worldgolf. : 18 holes (played on 9 fairways), Par 70, , rating 68, three tees. ; Who can play : Annual members ; Golf services : Pro Shop, caddies, trolleys, driving range, club rental The 125-year-old par 70 golf course was the first in Egypt, and was once its best. Before the Nasser Era, it was an 18-hole course used only by British nationals. Tennis Since 1907, Gezira Sporting Club has been the official home of Egypt's lawn tennis with open tournaments and championships regularly held on its clay courts. From 1925, international celebrities took part in these widely attended events as it staged the International Championships of Egypt. Despite the launch of the Egyptian Lawn Tennis Association Championship in 1934, Gezira Sporting Club continued to offer its two cups: * The Doherty: awarded for the singles. * The Slazenger: awarded for the doubles. Swimming The Gezira swimming team was founded in the early 20th century. Now is one of the stronger swimming teams in the Egyptian Premier National Championships. It is ranked 13th out of 33 clubs.

Finley received scholarships from Texas, Arizona, Houston, Texas A&M;, and Texas Tech. College career Finley chose to play at Texas and received a redshirt during his freshman year in 2005. As a redshirt freshman, he played in all 13 games and started four of them when the Longhorns came out in two tight-end sets. He caught passes in 10 games and broke the school freshman tight end record for receptions at 31 and had 371 yards and three touchdowns. At the end of the year, Finley was named an honorable mention Freshman All-American team. Continuing on into his sophomore season, Finley started all 13 games at tight end. On October 6, 2007, Finley broke the school record for receiving yards by a tight end in a 28-21 loss against Oklahoma when he caught four passes for a career-high 149 yards. He finished the season with 45 receptions for 575 yards and two touchdowns. His performance earned honorable mention All-Big 12 Conference honors from the league's coaches and media. On January 8, 2008, Finley announced he would forgo his junior and senior seasons of eligibility to enter the NFL by declaring himself eligible for the 2008 NFL Draft. Longhorn head coach Mack Brown said \\"Finley finished his career ranked among the most productive receiving tight ends in school history and handled himself well both on and off the field during his time at Texas.\\" Professional career=Green Bay Packers= Jermichael Finley lined up.

He battled Tory Humphrey in training camp to be the Packers' No. 2 tight end.Finley to battle Humphrey for job Finley eventually won the battle with incumbent veteran, Donald Lee, for the starting tight end position. Finley had a breakout season in 2009, totaling his first 100-yard game in an October 5 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings while finishing the latter half of the season leading the team in targets. On January 10, 2010, Finley posted a franchise record in the Packers' playoff bout with the Arizona Cardinals, catching six passes for 159 yards (broken by Davante Adams in 2019). After posting two 100-yard games in the first three games of 2010, Finley suffered a season-ending knee injury against the Washington Redskins. He was placed on injured reserve by the Packers on October 18. Finley started the 2011 season off strong, catching three touchdowns in a Week 3 divisional match up against the Chicago Bears. Despite key drops late in the season, Finley still finished 3rd amongst tight ends in receiving touchdowns and 12th in terms of yards. After the 2011 season, Finley became a free agent. On February 22, 2012, the Green Bay Packers re-signed Finley to a 2-year $14 million contract. Finley was set to make a little over $5 million in 2012, and around $8 million in 2013. In week 7 of the 2013 season against the Browns, Finley suffered a bruised spinal cord after making a reception and colliding helmet to helmet with Cleveland Browns' safety Tashaun Gipson. He was immediately paralyzed and had minimal feeling in his legs and was taken to the ICU of a Green Bay hospital. Finley began regaining the ability to move his extremities the following day and was later diagnosed with a spinal cord contusion after the Green Bay Packers had examinations from specialists. After his spinal cord injury sustained in 2013, Finley became a free agent. =Free agency= Finley initially received interest from the Seattle Seahawks, New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers, but no contract resulted. In October 2014, Finley filed a claim on his $10 million insurance policy.

He was a professor of political economics at Stockholm University and a member of the Stockholm School of economic thought. He was president of the International Economic Association from 1968–1971. From 1969–1979, he was a member of the committee that selects the laureates for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, the Economics Prize Committee, and served as the committee's chairman from 1975–1979. Erik Lundberg was the son of mathematician Ph.D. Filip Lundberg (1876-1965) and Astrid Bergstedt. 1931-33 he studied in the United States as Rockefeller Scholar, after his associate degree at Stockholm University, and when he returned to Sweden, he received post at the Riksbank's economic secretariat. In 1934 he was economic planning committee financial advisor in Iceland. He took his doctorate in 1937 with Studies in the theory of economic expansion, and received the same year employment at the Institute of Economic Research, where he in 1944 became head. He was one of Finance Minister Ernst Wigforss' closest advisers and at that time almost the same time he was appointed the first professor of economics at Stockholm University, a position he held from 1946 to 1965. He was also expert in various state investigations in the 1930s and 40s. 1933-1935 published Lundberg, Ingvar Svennilson and Gösta Bagge, Wages in Sweden 1860-1930 I-II. In his doctoral thesis develops Lundberg the economic theory which Keynes presented in the Treatise of Money, and attempts, mainly by Knut Wicksell's work, combining it with a dynamic aspect, and launching a business cycle and a non-equilibrium theory. In other works he investigates investments dual roles of demand and supply, and stated that this could lead to an imbalance in growth.

Rider Haggard, published in 1892. It is said to be inspired by Haggard's time in South Africa (1875–82). It was illustrated by Charles H. M. Kerr. The novel tells the tale of the origin and early life of the hero Umslopogaas, the unacknowledged son of the great Zulu king and general Chaka, and his love for \\"the most beautiful of Zulu women\\", Nada the Lily. Chaka was a real king of the Zulus but Umslopogaas was invented by Haggard. He first appeared as an elderly but vigorous warrior in Allan Quatermain (1887). He also appears in the novel She and Allan (1921). Nada the Lily is unusual for a Victorian novel in that its entire cast of characters is South African and black. Nada the Lily features magic and ghosts as part of its plot. There is some anecdotal evidence that Umslopogaas might have been based on an actual person, although not as described in the book. He would have been a Swazi not a Zulu. Plot outline Nada the Lily is set at the time of Chaka, the Zulu king, around whom much of the action turns, but essentially the book is the story of Umslopogaas, and of \\"his love for Nada, the most beautiful of Zulu women.\\" They have been brought up as brother and sister but Umslopogaas is really Chaka's son. It is narrated by Mopo the father of Nada and witch doctor to Chaka, whom Chaka had vowed never to slay because he saved the life of Chaka and his mother when they were outcast wanderers. During the course of the novel Umslopogaas teams up with Galazi the Wolf, who lives on Ghost Mountain and has power over a spectral wolf pack. The story ends tragically when Nada, fleeing the wrath of Dingaan following the assassination of Chaka, takes refuge in a cave on the mountain. Galazi dies in her defence but the cave proves her tomb as she is unable to open the stone door she closed behind her. Historical basis Parts of the story are closely based on actual historical events and on folktales recorded by Bishop Henry Callaway and others. 'Mopo' is based in part on a man called Mbopa who was involved in the assassination of Shaka; however Umslopogaas, Galazi and Nada are wholly invented characters. The real-life Zulu kings Shaka and Dingane are major characters and the book is set around the time of real events such as the assassination of Shaka, the Weenen Massacre (the subject of Haggard's later novel Marie), the Battle of Italeni, the Battle of Blood River and the coming to power of Mpande kaSenzangakhona (Panda), the third king of the Zulus. Cultural influence Nada is an Arabic word for the dewdrops in the morning and, as such, a poetic metaphor for the concept of generosity, another possible translation of the same word.Nada. weddingvendors.com. It is also probable that the name is a reference to the Portuguese word meaning \\"nothing\\" because Haggard was introduced to that idiom while living in South Africa. Stephen Coan, \\"H. Rider Haggard, Ghost Mountain, & Nada the Lily\\" (The Natal Witness, 9 July 2001; archived ): \\"After a final scramble we ended up sitting on her head while Mdluli told me what he knew of the mountain, its history & the Zulu meaning of Tshaneni. \\"But why Nada the Lily?\\" he asked me. \\"Nada is not a Zulu name.\\" No it's not. It's Portuguese. Nada's grandfather was a white man, \\"a Portuguese from the coast.\\" Reception E. F. Bleiler praised Nada the Lily. Bleiler said the novel was \\"generally considered to be Haggard's finest work, a sustained, tragic story. While Nada is a sop to the romantic market, the remainder of the book is powerful, imaginative, and filled with cultural detail\\". John Scarborough included Nada on a list of what he regarded as Haggard's best novels, along with King Solomon's Mines, She: A History of Adventure, Cleopatra, Red Eve, and Eric Brighteyes.

It was founded in 1940. Because of the importance of the goat breeding on its economy, it annually hosts the Festival of the Shepherd. History The former city of Ñorquín was initially the capital of the department and had a population of more than one thousand inhabitants. The first municipal election took place in 1886. Its population gradually moved to El Huecú due that the previous capital was located on private property. The establishment of El Huecú was authorized on September 2, 1938 by the national decree 11392. In 1940, the Argentine Executive Power designated El Huecú as the new department capital, but it was officially founded on February 1, 1940. The municipality was built in 1973 and it received its third-category status, which still holds, on 11 November 1976. El Huecú is one of the northern Neuquen's municipalities that has a participative budget. Since 2004, the Mapuche people are recognized as original inhabitants of the region. In 2003, the lonko Carlos Maripal became the first non-elected member of the Mapuche community in the province to occupy a position at a local legislature. Origin of the name The municipality's name comes from the Mapudungun, meaning Genious of the evil. The word was used by the Mapuche people to refer to the bunchgrass Vulpia octoflora.

He was also an accomplished classical pianist. Biography Gillman was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1917. His family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1922. It was there that he started taking piano lessons at age six. They moved to New York City in 1926, and he began intensive training as a pianist. Upon graduation from high school in 1933, Gillman won a fellowship to the Juilliard Graduate School of Music. After one semester at Juilliard, he enrolled in evening classes in French and mathematics at Columbia University. He received a diploma in piano from Juilliard in 1938, then continued his studies at Columbia, graduating with a B.S. in mathematics in 1941. He stayed on as a graduate student, and completed the coursework for a mathematics Ph.D. by 1943. In 1943 Gillman accepted a position at Tufts College, working on a special project for the Navy Department. While there he wrote a thesis based on their work on pursuit curves, and he received his master's degree from Columbia in 1945. He moved to Washington, D.C. where he continued doing Navy work for the Operations Evaluation Group (OEG), affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After five years he took a one-year sabbatical at MIT to write a doctoral thesis. Originally he intended to it to be on game theory, but he happened to read a book by Wacław Sierpiński and became suddenly interested in set theory. With no specialists to advise him, Gillman wrote and published a paper that became his thesis: \\"On Intervals of Ordered Sets\\". He also sent the paper to Alfred Tarski, beginning a correspondence that led Tarski to claim Gillman as \\"my Ph.D. by mail\\". In 1952 Gillman accepted an instructorship at Purdue University, and in 1953 he finally received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia. At Purdue he began to do research in topology, in collaboration with Melvin Henriksen, Meyer Jerison, and others. This work concentrated on the ring of all real-valued continuous functions whose domain is a given topological space. They explored the relationships between topological properties of the space and algebraic properties of the ring. Gillman & Henriksen defined and characterized the classes of P-spaces and F-spaces, and Gillman & Jerison published an entire textbook on the subject: Rings of Continuous Functions, . In 1958 Gillman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he spent the next two years as a visiting member at the Institute for Advanced Study. He and former OEG colleague Nathan Fine defined remote points and showed that if the continuum hypothesis holds, then the real line (or any separable Tychonoff space that is not pseudocompact) has remote points. In 1960 he became chairman of the department of mathematics at the University of Rochester. He was active in recruiting top mathematicians to the department, including Arthur Harold Stone and his wife Dorothy Maharam. At Rochester, Gillman also became involved in activities of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). In 1969 he was appointed a regional Associate Secretary of the American Mathematical Society, but he had to give it up after moving to the University of Texas that same year. He chaired the UT mathematics department until 1973, when he was elected Treasurer of the MAA. He held this office for 13 years. Gillman retired from UT in 1987 and served as President of the MAA for the term 1987–1988. Leonard Gillman received a Lester R. Ford Award in 1994 and again in 2003.

The USMAC specializes in US market entry for small to mid-sized, high-growth companies in the information and communications, clean technology, and the life sciences sectors planning to expand their marketing, sales and operations to the United States. The USMAC was founded in 1995 as a joint venture of the San Jose State University Research Foundation and the City of San Jose's Redevelopment Agency. The original name was the International Business Incubator (IBI). Initially, the organization initially only offered furnished office space and virtual office services to international high-tech companies looking to enter the United States. When consulting services was added to its portfolio in 2003, the company changed its name to US Market Access Center to reflect the new focus. The organization, along with the San Jose BioCenter, the San Jose Software Business Cluster, and the San Jose Environmental Business Cluster, were part of the San Jose Redevelopment Agency Incubation Program. In 2006, the US Market Access Center was named a Soft Landing International Incubator by the National Business Incubation Association (NBIA). In October 2011, the Redevelopment Agency's incubator programs became the subject of a San Jose city government investigation led by City Councilman Sam Liccardo, following the discovery of a 2009 consulting report that had been commissioned, but never released to the Council. In it, a consulting firm concluded that the city's incubation programs consumed millions in funding, but produced almost no jobs. The study also concluded that companies that did succeed after working with the USMAC tended to leave for other facilities. What the study missed was the fact that as an accelerator, the USMAC intentionally graduates successful companies out of the program and the facility. This was not a weakness, but done by design. In 2012, the City of San Jose and the San Jose State University Research Foundation elected to close the BioCenter and Environmental Business Cluster, but the USMAC remained open and continued to grow its operations. Two years later, following the State of California terminating support for all of the Redevelopment Agencies in the state, the City of San Jose terminated its payment of the rent on the USMAC facility in San Jose (as required by its agreement with the University). In the fall of 2013, the USMAC announced that it would be closing its San Jose facility. In a letter to tenants, management stated that without financial support from the RDA, the facility in San Jose would be closed. The USMAC has relocated its headquarters to Menlo Park. In recent years, the USMAC has run major programs for: \\\\- Cap Digital (France) \\\\- Czech Invest \\\\- Enterprise Estonia \\\\- Enterprise Ireland \\\\- Eurotechnologies (Lille, France) \\\\- Japan External Trade Organization \\\\- Joint Innovation Center (Brno, Czech Republic) \\\\- Kaunas University of Technology (Lithuania) \\\\- National IT Promotion Agency of Korea \\\\- Republic of Poland \\\\- Singapore Infocom Development Authority \\\\- Tallinn Technical University (Estonia) In addition to its headquarters in Menlo Park, the USMAC maintains a presence at RocketSpace, a leading accelerator in San Francisco.

Frank was born in Nuremberg. His father was a dealer in provisions, living in comfortable circumstances, who destined his son to become his successor in business. But these plans were thwarted by Sigismund's fondness for art. The mother, without her husband's knowledge, had him instructed in drawing in the local academy. Having lost his father in early youth, Frank was apprenticed to his godfather Neubert, who carried on at Nuremberg the business of lacquering and decorating wooden boxes and caskets. His progress in this work was rapid, but he stayed less than a year with Neubert. After returning to the house of his mother, who had married a second time, he once more devoted himself to the study of drawing, meantime painting boxes for other manufacturers at Nuremberg and earning enough to pay his expenses. On completing his twenty-first year his parents induced him against his inclination to wed Marie H. Blechkoll, the daughter of a hotel-keeper who brought him as her dowry the inn Zur Himmelsleiter. He continued his art studies while his wife managed the hotel. However, he now turned his attention to painting porcelain, to which art one of his guests, the porcelain-painter Trost, had introduced him. His success was immediate, and when, after a married life of five years, his wife died, he sold the hotel and established a porcelain factory. The undertaking, which brought him a good income, led him to travel in Austria, Hungary, and Turkey; in Vienna he made the acquaintance of several prominent artists, under whose instruction he trained as a colourist. Glass-painting At the beginning of the nineteenth century, however, when Western Germany repeatedly became the scene of French invasions, Frank's business interests suffered severely. It was then that his attention turned in a wholly new direction. At the shop of a business friend named Wirth he met an Englishman to whom Wirth sold some fragments of ancient coloured glass for what seemed to Frank a large sum. On inquiry he found that the high price paid was because the art of painting in glass which had been coloured while molten - an art which had produced so many church and palace windows during the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance - had been entirely lost during the eighteenth century. Frank determined to recover the lost secret of this art. Unaided and untaught, he worked for several years to accomplish his purpose; his savings fast disappeared, and his success seemed more and more doubtful. His friends expressed fears that he would become a financial and mental wreck, and urged him to give up his efforts. But Frank persevered, and in 1804 there came a turn in his fortunes. He had found at last the method of producing coloured glass which he had so long sought. His first commission was to paint the coat of arms of the Rhenish Count Schenk, for his chapel in Greifenstein in Franconia. When this glass- painting was seen by the travelling agent of a London art house named Rauh, a Nuremberger like Frank himself, he felt at once that Frank's work was comparable to the ancient glass-painting the secret of which had been lost. He hastened to Nuremberg, saw Frank, and made business arrangements with him. Frank now made several hundred pieces for the English market, some of which made their way to Philadelphia and Baltimore. But the disappearance of Rauh in 1807 put an end to Frank's prosperity and might have had serious consequences had not King Maximilian I of Bavaria become the artist's patron (1808). Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bavaria Frank's execution of the royal Bavarian coat of arms made a good impression on the king and the latter not only paid him generously, but turned over to him for factory purposes the building called the Zwinger, in Nuremberg. Henceforth Frank produced many works for King Maximilian, such as the Circumcision, after Hendrick Goltzius; the Nativity; the Passion, six parts after Lucas van Leyden; the Mosque of Cordoba; St. Barbara, after Holbein; the Judgment of Solomon, after Raphael; the Magi, after Rubens. For King Louis I, also, Frank executed many commissions, especially the glass decorations of the cathedral of Ratisbon. In 1818 Maximilian appointed Frank painter in glass at the royal porcelain factory in Munich, with a salary of 800 florins annually. When, in 1827, Maximilian's successor established the royal institute for glass-painting, Frank was entrusted with all the arrangements and with the technical management, particularly with the preparation of the colours to be used and the manufacture of the coloured glass plates. He was also charged with instructing assistants in the secrets of his craft. Here he worked until 1840 when he retired with an annual pension of 1200 florins. He died, aged 76, in Munich. He was the father of many children, of whom the most prominent was the historical painter Julius Frank. Among his friends were the physicist Fraunhofer and the Viennese glass-painter Molin, who praised Frank's colouring, especially his reds and his flesh colour.

Description The Cushion Sea Star has eight short, distinct, triangular \\"arms\\", though 7- or 9-armed individuals can be found. These \\"arms\\" are laterally fused together for some of their length, leaving ray-like tips of varying length to jut from the disk-like body. This species aboral surface can be any colour or combination of colours, while the oral side is uniformly pale. This sea star attains a maximum diameter from arm tip to arm tip of 5 cm-10 cm. Distribution and habitat The Cushion Sea Star is found in the intertidal zone of Australian coasts from Western Australia's south coast to Queensland's coast off Currumbin, while including Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. This sea star species favours rocky coasts abiding both in tide pools and to a maximum depth of 3 meters below sea level. Ecology and behaviour Like other sea stars, the Cushion Sea Star is a slow-moving animal using its tube feet to move about, collecting or subduing the food items that constitute this omnivorous species diet, namely, algae, detritus, mussels and other invertebrates. This species is viviparous like a few others classified in the genus Patiriella, brooding its young within the body. References * Sea stars - Class Asteriodea[sic].
