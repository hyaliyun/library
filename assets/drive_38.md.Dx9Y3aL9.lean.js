The game shut down on the 28th of February 2017.Paradox Interactive Forum: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads%2Fwar-of-the-roses- shutting-down.995096%2F Retrieved 13th May 2018. A follow-up, War of the Vikings, was released in 2014, but was shut down in 2017.  Gameplay  War of the Roses puts the player in control of a single, customizable soldier fighting for either the House of Lancaster or the House of York. The game plays mainly in a third-person viewpoint and is a multiplayer game.http://www.gameinformer.com/games/war_of_the_roses/b/pc/archive/2011/08/22/fatshark- goes-full-retail-with-new-medieval-pc- project.aspxhttp://www.joystiq.com/2012/04/25/war-of-the-roses-and-chivalry- wage-war-without-all-the-nonse/ There are three different types of weapons which the player can equip at a single time: primary, secondary, and a dagger. The player starts with a pre-made melee character, the footman, but will quickly unlock a pre-made Guardsman (originally this was a crossbowman), longbowman and footknight. The pre-made characters have a competitive set-up and are viable characters to play. However, there are also 8 custom slots to unlock which can be customised with weapons, weapon modifiers, armour and perks of the player‚Äôs choice. At higher levels, horses can be unlocked to allow a cavalry class. Players can change their selected characters within a round and can modify the profiles of the custom classes between rounds. The hitboxes are quite precise and the damage is calculated based on whether the hit strikes armour of various materials or flesh and which part of the weapon strikes. A defeated player may be killed outright or simply ‚Äòdowned‚Äô in which state they can be killed off with an execution move, revived by a teammate or choose to respawn. As with most aspects of the game each choice is a risk/reward scenario. Once dead a player can choose to respawn in a respawn location for the team or on a ‚Äòsquad leader‚Äô if the player has selected a squad. There are currently four game modes to choose from. One is a standard team deathmatch game mode. The objective of Conquest is to conquer checkpoints in order. Each team starts at their home spawn points and moves towards the enemy spawn points. Conquering a checkpoint unlocks the next in the sequence. Checkpoints are conquered by standing close to the flag; the more team members are in place, the faster the point is captured. Coloured letters indicate the status of each checkpoint. A \\"pitched battle\\" is a single life mode in which the winning team has the last man standing. After a server-set time, the battle area shrinks, forcing the remaining players into combat. The Assault game mode has Lancastrians attempting to take over defensive positions held by the Yorkists. Each map has a series of checkpoints to be taken within a limited time. If the checkpoint is taken the attackers get an increase in time to take the next checkpoint. The game ends when the Lancastrians take the final checkpoint or the Yorkists hold out for the allotted time. There is also a coat of arms maker that allows substantial customization. The arms are shown on shields and armour and allow players to recognize each other in battle. On 6 February 2013, a free to play version of War of the Roses was released on the Steam digital distribution platform. This trial version includes access to most online servers, enabling trial players to play alongside existing players, whether paid or trial, but private servers may opt out of allowing trial players to join. The trial version limits players by disallowing any unlocks, giving access only to the game‚Äôs base classes and weapons. Trial players are limited to only two of the game modes, TDM and Conquest, and gain experience and gold at 80% of the full rate, which increases to normal rate if the full game is purchased using the same account. Trial Players also do not have access to the Battleground trainer, so there is no tutorial for Trial players. = Competitive Play = War of the Roses has a competitive scene with both duel based and clan match based competitions. The first War of the Roses tournament was held while the game was still in alpha at DreamHack Summer 2012 in Elmia, J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden. The final was held on the DreamArena Extreme stage on 17 June 2013 and shown on DreamHack TV. The winning team shared a prize purse of US$5000 and headsets from Plantronics. War of the Roses was added as an unofficial event at the Roses Tournament for 2013. The match between the two universities was streamed by Paradox Interactive with live commentary from John Rickne, Community Producer at Paradox, and Matt Hoving, Streaming Producer at Paradox. A community run competition, The Eurocup was run during spring 2013 with a unique in-game helmet provided as prize for the winning team.  Development  War of the Roses was announced at Gamescom on 17 August 2011 when Paradox Interactive revealed that the game codenamed ‚ÄòProject Postman‚Äô would be a multiplayer action game based on the Wars of the Roses and developed by Fatshark. Originally there was expected to be a single-player campaign, but time constraints meant this was reduced to a game tutorial. Considerable attention had been paid to ensuring the historical accuracy of War of the Roses. During development, M√•rten Stormdal of Fatshark and Gordon Van Dyke of Paradox travelled to England to research the period. They visited battle sites and towns and were given special access behind the scenes at the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds. War of the Roses had an early access week from 25 September 2012 for those who had pre-ordered. The official release date was 2 October 2012; the game launch was celebrated with a live stream hosted by Senior Producer Gordon Van Dyke. On 3 October 2012 Paradox Interactive announced the formation of a permanent franchise team for War of the Roses which would be led by Executive Producer Gordon Van Dyke. On 15 October 2012 Paradox Interactive announced new free content, including weapons, armour, maps and a new game mode. 'Content updates would automatically add new items to be acquired in the game. The system is designed to reward players who have invested a lot of playing hours into the game and items will be immediately available for players to redeem though accumulated in-game currency. For those who are too impatient, there are also options to purchase in-game currency to secure content.' On 21 November 2012 Paradox Interactive launched the new game mode, called \\"Pitched Battle\\", and the new weapons and armour with a live stream event. 'The update introduces a wealth of new armaments to every knight‚Äôs arsenal, including the Kingmaker sword, a finely crafted piece of steel brandished by legendary English nobleman Richard Neville, otherwise known as Warwick the Kingmaker. A new suit of heavy armour will also be available to choose with different paint options to customize one‚Äôs fearsome look. One new helmet, four new visors, and seven new weapons, including the gothic mace, the halberd, and the horn-spanned crossbow, will also join the fray.' On 19 December 2012 Paradox Interactive launched their ‚ÄòWinter has Arrived‚Äô DLC, with a live stream event. This brought new armour, two new snow-covered maps and new weapons including the Dagger and Sword of Mary for Christ‚Äôs Mass, inspired by medieval depictions of the Virgin Mary, laden with holy symbols. Both weapons were available from 21 December 2012, at a special holiday price, but they reverted to an extremely high price thereafter. On 23 January 2013 Paradox Interactive launched the Gallowglass Mercenary Pack, yet another free DLC, adding new armor and weapons to the game, designed in the style of Scottish mercenaries from the Middle Ages. On 27 February 2013 Paradox Interactive launched the 'Outside the Law' free content update, with new armour, new weapons including fire arrows and another new map, a lush, green forest. This was accompanied by a free to play weekend and a livestream. On 8 March 2013 Paradox Interactive released the only paid DLC for War of the Roses, the \\"BRIAN BLESSED VO\\" pack which replaces the existing in-game announcer with a vocal performance recorded especially for War of the Roses by the great British actor Brian Blessed. On 21 March 2013 Paradox Interactive relaunched the game as a premium version called War of the Roses: Kingmaker with more new weapons and armour. It also launched a new game mode, Assault, in which Lancastrians attempt to take over positions held by Yorkists. It was accompanied by the additions of full controller support and support for Steam's \\"Big Picture\\" mode. Again the Executive Producer Gordon Van Dyke presented a live stream to display the new additions to the game. On 19 June 2013 Paradox Interactive added new content with the Guns of Burgundy, adding a new weapon type, the handgonne, to the game. There is also a new map, Ravenspurn, which is available for all game modes and new weapons and armour. On 22 July 2013 Paradox launched the 'sneak teaser trailer' for a new game in the War of the Roses brand. On 31 July 2013 Paradox Interactive added new content with the Italian & Hanseatic patch, adding more new weapons and armour. On 2 August 2013 Paradox Interactive announced sign ups for the alpha version of the new game from the War of the Roses team. On 6 August they revealed the game to be War of the Vikings On 23 January 2014 at the Paradox Convention in Miami (Florida), Paradox Interactive announced they were setting up a new studio - Paradox Arctic in the north of Sweden (Ume√•) - to take over responsibility for maintaining War of the Roses. The studio is headed by Mattias Wiking (formerly at Grin and Starbreeze). On 2 October 2014 Paradox Interactive announced that they were stopping development on War of the Roses, and the sequel game War of the Vikings.  Reception  War of the Roses received mainly positive review scores. It received a score of 73 on Metacritic out of 100. Critics touted the game for its \\"freshness\\" and innovation.http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-01-war-of-the-roses- review Strategy Informer gave the game a score of 8 out of 10, noting its enjoyability.http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/waroftheroses/2011/review.html However, the review also noted its fairly steep learning curve. Elder Geek also noted the steep learning curve but pointed out that this was because success at the game is skill based rather than equipment dependent. The Guardian listed it as one of the best games to play in autumn 2012 saying that 'the visuals are astonishing' Kotaku apparently found the learning curve more friendly saying \\"If you like the idea of multiplayer shooters, though, but are sick of the steep learning curve and instant deaths, you should definitely give War of the Roses a shot.\\" PC Gamer was less enthusiastic about the game, calling War of the Roses \\"A slight but fun third-person medieval melee game. It‚Äôs definitely different, but needs more bulking out.\\" Good Game gave it 8 and 8.5 out of 10. \\"I feel like I have been waiting for this game for a long, long time. I haven‚Äôt had this much medieval bashing fun since the days of Rune. It just ticks all the right boxes for me, it‚Äôs community focused, rewards teamwork, there‚Äôs rich strategy and leaderboards coming too\\".

The icebreaker is equipped with one Racal Decca Bridgemaster navigational radar operating on the I band. The vessel is equipped a cargo hold. Edward Cornwallis is equipped with a flight deck and a hangar that can house two light helicopters of the MBB Bo 105 or Bell 206L types. However, the vessel is only allotted one helicopter. The ship has a complement of 25, with 10 officers and 15 crew. Edward Cornwallis has 9 additional berths. Operational history The ship was constructed by Marine Industries at their yard in Tracy, Quebec with the yard number 450. Edward Cornwallis was launched on 24 February 1986 and entered service on 14 August 1986. The ship is registered in Ottawa, Ontario, and homeported at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. On 17 December 2007, Edward Cornwallis was dispatched to recover the barge Houston carrying diesel fuel that had cast adrift in St. George's Bay near Port Hood, Nova Scotia. Facing winds and waves, members of the crew boarded the barge. They rescued the crew and kept the barge from going aground until a tugboat arrived on 19 December. Five members of the crew were later awarded medals for their efforts. On 2 March 2020, Shelburne Ship Repair was awarded a $12.1 million contact to refit Edward Cornwallis at their yard in Shelburne, Nova Scotia.

Early life  Palmes was the second son of Francis Palmes of Carcraig and Elizabeth Taylor, daughter of Thomas Taylor of Ballyport, County Limerick. The Palmes family of Carcraig was a cadet branch of the Palmes family of Naburn.Yorkshire Life, April - June 1952 Military career Palmes began a lengthy military career shortly after the Revolution, being granted a captain's commission in the regiment of the eldest son of the Earl of Devonshire in 1688.PALMES, Francis (d. 1719), of Charlton, Kent He served in Ireland through the 1690s and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He saw service during the War of the Spanish Succession. Battle of Blenheim Palmes assumed command of his regiment at the Battle of Blenheim. Reports from the battle state that 'hardly anyone was more instrumental to the success of that day' than Palmes, and his endeavours appear to have attracted the attention of the Duke of Marlborough. The Duke of Marlborough recommended Palmes for appointment to the rank of brigadier general. In August he was promoted to this rank and commissioned as brevet colonel of horse. Marlborough's patronage of a similar note was also received by two other Irishmen, the Earl of Cardogan and Thomas Meredyth in the mid-1700s. Palmes was closely associated with the two. The Duke of Marlborough was accused as having Brigadier Cadogan, Brigadier Palmes and Brigadier Meredith as his favourites. A poem from 1707 recognised this close relationship between Palmes and the Duke of Marlborough and states that 'Palmes was to marry Marlborough's illegitimate daughter and receive a portion of ¬£10,000'. He was promoted to major-general in 1707.  Political positions  Palmes stood at the by- election on 23 January 1707 for West Looe and was successful. He did not stand for re-election in 1708. Diplomatic missions From February 1708 Palmes travelled extensively, undertaking mission to the United Provinces, Hanover, Prussia, Vienna and Savoy in order to concert measures with the allies. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in the Army in 1709 and became envoy to Poland in 1718.

It was through Fayol's work as a philosopher of administration that he contributed most widely to the theory and practice of organizational management. Henri Fayol  Research and teaching of management  Fayol believed by focusing on managerial practices he could minimize misunderstandings and increase efficiency in organizations. He enlightened managers on how to accomplish their managerial duties, and the practices in which they should engage. In his book General and Industrial Management (published in French in 1916, then published in English in 1949), Fayol outlined his theory of general management, which he believed could be applied to the administration of myriad industries. His concern was with the administrative apparatus (or functions of administration), and to that end he presented his administrative theory, that is, principles and elements of management. His theories and ideas were ideally a result of his environment‚Äîa post revolutionized France with an emerging republic bourgeois. A bourgeois himself, he believed in controlling workers to achieve greater productivity over all other managerial considerations. However, through reading General and Industrial Management, it is apparent that Fayol advocated a flexible approach to management, one he believed could be applied to any circumstance whether in the home, the workplace, or within the state. He stressed the importance and the practice of forecasting and planning in order to apply these ideas and techniques, which demonstrated his ability and emphasis in being able to adapt to any sort of situation. In General and Industrial Management he outlines an agenda whereby, under an accepted theory of management, every citizen is exposed and taught some form of management education and allowed to exercise management abilities first at school and later on in the workplace.  Fayol vs. Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management Fayol has been regarded by many as the father of the modern operational management theory, and his ideas have become a fundamental part of modern management concepts. Fayol is often compared to Frederick Winslow Taylor who developed Scientific Management. Taylor's Scientific Management deals with the efficient organization of production in the context of a competitive enterprise that is concerned with controlling its production costs. Taylor's system of scientific management is the cornerstone of classical theory. Fayol was also a classical theorist, and referred to Taylor in his writing and considered him a visionary and pioneer in the management of organizations. However, Fayol differed from Taylor in his focus. Taylor's main focus was on the task, whereas Fayol was more concerned with management. Another difference between the two theorists is their treatment of workers. Fayol appears to have slightly more respect for the worker than Taylor had, as evidenced by Fayol's proclamation that workers may indeed be motivated by more than just money. Fayol also argued for equity in the treatment of workers. According to Claude George (1968), a primary difference between Fayol and Taylor was that Taylor viewed management processes from the bottom up, while Fayol viewed it from the top down. In Fayol's book General and Industrial Management, Fayol wrote that He suggests that Taylor has staff analysts and advisors working with individuals at lower levels of the organization to identify the ways to improve efficiency. According to Fayol, the approach results in a \\"negation of the principle of unity of command\\". Fayol criticized Taylor‚Äôs functional management in this way. Those eight, Fayol said, were #route clerks, #instruction card men #cost and time clerks #gang bosses #speed bosses #inspectors #repair bosses, and the #shop disciplinarian (p. 68). This, he said, was an unworkable situation, and that Taylor must have somehow reconciled the dichotomy in some way not described in Taylor's works. Fayol's desire for teaching a generalized theory of management stemmed from the belief that each individual of an organization at one point or another takes on duties that involve managerial decisions. Unlike Taylor, however, who believed management activity was the exclusive duty of an organizations dominant class. Fayol's approach was more in sync with his idea of Authority, which stated, \\"...that the right to give orders should not be considered without the acceptance and understanding of responsibility.\\" Noted as one of the early fathers of the Human Relations movements, Fayol expressed ideas and practices different from Taylor, in that they showed flexibility and adaptation, and stressed the importance of interpersonal interaction among employees. = Fayol's Principles of Management = During the early 20th century, Fayol developed 14 principles of management to help managers manage their affairs more effectively. Organizations in technologically advanced countries interpret these principles quite differently from the way they were interpreted during Fayol's time as well. These differences in interpretation are in part a result of the cultural challenges managers face when implementing this framework. The fourteen principles are: #Division of work, #Delegation of authority, #Discipline, #Unity of commands, #Unity of direction, #Interrelation between individual interests and common organizational goals, #Compensation package, #Centralization, #Scalar chains, #Order, #Equity, #Job guarantee, #Initiatives, #Team-Spirit or Esprit de corps. = Fayol's Elements (or functions) of Management = Within his theory, Fayol outlined five elements of management that depict the kinds of behaviors managers should engage in so that the goals and objectives of an organization are effectively met. The five elements of management are: #Planning: creating a plan of action for the future, determining the stages of the plan and the technology necessary to implement it. Deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who should do it. It maps the path from where the organization is to where it wants to be. The planning function involves establishing goals and arranging them in a logical order. Administrators engage in both short-range and long- range planning. #Organizing: Once a plan of action is designed, managers need to provide everything necessary to carry it out; including raw materials, tools, capital and human resources. Identifying responsibilities, grouping them into departments or divisions, and specifying organizational relationships. #Command: Managers need to implement the plan. They must have an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their personnel. Leading people in a manner that achieves the goals of the organization requires proper allocation of resources and an effective support system. Directing requires exceptional interpersonal skills and the ability to motivate people. One of the crucial issues in directing is the correct balance between staff needs and production. #Coordination: High-level managers must work to \\"harmonize\\" all the activities to facilitate organizational success. Communication is the prime coordinating mechanism. Synchronizes the elements of the organization and must take into account delegation of authority and responsibility and span of control within units. #Control: The final element of management involves the comparison of the activities of the personnel to the plan of action, it is the evaluation component of management. Monitoring function that evaluates quality in all areas and detects potential or actual deviations from the organization's plan, ensuring high-quality performance and satisfactory results while maintaining an orderly and problem-free environment. Controlling includes information management, measurement of performance, and institution of corrective actions. =Effects of Written Communication= Fayol believed that animosity and unease within the workplace occurred among employees in different departments. Many of these \\"misunderstandings\\" were thought to be caused by improper communication, mainly through letters (or in present-day emails). Among scholars of organizational communication and psychology, letters were perceived to induce or solidify a hierarchical structure within the organization. Through this type of vertical communication, many individuals gained a false feeling of importance. Furthermore, it gave way to selfish thinking and eventual conflict among employees in the workplace. This concept was expressed in Fayol's book, General and Industrial Management, by stating,\\" in some firms... employees in neighboring departments with numerous points of contact, or even employees within a department, who could quite easily meet, communicate with each other in writing... there is to be observed a certain amount of animosity prevailing between different departments or different employees within a department. The system of written communication usually brings this result. There is a way of putting an end to this deplorable system ... and that is to forbid all communication in writing which could easily and advantageously be replaced by verbal ones.\\" Administrative theory in the modern workplace Fayol believed that managerial practices were key to predictability and efficiency in organizations. The administrative theory views communication as a necessary ingredient to successful management and many of Fayol's practices are still alive in today's workplace. The elements and principles of management can be found in modern organizations in several ways: as accepted practices in some industries, as revamped versions of the original principles or elements, or as remnants of the organization's history to which alternative practices and philosophies are being offered. The U.S. military is a prime example of an organization that has continued to use these principles.  References   Further reading  * Breeze, John D., and Frederick C.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History Before the school was built, it was the site of a medieval hospital. In 1700 a charity school was built in the precincts of Chester Cathedral; it was the first school outside London to be established by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. The charity school was moved to the Blue Coat School, which was built in 1717. Almshouses were built behind the school. The school was originally an L-shaped building, with its main wing on Upper Northgate Street, and a south wing looking towards Chester city walls. The south wing contained a chapel, and the main wing the schoolroom and dormitories. In 1733 a north wing was added. A new fa√ßade was added to the main wing in 1854, and new almshouses were built. The clock was added the following year. The school closed in 1949, and the buildings were occupied by the Chester College of Higher Education (now part of the University of Chester). Its name has been incorporated in the title of Bishops' Blue Coat Church of England High School. Architecture The building has a symmetrical U-shaped plan, and is constructed in brick with stone dressings. It has a hipped roof in grey slate, and is in two storeys. The main block has five bays, with the entrance bay in the centre; the second and fourth bays are recessed. Between the bays, and on the corners of the building, are rusticated quoins. The entrance bay leads to a through passage. The entrance is surrounded by a Tuscan-style doorcase with a basket arch. Above it is a niche containing the painted statue of a Blue Coat boy sculpted by Edward Richardson. In the upper storey is a six-pane sash window, above which is a pediment containing a circular clock face. The recessed bays contain a basket-arched 19-pane sash window, and each lateral bay has a doorway with pilasters, above which is a blank panel. Between the storeys is a stone band. Every bay in the upper storey has a sash window similar to that in the central bay. Centrally on top of the block is an octagonal cupola with a copper roof. The internal faces of the lateral wings have fenestration similar to that in the main block. Their front faces have basket-arched sash windows, and the north wing has an additional basement window.

It is an adventure story about the military history of France in Indochina and Algeria. It received the Prix Goncourt, with five votes to three against Carole Martinez's '. It was published in English by Atlantic Books as The French Art of War (translated by Frank Wynne). Background L'Art fran√ßais de la guerre was the third novel written by Alexis Jenni, a high-school biology teacher, although the first published. He had previously written one which he never submitted to a publisher, and one which was not accepted. According to Jenni, L'Art fran√ßais de la guerre took five years to write. He considers himself a \\"Sunday writer, just as there are Sunday painters.\\" The novel was partly inspired by the debate on French national identity,Bruce Crumley. \\"Berets and Baguettes? France Rethinks Its Identity\\", Time magazine, Nov. 04, 2009 announced by President Nicolas Sarkozy‚Äôs government.

Medical supplies for the front, including bales of cotton Cummerbund of silk; closely fitting jodphur-like white cotton trousers. probably made by Serouphi Ebeyan, dressmaker to the Ethiopian Court. Cotton is grown throughout Ethiopia at elevations above 1000 meters and below 1400 meters. Because most of the lowlands lack adequate rainfall, cotton cultivation depends largely on irrigation. History Cotton production has long been underway in Ethiopia. Before the revolution, large- scale commercial cotton plantations were developed in the Awash Valley and the Humera areas. The Tendaho Cotton Plantation in the lower Awash Valley was one of Ethiopia's largest cotton plantations. Rain-fed cotton also grew in Humera, Bilate, and Arba Minch. In 1867 it was reported that there were plans to construct a road from the Ethiopian cotton fields to the Red Sea to trade with Egypt and Turkey. Since the revolution, most commercial cotton has been grown on irrigated state farms, mostly in the Awash Valley area. Production jumped from 43,500 tons in 1974/75 to 74,900 tons in 1984/85. Similarly, the area of cultivation increased from 22,600 hectares in 1974/75 to 33,900 hectares in 1984/85. Wubne, Mulatu. \\"Agriculture\\" (and subsections), A Country Study: Ethiopia (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds.) Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.. Given its excellent growing conditions, abundance of raw materials and availability of land, Ethiopia has the potential to become a major global cotton producer but the cotton industry in Ethiopia as of 2011 is far behind that of the coffee industry and cereal production. There are however, significant obstacles to the development of the industry in Ethiopia due to a distinct lack of administrative bodies to monitor and certify agricultural practices in the country and to process cotton in factories on a wide-scale commercial level. However, the development of the textile industry is a priority of the Ethiopian government in their economic growth strategy and in 2006 implemented an important privatization initiative to attract foreign and private enterprises to develop the sector. Despite its lack of governance, the Ethiopian cotton industry is self- sufficient and as of 2002 provides some 50,000 tons annually to the textile industry of Ethiopia.

Early life He was born to Ferdynand Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and Pelagia Sapieha on 8 February 1870 in Berlin. His great- grandfather was Prince Anton Radziwill and his great-grandmother was Princess Louise of Prussia (1770‚Äì1836). He was a member of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. The nickname \\"Rudy\\", or \\"Red\\", was a reference to the color of his hair. His friends also called him \\"Munio\\", while his relatives often referred to him as just \\"the Renegade\\" or \\"the Degenerate\\". As a count (Hrabia) whose property was based around the village of Antonin he was also known, especially locally, as the \\"Maharaja of Antonin (the Przygodzice ordynacja)\\", due to his luxurious and excessive lifestyle. He attained degrees in law and philosophy and worked as a diplomat in the embassy of the Russian Empire in Paris. He also served as a lieutenant colonel in the German and as a major in the British armies. He was involved in several major scandals which led to him being disowned by some members of his family. Career He served as a diplomat in Russian service until the Russian Revolution in 1917, reputedly speaking eight languages. He served as a lieutenant colonel in the German army and as a major in the British army. He returned to the Second Polish Republic in 1926, assuming Polish citizenship that year. His activities were a constant source of gossip for the interwar Polish and international press.The Courier- Mail 7 June 1939; The Examiner 21 May 1938 After he was disinherited by his father, he tried to get back several properties through the Russian government (at that time, those properties were part of the Russian partition). Increasingly distanced from his family, at one point he sued his own father. He retained the Przygodzice ordynacja, which he brought to the brink of bankruptcy. He closed a family chapel in Antonin, causing a scandal when he attempted to remove some of his ancestors from their burial places in the chapel. Involved in numerous extramarital affairs, once he punched his first wife, throwing her out of a speeding car. One of his cousins, Krzysztof Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, in his memoirs described him as a psychopath; many members of the family referred to him as \\"degenerate\\". =World War II= In 1939, on the outbreak of World War II, he is alleged to have attempted to appease the Nazi Germany occupiers by offering Antonin to Adolf Hitler. At that time, he also declared himself a German, and welcomed the invaders as \\"liberators\\". After his divorce, Micha≈Ç Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç had multiple debts and developed an addiction to hazard. When Hitler's army entered Poland Micha≈Ç Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç hoped to enter the Volksliste (Nazi Party list classifying inhabitants of the German-occupied territories) and in order to do so, he delivered speeches promoting Polish surrender to the German army. Micha≈Ç Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç also wanted to dislocate the family catacombs in the cellars of the Antonin property, and in 1939 is alleged to have offered the castle as the gift to Hitler. This however failed to generate him enough good will with the new authorities, and he was put under house arrest. In 1940 he was allowed to emigrate to France, where he spent several months in the French Riviera. A new wave of scandals there only confirmed his bad reputation. He spent the remainder of World War II with relatives near Berlin and in Switzerland. After the war, he settled in his second wife's estate in Tenerife, where he lived alone in increasing poverty until his death on 6 October 1955. He was also a Knight of Malta. Personal life He married three times. He had two children from his first marriage to Maria Niko≈Çajewna de Bernardaky (in 1898). That marriage caused controversy because Maria, a Greek aristocrat, was Eastern Orthodox, and the couple agreed to raise their children in that faith. His frequent beatings once resulted in Maria breaking her leg. He divorced her in 1915. In 1916, he married his second wife, the widow Maria Henrietta Martinez de Medinilla de Santa-Susana. Later he got involved with a nurse Mary Atkinson who committed suicide. He attempted to divorce Maria Henrietta in 1929, but it was never finalized due to technical difficulties; the couple, however, separated. For that reason, his third marriage in 1938 to Harriet Dawson was seen as possibly illegal, and caused him a new wave of legal problems and scandals.

Created and led by identical twins David Michael Bennett and Isabella \\"Bunny\\" Bennett, the act combines music and improvisational comedy on-stage, although their studio works focus almost solely on music. Steam Powered Giraffe has its own fictional mythology, with the band members portraying characters both on stage and on record; its fictional universe has been explored via several comic books mainly written and drawn by Isabella Bennett. Although the band underwent several line-up changes, it always focuses primarily on three robot characters (played by the Bennett siblings and a third performer, although the original line-up featured four robots), with several \\"humans\\" assisting and performing comedy, music and dancing on stage, and several smaller robots being performed via puppetry or voice acting. To date, they have released five studio albums, two live albums, several live concert films, provided the soundtrack for the 2015 video game SteamWorld Heist, and released an official single for the 2016 video game Battleborn.  Career  = 2008‚Äì2011: Formation and early career = The members of Steam Powered Giraffe met while taking Theatre Arts at Grossmont College. Afterwards, they became members of a local San Diego pantomime group called Troupe SD. Trained in pantomime by Seaport Village mime Jerry \\"Kazoo\\" Hager, and with collective backgrounds in clown, theater, music, and visual design, Jonathan Sprague, Erin Burke (a fellow pantomime artist) and the Bennett twins‚ÄîIsabella and David‚Äîstarted street busking as quirky robotic characters in January 2008 at Balboa Park, California. For their first performance in public they called themselves Steam Powered Giraffe Presents: Peoplebots . Later that month they changed their name to just Steam Powered Giraffe). Erin Burke left the group in 2011 to pursue a career in acting. Since their conception, the band has performed at venues including the San Diego County Fair, San Diego Zoo, Wild Animal Park, Legoland California, Ontario Mills, Downtown Disney, and numerous science fiction, fantasy, anime, and steampunk conventions. In October 2009, the band released their first album, Album One. It contained the previously released single from May 2009 titled \\"On Top of the Universe\\", in 2009. In early 2011 the band released a single, \\"Honeybee\\", announcing that it would be on an upcoming second album. In late 2011 the band announced the release of a \\"live\\" album entitled Live at the Globe of Yesterday's Tomorrow. = 2012‚Äì2013: The 2¬¢ Show and MK III = Their second studio album, entitled The 2¬¢ Show, was released in May 2012.

In April 2012 they released a DVD entitled, Steam Powered Giraffe: The DVD (and the Quest For the Eternal Harp of Golden Dreams). On 24 September 2012, the band announced on their Tumblr page that Jon Sprague would no longer be a part of the group.http://officialsteampoweredgiraffe.tumblr.com/post/32204911846/jon- sprague-departing-steam-powered-giraffe-dear On 1 October it was announced that Sam Luke, the drummer for the band at the time, would become the new robot in the band, \\"Hatchworth\\". On 2 November 2012, Hatchworth made his stage debut with SPG at Youmacon in Detroit, Michigan with interim drummer Mike Buxbaum (of A City Serene). Later, Matt Smith was named SPG's new drummer. During this time, SPG also introduced the characters of the Walter Girls into their shows. The Girls started out by manning the band's merchandise tables at performances, but have started figuring in to the SPG stage show and back story. Described as \\"blue matter engineers\\", the porcelian-white skinned and blue-haired Walter Girls (now called Walter Workers) are essentially the robot's caretakers on stage. In June 2013, SPG released a cover of Rihanna's \\"Diamonds\\", essentially a solo performance by the Spine. The accompanying video, released to YouTube, introduced a new character to the SPG canon, a robotic giraffe puppet named GG (voiced by Bunny Bennett). GG appeared again in July when the band released a comedic video, \\"Walter Robotics Rap\\", to YouTube. On 9 August 2013, Steam Powered Giraffe announced the title to their third album, MK III.

She legally changed her name to Isabella Bennett on 22 January 2016. More videos have followed in the meantime. In May 2014, they released their third cover, a mostly acoustic version of Daft Punk's \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\". The video marked the first \\"official\\" appearance by the female Rabbit to the general public at large (although the band had played some dates prior and some photos and raw audience footage had been seen). The band then followed up with two new videos: \\"Fancy Shoes\\" in June and \\"I'll Rust With You\\" in July, with the latter featuring live footage recorded at Anime Midwest in Rosemont, Illinois. In September 2014, Steam Powered Giraffe gave their first international performance, playing at the Grand Canadian Steampunk Exposition in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. They returned for the 2015 Exposition to do a collaboration show with Professor Elemental. On September 1, 2015, SPG released The Vice Quadrant: A Space Opera, a 2-disc space opera concept album containing 28 tracks, although iTunes released it as two separate albums for download.

Set in 1957 and the present day, the novel, which is a meditation on memory and personal history, solitude and intimacy, tells the story of Samson Greene, a young and popular professor at Columbia University, who is found wandering in the Nevada desert with no memory of his previous life. Plot Samson Greene is found wandering in the Nevada desert and is identified by the ID in his wallet as he has no recollection of who he is or how he got there. Tests reveal that Samson has a cherry-sized tumour in his brain and after the tumour is removed and found to be benign, Samson finds that he has no memories past the age of 12. Although his wife, Anna, holds out hope that Samson will eventually recover and remember her, Samson does not. Eventually the strain between them grows great as Samson grows less fond of Anna and bonds with a former student of his, Lana. Samson and his wife decides to separate and Samson sublets an apartment from Lana, who has temporarily moved to attend film school at UCLA. He receives a call from Dr. Ray Malcolm who invites him to come to Los Angeles and be a part of his experimental procedures. While in Los Angeles being tested Samson meets Donald, a man who is working with Ray and his team so that they can extract one of his memories. After Donald's memory is extracted Samson agrees to be the first subject to have a memory transferred into his brain. When the procedure succeeds he is left with violent images of nuclear weapons testing which upset him and cause him to leave the clinic and search for Donald. In Vegas, when Samson is unable to contact Donald he returns to the hospital where they removed his brain tumour and steals the slides with the samples of his tumour on them before running to his great-uncle Max's retirement home, hoping to find out where his mother is buried. While visiting Max, who has dementia, Samson realizes his mother was cremated and buried under the magnolia tree in his childhood home. He returns there and buries the slides of his tumour in the ground with his mother. Reception The novel was critically acclaimed. Joy Press, writing in the Village Voice, said: \\"Krauss is a fluent, thoughtful writer who takes on a lot of complex ideas and rarely loses her grip on them... Man Walks Into a Room is a chilling addition to the annals of amnesia lit. It's a novel that grapples with the ephemeral experience of being human and the realization that we create a lifetime of memories that vanish when we do\\".Joy Press (May 21, 2002). Living in Oblivion, Village Voice. Retrieved May 14, 2011. Gillian Flynn, in a review for Entertainment Weekly, described Krauss's prose as \\"casually dazzling, as are the ideas she explores through Samson\\". The novel won praise from Susan Sontag and was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. The movie rights to the novel were optioned by Richard Gere.

Models for ceRNA regulation describe how changes in the expression of one or multiple miRNA targets alter the number of unbound miRNAs and lead to observable changes in miRNA activity - i.e., the abundance of other miRNA targets. Models of ceRNA regulation differ greatly. Some describe the kinetics of target- miRNA-target interactions, where changes in the expression of one target species sequester one miRNA species and lead to changes in the dysregulation of the other target species. Others attempt to model more realistic cellular scenarios, where multiple RNA targets are affecting multiple miRNAs and where each target pair is co-regulated by multiple miRNA species. Some models focus on mRNA 3' UTRs as targets, and others consider long non-coding RNA targets as well. It's evident that our molecular-biochemical understanding of ceRNA regulation remains incomplete. Hundreds of publications have described the influence of ceRNA regulation in normal and disease cells, but ceRNA regulation and its effects continue to be debated in scientific circles.  Summary  MicroRNAs are an abundant class of small, non-coding RNAs (~22nt long), which negatively regulate gene expression at the levels of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) stability and translation inhibition. The human genome contains over 1000 miRNAs, each one targeting hundreds of different genes. It is estimated that half of all genes of the genome are targets of miRNA, spanning a large layer of regulation on a post-transcriptional level. The seed region, which comprises nucleotides 2-8 of the 5‚Äô portion of the miRNA, is particularly crucial for mRNA recognition and silencing. Recent studies have shown that the interaction of the miRNA seed region with mRNA is not unidirectional, but that the pool of mRNAs, transcribed pseudogenes, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA) compete for the same pool of miRNA thereby regulating miRNA activity. These competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) act as molecular sponges for a microRNA through their miRNA binding sites (also referred to as miRNA response elements, MRE), thereby de- repressing all target genes of the respective miRNA family. Experimental evidence for such a ceRNA crosstalk has been initially shown for the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which is regulated by the 3‚Äô untranslated region (3'UTR) of the pseudogene PTENP1 in a DICER-dependent manner. A new mechanism has recently been shown in which two closely spaced MREs (of the same or of different miRNA families) can cooperatively sequester miRNAs and thereby significantly boost a ceRNA effect. For a cooperative effect to be considered two adjacent MREs, however, have to be of miRNA families that are expressed high enough to actively repress targets and to be less than 58 nucleotides apart. The biological relevance of the ceRNA hypothesis has been actively debated. Most notably, it has been challenged by a group of researchers that performed a quantitative assessment of two miRNA families (highly and lowly expressed) and their binding sites in liver- and embryonic stem cells as described below. However, these studies were focused on one miRNA per context, and their leading researchers later identified physiologically-relevant ceRNA regulation of another miRNA.  Debate on the Physiological Relevance of the ceRNA Hypothesis  Two studies by Bosson et al. (2014) and Denzler et al. (2014) have empirically assessed the ceRNA hypothesis by quantifying the number MREs that must be added to detect ceRNA-mediated gene regulation. Both studies agree that determining the number of transcriptomic miRNA-binding sites is crucial for evaluating the potential for ceRNA regulation and that miRNA binding sites are generally higher than the number of miRNA molecules. However, they differ in two aspects: (1) the experimental approaches used to determine the number of ‚Äò‚Äòeffective‚Äô‚Äô transcriptomic miRNA-binding sites and (2) the impact miRNA concentrations have on the number of binding sites that must be added to detect target gene derepression. The discrepancies between these studies lead to different conclusions with respect to the likelihood of observing ceRNA effects in natural settings, with Bosson et al. observing a ceRNA effect at physiologically plausible and Denzler et al. at unphysiological competitor levels. In a later study, Denzler et al. (2016) has revisited the discrepancies between the two studies and has shown that while miRNA levels define the extent of repression, they have little effect on the number of binding sites that need to be added to observe ceRNA-mediated regulation. Using the same cells and experimental systems as the two studies they suggested that the number of binding sites are very high and better reflects the estimates of the study by Denzler et al. (2014), and that low- affinity/background miRNA sites (such as 6-nt sites, offset 6-nt sites, non- canonical sites) significantly contribute to competition. Due to this large number of background sites, their model suggests that prospects of observing an effect from a ceRNA are greatly reduced. Bosia et al. used single-cell assays to demonstrate substantial ceRNA crosstalk in instances where there is a balance between binding site counts, miRNAs, and target RNA expression profiles. Opponents of the ceRNA hypothesis pointed out that irrefutable proof of ceRNA-mediated gene regulation still remains to be shown since most studies either overexpress RNA transcripts at unphysiological levels or lack seed mutation controls when up- or down-regulating potential ceRNA transcripts. A mechanistically elegant study is especially important, as supporters argue that the quantity of work alone is in favor the ceRNA hypothesis. Two recent studies resolved this issue, demonstrating physiological effects and site- specific effects for ceRNA regulation. Supporters of the ceRNA hypothesis criticized the studies by Denzler et al. for their focus on competition for a single miRNA. They argue that since ceRNA regulations are orchestrated through the cooperative effect of multiple miRNA families, the study by Denzler et al. does not represent a typical ceRNA competitor and can therefore not be used to generalize. In addition, supporters are not surprised that our mechanistic understanding of ceRNA regulation remains incomplete. Instead, they point out that hundreds of genetics and molecular biology studies have found ceRNA regulation physiologically relevant. Taken together, evidence since 2010, published in hundreds of papers, points to the relevance of ceRNA activity in both cancer and normal cells.  Experimentally validated ceRNA Regulators and ceRNA Networks  = High-throughput validation of ceRNA regulatory networks = Chiu et al. used LINCS data to support the regulation of hundreds of genes by ceRNA interactions in prostate and breast adenocarcinomas. = The PTEN ceRNA Network = PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor gene which is frequently altered in multiple human cancers and is a negative regulator of the oncogenic Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Three recent studies have identified and successfully validated protein-coding transcripts as PTEN ceRNAs in prostate cancer, glioblastoma and melanoma. PTEN ceRNAs CNOT6L, VAPA and ZEB2 have been shown to regulate PTEN expression, PI3K signaling, and cell proliferation in a 3‚ÄôUTR- and microRNA-dependent manner. Similarly, in glioblastoma, siRNA-mediated silencing of 13 predicted PTEN ceRNAs including Retinoblastoma protein (RB1), RUNX1 and VEGFA downregulated PTEN expression in a 3‚ÄôUTR-dependent manner and increased tumor cell growth. Additionally, PTEN's non protein-coding pseudogene, PTENP1, is able to affect PTEN expression, downstream PI3K signaling and cell proliferation by directly competing for PTEN-targeting microRNAs. Pan-Cancer and CLIP-Seq-supported ceRNA regulatory networks has been constructed and is available at https://web.archive.org/web/20110222111721/http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/, computational predicted ceRDB has been generated and is available at http://www.oncomir.umn.edu/cefinder/ =Linc-MD1= Linc-MD1, a muscle- specific long non-coding RNA, activates muscle-specific gene expression by regulating expression of MAML1 and MEF2C via antagonizing miR-133 and miR-135. Whether Linc-MD1 regulates miRNA activity by sequestering miRNA through a typical ceRNA mechanism or if the highly complementary miR-133 site regulates miRNA activity through target-directed degradation remains to be shown. = BRAFP1 = BRAFP1, the BRAF (gene) pseudogene, has been implicated in the development of cancer, including B-cell lymphoma, by acting as a ceRNA for BRAF. Upregulation of BRAFP1 led to an overexpression of the BRAF oncogene. = Hepatitis C virus (HCV)= Hepatitis C has shown been suggested to regulate miR-122 through be a ceRNA mechanism when overexpressed in Huh-7.5 cells. It however still remains to be shown whether Hepatitis C can reach the high titers necessary in vivo in order to modulate gene expression through a ceRNA mechanism. =KRAS1P= Another pseudogene shown to have ceRNA activity is that of the proto-oncogene KRAS, KRAS1P, which increases KRAS transcript abundance and accelerates cell growth. =CD44= The CD44 3‚ÄôUTR has been shown to regulate expression of the CD44 protein and cell cycle regulation protein, CDC42, by antagonizing the function of three microRNAs - miR-216, miR-330 and miR-608. =Versican= The versican 3‚ÄôUTR has been shown to regulate expression of the matrix protein fibronectin via antagonizing miR-199a function. =HSUR 1, 2= T cells transformed by the primate virus Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) have been shown to express viral U-rich noncoding RNAs called HSURs. Several of these HSURs are able to bind to and compete for three host-cell microRNAs and thus regulate host-cell gene expression. =ESR1= ESR1 has been shown to be regulated by multiple miRNAs that are highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer, and its 3' UTR was shown to regulate and be regulated by 3' UTRs of CCND1, HIF1A and NCOA3. = MYCN = MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma has been shown to deplete the abundance of its miRNA regulators, supporting MYCN's role as a master ceRNA regulator in neuroblastoma. = HULC = Highly Up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) is one of the most upregulated of all genes in hepatocellular carcinoma. CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) has been implicated in the upregulation of HULC. HULC RNA inhibits miR-372 activity through a ceRNA function, leading to derepression of one of its target genes, PRKACB, which can then induce the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. Overall, HULC lncRNA is part of a self-amplifying autoregulatory loop in which it sponges miR-372 to activate CREB, and in turn upregulates its own expression levels. = ceRNA in bacteria = Bacteria do not have miRNA, and instead, ceRNAs in these organisms compete for small RNAs (sRNAs) or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Similarly, competition by ceRNAs for RNA-binding proteins has also been reported in eukaryotic cells.

Micha≈Ç Franciszek Sapieha (1670 ‚Äì November 19, 1700) was a Polish-Lithuanian magnate of the Sapieha family, Koniuszy (Master of the Horse) of Lithuania, and a general of Lithuanian and Russian armies. In 1680 he attended a Jesuit college in Warsaw, then one in Braniewo. He participated in the campaign against Turkey of Emperor Leopold I in 1690, and then after the Moldovan expedition of Jan Sobieski, returned to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1691. In the spring of 1692 he was promoted to Major General in the Austrian army and in the years 1693‚Äì1694 fought in further wars against the Ottomans as head of the 47th Styrian Infantry Regiment. He participated in the Siege of Belgrade in 1693. Lithuanian Civil War After returning home in 1695 he fought against the party of the Great Lithuanian Chancellor Karol Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç whom he defeated. He supported the candidacy of Augustus II to the Polish throne. From 1696 to 1700 he participated in battles against the anti-Sapieha coalition of Grzegorz Antoni Ogi≈Ñski and of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Wi≈õniowiecki and Pac families in the Lithuanian Civil War. After his surrender at the Battle of Olkieniki on November 18, 1700, he was murdered by a mob of drunken szlachta. One of the major culprits behind the crime was the Canon of Wilno, Krzysztof Bia≈Ç≈Çozor whose brother had been executed on Sapieha's orders a year earlier, and who instead of giving confession that Sapieha asked for was the first to physically attack him. Micha≈Ç was dragged out of the abbey where he was being kept prisoner, and hacked to death with sabres. His supporters who had been captured were killed along with him, while those who were merely suspected of being sympathetic to him were forced to slash at the corpse to prove their loyalty to the anti-Sapieha cause. Title On 14 September 1700, Sapieha obtained the title of Prince from Emperor Leopold I. The title became extinct upon his death on 19 November 1700. That year the family lost its dominant position in the Grand Duchy as a result of its defeat in the Lithuanian Civil War. Most of the family members were stripped of their titles and privileges by the victorious confederates. In 1768, members of the Sapieha family obtained recognition of the princely title from the Polish Sejm. After the partitions of Poland, the family appeared in the list of persons authorized to bear the title of Prince of the Kingdom of Poland in 1824. The title was recognized in Austria in 1836 and 1840, and in Russia in 1874 and 1901. In 1905, the family obtained the qualification of Serene Highness in Austria.

Events such as the Uruguayan military coup forced Galeano into exile in Spain and Argentina;Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) these exiles, in particular, may have been formative in Galeano's life and writing. The ruminations of this book were formed as a result of Galeano's desire to remember the past traumas and as well as to learn from them. Within this piece of nonfiction, he explores themes such as modern education systems, racism, sexism, poverty, economics, work, and societal fear. The pretense of the prose tends to be preoccupied with learning to rethink the contradictions of society; in a moment when outrageous circumstances are normalized, it is time to reconsider the understandings many people hold, which, in turn, informs the way such people view things. Though focusing on Latin America, Galeano uses what he has learned from the political and social environment within Latin America to understand injustices and social dynamics throughout the rest of the world. Form In Upside Down, Galeano makes a set of rhetorical and visual choices that expose the intentions of his book. Beginning with the title, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, Galeano uses the term \\"primer\\" to convey the educational goals of the book. Later on he uses the term \\"practicum\\" to reinforce such goals. Primer, in this case, both indicates Galeano‚Äôs wish for this to be the initial textbook that engenders a new structure of thought and also suggests a secondary meaning; he views Upside Down as a text that provides a clear foundation. Galeano's prose is accessible to intellectuals as well as non intellectuals; many examples are developed in very clear and simple terms. His desire to change his readers' manner of thinking is shown through the accessibility of this non-fiction piece. Furthermore, small drawings, such as the one seen to the left, occupy the pages of this text. The text and image is reminiscent of introductory textbooks and picture books. Overall, Galeano's choices seem to always enhance accessibility. Summary Upside Down presents the relationship between developed (or ‚Äúfirst world‚Äù) and developing (or ‚Äúthird world‚Äù) nations, illuminating the influences of the colonizer over the colonized. Seeing life as \\"upside down\\" becomes the central metaphor for looking at experiences throughout the book. Galeano‚Äôs epigraph clues the reader into this by farcically posturing Al Capone, as an authority on honor, law, and virtue. It is frightening that Capone delivers a truthful message about the realistic and corrupt state of affairs, given the business he works in. Upending experience calls into question structures we imagine as unchangeable and factual. Galeano suggests that we can start to understand our perceptions of power as based from media interpretations when these \\"facts\\" are turned upside down again and forced to stand on their own, inherently dropping all media constructed falsities. Common views of power and hierarchy within societies, institutions, and media begin to look less believable when held against the raw numbers Galeano presents to his readers. Galeano also challenges the First World, eurocentric readers with the question of why Europe and America are always presented on the top of the world, and why can't Latin America and Australia and Africa be seen as the top of the world?Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.337, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) The method of questioning also forces his readers to critically analyze themselves and their roles in these power dynamics. =Education= Galeano begins his analysis with the students, and eventually looks at the role of teachers in the classroom. Finally he moves to the employment industry, analyzing the lessons learned from commercialism and from the general society. He divides the students into social class based on familial economic standings and sees the futures of students based on these economic standings as being pre-set. Poor kids are disrespected for being poor, rich kids are respected for being rich, and rich and poor kids end up in the same position as their parents.Galeano, Eduardo, \\"Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World\\", p.7, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Further distinguishing between the social classes, he explains that rich children in Latin America never experience the city they live in; they live in a sheltered, private, improved version of it. Galeano claims that these children see their own societies \\"as a threat,\\" and therefore are \\"stripped of cultural identity\\".Galeano, Eduardo, \\"Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World\\", p.12, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Poor children, on the other hand, are \\"dodging real bullets\\"Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.13, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) and \\"little slaves in the family economy of in the informal sector of the global economy\\".Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.14, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) In Latin American society, poor children are seen as potential disasters after they are victimized in child labor, the sex trade and sweat shop labor. Galeano demonstrates that the current system of \\"education\\" locks poor children in their social space in ways that often cause additional social grief. Galeano shares the personal story of a street kid who looks to drugs to rid himself of all the problems he faces in his daily life of poverty.Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.15, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Meanwhile, the children that lie somewhere between rich and poor taught the \\"fear of living, fear of falling, fear of losing your job, your car, your home, your possessions, fear of never having what you ought to have in order to be\\".Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.19, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Teachers, after the redistribution of jobs so that jobs are now almost all temporary,Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.166, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) have had to accept that teaching \\"does not pay\\".Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.176, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Galeano points out that it is counterintuitive to be financially unappreciative of those who are greatly involved in forming the next generation of workers and citizens. =Racism, Sexism, and Poverty= People are drawn to capitalism with the promise of choice, but as Galeano points out, those who are allowed to actually make those choices are limited often by money, gender, and race.\\"This world, which puts on a banquet for all, then slams the door in the noses of so many, is simultaneously equalizing and unequal: equalizing in the ideas and habits it imposes and unequal in the opportunities it offers\\".Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.25, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Some of the ideas that Galeano puts forward as equalized are of what systems to reward and what to fear. For example, failure is condemned while injustices are often overlooked as a mere fact of life.Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.32, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Fear has taught us to look towards furthering security instead of justice. For example, Galeano references the relief that most feel every time a criminal is killed, therefore choosing security over justice.Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.72, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Furthermore, Galeano points out that the idea of \\"equalization\\" works against the beauty of variant individual identities and cultural identities, molding numerous people into a common identity that fits better with today's capitalistic society. As globalization continues, the difference between the rich and the poor of the world just keeps growing, and with this increased polarization has come a new vocabulary of degradation to describe class and racial differences.Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking- Glass World, p.44, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) =Economics= The system of economics, explains Galeano, seems to be dichotomized these days: \\"You have a job or you have nothing\\",Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.164, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) \\"What is rewarded above is punished below\\",Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.147, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) \\"Profits are privatized, losses are socialized\\".Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.155, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Global corporations take all the power over workers by threatening to move the business to another third world location at the slightest complaint. Despite the abolition of slavery throughout the world, there is a new type of slavery that has taken power, \\"wage slavery.\\" This references the type of pay that is just high enough to keep the workers in need of the job they have, but always low enough to keep the workers in a constant state of \\"humiliation\\".Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.173, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Galeano further problematizes the idea of the economy by suggesting the connection between the choices made by the military as made in reference to economic growth. \\"Good news for the military economy, which is to say, good news for the economy: the weapons industry, selling death, exporting violence, is flourishing\\".Galeano, Eduardo, Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World, p.113, Picador USA, New York, USA (1998) Ideological consistency The ideology presented in Upside Down reflects both Galeano‚Äôs contemporary, public rhetoric and the ideas behind the movements with which he is involved. Endorsing egalitarian social conditions, Galeano continues to reiterate one of the fundamental messages found in Upside Down, i.e. that control must be placed over the global forces that influence people‚Äôs lives. In a recent manifesto issued by a prominent group of leftists, Galeano, along with other leading activists such as Naomi Klein, demonstrated his cries for increased democratization over the global institutions that influence many aspects of people‚Äôs lives.\\"Amid International Protests, Intellectuals and Activists Issue Manifesto for Global Democracy.\\" Welcome  Campaign for a UN Parliament. UNPA. Web. 06 Dec. 2011. http://en.unpacampaign.org/news/580.php Focusing on what Upside Down poses as one of the most controversial systems in the world, the manifesto addresses the international financial system, calling to democratize globalist organizations and institutions such as the IMF, the WTO, multinational banks, G8/G20, and the European Central Bank. Seeking to deconstruct the imperialist dominance that such establishments embody and perpetuate to the end of great inequality, both racial and social, the manifesto declares, ‚ÄúWe are all born equal, rich or poor, woman or man. Every African and Asian is equal to every European and American. Our global institutions must reflect this, or be overturned.‚Äù\\"Amid International Protests, Intellectuals and Activists Issue Manifesto for Global Democracy.\\" Welcome  Campaign for a UN Parliament.

The administrative center is Moba port. The territory has an estimated area of and a population of almost 610,000. Geography and climate The west of the territory is bounded by Lake Tanganyika and the south by Zambia. To the north is Kalemie Territory and to the east Manono Territory and Pweto Territory. Rivers flowing through the territory include the Mulobozi River, Lufako River, Mulondi River, Lunangwa River and the Tshama River. Moba-Port has a tropical climate, with a dry season from June to August. Temperatures range from around to , but may fall as low as in June or July. Inland at and higher elevations the climate is cooler. =Subdivisions= The territory contains the following chiefdoms or sectors: *Bena-Kamanya Sector *Bena-Tanga Chiefdom *Kansabala Chiefdom *Kayabala Chiefdom *Manda Chiefdom Economy Lake Tanganyika is of great importance as a source of fish. The land is rich is minerals. Gold is mined on a small scale, and copper, iron and diamonds have yet to be exploited. The soil is fertile. Crops include corn, beans,cassava, potato, wheat, rice, sweet potatoes, sorghum, coffee, Eleusine, onions, garlic, peas, peanut, tomato, banana, sugarcane, different types of fruit trees and palm oil. Road communications are poor. Few people have television and none have internet access. Civil wars The territory has been damaged by a series of rebellions and civil wars, the last being the Second Congo War (1998-2003). Since then the destroyed or damages villages are slowly being rebuilt. On 1 August 2007 a mob of demonstrators assaulted United Nations military observers and damaged offices belonging to the UNHCR and sister agencies. The United Nations withdrew from the town and ceased repatriation of refugees living in Zambia. After the situation stabilized and the UN was able to return, it was expected that the great majority of the 43,000 Congolese refugees who were still living in Zambian camps would return home to Moba territory. Health and education There are five secondary schools for the territory, specializing in biochemistry, fishing, business, and teaching. All schools are poorly equipped.

It was known as the \\"Heretaunga School ground\\" until 1913, when the owners, Mr and Mrs W.

Two further first-class matches were held there, one in 1914 when Hawke's Bay played the touring Australians and one in 1915 when Hawke's Bay played Canterbury in the 1914/15 Plunket Shield. It was in use throughout the remainder of the 20th century, and Central Districts played two List A matches there.

Early life and education William Whitehead Ratcliffe was born on 6 October 1870 in the village of Clenchwarton, near Kings Lynn (Norfolk, UK), the youngest of four children. His father, Zachariah, was a draper's assistant. The family moved to Gorton, near Manchester, while Ratcliffe was still young. After leaving school and while working as a clerk for a cotton merchant, he attended evening classes at the Manchester School of Art, whose director of design at the time was Walter Crane, and learned wallpaper design.Allwood, p.11 Career By 1901, Ratcliffe was working for the Wallpaper Manufacturers Combine. Shortly afterwards, his work took him to London, where he discovered the Garden City movement, which drew him to Letchworth Garden City, where he moved in 1906. By 1907, Ratcliffe was living in Westholm, close to Stanley Parker, brother of the Garden City architect Richard Barry Parker. In 1908, they were joined by Harold Gilman and his wife Grace, forming a small artistic clique.

Today, Culhucan is fully integrated into Mexico City physically and politically. This area was designated as a \\"Barrio M√°gico\\" by the city in 2011. Modern Pueblo Culhuac√°n Culhuacan is one of the subdivisions of the borough of Iztapalapa, bordering the borough of Coyoac√°n. Geographically, it is located at the base of the Cerro de la Estrella mountain. Today, the area known as Culhuacan is politically divided into eleven units, called ‚Äúcolonias,‚Äù ‚Äúbarrios‚Äù or ‚Äúpueblos‚Äù with the historic center designated as Pueblo (village) Culhuac√°n, due its earlier independent status as an altepetl and then as a recognized pueblo by the Spanish colonial government.S.L. Cline, Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1986, p. 38. Graffiti mural by Nomadas Colectivo on 16 de Septiembre Street. The area was separate and rural as late as early 20th century, made up of chinampas separated by a series of canals. The Culhuacan area is now physically, economically and politically integrated into Mexico City, covered in modern cinderblock and cement structures that continue uninterrupted into neighboring areas. Line 12 of the Mexico City Metro passes through the Pueblo with the elevated station Pueblo Culhuac√°n only a couple of blocks from the central 16th century monastery complex. What is now Avenida Tl√°huac was a canal in the colonial period. This canal was a main waterway connecting Mexico City with the agricultural areas of Chalco and Xochimilco with flat bottomed canoes called trajineras carrying produce to the city. In the mid 20th century, this canal was closed, filled in and paved over to create the current road. Line 12 of the Metro here is elevated following this same road. To this day, the residents of this area maintain a kind of rivalry with those from the historic center of Iztapalapa on the other side of the Cerro de la Estrella. Both host passion plays during Holy Week and each has a small natural cave that contains an image of the buried Christ as a local pilgrimage site. Culhuacan's cave site is marked by a chapel called the Capilla del Se√±or del Calvario. It refers to the image was is said to have been found over 200 years ago by quarry workers in this cave. The pre-Hispanic City-State (Altepetl) The name comes from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúplace of the culhuas.‚Äù The term ‚Äúculhua‚Äù means ‚Äúancient or venerable‚Äù but it can also mean ‚Äúhunched‚Äù which might refer to the Cerro de la Estrella. However, the area was considered by the Mexica to be an ancient religious and mythical place as a connection to the cultural past. Culhuacan was founded in 600 CE and was a center of influence in the lake are of the Valley of Mexico . The Ram√≠rez Codex says that this city was recognized by the Mexica as a contemporary to the mythical Aztl√°n and of the ancestors of the peoples who were in the Valley of Mexico before the Aztecs. The early Mexica leaders married women from Culhuacan in order to legitimize their lineage. Culhuacan's prime was between the fall of Tula and the rise of Tenochtitlan, making it a major power in the Valley of Mexico for three hundred years. Culhuac√°n was located on the north coast of the Lake Chalco/Lake Xochimilco, which has since dried up. According to archeological studies, the site appears to have been continuously inhabited since its initial founding. Until between 600 and 800 CE, it was an important provincial city under the domination of Teotihuacan. Between 800 and 900 CE, it became governed by a Toltec-Chichimeca dynasty, which dominated much of the south of the Valley of Mexico. Between 900 and 1000 CE, Culhuacan, along with Tula and Otumba, formed the nucleus of the Toltec empire. When this fell, Culhuacan became a haven for the last of the Tula ruling class. The city declined but despite this, it remained the most powerful in the valley until the rise of Tenochtitlan in the 15th century. However, almost nothing remains of the pre- Hispanic settlement because it was completely destroyed, with the exception of the temple at the Cerro de la Estrella, which then became the center of the Aztec's 52-year renewal ceremony. Colonial-era Culhuacan A great deal is known about colonial-era Culhuacan, especially the late sixteenth century. Cullhuacan was the subject of a Relaci√≥n Geografica, a project by the Spanish crown to systematically gather data on indigenous communities. Many of these reports to the crown had pictorial maps drawn by indigenous scribes accompanying them; Culhuacan's written report and the map have been published.Gonzalo Gallegos, ‚ÄúRelaci√≥n geografica de Culhuacan,‚Äù Revista Mexicana de Estudios Hist√≥ricos (1927) 1(6)171-73.Mariano Monterrosa Prado, ‚ÄúEl plano de Culhuac√°n‚Äù Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia Boletin 39:12-16.S.L.

The richest source of Culhuacan's history is a collection of last wills and testaments and other documents in Nahuatl from the period 1580‚Äì1600, now found in the collections of the Universidad Iberoamericana.S.L. Cline and Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla, The Testaments of Culhuacan. UCLA Latin American Center Publications, Nahuatl Studies Series 1, 1984. The analysis of the information in the Nahuatl wills has made possible the writing of a social history of the town at a particular period in its colonial history, an example of the New Philology.Cline, Colonial Culhuacan The monastery The monastery of San Juan Evangelista is one of the few remaining from the 16th century in Mexico City. It is located on Avenida 10 between Avenida Taxquena and Avenida Tl√°huac. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Culhuacan was selected as an evangelization center first by the Franciscans and then by the Augustinians. The Franciscans founded a small mission over the ruins of the Culhuacan main temple. They were replaced by the Augustinians between 1552 and 1569, who replaced the Franciscan mission with a monastery and church. This monastery was dedicated to the John the Apostle and became the center of learning and religion for the area. The monastery closed as such in 1756, when the Spanish Crown took away much of the power of the religious orders in New Spain. The complex was converted into a parish. Later it became a Catholic school and then a barracks for the Zapatistas. It also served as the offices of the Direction of Historic Monuments of the INAH. Restoration work began in 1944 when it was declared a historic monument, and finished in the 1980s. The monastery is built in a mostly Renaissance style with walls of basalt obtained locally. The current portico used to lead to the monastery's garden and originally served as an open chapel, then as a portal to receive pilgrims. The wall of this has a series of multicolored frames in Baroque style. In the vestibule a figure of Saint Augustine is featured protecting representatives of various religious orders. Attached to the vestibule is a small chapel for meditation which also conserves some of its painting from the 16th century. The cloister is square and sober with frescos in Baroque/Plateresque style. It has a garden area in the center and on the four sides there are arches in a somewhat Romance style. Behind these are wide corridors which lead to the kitchen, baths, dining room, refectory, chapter house, library, study areas, the church and confessionals. The upper cloister has twelve cells for monks now occupied by offices and halls of the site museum. This area contains some of the best preserved black and white murals from the 16th century and makes the complex notable. These murals include scenes of Augustinian martyrs and one called the Adoration of the Magi. Part of the cloister was opened as a museum in 1995, with three halls dedicated to the area's pre-Hispanic history and one to its colonial history. The first hall is called the ‚ÄúDominion of Culhuacan and the lake area‚Äù which contains ceramics such as plates and bowls, mostly of Toltec influence. The other two halls have to do with the history of the city under Mexica domination. During this time, the city was a ceremonial center. Objects on display include cups for pulque, an effigy of the god of death, female figurines, seals, a sacrificial knife, a mask depicting the god Tlaloc and a sculpture of the goddess Chicomec√≥atl in basalt, which is unique. One section is dedicated to the New Fire ceremony. In addition, there are a number of objects related to everyday life during the pre-Hispanic era, such as farming tools, objects related to textiles and obsidian knives and spear points. Most of the pieces on display are from excavations from the adjoining Parque Hist√≥rico and others donated by residents of Culhuac√°n. The last hall relates to the colonial period, which used to be a private chapel for the use of the monks. The objects here are from the original church, such as the base of the pulpit and four wood columns of an altarpiece from the 16th and 17th centuries. There is also a collection of photographs including those showing the restoration of the complex. The Culhuacan Community Center is also located in the former monastery. It is a pilot program of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia dedicated to research, rescue and conservation of local cultural and artistic heritage as well as education. It hosts events such as workshops, concerts, theater, dance and a library, as well as festivals such as the Festival del Son Jarocho and the Feria Latinoamericana del Tamal. It was established in 1984. Other landmarks Chapel of the Se√±or del Calvario The Parque Historico was established to protect the remaining pre-Hispanic ruins along with a colonial-era dock and reservoir from when this area was part of the chinampa zone on the shoreline of Lake Chalco/Lake Xochimilco and later on the canal connecting it to Mexico City. In the past, this spot was one of the most important for Culhuac√°n which it is now again today, now as a recreational area. It is part of a reforestation effort in the area by Saul Alcantara Onofre of the INAH and contains native species such as Montezuma cypress and holm oaks . Culhuacan was home to the first paper mill in New Spain, constructed on what is now Avenida Tl√°huac and began functioning in 1580. It was constructed next to a spring, whose water was used to power the millstone. Today, the remains of this mill are in an enclosed plaza. The ruins of the paper mill lay for several centuries without anyone knowing what they were until the mid-20th century. It was used as a garbage dump until the site was investigated by a woman named Teresa Ambriz. However, it was not designated as a historical site until 1987, as part of the monastery complex. The site is flanked by vendors and is hard to see by the casual passer-by. When the monastery church was closed, another church was built between 1880 and 1897 to the south to replace it. It was also named San Juan Evangelista. This church has a single name with circular windows on the side walls. The cupola has images of various angels and it has the small Plateresque columns on its altar that are on that of the original church. The Capilla del Se√±or del Calvario is an important sanctuary in Pueblo Culhuac√°n as well as Xochimilco and Tlalpan. It contains an image of a buried Christ. This church was built between at the end of the 19th century or early 20th. The interior is small but extended by an appendage added outside and attached to the front facade. The interior is noted for its rich ornamentation with gold leaf on the columns, capitals and areas of the ceiling. The image generally found on the main altar. The church was built next to a small natural cave, which was a shrine in the pre Hispanic period. According to local legend, the image of Christ was found here. In front of this chapel is the Plazuela de la Ancienidad which is dedicated to the memory of the fact that Moctezuma II granted the area to retired soldiers and government servants See also Carnivals of Iztapalapa Further reading *Brenner, Anita.

Occupy protests took place in Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Lower Hutt, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill. Overview The Auckland Occupation was the largest of the Occupy Movement protests in New Zealand. Auckland had 350 occupiers at its peak, while Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin typically had fewer than 50. The success of the Auckland Occupation was largely attributable to the size of the city - nearly one third of all New Zealanders live in Auckland - and the involvement from the first moments by professional activists, Trade Unionists and the Mana Party. Other contributing factors included the concurrent Rugby World Cup and the impending 2011 New Zealand general election, held on 26 November 2011. The occupations in New Zealand benefited from the existence of the New Zealand Bill of Rights, which protects free speech and free assembly. The Bill of Rights expressly anticipates the use of local bylaws to stifle and thwart political protests. The New Zealand Police made it clear that they do not wish to be used by local Councils to repress peaceful democratic protests. Dunedin City Council issued a Trespass Notice against its Occupiers on 2 November. Auckland Council issued theirs on 28 November, followed immediately by a request for an Injunction. Wellington and Christchurch Councils waited for the outcome of Auckland's Injunction court case. Locations * Auckland (began 15 October)Worldwide 'Occupy' protests held over financial crisis. 15 October 2011. BBC News. Sites occupied: Aotea Square, Albert Park, Victoria Park. * Christchurch (began 15 October) * Dunedin (began 15 October) * Wellington (began 15 October) Occupation of Aotea Square A banner posted in the area =History= Inception Soon after the commencement of the Occupy Wall Street protests two groups attempted to simultaneously form an Auckland-based Occupation. The \\"Occupy Queen Street\\" and \\"Occupy Auckland\\" groups were quickly amalgamated. The larger group consisting of social justice groups, unions, student activists and political organisations met at Unite Union on the 7, October, 2011. The following day, Saturday, 8 October 2011, a meeting was held in the gazebo in Albert Park, attended by approximately 30 people under the auspices of \\"Occupy Auckland\\". Many of those in attendance were long-time activists, or represented various social constituencies, and some of the participants had been at both meetings. This first meeting laid the foundations for the association with the global Occupation Movement, the adoption of the principles of absolute adherence to peaceful non-violent resistance, fundamental leaderlessness and the formal adoption of the General Assembly processes. A motion to appoint a spokesperson for the group was initially rejected because, \\"a spokesperson is just another head to be lopped off by the press\\". The date set for the Occupation was 15 October, final location to be announced. Organisation A meeting was held in a cafe on K' Road the following day, where fliers, web pages and basic structures were created. During the remainder of the week, planning sessions and promotional activities were conducted, including the scouting of Aotea Square and Albert Park by four Town Planners. On Thursday of that week, the General Assembly finally chose Aotea Square of the two locations surveyed. Aotea Square was chosen for its political significance, its central location, and because it had recently been \\"taken\\" from the people of Auckland by \\"The Edge\\", and was no longer used as a marketplace and speakers' forum. Albert Park was seen as being less contentious, more centrally located in terms of the overall geography of the city, more suitable as a camp ground and closer to natural allies at the university; however, the site was rejected and at least two organisers dissented from the majority view in their preference for Albert Park. Occupation On 15 October, a march of over 2000 people set off from Britomart, up Queen Street to Aotea Square. A rally was held on arrival in the square, followed by a concert that evening after tents were set up. There were approximately 70 occupiers on the first night. Stiff resistance was anticipated, but apart from a misunderstanding with police, the Occupation began without incident. Few of the original occupiers were homeless, or unemployed. Most were young professionals, students and members of the middle class. Many were experienced protesters and professional activists. The involvement of the trade union movement in the initial weeks of the occupation was significant. The Unite Union, First Union, the SWFU, the Mana Party and Legalise Cannabis Party were either directly involved, or members of their organisations came on their own time. Unaffiliated participants regularly expressed their gratitude for this support. Over time however, for various reasons, this support began to drop off for reasons of other commitments, particularly the looming elections. By the fourth week of the occupation, Unite members were only irregular participants. Expected support in strength from the middle class did not materialise, although support off site was always strong. Donations began to drop off, in large part due to decisions made in the first days of the Occupation to use Facebook almost exclusively. The website was neglected, and so it became difficult for the public who were not familiar with Facebook to see what was needed and make donations. The Occupation became more or less invisible, except to approximately 5,000 Facebook friends, most of whom were not located in New Zealand. This error was compounded by the loss of a number of media-savvy personnel responsible for Press Releases. This loss was not off-set, even by the brief participation of Dr. Campbell Jones, an academic from the University of Auckland. The loss of support from the professional activist network gradually accelerated until the issuance of the Trespass Notice by Auckland Council. Political contributions After the immediate arrival at the camp site, work was divided roughly into three large categories: \\"Town Planning Activities\\", \\"Political Establishment\\" and \\"Group Activism\\". Those who had been heavily involved in the original organisation then began to distance themselves from their initial roles as logistical organisers in favor of more political involvement. In the first two weeks, especially, key strategic and political goals identified prior to arrival at the square were carried out to insure that the Occupation was truly established not only as a physical occupation, but primarily as a political event. Call for unity of 16 October 2011 The first political resolution of the Occupation was passed on 16 October. The resolution rejected anti-semitism, islamophobia, racism and sexism, and called for unity between the 99%. The purpose of this resolution was to immediately diffuse destructive religious tensions between Jews and Muslims, which could have been incited by opportunistic attacks from elements of the radical left against \\"Zionism\\" and \\"Israel\\". The perceived position of the Occupation as a cosmopolitan forum and \\"neutral ground\\" required this, if there was any hope of having the safe involvement of either Jews or Muslims in the Occupation. The close proximity of the Jewish Synagogue in Grey's Avenue and the not- inconsiderable Muslim student population in the area made this an imperative, in order to avoid even the possibility of offense. The resolution appears to have been a success, as no serious complaints were received, and there were no major anti-semitic or islamophobia incidents during the Occupation. Muslims and Jews moved freely through the camp and frequently engaged in friendly and enjoyable political discussions. An open Letter to the Prime Minister of Australia, 22 October 2011 Following the repression of the Occupation of City Square in Melbourne, the GA approved an open letter to the Prime Minister of Australia, denouncing the actions of the Victoria Police and calling for an end to the suppression of the Occupation Movement in Australia. This letter cited the \\"exemplary professionals\\" of the Auckland Council and the New Zealand Police, and suggested that the prime minister could take advice from these bodies, who to this point had a positive working relationship with the Occupation. The Declaration of the Occupation of Auckland, 3 November 2011 On 3 November 2011, the Declaration of the Occupation of Auckland was ratified. This statement, which was workshopped heavily for 10 days was addressed to the people of New Zealand, though it was understood that it would be read widely in government circles throughout the country. It was intended to express the justification of the Occupiers for their actions, \\"We wish you to hear those concerns which have driven us to make this Occupation. We do not do this lightly. For we live with the risk of arrest. We have put our reputations, our persons, our careers, our property and our relationships in jeopardy. We wish to impress upon you the depths of our determination and our sincerity.\\" The declaration was not intended to be a policy statement or political platform, though it does explain the purpose of the Occupation. It consists of an introduction, in the form of a Preamble, a list of formal Grievances, and a Call to Action, requesting the reader to judge for themselves whether the Occupiers are justified in their actions. Three choices of response were offered; to join, to support or to fight the Occupiers. The declaration concluded by appealing for the reader to come and help the Occupiers by reasoning together to discover solutions for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The Occupiers then declared a challenge, declaring that they would remain in the Square \\"until the 99% awaken\\". The declaration was received enthusiastically by the Occupiers and was ratified unanimously. Five days after it was ratified, it was printed and laminated on A0 and posted on three sides of the Occupation. Most visitors were observed to read it in its entirety. In the weeks that followed its ratification, criticisms of the declaration began to emerge, though there was no serious or concerted attack on the document, and support remained strong. A few persons outside of the Occupation felt that key issues were not represented, pertaining particularly to indigenous rights and ecological concerns. Others felt that it was difficult to read. It was also criticised as being \\"too American\\", because of its resemblance to the OWS Declaration and its echoing of sentiments found in the Declaration of Independence. Its strong language and unambivalent tone and its enumeration of grievances rather than political solutions was considered to be out of character with other more traditional New Zealand political statements. However, when the grievances are removed, parallels between the Declaration and the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand can be observed. Similarities between the two documents include the citation of the authority of the framers and the strong reference to logical assertion of sovereignty, a common theme in populist political thought in New Zealand. The author of the Auckland Declaration was unaware of the New Zealand Declaration of Independence at the time, and so these similarities are best attributed to the familiarity of both authors with the common roots of Western Political Democracy. =Social justice actions= Occupation of the University of Auckland Clock Tower, 17 October 2011 Approximately 200 student activists from the We are the University Movement occupied the clock tower of the University of Auckland for several hours, until police arrived with dogs and threatened to make mass arrests. After leaving the clock tower the students marched to the Occupy encampment. Feeding the homeless As the first Occupiers were for the most part neither homeless nor unemployed, the level of donations were more than adequate to cover the needs of the Occupation, and standards were very high. However, as word got around in Queen Street that the Occupation was providing three hot meals a day to all comers, the homeless began coming to the camp, swelling numbers. At its peak, the Occupation fed 350 people three meals a day. Many of the homeless assumed responsibility in overseeing and performing kitchen and cooking duties, replacing the original Unite Members who set it up initially. Eventually, it became impossible to feed so many people for free, and a nominal charge was instituted of $1 per meal, well within the means of everyone at the camp. =History= Occupy protests, events and actions also occurred in the New Zealand city of Dunedin.

The anti-Sapieha confederates were victorious. Background Micha≈Ç Serwacy Wi≈õniowiecki, leader of the anti-Sapieha forces Since the second half of the 16th century the Sapieha family of Lithuania and Belarus had risen to prominence and attained a premier rank among the magnate families of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Over the course of the 17th century, the family came to monopolize most of the top government offices of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. While these offices were not hereditary, the Sapiehas ensured that they remained within the family. Over time this contributed to growing resentment among Lithuania's other magnate clans and opposition to the Sapiehas began to form in various quarters. The Sapiehas attempts to control local politics through the sejmiks and their arrogation of other nobles' lands also led to dissatisfaction among rank-and-file szlachta. The volatile situation was furthered acerbated by the actions of the King of Poland, Augustus II the Strong. Augustus aimed to transform the weak position of the Polish-Lithuanian monarch into one based on the then current Western (and Russian) model of an absolute monarch. He saw the potential conflict in Lithuania as a possible excuse for an intervention which could then be utilized to strengthen royal power, as well as a means of weakening powerful magnate families in the region. Augustus allowed the Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Jan Kazimierz Sapieha the Younger to conscript further forces for the Sapieha's private army, while at the same time he issued proclamations calling on the lesser nobility to defend their ancient privileges. The anti- Sapieha coalition consisted of members of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Pac and Ogi≈Ñski families, and had the support of medium and lesser nobles. It was further strengthened in April 1700, when Sapieha's soldiers and courtiers mistook a procession of the Princely Wi≈õniowiecki family in Vilnius, for that of the anti-Sapieha Kocie≈Ç≈Ç family, attacked it and wounded two of its most prominent members Micha≈Ç Serwacy Wi≈õniowiecki and Janusz Wi≈õniowiecki. As a result, the Wi≈õniowieckis joined the anti-Sapieha cause, with Micha≈Ç Serwacy given the overall command of the coalition. Battle Initial military engagements, at Lipniszki and in a skirmish on the Ashmyanka River, were favorable to the Sapiehas who commanded well trained professional troops against irregular forces of the szlachta. In October the szlachta gathered in a camp near the town of Olkieniki (today Valkininkai, in Lithuania). Sapieha forces, under Micha≈Ç Franciszek Sapieha, left Vilnius in early November and arrived near Olkieniki in the middle of the month. Older accounts of the battle give the strength of the szlachta forces at around twenty thousand and that of the Sapiehas at eight or nine thousand. Newer sources list lower figures; twelve thousand for the szlachta and around three thousand for the Sapiehas. It is generally agreed that the Sapieha troops were of superior quality. The Sapieha forces also had eight pieces of artillery, which the confederates lacked. Last minute negotiations and an attempt at a truce was made by Bishop of Vilnius Konstanty Kazimierz Brzostowski, who while a long time Sapieha opponent, was genuinely worried about the extent of destruction that the civil war was going to cause in Lithuania. Brzostowski, accompanied by bishop sufragan Jan Miko≈Çaj Zgierski, met with the Sapiehas at a tavern in nearby Leipalingis. The details of the proposed truce are unknown but the conditions were rejected by Sapiehas, who declared that things will have to be \\"settled with sabres\\".PJ, Polska anarchia A contemporary poem described the various regiments and their commanders on the anti-Sapieha side. The counties (voivodeships) of Ashmyany (Kociell), Lida, Brac≈Çaw, Troki, Grodno, Upita, Nowogr√≥dek (Radziwill), S≈Çonim, Wo≈Çk√≥w, Witebsk (Oginski), Orsza (Kmicic), Brze≈õƒá Litewski, Pinsk (Wisniowiecki), M≈õcis≈Çaw, Minsk, Samogitia (Oginski) and Po≈Çock (Pac) all supported the confederates, while the counties of Vilnius, Ukmergƒó, Kaunas, Mozyr and Rzeczyca County supported the Sapiehas. The confederates placed their infantry in the center, the majority of the szlachta were on the right or in reserve, and the left wing was taken up by hired Wallachian cavalry. Wisniowiecki placed his troops between Valkininkai and Leipalingis, while Oginski led his troops through the local forests in a wide encircling maneuver. The Sapiehas also placed their infantry in the center, their rajtars on the left, with the right taken up by Tatar troops. Aftermath In the aftermath of the battle, a drunken mob of szlachta, encouraged by the Canon of Vilnius, Krzysztof Bia≈Ç≈Çozor, whose brother had been executed by the Sapiehas the previous year, murdered many of the Sapieha leaders, including several prominent members of the family itself. Most notably, a mob lynched Micha≈Ç Franciszek Sapieha, who was kept after the battle imprisoned in a nearby abbey. The battle and the subsequent slaughter marked the end of the dominance of the Sapiehas in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in general, and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in particular. Jan Kazimierz Sapieha managed to escape capture and fled to the Duchy of Prussia. One of the participants on the Sapieha side was the then relatively unknown nobleman Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, who would become an aide to Charles XII of Sweden and the father of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the last King of Poland. Poniatowski was spared from the slaughter which followed the battle because of his low rank, young age, and relatively low status at the time.

It was first published in the United States in 1957, by Boston publisher Little Brown, and in the United Kingdom in 1958 by London publisher Andre Deutsch. In 1969 a paperback edition was published by Panther Books with the title A Moment of Love. Plot Set in Belfast in the 1950s, the novel tells the story of a 37-year-old Catholic male teacher, Diarmuid Devine, who is single and sexually inexperienced. When he overhears a colleague refer to him as ‚Äúthat old woman‚Äù, he understands that his life is slipping away from him. He meets and is attracted to a Protestant girl 17 years younger than him, who is on the rebound from an affair with a married man. Critical review The poet Patrick Hicks argues that in writing the novel Moore \\"interrogated the educational system that taught him a version of masculinity that he found unacceptable\\" and that this enabled him \\"to become, arguably, one of the first contemporary male novelists with an overtly feminist agenda\\". In Brian Moore: A Critical Study, Jo O'Donoghue claims that \\"Moore is nowhere more anti- clerical than in The Feast of Lupercal...If the novel appears to exaggerate the ugly side of Catholic education it is because Moore retains a great deal of bitterness towards the system of religious education to which he himself was subjected.

In contrast to negative interdependence (i.e., individuals can only achieve their goal via the failure of a competitor) and no interdependence (i.e., a correlation does not exist between individuals' goals), positive interdependence happens when \\"individuals perceive that they can attain their goals if and only if the other individuals with whom they are cooperatively linked attain their goals\\". Consequently, positive interdependence results in members of a group \\"encouraging and facilitating each other's efforts...in order to reach the group's goals\\". Positive interdependence can also be understood by its effects on the psychological processes of learners in a group setting. It promotes substitutability (the degree to which actions of one group member substitutes for the actions of another), positive cathexis (investment of positive psychological energy in objects outside one's self), and inducibility (openness to influencing and being influenced by others), whereas Negative Interdependence creates nonsubstituability, negative cathexis and a resistance to being influenced by others. Modern history Derived from the constructivist learning theory and social psychology's social interdependence theory, positive interdependence theory is the foundation of modern collaborative and cooperative practice in business, science, and education. Kurt Koffka, one of the founders of the gestalt school of psychology, proposed that interdependence was essential for a group to become a dynamic whole and recognized that interdependence will vary from one individual to another within the group. As part of his early work in social and organizational psychology, his student Kurt Lewin theorized that the essence of the group gestalt depends on interdependence among members, and further, it is created by sharing a common goal. His student, Morton Deutsch, expanded on the social interdependence theory during his work on conflict resolution. Deutsch studied how the \\"tension systems\\" of different people within a group might be interrelated. Deutsch conceptualized the three types of interdependence: positive, negative, and none. A basic premise of social interdependence theory centers on the participant's goal structure which determines how they interact with one another. Other important variables for success include personal predisposition or cognitive bias. and training in social cooperation and collaboration techniques. The social dominance theory is considered to be the opposite of social interdependence theory. Cooperative and collaborative learning David Johnson, Deutsch's student in the study of social psychology, with his brother Roger Johnson, a science educator, and their sister, educator Edye Johnson Holubec, further developed positive interdependence theory as part of their research and work in teacher and professional training at the Cooperative Learning Center at the University of Minnesota (founded in 1969). Johnson, Johnson, and Holubek identify positive interdependence as the first essential element for successful cooperative learning. Positive interdependence (cooperation) results in promotive interaction where individuals encourage and facilitate teammates' efforts to complete the task. Negative interdependence (competition) encourages contrient interaction where team members work to oppose or block the success of others on their team while working to further their own, individual goals. Interpersonal interaction alone does not increase productivity or lead to higher achievement in learning groups; instead, positive interdependence is needed to produce those results. Johnson and Johnson structure interdependence using overlapping methods in three broad categories: Outcome interdependence includes the structure of goals and rewards. Means interdependence distributes roles, resources, and tasks in such a way that sharing is necessary in order to achieve a goal. Boundary interdependence defines discontinuities that segregate groups from one another while also serving to unify the individuals within each group. \\"Discontinuity can be created by environmental factors (groups separated around a room or in different rooms), similarity (all seated together or wearing the same shirt), expectations of being grouped together, and differentiation from other groups.\\" Strategies =Common practices to facilitate it= Joint rewards, divided resources, and complementary roles are effective methods of facilitating positive interdependence. An example of a joint reward would be if everyone on the team received a bonus if all team members reach a specified score on a test. Dividing resources and roles among team members will force the participants to share their individual information or tool to achieve a common goal, and thus promote positive interdependence. =Categories= Positive interdependence strategies can be categorized into four major groups: * Positive Goal Interdependence * Positive Resource Interdependence * Positive Role Interdependence * Positive Identity Interdependence Positive Goal Interdependence is achieved when learners share the same goals and perceive that group cooperation is essential in achieving these goals. Positive Resource Interdependence divvies up the resources or materials for completing the task by giving each group member an essential piece of the puzzle and makes it essential for the group to share resources or put their puzzle pieces together in order to be successful. And Positive Role Interdependence imparts a sense of ownership for each group member by assigning an interconnected role for each individual that is vital in completing the learning project. And Positive Identity Interdependence infuses unity and cohesion, inspiring camaraderie and loyalty by way of a shared identity expressed through a mutual logo, motto, name, etc. In CSCL Computer-supported collaborative learning, or CSCL, offers strategies to promote positive interdependence by giving learning groups the technology to facilitate cooperative interaction through computer networks and achieve knowledge building through collaborative environments that support asynchronous and synchronous communication. Technology tools provide learner groups the means to share knowledge, construct shared understanding, and achieve deeper learning outcomes. Moreover, CSCL provides a framework to boost learner participation and has been shown to greatly improve learner engagement due to its social nature and adherence to constructivist learning principles. Specific strategy examples to create positive interdependence include leveraging CSCL technologies such as augmented reality role playing and computer games Augmented reality role playing utilizes an emotionally compelling virtual world that allows group members to assume identities and create a sense of interdependence. This augmented reality provides an environment for learners to rely on each other for completing real world tasks in various roles such as investigators, scientists, and fantasy personas (alternate reality game). By designing learning projects that require role play and collaborative problem solving, CSCL builds positive identity and goal interdependence. Computer games can also be designed to promote positive interdependence by designing software tools that harness themes such as resource, role, and task interdependencies. A strategy for resource interdependence is to design learning games where no group member has all of the information to complete the task. Each member receives an essential piece or partial resource, and is forced to interact in order to be successful, as seen in games like Chase the Cheese and TeamQuest. For role interdependence, educational projects assign specific roles to each group member with specific responsibilities that are interchangeable and interconnected. And, to ensure interdependency, software tools are sequential, requiring each group member to complete part of the task in order to progress through the next phase. Benefits and limitations When team members are positively interdependent they share common goals and thus support each other's efforts. This group dynamic has numerous benefits for the individual learner and the team. =Individual benefits= * Individuals trust other members and make sure they act in trustworthy ways themselves. This sense of trust and responsibility does not only help individuals develop personally but it also acts as glue that holds the team together. * Positive interdependence intrinsically motivates individuals to try harder because they know that their teammates are dependent on them. * It fosters high level critical thinking and reasoning strategies. * It leads to greater long term retention of what is learned and increases the members willingness to take on more challenging tasks. * It gives individuals the opportunity to hear a variety of insights and perspectives. * Comparison and contrasting of others reasoning, opinions and conclusions helps promote higher quality decision making, better problem solving and also increases creativity. * Individuals have low amount of anxiety and stress when performing in a group that is positively interdependent. * Positive interdependence has a favorable impact on the psychological health and the self-esteem of an individual. =Team benefits= * An individual's performance affects the performance of the group, which creates a responsibility force that increases one's effort to achieve. Thus, positive interdependence helps in the attainment of the group goal by making every member personally responsible for the team's success. * Positive interdependence increases achievement and productivity of the team as a whole. * It leads to the development of more discoveries as compared to competitive or individualistic learning approaches. * Within positively interdependent groups, conflicts have positive outcomes, such as higher achievement, respect for other's perspectives, more integrative agreements, greater liking for each other and positive attitudes towards conflicts. * Positive relations and social support are formed between members from different ethnic background, culture, language, social class, ability and gender groups. =Limitations= * The biggest limitation of the positive interdependence theory is that it assumes people with different experiences, backgrounds, opinions, and ideals will all be willing to come to a consensus. It does not take into consideration real life situations and challenges such as non-cooperative members, untrustworthy individuals, slowly emerging roles and influential leaders, etc... * Being a member of a group is not sufficient. There has to be positive interdependence among all the group members. Imbalance of positive interdependence can lead to failure in achievement of the goal or even to the dissolution of the team. If there is failure, blame is also shared. * Constructive controversy or conflicts occur when group members have different information, perceptions, opinions, theories, willingness to take risks, and they need to reach to one conclusion. In positive interdependence conflicts occur not because of the final goals but over how best to achieve those mutual goals. * Application of positive interdependence in teaching is very demanding on the part of a teacher. Just putting students in groups and asking them to work together may not be sufficient to achieve positive interdependence among them. The teacher needs to explain the task and the concept and structure collaborative activities in order to promote positive interdependence. Group work does not imply positive interdependence. * Too much positive interdependence may eventually lead to social dependence. * Positive interdependence neglects the benefits of healthy competition. * Positive interdependence in computer-supported collaborative learning is hard to achieve as it is difficult to create shared understanding when people are distant and come from diverse backgrounds, cultural values and norms.

History Manguinhos Airport in October 1941 The origin of Manguinhos Airport is related to Aeroclube do Brasil (), a school of aviation founded in 1911 at Campo dos Afonsos Airport. In 1919 the Brazilian Army decided to locate at this facility the School of Military Aviation and forced the Flying Club to move elsewhere. The board of directors decided to re-locate its facilities near Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and for that land was flattened and a swamp drained. An official property land-title was however never given to the Flying Club; it just occupied the site with the acknowledgement of authorities. Manguinhos was officially opened in 1936 although it had been in use before this year. In fact, around this time whereas Santos Dumont Airport served mainly to hydroplanes, aircraft with landing gear used the Manguinhos facilities. In fact, ETA ‚Äì Empresa de Transporte A√©reo had its operational base at the airport. On December 22, 1959 a major accident led to the eventual closure of the airport: a VASP Vickers Viscount 827 and a Brazilian Air Force Fokker S-11 based at Afonsos Air Force Base collided in the air very close to Manguinhos Airport. The VASP aircraft, originated at Bras√≠lia, and on approach to land at Rio de Janeiro-Gale√£o, crashed killing its 32 occupants and 10 persons on the ground. The cadet parachuted to safety. According to the press, the pilot of the Fokker, the Air Force cadet Eduardo da Silva Pereira, with only 19 flight-hours, was trying to impress his girl-friend by doing manoeuvres over her house in the proximity of Manguinhos Airport and collided with the Viscount. Official investigations however state that the cadet was training manoeuvres outside the designated training area and did not see the Viscount approaching. Moreover, the aircraft had no radio communication equipment. The cadet left the Air Force one year later because of other reasons. The accident opened questions about the interference of air traffic related to Manguinhos in approaches to Rio de Janeiro-Gale√£o and Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont airports. Even though no aircraft based in Manguinhos was involved directly in the accident, authorities believed that similar accidents could happen in the future. In 1961 operations at Manguinhos were severely restricted and Brazil Flying Club had to move elsewhere. Since there was a maintenance company based at Manguinhos, certain flights were still allowed with control operated by Gale√£o until 1972, when Manguinhos closed. Hangars and control tower were demolished and presently in the site is located the shanty town Vila do Jo√£o, part of Complexo da Mar√©. Accidents and incidents *December 22, 1959: a VASP Vickers Viscount 827 registration PP- SRG while on approach to land at Rio de Janeiro-Gale√£o was involved in a mid- air collision with the Brazilian Air Force Fokker S-11 (T-21) registration FAB0742 in the vicinity of Manguinhos. All 32 people on board the Viscount were killed, as were a further ten on the ground. The T-21 pilot parachuted to safety. This accident eventually led to the closure of Manguinhos Airport Access The airport was located north of downtown Rio de Janeiro.

It is endemic to Colorado in the United States, where there are eight known occurrences.Mimulus gemmiparus. The Nature Conservancy. Retrieved 11-04-2011. It was formerly known as Mimulus gemmiparus. This annual herb grows about tall. Some of the leaves have propagules on their petioles called gemmae. When a leaf falls off the plant the gemma can generate a new plant; this is the mode of reproduction for this species, as flowers are rarely produced and they are sterile. The gemmae are probably dispersed on water. The plants occur in colonies of mother and daughter plants. When they do occur, the flowers are yellow with variable patterns of red spots and measure about half a centimeter long. While the flowers are rare in nature, the plants may produce many flowers when propagated in the greenhouse.Beatty, B.L., W.F. Jennings, and R.C. Rawlinson (2003, November 21). Mimulus gemmiparus W.A. Weber (Rocky Mountain monkeyflower): A technical conservation assessment. [Online]. USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region. Retrieved 11-04-2011. This plant grows in subalpine climates in moist areas such as seeps in granite outcrops and overhangs and forest habitat near springs. It can often be found alongside other Erythranthe species, such as Erythranthe floribunda, Erythranthe guttata, and Erythranthe rubella. The forests are dominated by spruce, fir, and aspen and other plants in the habitat may include Jamesia americana (fivepetal cliffbush), Dodecatheon spp. (shootingstar), Aquilegia saximontana (Rocky Mountain blue columbine), Epilobium spp. (fireweed), Salix spp. (willow), Campanula rotundifolia (bluebell bellflower), Artemisia ludoviciana (white sagebrush), Packera plattensis (prairie groundsel), Erigeron subtrinervis (threenerve fleabane), Rhodiola integrifolia (ledge stonecrop), Oreochrysum parryi (Parry's goldenrod), Brickellia microphylla (littleleaf brickellbush), Amelanchier utahensis (Utah serviceberry), and Montia chamissoi (water minerslettuce). Threats to this species include recreational activities such as hiking and horseback riding.

These multidisciplinary uses of the term are not independent and can more or less overlap; each construction of the term meaning can correspond with related constructions in other fields. The logical positivists, for example, associated meaning with scientific verification.See also The verifiability theory of meaning.  Psychology  =Behaviorism= According to B. F. Skinner, meaning is the modern version of idea. Like an idea, a meaning is said to be expressed or communicated by an utterance. A meaning explains the occurrence of a particular word in the sense that if there had been a different meaning to be expressed, a different word would probably have appeared. Meaning has certain advantages over ideas because they have the possibility to be located outside the skin, and thus, according to Skinner, meanings can be observed directly.Sellars, Wilfrid. 1980. \\"Behaviorism, language and meaning.\\" Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 61:3-30.Skinner, B. F. 1947. Verbal Behavior. ch. 1. =Cognitive psychology= Jerome Bruner, one of the founding fathers of cognitive psychology, wrote:Bruner, Jerome. 1990. Acts of Meaning. Harvard University Press. p. 4. > Very early on,...emphasis began shifting from 'meaning' to 'information', > from the construction of meaning to the processing of information. These are > profoundly different matters. The key factor in the shift was the > introduction of computation as the ruling metaphor and of computability as a > necessary criterion of a good theoretical model. Information is indifferent > with respect to meaning... =German critical psychology= German critical psychology provides a metatheoretical framework for research on both psychological and computational tasks. One important part of this is the logical-historical development of the meaning category. It is shown that meaning is nothing absolute but subjective. Meaning is neither a property of things nor only present as an imagination of cognition. Thus, meanings cannot be \\"defined\\" or \\"assigned\\" as commonly thought. Meanings arise from societal production of use-value.\\"Meretz, Stefan. 1999. \\"Meaning concepts used in psychology and computer sciences.\\" Pp. 120‚Äì28 in Challenges to Theoretical Psychology, edited by Maiers, Wolfgang et al. North York, ON: Captus Press, Inc. p. 126.

Recorded between August and November 2009 at their home in Golcar, Huddersfield, it was released on 22 February 2010 on the No Masters label, distributed by Proper Records. The album, which was mixed and mastered by Neil Ferguson of Chumbawamba, also featured Anna Esslemont and Cormac Byrne (both from Uiscedwr), Jackie Oates and the Solo Players string quartet. It was critically acclaimed and received a four-starred review in the Financial Times. Songs The title of the album refers to the words of one of the songs on the album, \\"Que Sera\\", about the execution during World War I of the British nurse Edith Cavell. Belinda O'Hooley says that \\"Que Sera\\" seeks to portray \\"the horrors of war from a woman's perspective\\" and \\"explores the feelings, sounds and senses that Edith Cavell may have felt as she stood before a firing squad\\". The album also includes a version of the song \\"Spancil Hill\\" and a new song \\"Too Old to Dream\\" incorporating a segment of \\"When I Grow Too Old to Dream\\", a popular song with music by Sigmund Romberg and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, published in 1934 and recorded by many artists, most notably Gracie Fields. Reception Colin Irwin, for BBC Music, said: \\"Too Old to Dream is a sentimental, yet still intensely moving picture of faded memories, melded into the old Sigmund Romberg/Oscar Hammerstein II standard and a recording of a Dewsbury care home resident....One More Xmas might also one day be recognised as a classic. Thoughtful, provocative, yearning and deeply poignant, it‚Äôll resonate with anyone who's lost a loved one or wilts under grown-up responsibilities, and may just be the best seasonal song written since Fairytale of New York.\\" Neil Spencer, writing in The Observer, said: \\"The spare, dramatic piano parts that Belinda O'Hooley formerly brought to the Unthanks have grown into rippling, neo-classical arrangements on this first album with fellow singer and songwriter Heidi Tidow... A bold, unsettling debut.\\" David Honigmann, reviewing the album for the Financial Times, gave it four stars, and said \\"the deceptively light 'Shelter Me' is a memorably off- beat love song...O‚ÄôHooley unfolds a gorgeous piano melody.\\" Peter Culshaw of The Arts Desk described Silent June as a \\"low-key but intensely beautiful and poetic album...the piano, adventurous bracing strings and vocals give it a semi-classical feel.\\" It was one of MOJO magazine's Top 10 Folk Albums of 2010 and won \\"Best Debut\\" in the Spiral Awards, organised by Spiral Earth.

Montoliu translated many of Shakespeare's plays into Catalan and can be remembered as the great translator of John Ruskin, almost unknown to the Catalan intelligentsia of the time. In 1903 Cebri√† de Montoliu participated as speaker in the Catalan University Congress. In the summer of 1907 is one of the signatories of the Manifesto for Spanish regeneration alongside names such as Gabriel Alomar, Josep Carner, Amadeu Hurtado, his brother, Manuel de Montoliu, Josep Pijoan, and Francesc Pujols, among others. The influence of Ruskin had a powerful impact on Montoliu in believing in the power of transforming education and in 1903, de Montoliu participated in a series of lectures on trying to convey what he had learned of the institutions of social culture in England and France. He was also a follower of great town planners such as Ebenezer Howard and Patrick Geddes and met Geddes at the Civic Building Exhibition in Ghent, Belgium in 1913. He proposed a museum in Barcelona which would open its doors to coincide with the International Electrical Exhibition that had been planned in the city in 1917. He was then influential in the development of Barcelona as a Garden City, and was noted for his ecological town planning. He has been described as an interpreter of modern urbanism.

An entrepreneur by profession, Destro joined politics relatively late in her life. In 1999 she formed a list for Padua municipal election and ran as an independent candidate for mayor, with the support of centre-right parties, notably including Forza Italia (FI). Her bid was successful as she defeated outgoing mayor Flavio Zanonato in a run- off. Having joined FI in 2001, she ran as the official FI candidate four years later. Most Paduans were unimpressed by her record as mayor and she was consequently trounced in the election: she obtained just 33.6% of the vote and her long-time opponent Zanonato went on to win in the first round with 51.9% of the vote. Despite her unpopularity among voters in Padua, she continued her political career through the ranks of FI and, later, The People of Freedom (PdL). She was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies at the 2006 general election and re-elected in 2008. An enthusiastic supporter of fellow entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi, during her second term as deputy, she grew critical of him.

He was known as the Pachad Yitzchok (Dread of Isaac). Early life The Pachad Yitzchok was the eldest son of Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (1820-1883), the first Sadigura Rebbe,Friedman, Yisroel. The Golden Dynasty: Ruzhin, the royal house of Chassidus. Jerusalem: The Kest- Lebovits Jewish Heritage and Roots Library, 2nd English edition, 2000, p. 76. and his wife Miriam. He was the grandson of Rabbi Yisroel of Ruzhin (1797-1851), founder of the Ruzhiner dynasty.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 20. At the age of 15 he married Malka Twersky, daughter of Rabbi Yochanan Twersky, the Rachmastrivka Rebbe. They had four sons and one daughter.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 79. Founding of Boyaner Hasidism Boyan. Upon the death of his father in 1883, Rabbi Yitzchok and his younger brother, Rabbi Yisrael (1852-1907), assumed joint leadership of their father's Hasidim. Although they were content with this arrangement, many of the Sadigura Hasidim preferred to have one Rebbe, and in 1887, the brothers agreed to draw lots to determine who would stay in Sadigura and who would move out. The lots fell to Rabbi Yisrael to remain as the second Sadigerer Rebbe, while Rabbi Yitzchak moved to the neighboring town of Boiany (Boyan) and established his court there, becoming the first Boyaner Rebbe. Under the leadership of the Pachad Yitzchok, Boyaner Hasidism flourished. The town of Boiany became a Hasidic center with a synagogue and four prayer houses. Boyaner communities were established in neighboring towns and in Jerusalem, Tiberias, and Safed. The Rebbe encouraged one of his wealthy Hasidim, Dov Ber Horenstein, who was childless, to build houses in Jerusalem as a memorial for himself; thus, the neighborhood of Batei Horenstein was founded near what is now Geula.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 80. The Boyaner Rebbe was known for his piety and humility. However, he presented a regal face to the public and lived in a palatial home. This dichotomy was emblematic of the Ruzhiner tradition founded by his grandfather, Rabbi Yisroel of Ruzhin. The Rebbe was revered by his Hasidim, and formed close relationships with them.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 73-74, 76. He was also known for his Torah knowledge and his love for the Land of Israel. He inherited the title of nasi (president) of Kolel Vohlin in the Land of Israel from his father, with responsibility for coordinating all funds sent for the welfare of the Orthodox community living there.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 435. Final years and succession At the beginning of World War I, the Russian army occupied Boiany and the Jewish neighborhood was completely destroyed. The Boyaner Rebbe and his family fled to Vienna. In 1916 the Rebbe became deathly ill, but recovered and continued to lead his flock. On 11 March 1917 (17 Adar 5677), he suddenly took ill again, called for his wife and children to part from each of them individually, and then began singing a nigun of deveikut (attachment to God). While he was singing, his soul left him.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 81. He was buried in the Vienna Jewish cemetery in a special ohel. His eldest son, Rabbi Menachem Nachum (1869-1936), was buried in the same ohel after his death.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 93. After the war ended, the Pachad Yitzchok's four sons each moved to a different country to establish their courts. His eldest son, Rabbi Menachem Nachum, became the Boyaner Rebbe in Chernowitz, Bukovina. Rabbi Menachem Nachum's son-in-law, Rabbi Moshenu (1841-1943), became the Boyaner Rebbe in Krakow.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 106. The Pachad Yitzchok's second son, Rabbi Yisroel (1878-1951), became the Boyaner Rebbe in Leipzig, Germany. His third son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov (1884-1941), became the Boyaner Rebbe in Lemberg.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 81-82. His fourth son, Rabbi Mordechai Shlomo (1891-1971), became the Boyaner Rebbe in New York. After the latter's death, the Boyaner dynasty was leaderless until 1984, when Rabbi Mordechai Shlomo's grandson, Rabbi Nachum Dov Brayer (born 1959), was crowned Boyaner Rebbe. The dynasty is now headquartered in Jerusalem, Israel, where the Rebbe resides.

Indian Shores, Florida on left, mangroves on right The ecology of Florida is remarkable due to its climate and diverse ecological regions. From the northwestern panhandle to the Everglades, differences in hydrology, climate, landforms, soil types, flora and fauna shape each ecoregion, creating a complex and unique landscape that has been recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. A misconception often associated with the Florida landscape is that the changes of density and diversity of flora seem chaotic or random, however, Eugene Odum's research states that \\"‚Ä¶over the long term plant habits showed remarkable continuity.\\"Nature's Economy, Donald Worster The introduction of different species caused certain evolutionary developments ‚Äì some plants grew more quickly and in larger numbers, while others could survive longer ‚Äì to sustain themselves in a dense environment. Abiotic environment =Climatology= The climatology of Florida varies from region to region due to its proximity to the equator. From central Florida to the Georgia border, the climate is generally humid subtropical, while South Florida fosters a tropical climate. The end of spring to mid-fall is characterized by a significant rainy season, subjecting Florida to hurricanes, thunderstorms, and tropical cyclones. The winter and spring is significantly drier, leading to brushfires and strict no- fire laws. While very uncommon, snow has been recorded in northern Florida; orange groves are damaged by hard freezes. A photo of Ponte Vedra Beach, an area attracting many tourists =Water= As a peninsula, Florida is surrounded on three sides by two main bodies of water, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Due to its water centrality and extremely low ratio of land sea levels, Florida is composed of marshland, swampland, lakes, springs and rivers. Florida's largest river is the St Johns River and its largest lake, Lake Okeechobee, flows into the Florida Everglades. Biotic environment =Fauna= A Gulf fritillary, taken in Payne's Prairie State Park, Florida Florida was once home to a very diverse array of wildlife. Bobcats were once very prominent in Florida, but land development, drained marshland, and deforestation are pushing this species of lynx into more northern areas. Florida also has many species of armadillo, opossum, foxes and birds like the American eagle and osprey, but are also being forced from their natural environments and into more urban areas, contributing to high percentages of roadkill. The Wildlife Foundation of Florida acts to gain collaboration of the public in order to protect and conserve all types of wildlife from land and air to water. The insect population of Florida is also unique. The Gulf fritillary is a butterfly native to Florida grasslands. One such area is Payne's Prairie in Gainesville, Florida. Other Florida native insects include various species of mites including Florida termites and many types of ants, like the fire ant. =Forest ecology= Because Florida has such a wide variety of climate conditions, there are many types of forest ecosystems, including: Upland hardwoods Upland hardwoods are often found in patches, surrounded by flatwoods and sandhills. Many species of trees prefer these types of ecosystems so there isn't a dominant species. Many Florida State Parks are located in these types of ecosystems. Bottomland hardwoods Bottomland hardwoods are very low, wet areas that are located in close proximity to lakes, rivers, and sinkholes, making them prone to flooding. This environment propels the growth of deciduous trees that grow in layers with shrubs and herbaceous plants and are under constant change. Sandhills Sandhills are very dry, with sandy soils so it is rare that these ecosystems ever flood. Because of this sort of climate, fire often changes the landscape so that they are predominantly grass and trees with no shrubbery. Scrub Scrub land is extremely low in nutrients because of its sandy soil caused by frequent fires. Most often, scrubs consist of open pinelands with various oaks, shrubs, and palmetto. These plants are called xerophytic because they grow well in dry climates and have roots close to the surface to catch what little nutrients they can. Flatwoods Pine flatwoods are very low, flat, sandy lands that are subject to fires during some parts of the year, but may be flooded for months due to seasonal rainfall. Pine needles contribute to a nutrient rich soil so plant growth is often rapid, allowing farmers to feed their livestock. Tropical hammocks Tropical hammocks include many broad-leaved evergreens. These forests are restricted to South Florida because of hard freezes in the North. These areas are often used for land development because of their well-drained soils. Human impacts The State of Florida's landscape was mostly made up of a largely forested area, prairies, and the large wetland area now referred to as the Everglades. Throughout its landscape small rivers, swamps and naturally occurring lakes and springs made up the state. At the time the area was inhabited by the native indigenous tribes of Florida. These tribes lead a mostly subsistence-based lifestyle. A subsistence-based lifestyle consists mostly of basic farming that would provide enough food for one family unit. This way of living minimally impacted the landscape as most of the time only fertile areas of non-swamp land were utilized as the technology to drain large portions of lands and redirect water were still not widely available. Over time, with the colonization of Florida, more and more people started to become attracted to the area. Once the technology to drain and redirect extensive areas of swamp land presented itself more and more came to lay claims to acres of land for future development. These large influxes of peoples led to the mass manipulation of the Florida landscape thus altering it permanently. Many of the activities that took place dealt with the diversion, draining or redirecting of water through the creation of various types of water ways like canals or manmade lakes, the cutting down of forests and the conversion of lands from natural to agricultural use. This intense and highly complex manipulation of the landscape caused quite a few problems for the native species of animals living there even though it solved many problems for the many new populations of people that would come to live there. =Water= Water is an important and highly valued resources. It is used for farming, providing electricity, as well as plumbing, cleaning, drinking, bathing and many other things. This poses problems for the natural environment. Bodies of water, like lakes or ponds, are drained for the creation of homes or other facilities. Water can also be redirected so that certain areas that are creating new businesses or that have a large population of people moving in can have fresh clean water going directly to them instead of having to import water from other areas or buy it in large quantities to store for personal or commercial use. In the natural environment many animal species depend on the regular flow of water as well as specific bodies of water for their survival. Draining small lakes, ponds, and river beds gets rid of a habitat that many different species of fish, alligators, insects, and other animals were dependent on for their survival. Likewise redirecting water poses just as great a threat to native species, as it does to us. When water is redirected the original flow becomes disrupted, and limits the amount of water that can be obtained at other areas. Water pollution Runoff of pesticides, fertilizers, and chemicals from farming, factories, households, commercial and industrial uses causes imbalances within ecosystems. Toxic chemical runoff and byproducts from decomposing materials and foods can contaminate water supplies. Most importantly these chemicals, like mercury, wreak havoc in fisheries and cause problems like infertility, mutations, and sometimes death of the fish. Large agricultural and farming communities, as well as urban areas leak pollutants directly into the water supply that can then flow through natural environments. When pesticides and fertilizers get into the water plants are affected too. Fertilizers often contain phosphorus which can lead to an increase in growth of some water borne plants and foliage. This abnormally rapid growth can in turn cause other populations of water borne plants to dwindle because of competition for space. =Deforestation= Forests provide many benefits to the environment. They create habitats for small and large animals, insects and small organisms like bacteria and fungi that feed on decomposing tree trunks. They also store carbon. Forests are like giant banks of stored carbon. When forests are cut down in large quantities tons and tons of previously stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Aside from storing vast amounts of carbon they also help prevent soil erosion. Areas that have been dry and arid with bare exposed soil can be recovered by planting trees around a buffer area to prevent further soil erosion. With proper care, maintenance, and patience the area can be recovered. Deforestation is the removal of all or some trees from an area of forest for use as something else. Florida is known for having a variety of different ecosystems aside from the wet marshlands called the Everglades. It is also home to a variety of different kinds of forests. The trees and wood obtained from these forests are used for the construction of furniture, homes, or can be sold as individually sized boards and shapes for construction. In order to obtain these large amounts of wood whole sections of trees need to be cut down. Sometimes trees are cut down simply to get to an area of preference. Another reason for cutting down large sections of trees is for the construction of new homes or buildings in an aesthetically pleasing area. \\"Florida has lost 22% of forests since 1953 (a loss of 1.6 million ha).\\" Climate change The Florida coastline is already experiencing the effects of global warming. It could change the look and appearance of Florida's coastline forever. \\"In fact, scientists have already observed changes in Florida consistent with the early effects of global warming: retreating and eroding shorelines, dying coral reefs, saltwater intrusion into inland freshwater aquifers, an upswing in forest fires, and warmer air and sea-surface temperatures. \\" =Introduced fauna and flora= Introduced species are species that are brought over from non native environments, for example from China to Florida. These species oftentimes find that their new environment is perfect for them and begin to grow and breed at extraordinary rates becoming invasive. \\"An invasive species is generally defined as a plant, animal or microbe that is found outside of its native range, where it negatively impacts the ecology, economy, or quality of human life. \\" With nothing to keep them in check, since there is nothing in the new environment to challenge their boundaries, or that feeds on it, the alien species will continue to take over and sometimes push native plants or animals out of their native environments. In Florida local and private groups have formed to help combat some of their invasive species of plants and animals. \\"The Florida Invasive Species Partnership (FISP) is a collaboration of federal, state and local agencies along with non-government organizations, all with a stake in managing invasive non-native species in Florida \\" One example of a plant species that has spread abnormally is the Old World climbing fern (Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br.). This invasive vine can grow up to 90 feet and more, and can survive through the winter without losing much of its greenness. This vine has been known to cover whole sections, rows, and at times all of the trees in forests and line them in huge veils of sweeping green foliage. These vines pose serious fire hazards in dry areas or during dry seasons. The vine is native to the following countries: :*Africa :*Australia :*Southeast Asia Old World fern taking over a forested area One example of an animal species that has bred without limit is the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis). The Cuban tree frog found its way to Florida after hitching a ride in shipping containers on trading boats and ships. As its name implies, the frog is native to Cuba. Florida's warm, rainy and humid weather is the perfect environment for the Cuban tree frog to reproduce and breed. The only thing that seems to cause sharp declines in their populations are freezes, or unusually cold winters. These frogs have spread up and down the coast of Florida as well as around the central Florida area. They eat various types of insects and spiders, but are also cannibalistic and have caused the native Florida tree frog populations to decrease as they feed on them. \\"Cuban Treefrogs are 'sit-and-wait' predators. On warm nights in Florida, it is common to encounter Cuban Treefrogs hanging on walls and windows near lighted areas as they sit and wait for insects (and native treefrogs) to be attracted to the lights. As they feed, they defecate on the windows and walls, and their fecal deposits can become unsightly over time, especially if there are a lot of frogs in the area. Furthermore, when a person enters or exits his or her home at night, Cuban Treefrogs that are waiting for an insect meal may be startled and as a result will occasionally jump onto people or into their homes through open doors. \\" The frog is native to areas such as: :*Cuba :*Cayman Islands :*Bahamas =Endangered Florida species= When a species becomes listed as endangered it is mostly due to a wide variety of causes usually linked to human activities. Some of these activities include: *developing land on animal habitats *over-hunting *intentional killing off of a species *the introduction of foreign species which compete for the same resources *pollution The state of Florida has about 33 animals, and 43 plant species that are endangered. Some of the animals that are listed are the Florida panther, the leather-back sea turtle, the West Indian manatee, and the red-cockaded woodpecker to name a few; and some of the plants that are listed are the bell-flower, scrub plum, Small's milk pea, and the water-willow. Migration patterns When an animal migrates what they are doing is simply moving from one place to another and back to their original location. Animals migrate to find good breeding grounds or areas with large amounts of food. When man made objects or constructs get in the way of an animal's routine migratory path it is forced to change its usual breeding ground or area of sustenance. = Changes in the migration patterns of panthers = The Florida panther is listed as endangered. This is because of the encroachment of developing lands and highways and other man made structures that have mostly destroyed or diminished their natural habitats. They also have trouble hunting the white-tailed deer, which is their main source of food, as they have been cut off from each other because of human developments as well. Due to these developments Florida Panthers have had to change their migration routes, as well as become adjusted to smaller hunting and breeding grounds than they previously had. = Migratory birds = Many birds spend summer in New England or farther North on the East coast of the U.S. and migrate through Florida on their way to South America or the Caribbean. Water birds that winter in Cuba, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico use Florida as their last land stop before the islands, while most land birds will fly from Florida to the coast of Mexico in order to continue moving to South America while remaining over land. Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) that spend summers in the Eastern half of the U.S. use multiple routes through Florida to reach the Yucat√°n peninsula, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Upon their return, birds crossing the Gulf of Mexico need to stop in Florida to feed and replenish their energy after the strenuous flight over water. Some species like the Red Knot (Calidris canutus rufa) stay in Florida for the winter. In the case of the Red Knot, the east coast of the state is used as a stopover on the way to the Caribbean and as a over-wintering area. Some birds returning North in the fall have migration patterns that bring them into the path of Gulf hurricanes, increasing the danger of the flight as well as the need for abundant resources on the North coast of the Gulf. Migrating birds arrive in highest densities in areas with dense hardwood forests. For those in need of food, this habitat could indicate to them an abundance of resources, and many stop over in the panhandle of Florida in hardwood and pine forests close to the coast. Conservation of these forests will be important for the future of many migrating bird species; with so many birds using these forests to forage after strenuous flights, degradation or loss of this habitat could lead to high mortality as the birds quickly use up a smaller pool of resources . The same can be said for the East coast of the state, where habitat loss caused by sea level rise, beach erosion, and development threaten migratory routes with habitat loss. Although the Migratory Bird Treaty Act made the \\"taking, killing, or possessing migratory birds unlawful,\\" habitat must also be protected to help birds that migrate through Florida survive. Image of a Florida panther State policies The Florida Department of Environmental Protection is the agency responsible for protecting Florida's ecology. Its self-stated mission is to protect \\"our air, water and land.\\" It is divided into 41 programs that cover three areas of interest: Regulatory Programs, Land and Recreation, and Water Policy and Ecosystem Restoration. =Regulatory programs= The DEP makes regulations and also follows up to make sure they are adhered to. Besides the normal administrative sections of the agency, there is an office of the Inspector General, which conducts audits and investigations related to preserving Florida's air, land and water. It provides an impartial judge to determine what should be done. They are supported by law enforcement and policy compliance sectors. There is also an office for siting coordination, which regulates the power grid and natural gas pipelines across the entire state. =Land and recreation= Manatee Springs State Park The DEP is responsible for state-owned recreational land. This includes the entire state park system and most of Florida's beaches. There are also separate entities dealing with the trails and greenways (Florida Ecological Greenways Network) initiative, Green Lodging, and the Clean Marina program, to name just a few. The Front Porch Florida program also falls into this category; it is a program to help neighborhoods regain a sense of community. It hopes to make these communities a fun place to be. The Bureau of Beaches and Coastal Systems monitors Florida's fragile beach environments and works with local initiatives and the Army Corps of Engineers to protect and restore the beaches. It also is responsible for disaster response initiatives, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill beach cleanup efforts. State-owned lands are under the supervision of this department, divided into the Florida State Parks program and the Public Lands program. =Water policy and ecosystem restoration= Some programs from the other two categories also fall into this category, such as the Bureau of Beaches and Coastal Systems, because they deal with the restoration aspect of a larger issue. However, some programs are entirely within this category, such as the Wastewater Program and the Everglades Restoration program. The Springs, Water and Wetlands programs all fall into this category. These programs perform important functions by monitoring the quality and quantity of Florida's drinking water. Progress Florida Locator Map =FERI= In 1998, the Office of Ecosystem Management conducted the Florida Ecological Restoration Inventory (FERI). Using information gathered from the managers of all state-owned lands, they assessed the restoration needs and created a comprehensive map including the urgency of each need. This became an online database of planned, needed and completed restoration projects and the information about them. In 2000, the Bureau of Submerged Lands and Environmental Resources was awarded a grant to update FERI and expand the database to include information from other agencies. There are currently six categories in FERI. They are: cultural resource protection, ecological protection, exotic removal, hydrologic restoration/enhancement, upland restoration/enhancement, and wetland restoration/enhancement. =Recovery Program= The DEP has initiated the Recovery Program, which uses ARAA federal stimulus money to fund environmental programs across the state. Diesel emissions reduction is receiving 1.7 million dollars to add electricity to rest stops so trucks do not have to idle and retrofitting school buses to make them more environmentally friendly. The Superfund program will receive $61 million to clean up hazardous waste from the Superfund hazardous waste sites. Leaking Underground Storage Tanks will use $11.2 million to clean up \\"orphan\\" petroleum storage tanks (abandoned tanks that have no party responsible for them). $750,000 from the EPA will go towards local brownfield land projects. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund will use $132.3 million to issue loans for communities to improve their waste water and storm water systems. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund will use $88.1 million to issue loans for communities to upgrade their drinking water infrastructure. References External links *Myers, R.

He is well known for bidding US$650,100 with Mohnish Pabrai for a charity lunch with Warren Buffett on June 25, 2008. In 2009, he was featured in \\"the Checklist Manifesto\\", by Atul Gawande regarding his use of checklists as part of his investment process. Education and early life Spier was born in 1966 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. When he was three months old his family moved to Tel Aviv, Israel where he attended kindergarten. In 1970 his family moved to Iran where he attended the British Embassy School in Tehran. In 1977 his family moved again to Richmond in the UK, and he attended the City of London Freemen's School, in Ashtead, Surrey as a weekly boarder. In 1984 he matriculated to study Law at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was tutored by Hugh Collins and Mary Stokes among others. Two years later, in 1986, he switched to study PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics). Among his tutors were Peter Sinclair for Economics ‚Äì where he occasionally shared tutorials with David Cameron, who would go on to become Prime Minister. He also studied politics with Vernon Bogdanor. Although he was thoroughly mediocre at Politics, he proved to be a capable economist and graduated with a First-class degree, having also been awarded the Georg Webb Medley Prize for his performance in Economics. During his university summers, Spier also completed courses of study at Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg and at Harvard Summer School. He also interned with Creditanstalt in London. In 1990 Spier was offered places both in the Joint Business and Economics PhD program and at the MBA Program at Harvard. He opted to do the MBA and in 1993 he completed his MBA. Contemporaries at HBS include Mark Pincus, Chris Hohn and Sherry Coutu. Career From 1988 to 1990, Spier was an associate at Braxton Assoiates, the strategy consulting firm which was later sold to Deloitte Consulting. Based out of the London and Paris offices, Spier worked with colleagues David Pitt-Watson, Michael Liebreich and others in advising British and European companies on their strategy vis-a-vis the European Common market. He subsequently took up an internship at the Forward Studies Unit (Cellule de Prospective) at the European Commission in Brussels. Spier writes in his book that although interviewed with white-shoe firms like Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan during his last year at Harvard Business School, he turned down that opportunity to work in those, more structured environments for the lesser- known D.H. Blair. There he was given the title of Vice President and he sought funding for new technology startups. Spier subsequently described this experience as \\"not dissimilar\\" to the movie Wolf of Wall Street.. It was a career decision that he quickly came to regret. Upon leaving investment banking Spier founded the Aquamarine Fund, an investment partnership inspired by, and styled after Warren Buffett's 1950s investment partnerships ‚Äì which he continues to manage today and which had $250 million in AUM as of 31 December 2019. He is also an occasional financial commentator in the media. Spier follows closely Warren Buffett's principles on Value Investing and capital allocation. However, he also admits that Value Investing has changed over time, as the popularity of style means that generally fewer opportunities become available to investors. Ideas that will work would still be around, but the successful value investor of today has to look further and sometimes think outside the box.. In 2003, Spier became the target, along with David Einhorn, Bill Ackman, and Whitney Tilson, of investigations by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York Attorney General, as well as by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding short sales of Farmer Mac, MBIA corp and Allied Capital. The melt down of these companies during the late-2000s financial crisis vindicated their short thesis and was the subject of books by Ackman and Einhorn.Fooling Some of the People All of the Time: A Long, Short Story, David Einhorn: http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470073942.html Spier has regularly advocated for probity and modesty in the management of financial firms. In 2008 Spier published a paper along with Peter Sinclair and Tom Skinner on \\"Bonuses, Credit Rating Agencies and the Credit Crunch\\" which argued that part of the cause of the 2008 crisis was short-termism leading to the miscalculation of bonuses at Credit Rating and other financial firms. He has also strongly advocated in favor of zero management fees when it comes to professional investment management. In 2014 Palgrave MacMillan published The Education of a Value Investor which narrates Spier's early career struggles in investment banking on Wall Street and his transformation into a Value investor. The book has sold more than 150,000 copies in English and has been translated into Spanish, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Polish, Hebrew and Vietnamese. In 2016 Spier, along with Phil Town and Matthew Peterson successfully petitioned Judge Sontchi at the Delaware Court of Bankruptcy to form an official committee of equity holders of Horsehead Corporation ‚Äì which had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. In a youtube interview with Tilman Versch of ValueDACH, Spier likened the art of stock picking to \\"Drunks in Bars\\". also referencing Dan Bilzerian In 2020 Spier hosted a panel on \\"The Future of Intelligent Investing\\" with Niall Ferguson, Sandy Climan and Daniel Aegerter. Spier hosts an annual investment conference in Klosters called \\"VALUEx\\". Attendees have included include: Joe Chapman and Richard Reese, the former CEO of Iron Mountain Guy Spier speaking with Niall Ferguson during the World Economic Forum =Non-profit contributions= In 1997, Spier spoke out in The Independent against the increasing intrusion of paparazzi in British public life, writing \\"...if such a regime had been in place before last weekend, every tabloid which published photographs of Princess Diana and Dodi on their summer holidays would have been required to pay the resulting profits to them. I do not think that it would take too fine a legal mind to distinguish between public events, such as speeches and hospital visits, and private events, such as a ski trip with one's children or a ride in a car with a friend.\\" In 2002, writing in the Financial Times, Spier questioned the motives of the directors of the Hershey Trust Company for selling out their stake asking, \\"Why would anybody in their right mind want to trade a significant share of Hershey, with its excellent characteristics, for an insignificant share of a hotchpotch of US business, probably chosen by some adviser who is better at getting selected than at delivering investment performance?\\". Spier regularly addresses students and other audiences including MIT, Ivey School of Business, Harvard Business School and Google. From 2000 to 2005 Spier served, with the close support of Amanda Pullinger as the President of the Oxford Alumni Association of New York. Under his and Pullinger's leadership, the association grew to over 5,000 members and was a pioneer in bringing an American style approach on alumni relations to a British university. From 2007 to 2009, Spier served on the Advisory Board of the Dakshana Foundation.. In 2011, Spier founded the VALUEx conference in Klosters. In 2017 Spier joined the newly formed board of the Swiss Friends of Oxford University. He also serves on the advisory boards of Horasis, and World Minds He is also a member of the International Council of the Global Leadership Foundation which was founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner F. W. de Klerk. Personal life Spier lives in Zurich with his wife Lory and three children ‚Äì Eva, Isaac and Sarah. He is related to the Lazard and the Speyer banking families through his great great grandmother, Johanna Lazard. He is a former resident of Tuxedo Park, New York, the village constructed by Pierre Lorillard in the late 1800s, where he lived in the Bruce Price Cottage. He is a member of Entrepreneurs' Organization and of the Young Presidents' Organization.

He was a leading two-year-old in 1920 and finished third in the 1921 2000 Guineas before winning the Derby at Epsom. Less than three weeks after the Derby, Humorist died in his stable from a lung haemorrhage caused by a tubercular condition. Background Humorist was a \\"beautiful, rather delicate\\" chestnut colt with a broad white blaze and a ‚Äúkind and intelligent‚Äù temperament. He was bred by his owner Jack Joel, who sent him to his private trainer Charles Morton at Letcombe Bassett in Berkshire. Jest. Humorist's sire, Polymelus, was a good racehorse who won the Champion Stakes in 1906, but went on to much greater success as a stallion. Apart from Humorist, he sired the Derby winners Pommern and Fifinella and through his son Phalaris is the direct male-line ancestor of most modern thoroughbreds. Humorist's dam, Jest was a highly successful racemare, winning the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks in 1913, and was a half sister of the St Leger winner Black Jester. Throughout his time in training, Humorist puzzled his connections with his performances, both at home and on the racecourse. He would switch from traveling easily to struggling in a matter of strides. Charles Morton was to say that ‚Äúall the time I felt there was something wrong with him... he would be perfectly well one day and listless the next.\\" Only after the colt's death were the reasons for this tendency revealed. Racing career =1920: two-year-old season= Humorist was among the best two-year-olds of his generation, winning three time and finishing second twice in five starts. He made his debut in the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom in June, winning by a neck after looking set for an easy victory. He then suffered a bout of coughing and missed his intended target at Royal Ascot. He returned in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in which he was beaten a neck by Lemonora. Humorist then won impressively in the Buckenham Stakes and the Clearwell Stakes before being sent to Newmarket for the Middle Park Stakes. He produced a creditable effort to finish second, beaten a neck by Monarch. =1921: three-year-old season= As a three-year-old Humorist was sent straight for the Classic 2000 Guineas without a trial race and started favourite in a field of twenty-six. He led the race into the closing stages and looked the likely winner, but tired abruptly and finished third behind Craig an Eran and Lemonora. The colt's courage was called into question but Donoghue insisted that there was a physical explanation. Morton changed the horse's training regime, working him very lightly in the lead up to the Derby. Humorist started at 6/1 second favourite at Epsom, with Craig an Eran starting 5/1 favourite. Humorist tracked the leaders before being sent by Donoghue through a gap on the rails and into the lead two furlongs from the finish and held off the sustained challenge of Craig an Eran in a \\"battle royal\\" to win by a neck. Humorist appeared distressed and unsteady after the race and had to spend the night in the racecourse stables before he was well enough to return to Letcombe Bassett. Humorist was being prepared for a run at Royal Ascot but after bleeding from his nostrils it was decided to rest the horse. In late June Humorist was painted by the artist Alfred Munnings. Hours later he was found dead in his stable, in \\"a pool of blood\\". An autopsy revealed that the colt had been suffering from chronic tuberculosis, which would have affected him for many months before his death. He had effectively been running on one lung. Donoghue paid tribute to the colt: Humorist was buried at Joel's Childwick Bury Stud, near St Albans. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Humorist as the best British colt of his generation and at #150 in their list of British-trained horses of the 20th Century .Randall, J and Morris, T.

Background The Mikeladze family was constantly involved in the civil wars that plagued Imereti (western Georgia) from the 15th century into the 19th. After the Russian conquest of Imereti in 1810, the family was integrated into the Russian nobility and confirmed as a princely house (knyaz) in 1850. Many in the Mikeladze family made careers in Russia while others immigrated to other parts of the world after the Russian revolution. The family has produced several military officers, intellectuals, musicians and notables in other professions.

Through this connection, it provides users the ability to play games with other users online, in addition to other online services. The three most common networks now are Microsoft's Xbox Live, Sony's PlayStation Network, and Nintendo's Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Network. These networks feature cross platform capabilities which allows users to use a single account. However, the services provided by both are still limited to the console connected (e.g. an Xbox One cannot download an Xbox 360 game, unless the game is part of the Xbox 360 to Xbox One backwards compatibility program). Additional services provided by these networks include the capability of buying additional games, online chatting, downloadable content, and game demos. Early attempts The earliest experiments relating to online connectivity on game consoles were done as far back as the early 1980s. For some consoles, Dial-Up internet connectivity was made available through the use of special cartridges, along with an adapter. The GameLine for the Atari 2600 and the PlayCable for the Intellivision are two notable examples of this. Services like these did not have multiplayer online gaming capability, but did allow users to download games from a central server and play them, usually requiring a fee for continued access. However, neither the GameLine or PlayCable attained mainstream popularity and both services were shut down during the 1983 video game crash. During the 1990s a number of online gaming networks were introduced for home consoles, but due to a multitude of problems they failed to make a significant impact on the console gaming industry. For a number of years such networks were limited to the Japanese market. In a November 1996 interview, Shigeru Miyamoto remarked that online multiplayer gaming had not achieved mainstream success, and would not for a long while yet, because the technology of the time could not provide the quick-and-easy startup that general consumers would want from a \\"plug and play\\" console. The first online initiative by Nintendo was the Family Computer Network System for the Famicom, only released in Japan. This device allowed users to access things such as game cheats, stock trades, weather reports, and some downloadable content for their games. It failed to catch on. The Sega Net Work System was a network service in Japan for people using the Sega Mega Drive. Debuting in 1990, this service worked with the Game Toshokan (literally meaning \\"Game Library\\") cartridge to download games on the console (meaning that the game would have to be re-downloaded each time).Sega Meganet - Sonic Retro Players attached a Mega Modem (modem, with a speed of 1,600 to 2,400 bit/s) to the \\"EXT\\" DE-9 port on the back of the Mega Drive, and used it to dial up other players to play games. There was a monthly fee of ¬•800. Sega then brought a similar online service to North America, the Sega Channel, debuted in December 1994. Sega Channel provided users the opportunity to download new games straight to their consoles with the purchase of a cartridge similar sold through General Instruments. The service cost $15 (USD) per month and at one point had over 250,000 American subscribers while also building a following overseas but Sega decided to halt the project and provide an online portal in their new console the Sega Saturn. AT&T; unveiled the Edge-16, an online gaming peripheral which featured simultaneous voice and data transmission, at the 1993 Consumer Electronics Show. However, AT&T; cancelled it in 1994, having decided that its $150 (USD) price tag and lack of a match- up service (meaning players would have to find someone to play with on the network themselves) would prevent it from achieving any popularity. In 1994 an American company, Catapult Entertainment, developed the XBAND, a 3rd party peripheral which provided customers the ability to connect with other users and play games through network connections. The peripheral cost $19.99 (USD) and required a monthly fee of $4.95 (USD) for 50 sessions/month or $9.95 (USD) for unlimited use. The Xband supported the Super NES and Sega Genesis consoles and received a mushrooming installed base (the number of users quadrupled over the second half of 1995), but once the Super NES and Sega Genesis's popularity faded the peripheral was discontinued. The Satellaview was launched in mid-1995 for the Super Famicom in Japan. The access provided downloadable versions of hit games free to the user but required the user to download the games only at certain times through a TV antenna, in a fashion similar to recording a TV show. NET Link for the Sega Saturn provided users the ability to surf the web, check email, and play multiplayer games online. Released in 1996, the modem peripheral cost $199 (USD) and came with a web brower program and a free month of access. Despite the device's low price, strong functionality, and prominent marketing, less than 1% of Saturn owners purchased the NetLink in 1996, an outcome cited as evidence that the idea of online console gaming had not yet achieved widespread interest. Phil Harrison of Sony Computer Entertainment commented on the issue of online console gaming during a 1997 round table discussion: The first home console with built-in internet connection, the Apple Pippin, was launched in 1996. However, its $599 price tag kept it from effectively competing with other internet gaming options (by comparison, the Sega Saturn and its separately sold Netlink device combined cost less than $400). The Philips CD-i and its CD-Online service (released in 1996) also rang up at less than the Pippin, but suffered from mediocre functionality. In 1999 Nintendo decided to take another shot at online gaming with the Nintendo 64DD. The new peripheral was delayed often and only released in Japan, it provided users to connect with each other and share in-game art and designs and even play games online, after purchasing the peripheral for 30,000 yen. The 64DD failed to impact gamers as it was released shortly before Nintendo announced the release of its new console, the GameCube, and only nine games would be released supporting the new peripheral.\\"AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY, GOD CREATED XBOX LIVE..\\" XBOX Nation 19 (2004): 52. MAS Ultra - School Edition. EBSCO. Dreamcast SegaNet became a short-lived internet service operated by Sega, geared for dial-up based online gaming on their Dreamcast game console. A replacement for Sega's original, PC- only online gaming service, Heat.net, it was initially quite popular when launched on September 10, 2000. Unlike a standard ISP, game servers would be connected directly into SegaNet's internal network, providing very low connection latency between the consoles and servers along with standard Internet access. ChuChu Rocket! was the first online multiplayer game for the Dreamcast. Modern networks Modern consoles include an Ethernet port to allow users to plug into the consoles online gaming network. This is the location of the Ethernet port on the Xbox360 slim model =Xbox Live= Xbox Live (trademarked as Xbox LIVE) is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service created and operated by Microsoft Corporation. It was first made available to the Xbox system in 2002. An updated version of the service became available for the Xbox 360 console at that system's launch in 2005. The service was extended in 2007 on the Windows platform, named Games for Windows ‚Äì Live, which makes most aspects of the system available on Windows computers. Microsoft has announced plans to extend Live to other platforms such as handhelds and mobile phones as part of the Live Anywhere initiative. With Microsoft's Windows Phone 7, full Xbox Live functionality was integrated into new Windows Phones that launched in late 2010. The Xbox Live service is available as both a free and subscription-based service, known as Xbox Live Free and Xbox Live Gold respectively, with several features such as online gaming restricted to the Gold service. Prior to October 2010, the free service was known as Xbox Live Silver. It was announced on June 10, 2011 that the service would be fully integrated into Microsoft's Windows 8. =PlayStation Network= PlayStation Network, often abbreviated as PSN, is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service provided/run by Sony Computer Entertainment for use with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita video game consoles. =Nintendo Network= The Nintendo Network is Nintendo's second online service after Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to provide online play for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U compatible games. It was announced on January 26, 2012, at an investor's conference. Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata said, \\"Unlike Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which has been focused upon specific functionalities and concepts, we are aiming to establish a platform where various services available through the network for our consumers shall be connected via Nintendo Network service so that the company can make comprehensive proposals to consumers.\\" Nintendo's plans include personal accounts for Wii U, digitally distributed packaged software, and paid downloadable content. Wii (Online) The Wii console is able to connect to the Internet through its built-in 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, with both methods allowing players to access the established Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. Wireless encryption by WEP, WPA (TKIP/RC4) and WPA2 (CCMP/AES) are supported. AOSS support was discreetly added in System Menu version 3.0. Just as for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo does not charge fees for playing via the service and the 12 digit Friend Code system controls how players connect to one another. Each Wii also has its own unique 16 digit Wii Code for use with Wii's non-game features. This system also implements console-based software including the Wii Message Board. One can also connect to the internet with third-party devices.

It was developed by architects Foster + Partners, infrastructure consultants Halcrow and economists Volterra and launched by Lord Foster at the Institution of Civil Engineers in London on 2 November 2011. A more developed proposal for a platform-based Thames Hub Airport, located on the Isle of Grain in the Thames Estuary in Kent, was submitted to the Airports Commission in July 2013 by Foster+Partners.  Background  = Infrastructure challenges = The Thames Hub concept was developed to address a number of infrastructure challenges facing the UK. These include: * The economic divide between the North and South of the country. * The need for a long-term replacement for the existing Thames Barrier which provides flood protection for London * London's over-congested radial rail network which acts as a bottleneck within the UK's passenger and freight rail network * The need to develop a direct connection between the current high speed rail line High Speed 1 (HS1) and the planned High Speed 2 (HS2) line. * The fact that the UK's only international hub airport, Heathrow, is operating at 98% capacity and expansion within the surrounding urban area is controversial; in addition road and rail access to Heathrow from the UK's regions is difficult. * Inland freight distribution to and from Britain's seaports is over-dependent on a road network that is already overloaded * The need to increase the UK's renewable electricity generation capacity, provide new utility distribution networks for electricity and water and enhance broadband data connectivity across the regions * A major housing shortage, particularly in London and the South East, given that the UK's population is forecast to rise to 70m by 2027. * The need to respond to the rise of emerging economies, the changing nature of global trade and the development of larger container ships, such as the 18,000 TEU Maersk Triple E class ships, and 9,000-mile long range passenger aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In the Thames Hub report, Lord Foster says that \\"We need to recapture the foresight and political courage of our 19th century forebears if we are to establish a modern transport and energy infrastructure in Britain for this century and beyond.\\" In the accompanying video Foster talks about the consequences of inaction in relation to infrastructure planning and says that \\"the cost of doing business as usual is unaffordable and is certainly greater than this initiative\\". = Thames Barrier = The Environment Agency believes that it will have to upgrade the Thames Barrier some time after 2070. The Agency estimates that the rise in sea level in the Estuary over the next century, due to thermal expansion of the oceans, could be between 20 cm and 88 cm and in a worst-case scenario could be more than 2.7 metres. = Rail network = London's radial passenger rail network makes it difficult for rail passengers to travel around Outer London and the South East without first going into Central London. In addition rail freight trains need to run through Central London to get between the Thames Estuary ports and the rest of the country. = Airport expansion = There have been proposals for a Thames Estuary airport since 1943. In 1968 Lord Roskill was appointed to Chair the Third London Airport Commission, which considered options for a third London airport including a proposal for an airport at Maplin Sands in Essex. When the Commission reported in 1970, the Government decided to reject its advice for an airport at Cublington and instead decided to promote an airport at Maplin Sands. However this was abandoned in 1974 as a consequence of the 1973 oil crisis. Options for an estuary airport were considered in detail by the Labour Government as part of its work in preparing the 2003 Air Transport White Paper. However the White Paper announced the Government's decision not to progress an estuarial option, but to approve plans for a new third runway at Heathrow. In 2008 Boris Johnson the Mayor of London announced plans to carry out a study for an estuarial airport in the Shivering Sands area, north-east of Whitstable. The feasibility report, produced in October 2009 by former CrossRail Executive Chairman, Douglas Oakervee (who led the construction of Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport on an island platform), concluded that there is \\"no logical constraint\\" to the plan. Although Kansai Airport in Japan is located on a man-made island in the middle of Osaka Bay, the Mayor's proposal was criticised as being too radical and is now commonly referred to as Boris Island. In 2010 the new Coalition Government reversed the decisions in the White Paper and ruled out further airport expansion of London's three main airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted). In March 2011 the Government launched a 6-month public consultation exercise on its policy for a sustainable aviation framework. In August 2011 the DfT published new air traffic forecasts that predicted (in sharp contrast to those published by the previous government in 2009) that the majority of future air traffic growth to 2050 would be accommodated at regional airports. These new projections have been strongly criticised by airlines because they seem to ignore the strong preferences by airlines to operate hub and spoke networks rather than offering point to point services. Recent studies published by the British Chamber of Commerce and Frontier Economics for Heathrow's owner BAA estimate that the economic cost of not expanding capacity at Heathrow ranges between ¬£900 million and ¬£1.2 billion per year. Willie Walsh, Chief Executive of International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways (BA) the largest airline at Heathrow, has recently conceded that plans for a third runway at the airport are \\"dead\\" and that BA will now look to expand abroad. In his Mayoral response to the Government's sustainable aviation public consultation, Boris Johnson highlighted the fact that China's fastest growing airline was unable to operate at Heathrow due to a lack of airport capacity. The Institute of Directors has called for Government to be bold when drawing up its final aviation framework and to consider such ideas as a new hub airport in the Thames estuary. Simon Jenkins, Chairman of the National Trust has said that a Thames Estuary airport offers \\"the least harm for the greatest gain\\". On 31 October 2011 to the Airport Operators Association, the Labour Party's Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle announced that the Party had abandoned its support for a third runway at Heathrow Airport but said that the Government must also drop its moratorium on new airport capacity in the South East. In a 27 November 2011 interview in the Sunday Times, former Deputy Prime Minister and current Chairman of the Government's Regional Growth Fund, Lord Heseltine said that ministers ought to seriously consider an estuarial airport. On 29 November 2011 the Government announced that it would seriously consider \\"all options for maintaining the UK's hub airport status except a third runway at Heathrow\\" and on 19 March 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that the Thames Hub would be one of those options. The promoters claim that the Thames Hub proposal complements the UK Government's National Infrastructure Plan and provides a more integrated case than previous proposals for a Thames Estuary airport.  Proposals  The Thames Hub's vision is that integrated infrastructure development can provide benefits not just for London and the Thames Gateway area but for the whole of the country, hence the project's strapline \\"An integrated vision for Britain\\". The main components of the Thames Hub are: * A new flood protection barrier and crossing for the Thames Estuary that extends the flood protection area for London and the Thames Gateway by 150% * Two opportunities to generate carbon free renewable power ‚Äì hydropower generators could be integrated into the new flood barrier and an array of hydropower turbines could be installed in the water. Together, these would provide a major new source of clean energy for the South East, while satisfying the demands of the Estuary Airport * A four-track (two high-speed, two conventional speed) passenger and freight Orbital Rail route around London, which links London's radial lines, a future high-speed rail line to the Midlands and the North, the Thames Estuary ports, the airport, HS1 (Channel Tunnel to London), and European rail networks * A Thames Estuary Airport, capable of handling 150 million passengers per annum, enabling the UK to retain its global aviation hub status. The airport is integrated within a logistics matrix that connects by rail the Thames Estuary Ports (London Gateway, Tilbury, London Thamesport) with the ports of Liverpool, Southampton and Felixstowe. The multi-layered rail station below the airport will handle 300,000 passengers per day and would be the UK's busiest station * A new Trade Spine, incorporating utility pipes and data cables linking the Thames Estuary to the Midlands and North of the country via the Orbital Rail route and the UK rail network * A comprehensive environmental management strategy that minimises the impact of development and provides opportunities to create significant new wildlife habitats to more than offset losses elsewhere. The project could be the catalyst to reduce pressure on foreshore habitats from rising sea levels and storm activity = Flood protection barrier and crossing = The proposal envisages a new flood barrier, about 18 miles downstream of the existing Thames Barrier, at Lower Hope between East Tilbury in Essex and Cliffe in Kent. The new barrier would provide protection to the year 2100 and beyond and result in a 150% increase in the area of land protected from flooding. The increased value of this land could be used to help finance the project through an insurance levy on those areas protected, offering an early 'first win' for the Estuary development. Residential development on newly protected land east of Gravesend and east of Tilbury could provide homes for Thames Hub staff. To maximise efficiency, housing developments could be grouped to form an energy-efficient network of smart homes. Shipping in the Estuary would however be seriously affected because the barrier location is in the middle of a tight S bend where strong tidal cross currents occur. While navigation channels would be incorporated into the barrier to allow ships to pass negotiating the barrier would be a challenge for a large ship since it would still be recovering from making its turn while lining up for the barrier. = Renewable energy = Hydropower turbines could be integrated into the flood protection barrier. The proposed hydropower array in the Estuary would be 5 kilometres long and 500 metres wide and would harness tidal flows to produce energy with zero carbon emissions. The tidal generation units can sit either on the estuary bed or on floating pontoons. Their proposed location is north of the Estuary Airport and to the south of the Yantlet shipping channel, the main container freight route to Tilbury Docks and the new London Gateway port. By occupying the space between the airport reclamation and the shipping channel the units will present a hazard to smaller craft which currently navigate outside the shipping channel. Depending on the type of generation units used, there is the potential to generate up to 525 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy per year - enough to power some 76,000 homes. Over a yearly cycle, the energy produced would be enough to supply the Estuary Airport, where demand is estimated as 400-600 GWh/year, allowing excess power to be fed back into the National Grid. = Orbital Rail Route = The four track orbital rail route will closely follow the alignment of the M25 orbital motorway around London. For around a third of its length, the route would pass through tunnels, particularly in sensitive areas such as Epping Forest. It is estimated to remove around 4,000 lorries per day from the M25 and would reduce the costs of continual motorway expansion and the maintenance demands caused by prolonged heavy use. The proposal envisages that the orbital rail route could be sunk by one metre into the ground. The excavated earth could then be used to build embankments alongside the track, within which energy and data cables could be laid, in order to provide acoustic shielding and reduce the visual impact of the railway, similar in concept to the use of the Ha-ha in garden design. New stations along the Orbital Rail route will be located close to existing junctions on the M25, making them accessible by two million people within a 10 kilometre radius. Using the Orbital Rail line to reach their final destinations and thus avoiding central London will allow passenger rail journey times across the capital to be reduced by up to an hour. In crossing the Thames Estuary, rail tunnels and local road links could be integrated into the flood protection barrier, similar in concept to integration of the Saint Petersburg Ring Road in the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia. The Orbital Rail route would provide a missing link between the existing HS1 high-speed rail line and the proposed high-speed line to the Midlands and the North, maximising the impact of both. It also integrates with the new Hub Airport, allowing it effectively to serve the whole of the UK. Up to 60% of airport passengers will arrive using fast, frequent services from across the country = Estuary Airport = The airport site was selected for its proximity to London ‚Äì at 34 miles (55 kilometres) from the centre, it can be reached in 30 minutes by high-speed rail. The proposal to build the airport on a platform, like those at Chek Lap Kok in Hong Kong and New Doha International Airport in Qatar would allow flights to take off and land over water, significantly reducing noise impacts and enabling the airport to operate 24 hours a day. Approximately half the area of the airport platform will be on reclaimed land extending into the Estuary, 7 metres above sea level, with the other half on the Isle of Grain. The on shore portion of the site will require the removal of several villages and the relocation of the recently constructed Grain LNG terminal. The airport will accommodate long-haul airline schedules and growing demand in the Asian market. Thus it will reassert London's geographical advantage as the stop-off point between North America and Eurasia, which is being eroded by a combination of new long-range aircraft and the emergence of networks centred on a global hub, such as Dubai. = Trade spine = The trade spine would include rail links and utility cables. High-speed services would reduce journey times significantly from the cities of the Midlands and North to the cities of continental Europe. By rail, it will take approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes to reach the new Hub Airport from Leeds or Manchester. = Environmental management strategy = As the site is located in an internationally protected Ramsar site a key element of the proposal will be an environmental management strategy to compensate for the loss of wetland habitat and provide an equivalent area of new roosting and feeding grounds for birds.  Funding  The project is estimated to cost ¬£50 billion. The promoters state that it does not need to depend solely on public funding. Established private-sector funding models ‚Äì such as the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) approach ‚Äì could provide a funding mechanism for the project. Such an approach is described in a paper for the European Investment Bank by regulatory economist Dieter Helm and how greater use can be made of RAB funding is being studied by HM Treasury.  Benefits  The project is estimated by its promoters to deliver ¬£150 billion of economic and environmental benefits - ¬£35 billion from rail and road transport, ¬£35 billion from the airport, including tax revenues, ¬£2 billion from environmental management and ¬£75 billion from growth in the Thames Hub area. When the benefits are compared to the costs of the project this gives a Benefit Cost Ratio of 3 to 1, which is typically viewed as representing high value for money.  Public reaction  The launch of the Thames Hub proposal on 2 November 2011 attracted widespread media comment, including coverage on television and radio and articles on web sites, in newspapers and the technical press. = TV and radio = The Hub received extensive coverage on BBC News, BBC News web site and BBC Local Radio stations, such as BBC Radio Kent and BBC Radio Suffolk. It was the lead story on BBC London News 10.30pm bulletin and was the third story on ITV's London Tonight. = Newspapers = Most national newspapers were positive about the proposals. The Times referred to it as a \\"grand plan.... to revive the economy\\" and in his 'Commentary' for the paper Tony Travers, Director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a regular media commentator, said, in relation to the London economy, \\"if this plan does not take off, decline is certain\\". The Daily Telegraph in its 'Comment' section said that it was \\"refreshing to see ambition reminiscent of Britain‚Äôs Victorian heyday in the latest proposals for a new airport in the Thames estuary.\\" The Financial Times said the Hub \\"could lead to the most radical overhaul of Britain‚Äôs transport, logistics and communication network since the building of the railways.\\" The London Evening Standard's editorial said that it was a \\"welcome, imaginative contribution to the debate about the South East's aviation needs.\\" Rowan Moore writing in The Observer was more cautious, citing critics who say that the airport could become a white elephant like Montr√©al- Mirabel International Airport in Canada. = Technical press = Project magazine, the voice of project management, dedicated five pages of its February 2012 issue to the proposals. It described the project as a \\"great British project idea\\", which was aiming to deliver an \\"innovative and sustainable transport solution fit for the 21st century\\". New Civil Engineer magazine devoted five pages of its 3 November 2011 edition to the Hub and in the following week it was the most popular story on its web site. The design magazine Design Week said that the Hub had \\"put the value of huge, design-led national infrastructure projects firmly in front of Government\\". It also quoted Mat Hunter, chief design officer at the Design Council, as saying \\"This is a great chance to start with a blank page and adopt a design-centred approach to a major piece of infrastructure.... The fact that Lord Foster, as a globally-renowned, sustainability-aware designer is initiating this project is hugely positive - what‚Äôs needed now is to bring together those on all sides to explore how such an exciting project could work financially, environmentally, logistically and politically.\\" Wired UK magazine called the proposal \\"ambitious\\". = Government = A Department for Transport spokesman was quoted as saying that the proposal was an \\"important contribution to the debate on the future of aviation\\" and that a Thames Estuary airport would \\"be considered as part of our wider review of aviation policy.\\" Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, welcomed the proposal and a spokesman said that \\"He is delighted that a distinguished figure like Lord Foster agrees that the answer to Britain‚Äôs aviation needs lie in the [Thames] estuary.\\" In November 2011 the Mayor published a study on the economic benefits of a Hub airport for London which referred to the Thames Hub as an \\"exciting development.\\" Medway Council in Kent and local MP Mark Reckless announced their opposition to the project. = Others = Billionaire industrial designer, and founder of the Dyson company, James Dyson has pledged his support for the project. Friends of the Earth announced their opposition to the project.  Awards  The Thames Hub won Project of the Year 2012 at the Global Air Rail Awards, an international awards ceremony, supported by Airports Council International, dedicated to the air-rail market to recognise best practice in intermodal travel around the world.  Government announcement  The National Infrastructure Plan 2011, which accompanied the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 2011 Autumn Statement on 29 November 2011, confirmed that in consulting on its aviation strategy in March 2012 the Government \\"will explore all the options for maintaining the UK's aviation hub status, with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow.\\" Conservative Party Deputy Chairman and Kent MP for Sevenoaks Michael Fallon told BBC Radio Kent that the Government was looking seriously at plans for a Thames estuary airport. Leader of Kent County Council Paul Carter told BBC Kent that he wanted the Government to look at other options - including locating the airport next to the Essex coast. However he said he could see that \\"there is a very good business case we don‚Äôt bleed away aviation business to Holland\\" by building a new airport close to London. The Financial Times reported that the Chancellor's announcement gave a boost to supporters of a new hub airport in the south-east of England. In response Lord Foster on behalf of the Thames Hub team welcomed Mr Osborne's statement, saying: \\"We believe that the economic case for the Thames hub is compelling.\\" Boris Johnson also welcomed the Government's commitment to \\"an open debate to explore the capital's future airport capacity needs including the potential for a new airport in the Thames Estuary.\\" A few days before the Autumn Statement several newspapers had suggested that the Chancellor was supportive of an estuary airport and the evening before the Chancellor spoke Lord Foster had made the case for the Thames Hub in a packed lecture at Oxford University's Sa√Ød Business School. To coincide with the lecture the Thames Hub team also released some new images of the Thames Hub on the Thames Hub web site. In his Budget 2012 speech in the House of Commons on 21 March 2012, the Chancellor announced that the Government would set out its thinking on the issue of retaining aviation hub status in the Summer, thereby delaying the promised March 2012 consultation document.  Alternatives  Alternative, non-estuarial, options for providing additional airport capacity in Kent have been proposed. One option is to expand Manston Airport. The airport, situated in Thanet, in north east Kent, is relatively close (15 miles) to the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal and because of this proximity its supporters claim that it could become a hub for arrivals and departures between the UK and Europe and beyond. They also argue that, compared to developing a new airport, expansion at Manston would: a) reduce the amount of taxpayer support that would be needed; b) result in less environmental costs; and c) help regenerate this relatively deprived area of Kent. However Manston is located 65 miles from Central London and the journey time from St Pancras by existing high speed Javelin trains to the nearest rail station at Ramsgate is 1 hour 16 minutes. This journey time could be reduced to under 50 minutes if the old Ashford to Ramsgate railway line, that makes up part of the HS1 route was upgraded to high speed standards, although the Department for Transport has no plans to do this at present. A further challenge for Manston is that the flight path from its single runway is directly over Ramsgate, a seaside resort of some 40,000 residents. The end of the runway is less than 1.5 km from the edge of the Town. On 19 December 2012 consulting engineers Beckett Rankine launched an alternative proposal for a new hub airport, which they call Goodwin Airport, located on the Goodwin Sands. In the proposal's supporting website they claim that unlike proposals for sites in the Thames Estuary the Goodwin Sands are not in an environmentally protected area, do not require relocation of existing infrastructure (such as Grain LNG terminal or windfarms) and have enough space for in excess of runways separated sufficiently to allow independent operation. The runways at Goodwin can be aligned so that there is no overflying of the coast. Beckett Rankine claim that for these reasons the Goodwin Sands are the most sustainable site available for a new hub airport. The cost of developing an airport on the Goodwin Sands is claimed to be less than for an airport in the Thames Estuary because there is no infrastructure which has to be relocated and creation of replacement ecological habitats to compensate for the loss of protected habitat is not needed. Furthermore, unlike the Isle of Grain, the site is already in Crown ownership. Promoted by Beckett Rankine as the hub airport for northern Europe the Goodwin Airport scheme has been welcomed in both France and Belgium.

He was co-owner of the Cowles Media Company, whose assets included the Minneapolis Star, the Minneapolis Tribune, the Des Moines Register, Look magazine, and a half-interest in Harper's Magazine.  Biography  The son of banker, publisher, and politician Gardner Cowles Sr., John was a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University. In 1922, Cowles launched the Register and Tribune Syndicate. In 1935, his family acquired the Minneapolis Star; John moved to Minneapolis to manage the paper. Under his leadership, it had the city's highest circulation, pressuring Minneapolis's other newspapers. With his brother Gardner \\"Mike\\" Cowles Jr., he was a co-founder of Look magazine, launched in 1937. In 1939, the Cowles brothers, along with entrepreneur Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold, became owners of the newly formed Comic Magazines, Inc., the corporate entity that would publish the Quality Comics comic book line. (Quality was an influential creative force in what historians and fans call the Golden Age of comic books). That same year, the Cowles family purchased the Minneapolis Evening Journal, merging the Star and the Journal into the Star-Journal. The following year the Cowles family bought the Minneapolis Tribune and merged it with their company, giving it ownership of the city's major newspapers. The Tribune became the city's morning newspaper, the Star-Journal (renamed the Star in 1947) was the evening newspaper, and they published a joint Sunday edition. A separate evening newspaper (the Times) was spun off, which published until 1948.Morison, Bradley (1966). Sunlight on Your Doorstep: The Minneapolis Tribune's First Hundred Years.

It is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim.Striverdi Medical uses Olodaterol is a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in people with COPD. While it appears to reduce COPD exacerbations it does not appear to alter the speed at which a person's lungs worsen or alter their life expectancy. , olodaterol is not approved for the treatment of asthma. It is administered in an inhaler called Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler. Adverse effects Adverse effects generally were rare and mild in clinical studies. Most common, but still affecting no more than 1% of patients, were nasopharyngitis (running nose), dizziness and rash. To judge from the drug's mechanism of action and from experiences with related drugs, hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (fast heartbeat), hypokalemia (low blood levels of potassium), shaking, etc., might occur in some patients, but these effects have rarely, if at all, been observed in studies.  Interactions  Based on theoretical considerations, co-application of other beta-adrenoceptor agonists, potassium lowering drugs (e.g. corticosteroids, many diuretics, and theophylline), tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors could increase the likelihood of adverse effects to occur. Beta blockers, a group of drugs for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and various conditions of the heart, could reduce the efficacy of olodaterol. Clinical data on the relevance of such interactions are very limited. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Like all Œ≤ adrenoreceptor agonists, olodaterol mimics the effect of epinephrine at Œ≤2 receptors in the lung, which causes the bronchi to relax and reduces their resistance to airflow. Olodaterol is a nearly full Œ≤2 agonist, having 88% intrinsic activity compared to the gold standard isoprenaline/isoproterenol). Its half maximal effective concentration (EC50) is 0.1 nM. It has a higher in vitro selectivity for Œ≤2 receptors than the related drugs formoterol and salmeterol: 241-fold versus Œ≤1 and 2299-fold versus Œ≤3 adrenergic receptors. The high Œ≤2/Œ≤1 selectivity may account for the apparent lack of tachycardia in clinical trials, which is mediated by Œ≤1 receptors on the heart. =Pharmacokinetics= Olodaterol is substantially metabolized by glucuronidation (UGT2B7, UGT1A1, UGT1A9) and O-demethylation (CYP2C8, CYP2C9). =Pharmadynamics= Once bound to a Œ≤2 receptor, an olodaterol molecule stays there for hours ‚Äî its dissociation half-life is 17.8 hours ‚Äî, which allows for once-a-day application of the drug like with indacaterol. Other related compounds generally have a shorter duration of action and have to be applied twice daily (e.g. formoterol, salmeterol). Still others (e. g. salbutamol/–∞lbuterol, fenoterol) have to be applied three or four times a day for continuous action, which can also be an advantage for patients who need to apply Œ≤2 agonists only occasionally, for example in an asthma attack. History On 29 January 2013 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) recommended that the clinical data included in the new drug application (NDA) for olodaterol provide substantial evidence of safety and efficacy to support the approval of olodaterol as a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment for airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. On 18 October 2013 approval of olodaterol in the first three European countries ‚Äî the United Kingdom, Denmark and Iceland ‚Äî was announced by the manufacturer. On July 31, 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Striverdi Respimat (olodaterol inhalation spray) to treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema that are experiencing airflow obstruction.

On July 14, 2008, the District Court for S. D. N. Y. decided in favor of eBay on all claims. Tiffany appealed these decisions to the Second Circuit. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court with respect to the claims of trademark infringement and dilution. The false advertising claim was returned to the district court for further processing, which was then ruled in favor of eBay. Background =Tiffany= Founded in 1837, Tiffany & Co. is an established brand of luxury goods with high-end quality, including jewelry, watches, and home items. Created in New York City by Charles Lewis Tiffany, Tiffany is \\"renowned for its rare and magnificent diamonds\\" its \\"style is defined by groundbreaking designs and glamorous collections.\\" Tiffany marks are famous and a valuable asset for the company and are closely controlled through the distribution chains of its goods. In 2009, Tiffany had worldwide net earnings of $368.4 million, 90% of which derived from jewelry sales. =eBay= eBay is an online-market place, founded in 1995, that allows its registered users to buy and sell items with other users. eBay has more than 97 million active users globally, In 2010, users worldwide collectively traded more than $2,000 worth of goods every second. It is the \\"world's largest online marketplace, where practically anyone can buy and sell practically anything.\\" Sellers put listings of their items under certain categories, such as \\"Books\\" or \\"Electronics\\", and potential buyers can search the items they want by keyword search or by browsing under the category. The two parties contact each other directly and decide the payment and shipping details to complete a transaction. eBay makes revenue by charging the sellers a commission fee for its listing services and for each completed deal. eBay addresses trademark owners‚Äô concerns through their Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program and \\"fraud engine\\". Through VeRO, owners of trademarks report potentially infringing listings to eBay by submitting a Notice of Claimed Infringement form (NOCI). eBay staff review submitted NOCIs and remove the offending listings if the information is accurate. The fraud engine is a collection of software rules and models that automatically find and remove listings that violate eBay policies. Starting from 2004, counterfeit Tiffany goods were found to be sold on eBay's website, which could also be linked from eBay's homepage as top-sale listings. =Actions leading to litigation= In May 2003, Tiffany complained to eBay regarding the sale of counterfeit items on its website and eBay recommended Tiffany participate in VeRO. In 2004 (and again in 2005 after litigation ensued), Tiffany conducted surveys to determine the extent of counterfeiting occurring on eBay.Tiffany (NJ) Inc., 576 F. Supp. 2d at 485. Tiffany hired a third party to purchase a random sample of items bought from eBay using the keywords \\"Tiffany\\" and \\"sterling\\" and then inspected these items for authenticity. 136 pieces were purchased in 2004, 73.1% of which were counterfeit, 5% were authentic, and the remaining 21.9% were unverifiable. 139 items were purchased in 2005, 75.5% of which were counterfeit. After counterfeit items continued to be sold on eBay, Tiffany made 5 different demands on eBay in June 2004 ‚Äì (1.) Prevent sellers from listing 5 or more Tiffany jewelry items at once, (2.) Ban the sale of silver Tiffany jewelry, (3.) Ban the sale of items advertised as counterfeit Tiffany, (4.) Stop advertising the availability of Tiffany merchandise, and (5.) Remove ‚ÄòTiffany‚Äô sponsored link advertisements on search engines. Although eBay continued to allow the sale of Tiffany jewelry and buy sponsored link advertisements through a third party, eBay‚Äôs refusal to categorically ban sellers listing more than 5 Tiffany items at a time triggered this lawsuit.  District Court findings  On July 14, 2008 the district court ruled in favor of eBay on all issues. Tiffany appealed and on April 1, 2010 the Second Circuit court ruled in favor of eBay on all issues, except the false advertising claim, which it remanded back to the district court. On remand, the district court again ruled in favor of eBay on the last issue on Sept. 13, 2010.Tiffany v. eBay, Inc., 2010 WL 3733894 =Direct trademark infringement= EBay's use of the Tiffany marks ‚Äì Tiffany pointed out that eBay advertised the availability of Tiffany goods on eBay's market through several ways such as \\"on the eBay home page, through communications with sellers and buyers, and through lists of top search terms and popular brand names.\\" From this, the Court ruled that \\"eBay's use of the Tiffany Marks on its website did not create the impression that Tiffany had affiliated itself with, sponsored, or endorsed the sale of Tiffany items on eBay\\" and that eBay's use of Tiffany marks on its homepage was \\"a protected nominative fair use.\\" # eBay demonstrated that it is necessary to use the Tiffany marks in order to identify and describe their jewelry. # eBay demonstrated that it did not use the marks more than necessary to identify the item. # eBay showed that it did not do anything that would suggest that Tiffany & Co. was sponsoring or endorsing any of the listings or eBay itself. Tiffany alleged eBay violated the Lanham Act and New York state common law by directly infringing on its trademark in three ways. First, eBay profited from the sales of Tiffany jewelry resulting from the Tiffany trademark. Second, eBay bought sponsored links on Google and Yahoo! that advertised eBay listings for Tiffany items. Lastly, eBay should be held liable jointly and severally with the offending sellers, even though eBay didn‚Äôt directly list counterfeit items. Purchase of Sponsored Links. In response to Tiffany's assertion that eBay's practice of purchasing search engine advertising links constitutes direct trademark infringement, eBay claimed, under 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com, Inc. this conduct is not trademark \\"use\\" and thus is not infringing. While the Court found that 1-800 Contacts case is distinguishable from the current case, it concluded that the conduct is protected as a nominative fair use even if it was actually a use of the trademark. The reason is simply that eBay's use of the TIFFANY Marks in sponsored links is effectively identical to that on its own website, and thus the same conclusions can be made. Joint and Several Liability. To support this allegation, Tiffany referred to Gucci America, Inc. v. Exclusive Imports International. The court held that, however, that the two cases were entirely distinguishable from one another because eBay \\"never takes possession of items sold through its website, and that eBay does not directly sell the counterfeit Tiffany merchandise to buyers.\\" The court found that Tiffany's \\"joint and several liability\\" was misplaced and more applicable under the theory of contributory infringement rather than direct infringement and that eBay was not \\"liable for direct trademark infringement under state or federal law.\\" The Second Circuit held that the nominative fair use defense protected eBay‚Äôs activities because eBay needed to reference the Tiffany name to identify the jewelry, eBay only used enough of the trademark as was \\"reasonably necessary\\" to make that identification, and eBay did not suggest endorsement or sponsorship by Tiffany. Further, because eBay does not take possession of counterfeit goods, nor does eBay directly sell items, this issue would be more properly argued under contributory trademark infringement. =Contributory trademark infringement= Tiffany claimed the contributory trademark infringement of eBay, which was a judicially constructed doctrine articulated by the Supreme Court in Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc. and found the liability for trademark infringement can extend beyond those who actually mislabel goods with the mark of another. As established in Inwood, \\"if a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement, the manufacturer or distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit.\\". Using this finding, Tiffany claimed that eBay continued to provide its platform despite its knowledge, or reason to know, that counterfeit merchandise is being sold. Product vs. service ‚Äì eBay argued that its website was service that provides a \\"venue for listings created and posted by third parties\\" rather than a \\"product\\" as defined by the Inwood case. The Court agreed that eBay fell on the \\"service\\" side of the product/service distinction. After examining all the facts, the Court found that \\"eBay exercises sufficient control and monitoring over its websites\\" and is similar to a flea market and uses Hendrickson v. eBay as a case that eBay \\"features elements of both traditional swap meets‚Äîwhere sellers pay for use of space to display goods‚Äî and traditional auction houses where goods are sold in a highest bid process.\\" The court concluded that \\"eBay's conduct must be assessed under the standard for contributory negligence set forth in Inwood.\\" The Second Circuit held that eBay did not have the requisite level of knowledge to satisfy the Inwood standard. \\"For contributory trademark infringement liability‚Ä¶, a service provider must have more than a general knowledge or reason to know that its service is being used to sell counterfeit goods.\\" Here, Tiffany did not identify specific cases of infringement to eBay; and when NOCIs did identify specific sellers, eBay suspended them. Therefore, eBay was not liable for contributory trademark infringement. Knowledge Or Reason To Know. Tiffany provided the evidence that eBay had been notified \\"that some portion of the Tiffany goods sold on its website might be counterfeit.\\" Tiffany informed eBay by sending demand letters in 2003 and 2004, buying products in eBay's 2004 Buying Program and appraising that 73.1% of Tiffany's purchases were counterfeit and filing thousands of Notices of Claimed Infringement (NOCIs) submissions. Tiffany argued that eBay's generalized knowledge of the counterfeit items should have prompted them to \\"preemptively remedy the problem at the very moment that it knew or had reason to know that the infringing conduct was generally occurring, even without specific knowledge as to individual instances of infringing listings or sellers.\\" The court ruled that the generalized knowledge that eBay possessed was insufficient under the Inwood test and that eBay could not be forced to remedy the problem. Willful Blindness. The Court considered whether eBay was willfully blind to the infringement. Tiffany contended that eBay was obligated to perform investigations on the infringing behaviors on its websites, given the knowledge and evidences provided by Tiffany. Nevertheless, evidence showed that eBay had spent significant efforts to fight with the sales of counterfeit items on its websites, including the VeRO program and the fraud engine. Upon the general knowledge of the problem, eBay also took reasonable steps to remedy the problem through its general anti-fraud tools. The Court thus held that eBay was not willfully blind. The court concluded that eBay did not ignore the infringing activities and tried to prevent the sale of counterfeit items, as evidenced by the VeRO program and the \\"fraud engine\\". In addition, eBay had no affirmative duty to search for potentially infringing items without specific knowledge. The appellate court also agreed with the district court‚Äôs ruling that eBay was not liable for contributory trademark infringement in specific cases where eBay received a NOCI from Tiffany and didn‚Äôt permanently ban the seller. In these cases, Tiffany argued that the filing of the NOCI satisfied the Inwood \\"knowledge or reason to know of infringement\\" requirement for these specific infringing sales. The district court concluded, however, that eBay needed only to take \\"appropriate steps\\" after receiving the NOCI. A NOCI was not conclusive evidence of actual infringement; instead, it was a good-faith assertion by the trademark owner of infringement. Therefore, permanently suspending the seller was unnecessary, and eBay‚Äôs prompt removal of potentially violating listings was appropriate. While eBay could have screened out potentially infringing listings more cost efficiently than Tiffany, the trademark right holder has the responsibility to police for infringement. Continue to Supply. Although the general evidence was not sufficient for eBay to take the duty, the NOCIs filed by Tiffany to eBay clearly provided the specific knowledge of infringement. Tiffany argued that eBay continued to serve individual infringers by failing to take adequate steps in response to the NOCIs submissions, and the same listing with the same username appeared on the website even if they were pointed out in NOCIs. The Court held that, first of all, Tiffany wrongly equated the NOCIs, which were merely a good belief, with the determination of counterfeit, and moreover, Tiffany failed to provide evidence for this claim, as the record showed that eBay took appropriate steps to remove such listings and warn the users who sold counterfeit items, instead of continuing to supply such individual sales. =Other Causes of Action= Unfair Competition. Tiffany alleged \\"unfair competition, infringement, and the use of false descriptions and representations under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and New York common law.\\" According to Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc., in which the Lanham Act infringement and Section 43(a) claims were considered jointly, the Section 43(a) claims of Tiffany are governed by the same legal analysis as its federal infringement claims. Thus, Tiffany's Section 43(a) claims must fail as the contributory and direct infringement claims failed. Since eBay routinely removed listings that Tiffany reported to it and spent significant efforts on investigating the items, Tiffany has failed to show the bad faith by eBay. False advertising ‚Äì Tiffany alleged false advertising under Section 43(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act, as eBay engaged in advertising the counterfeit Tiffany merchandise on its homepage and on sponsored links for the Yahoo! and Google search engines. The court disagreed, due to the following reasons: # eBay's use of the term \\"Tiffany\\" was fair use. # Although eBay had the generalized knowledge that many Tiffany products sold on its website were counterfeit, Tiffany did not prove that eBay had specific knowledge on which product was counterfeit. # To the extent that the advertising was false, it was the responsibility of the third-party sellers rather than eBay's. Also the court stated that because eBay was actively removing the purportedly counterfeit items from its listings, they could not be seen as misleading customers. The district court found nothing literally false in eBay‚Äôs advertisements since eBay did sell authentic Tiffany products for sale, making eBay‚Äôs advertising practices a nominative fair use. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that extrinsic evidence was necessary to determine if eBay‚Äôs advertisements were likely to mislead or confuse consumers. Since the district court did not look at extrinsic evidence, the appellate court remanded this case to the district court. On remand, the district court concluded that no extrinsic evidence indicated that the advertisement in question misled or confused any consumers. Therefore, there was no Lanham Act false advertising violation. Trademark dilution ‚Äì Tiffany also challenged eBay's practice constitute trademark dilution under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(c), as well as under New York General Business Law ¬ß 360-l. Specifically, Tiffany argued that eBay was liable for dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment. In addition, Tiffany also claimed the contributory trademark dilution of eBay. The Court concluded that, however, Tiffany failed to prove that eBay was liable for trademark dilution and that even if that eBay could be liable for dilution, eBay's use of the Tiffany marks was a protected, nominative fair use. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) Opinions =Direct Trademark Infringement= The Court agreed with the district court that eBay's use of the Tiffany marks did not constitute direct trademark infringement. The court saw eBay's use of the mark as a way \\"to describe accurately the genuine Tiffany goods offered for sale on its website.\\" The court also used the fact that the \\"About Me\\" page of Tiffany that is located on eBay's website explains that \\"[m]ost of the purported \`TIFFANY & CO.' silver jewelry and packaging available on eBay is counterfeit.\\" =Contributory Copyright Infringement= The Court confirmed the decision the district court made in favor of eBay regarding contributory copyright infringement. Although the Inwood test was meant for regulating the manufactures or distributor of products, Courts have decided to extend it to services, which eBay provided in this case. When Tiffany argued that eBay was liable because it \\"continues to supply its service to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement\\", the district court's opinion was eBay does not have specific knowledge of the infringement instances. Tiffany disagreed. Tiffany argued that eBay knew clearly that the infringing sales were ubiquitous on its websites and continued to provide its services. The Court rejected this argument and found such general knowledge was still insufficient for eBay to take an affirmative duty. =Trademark Dilution= Tiffany contended that eBay‚Äôs advertising practices constituted trademark dilution under the Lanham Act and New York state business law. Tiffany argued that counterfeit items of inferior quality were sold, harming the distinctiveness, value, and reputation of the trademark. In addition, Tiffany argued that eBay should be liable for contributory dilution for encouraging third parties to dilute its trademark. The district court reasoned that eBay was not liable because eBay did not try to confuse the Tiffany trademark with its own product, an online auction website, but used the mark to advertise the availability of authentic Tiffany merchandise on its website. There was \\"no second mark or product at issue here to blur with or to tarnish\\" the Tiffany trademark and therefore, no trademark dilution. The district court rejected Tiffany's claim of dilution by blurring as eBay never attempted to associate the Tiffany marks with its own products. By such, the dilution by tarnishment also could not be held. Tiffany did not bring this decision on appeal. =False Advertising= Tiffany submitted that eBay was liable for false advertising as they advertised in various ways the availability of the Tiffany jewelry and most of them were in fact counterfeit. The district court rejected this claim and thought eBay's advertisement was not literally false because genuine products were indeed sold on their websites. Supreme Court Tiffany filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, which was denied on Nov. 29, 2010. Justice Sotomayor took no part in the decision.  Implications  The Second Circuit ruling has been lauded by organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Public Citizen, and Public Knowledge. EFF argued that internet commerce would be stifled if the burden of policing for trademarks were placed on intermediaries, such as eBay, because any listing even remotely suspicious would be removed. Other commentators have noted that eBay‚Äôs investments in reducing the amount of counterfeit goods sold on its website helped it win in the lower courts and to cement the victory in the Circuit court.Jane Coleman (September, 2010) Organizations such as the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC), however, accuse eBay of \\"turning a blind eye\\" to the amount of counterfeiting that occurs on its website. According to the IACC, 29% of online counterfeit sales occur through eBay. Others have pointed out that the burden to police for counterfeits may hit small businesses particularly hard. In addition, the Supreme Court‚Äôs denial of appeal leaves open the possibility that courts in different districts may come to a different conclusion in the future, leading to a conflict in case law. Others have decried the court's focus on eBay's \\"investment\\" in reducing counterfeiting without reference to the overall economics of either eBay's profitability or the contribution of sales of counterfeits to its success. More to the point, the court did make a finding that \\"eBay appears to concede that it knew as a general matter that counterfeit Tiffany products were listed and sold through its website,\\" but this general knowledge was not sufficient to trigger liability. The liability appears to trigger only when specific individuals (i.e., sellers or stores) are engaged in the counterfeiting of goods, and can be notified to eBay. French courts have disagreed with the Second Circuit decision. In 2008, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) sued eBay in France over the sales of counterfeit perfumes and handbags on its website. LVMH alleged eBay had not done enough to stop the sale of counterfeit goods, but eBay lost the lawsuit. In 2010, LVMH again sued eBay, this time for harming the reputation of the Louis Vuitton trademark and domain name. LVMH won and received 200,000 Euros in damages. The French tribunal put the onus on eBay to enforce adequate measures to prevent illicit goods from entering the market. For example, sellers could be asked to provide receipts of purchase or even certificates of authenticity. eBay could also be made to notify customers when the origin of a good appears doubtful. Commentators have suggested that this disparity between French and U.S. law may \\"weaken the integrity of the online marketplace.\\" See also * Lanham Act References External links * * Starbucks Corp. v.

Oriental Carpet Design. pp. 10. the history and lineage of any name relating to specific types of rugs for so many decades is unusual. Through the 1960s, the Dilmaghani family was still designing, manufacturing and importing Persian carpets from Iran to the United States. Dilmaghani is seen as an important connection of 19th and 20th century Persian rug and carpet production in and around the cities of Tabriz and KermƒÅn. Dilmaghani remains among the best known names of branded 19th, 20th and 21st century hand knotted carpets.  Identification  Antique '92' Dilmaghani Kerman Signature ca. 1880 Semi Antique Dilmaghani Kerman \\"Cyrus Crown\\" ca. 1925 Often, carpets by Dilmaghani from the mid 19th century through the early first quarter of the 20th are identifiable by a large woven signature (in Persian). They are usually within the border of KermƒÅn Persian rugs bearing cartouche inscriptions loosely translate as: \\"Made to Order by Dilmaghani.\\" Additionally, some rugs had numerical Persian inscriptions. The two earliest generations of Dilmaghani carpets are identified by these Persian numerical designations. The earliest number, '02', spans ca. 1845-1880. The second generation of signed rugs, designated with a '92', spans ca. 1880-1910. Post first quarter 20th century examples are either modestly signed, or bear the firm's trademark Crown with laurel, known as the Cyrus Crown.Cyrus Crown (First Use '1929') Mid-century unauthorized replicas of the firm's Crown Kerman carpets are often referred to as \\"Imperial Crown\\" or \\"Crown Royal\\" Kermans. These and other permutations using the word \\"Crown\\" were created by other manufacturers to ride on the clout of true Cyrus Crown Carpets as well as the Dilmaghani firm.  History  The Dilmaghani family were of Azerbaijani origin, and were largely wholesale general merchants, or tujjar (Khan al-Tujjar), as well as sarraf, or bankers. The first account of the Dilmaghani family that relates to carpet manufacturing and trade traces from the 1850s; first in Tabriz and later in KermƒÅn. The Dilmaghanis were also involved in the export of dried fruit to Russia and Turkey working through agents throughout Persia and representatives in Constantinople. The oldest documented and verifiable producer of Dilmaghani branded carpets is Hadji Mohammed Hussein Dilmaghani, whose primary business were selling bills of credit to India and manufacturing fine Persian carpets. Early carpets by Dilmaghani are often identified through auction houses such as Sotheby's, Christie's and Skinner, Inc. and knowledgeable authorities in antique rugs made in workshops or cities. Mehdi Dilmaghani, Hadji Mohammad's son, arrived in the United States in 1922 and founded Mehdi Dilmaghani & Co. Inc. in Manhattan New York. Mehdi Dilmaghani continued to manufacture, import and distribute Persian rugs for the American and European markets and therefore is regarded as a significant tie between 19th and 20th century carpet production. In 1963, Mehdi Dilmaghani and Co. Inc relocated from Manhattan to Scarsdale, New York. The Dilmaghani firm contracted architect Robert Carroll May, a long- time understudy & apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright to carry out Dilmaghani's building design. The Dilmaghani showroom contains 20,000 square feet of showroom, office and warehouse space free of internal support pillars and load-bearing walls. Today, 4th and 5th generation Dilmaghanis continue, and are active, in the Oriental Rug industry. Dennis Dilmaghani, Mehdi Dilmaghani's son, became president and took over operation of the company in 1977. David Dilmaghani (5th generation) operates his own business with focus on antique and vintage hand knotted rugs in retail capacity both online (national and international) and locally with a retail presence.Old New House LLC  Persian rugs  Dilmaghani Persian rug production into the 1880s was supervised by Hadji Mohammed Hussein's brother, Hadji Mohammad Dilmaghani. In 1911, more than 2,000 weavers in Kerman City were under contract to Hadji Mohammad Dilmaghani. Their primary market was in America, and by 1917 the market value of a single export shipment to Europe or America could reach as high as $24,000. From the early 1920s through the early 1960s, Dilmaghani owned three factories in Kerman, and several in Tabriz and Sarouk, Persia. Based on quality, these carpets were subjected to the highest import tax assessment determined by United States Customs. In 1929, Dilmaghani adapted a crown and laurel woven into specific rugs to supplement or substitute the long-time run of Dilmaghani signatures. Mehdi Dilmaghani & Co. Inc. registered several variations of their Cyrus Crown trademark in 1934.Dilmaghani Crown Trademark Post mid 20th century, Dilmaghani still traded and imported Kerman carpets, and the Cyrus Crown trademark remains active and in use today. Over the course of nearly sixty years, Mehdi manufactured an estimated 25,000 Crown Kerman, Crown Sarouks and Crown Tabriz Carpets ranging from 2'x3' to 15' x 30' in size. Crown carpets were extensively documented, and the firm still retains many original production records including weaver names and loom dates for carpets from the 1930s.Cyrus Crown Documentation  Oriental rugs  Since the early 1950s, Dilmaghani manufactured and imported oriental rugs from many countries other than Iran including carpets made in Afghanistan, Armenia, Bulgaria, China, Hungary, India, Japan, Nepal, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Tibet and Turkey.Countries of Origin An installation of a Dilmaghani carpet was made in the Reading Room of the Clinton School of Public Service located on the William J.

It is the ninth episode of the show's eighth season and was broadcast on December 4, 2011. Plot Chuck calls Gabrielle, Susan and Lynette individually for questioning about the disappearance - and possible murder - of Alejandro, inciting panic, and Bree's life begins to spiral into despair when her friends abandon her after they blame her for scorning Chuck and causing him to take out his revenge on them. Susan begins to panic and tells Mike she is worried she will crack under the pressure and wants to go away for a while. He tries to explain that leaving would look suspicious and that they don't have the money to simply go away. Following this she goes to see Felix and ask for the money from the paintings she sold. He tells her it will take a few weeks to get the cheque but she begs him for it explaining she needs to leave town. Felix then visits her house with a cheque as well as a job offer for her in New York so she can continue painting. Susan relays this to Mike explaining how she doesn't love Wisteria Lane like she used to but he becomes angry and tells her that she is running from her problems and would not go with her. During her interrogation Chuck reveals that he knows about Carlos having checked into rehab leading Gaby to admit she is happy they managed to catch his problem early. This prompts Chuck to ask what could have happened recently to trigger his drinking and under pressure Gaby tells him that Carlos had an affair to which he replies that he would follow this up with her husband. Knowing she needs to get to Carlos before Chuck does, Gaby tries to see him in rehab but is told that he is not allowed visitors until the next week. After breaking in and finding him Gaby explains the situation to him. Later when Chuck visits Gaby to reveal he knows that Alejandro was her stepfather, he tells her he would be opening an official case. Gaby then tries to call the rehab center only to learn that Carlos has checked himself out, so she goes out to find him. Lynette begins to worry about what would happen to her children should she be arrested and so decides she needs to tell Tom about her involvement in the murder. Tom is about to leave on a trip to Paris with Jane so Lynette runs to the airport to ask him not to go and admits her secret. He decides to stay which upsets Jane, who decides to get on the plane without him. Bree tries to make amends with each of the women all of whom tell her they are no longer friends as she has managed to make a mess of all their lives causing her to continue drinking. Bree goes out to a bar and blacks out, leading Ben to visit her the morning after to remind her that she came to his house drunk the night before. Bree admits how unhappy she is and Ben advises her to try to make it up to her friends. Renee sees Ben come out of Bree's house and confronts him to which he explains he was simply being a shoulder for her to cry on as she's going through a rough time. Following this Bree tries once again to talk to Gaby who tells her that Chuck is only targeting them to punish her for breaking up with him and so she goes to see him an offer a deal; she will confess to whatever he wants if he promises to leave her friends alone. Chuck, however, refuses this deal as what he wants is for her to be in pain. He then goes to see Ben to tell him he is shutting down his construction site to investigate and purposely makes Renee doubt him with regards to Bree again. Renee goes to see Ben later that night and sees Bree drunkenly drive off in her car. Bree heads to a motel and, after admitting to a hallucination of Mary Alice that she is depressed having lost her perfect life, she picks up a gun. Chuck is hit by a car and left for dead. The identity of the driver is left unknown. Reception According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Putting It Together\\" was watched by 8.20 million viewers and held 2.7 rating between 18 and 49 years of age.

Bundoran Junction was triangular, giving the branch access northwards to and Derry as well as southwards to and Dundalk. The E&BR; renamed itself the Enniskillen, Bundoran and Sligo Railway in anticipation of its extension to Sligo. This would have given stations on the E&BR; a direct main line link with Dublin via the MGW instead of the INW's indirect and rather meandering route to Dundalk where it connected with the Dublin and Drogheda Railway‚Äôs main line to the city. A direct link to Sligo would have benefitted not only Bundoran and Ballyshannon but also the considerable pilgrim traffic to , the nearest station for St Patrick's Purgatory on Lough Derg. It would also have enabled the E&BR; to carry substantial cattle traffic from the west of Ireland to the north-east, both for domestic consumption in and around Belfast and for export to Scotland and England. However, construction of the section from Bundoran to Sligo was delayed, and in 1875 Parliament authorised a rival project, the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (SL&NCR;), which took an inland route from Enniskillen via Manorhamilton to Collooney Junction on the MGWR line about south of Sligo. In 1878 the E&BR; obtained an Act allowing it to abandon its extension to Sligo, and the SL&NCR; opened in phases between 1879 and 1883. The SL&NCR; adopted as its company seal a picture of two steam locomotives colliding, with one derailed and the other remaining on the track. This commemorated the SL&NCR;'s success in reaching Sligo and the E&BR;'s failure to do the same. The SL&NCR; route attracted the cattle traffic to the east coast but it was too circuitous to carry much of the passenger traffic to Bundoran, Ballyshannon or Lough Derg. This was to the permanent disadvantage of both the SL&NCR; and the E&BR.; Under the Great Northern Railway In 1876 the INW merged with the Northern Railway of Ireland and the Ulster Railway to form the Great Northern Railway (GNR), which continued the INW's undertaking to work the E&BR.; The GNR absorbed the E&BR; in 1896. At first the GNR did not operate through trains between Bundoran and Dublin. However, by 1916 the GNR ran the Great Northern Hotel at Bundoran and was running through coaches that were attached a main line train between Dublin and Dundalk and to an INW line train between Dundalk and Enniskillen. The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary between counties Donegal and Fermanagh into an international frontier.Dewick, 2003, maps 59, 60 This imposed three border crossings on the E&B; line: one each side of Pettigo and a third just west of Belleek. It also placed a border crossing on the road between Pettigo and the pilgrims‚Äô destination of Lough Derg. Partition also imposed a border crossing on the SL&NCR; ‚Äî a fate that would not have befallen the E&BR;'s proposed line between Bundoran and Sligo if it had been built. Stops for customs examinations delayed trains for unpredictable lengths of time, which added to the E&B; line's existing disadvantage of circuitous connections to the centres of trade and population on Ireland's east coast. Growing road transport was able to take more direct routes with which GNR trains found it increasingly difficult to compete. The E&B; line had five intermediate stations between Bundoran Junction and Bundoran. In Fermanagh the GNR added four railmotor halts to the line and in 1934 it introduced a railcar to serve all stations between Enniskillen and Bundoran, including the railmotor halts. The railcar was a great success, covering between eight and 12 miles per gallon of fuel and costing only 4d per mile to run ‚Äî far less than an equivalent steam train. During The Emergency the GNR introduced the seasonal Bundoran Express, one of Ireland's relatively few named trains. It was not a fast train but it was a through service via Dundalk between Dublin Amiens Street station and Bundoran. The train ran non-stop between and Pettigo, which allowed it to pass through Northern Ireland without stopping for customs checks. The Second World War created new traffic for the GNR in Northern Ireland. Fuel rationing in the UK impeded road competition in Northern Ireland from 1939, and was further tightened from 1942. Many passengers and GNR staff exploited shortages and rationing of commodities in the UK by smuggling goods across the border from the Republic into the UK. On one occasion in July 1942, when the 17:00 departure from Bundoran to Belfast reached the border it was detained so long while customs officers searched its passengers that it was 04:00 the next morning that it reached . After the war the GNR's fortunes declined again. In 1953 the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic jointly nationalised the ailing company as the GNR Board. Nationalisation and closure In 1957 the Northern Ireland Government made the GNR Board close all its lines across or near the border except the Dublin ‚Äì Belfast main line and its branch to Newry. Lines including the Enniskillen and Bundoran, the Dundalk and Enniskillen and the Omagh ‚Äì Enniskillen section of the Londonderry and Enniskillen were closed on 1 October 1957. Closure of these lines and the Northern Ireland government's withdrawal of grant aid gave the SL&NCR; no option but to close as well. The closures conceded holiday traffic to Bundoran and Ballyshannon to road competition, but the railway strove to retain pilgrim traffic to Lough Derg. The Bundoran Express was replaced by a service from Dublin via and the Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway (PD&O;) to Omagh in Northern Ireland, which then became the railhead for Lough Derg. In 1958 the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland dissolved the GNR Board and divided its assets between C√≥ras Iompair √âireann and the Ulster Transport Authority. However, CI√â continued the pilgrim service to Omagh until 1964. In February 1965 the UTA closed the PD&O; as recommended by the Benson Report of 1963.

Location The highlands are divided by the Mulobozi River, which flow into the lake just north of Moba port. The northern section reaches an altitude of while the larger southern part reaches . Mean annual rainfall is around , mostly falling between October and April. The soil is relatively low in nutrients. A sublacustrine swell extends from the Marungu plateau under the southern basin of Lake Tanganyika, subdividing it into the Albertville and Zongwe basins. The Zongwe trough holds the deepest part of the lake, at below the present lake level. Alluvial cones from the rivers that drain the Marungu Plateau are present at the foot of the Zongwe trough, and there are many V-shaped valleys below the lake level. These features indicate that during the Quaternary (2.588 million years ago to the present) the lake level varied greatly, at times being much lower than now. The explorer Henry Morton Stanley noted this feature when he visited the region in his journey of 1874‚Äì77. He wrote, \\"Kirungw√© Point appears to be a lofty swelling ridge, cut straight through to an unknown depth. There are grounds to believe that this ridge was once a prolongation of the plateau of Marungu, as the rocks are of the same type, and both sides of the lake show similar results of a sudden subsidence without disturbance of the strata.\\" Ecology The higher parts of the highlands are Miombo woodland savannas, with scrub plants on the slopes and some dense forest in the ravines, and remains of riparian forest along the streams. Forest plants include Parinari excelsa, Teclea nobilis, Polyscias fulva, Ficus storthophylla and Turrea holstii in ravines, and Syzygium cordatum, Ficalhoa laurifolia and Ilex mitis by the water. Hyperolius nasicus is a small, slender tree frog with a markedly pointed snout, a very poorly known member of the controversial Hyperolius nasutus group. It is known only from its type locality in the Marungu highlands at Kasiki, at . The greater double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris prigoginei) is found only in the riparian forest of this area. The sunbird is found in only a few areas of riparian forest. It has been recorded from Kasiki, the Lufoko River, Matafali, Pande and Sambwe. It is one of 25 bird species in Zaire (out of 1,086 in total) that were considered threatened in 1990. A 1990 book recommended conservation measures in the Highlands focusing on endemic plants. The Marungu Highlands riparian forest patches are in great danger of destruction from logging and from stream bank erosion by cattle. There have been proposals to conserve the forests that border the Mulobozi River and Lufuko River above within nature preserves. Early reports Prehistoric stone tools, facies with rare bifaces, have been found in the region dating from the Early Pleistocene (over 780,000 years ago) to the present Holocene epoch. During that period the climate alternated several times between arid or semi-arid and pluvial. The English explorer Richard Francis Burton visited the region in 1857‚Äì59. At that time Marungu was one of the sources of slaves collected by the Arabs and taken to the great slave market at Ujiji. The Watuta had earlier plundered the land and almost wiped out the cattle of the inhabitants. A merchant from Oman who had lived in the region for five months told Burton it was divided into three distinct provinces. There were Marungu to the north, Karungu in the center and Urungu in the south. Burton also heard of a Western Marungu, divided from the eastern by the Runangwa River. Burton was somewhat skeptical about the name, which he thought was more likely that of a race than a country. Burton reported that, Stanley visited Marungu in 1876. He wrote, \\"Though the mountains of Marungu are steep, rugged, and craggy, the district is surprisingly populous. Through the chasms and great ca√±ons with which the mountains are sometimes cleft, we saw the summits of other high mountains, fully 2500 feet above the lake, occupied by villages, the inhabitants of which, from the inaccessibility of the position they had selected, were evidently harassed by some more powerful tribes to the westward.\\" Joseph Thomson visited the region in 1878‚Äì80. He reported that there was no head- chief in Marunga, which was divided into three independent chieftainships that sometimes engaged in warfare. From north to south these were called Movu, Songwe and Masensa. The chiefs were Manda, Songwe and Kapampa. The people were \\"most excitable and suspicious\\", and Thomson had difficulty in obtaining permission to travel through the country. Thomson wrote: Thomson said of the terrain, \\"We had now no gentle undulations and rounded valleys, but savage peaks and precipices, alternating with deep gloomy ravines and glens. Ridge after ridge had to be crossed, rising with precipitous sides, and requiring hands and knees in the ascent. Now we would go up 3000 feet, to descend as far, repeating the process three times a day, and never getting half a mile of moderately good walking ground.\\" He visited during the rainy season, which added to his discomfort. Thomson conceded, \\"... the savage and awe-inspiring grandeur of the mountain scenery we traversed in Marungu was not without its relief. Here the sun, darting his rays through a rift in the overhanging cloud-bank, would glorify as if with a golden crown some conspicuous peak, or smile upon some pleasant glade; and there glimpses of Tanganyika would be obtained, 2000 feet beneath us, its waters in the distance seeming as calm and undisturbed as the sleep of innocence.\\" Notes Sources    * Further reading * Category:Highlands Category:Landforms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Tanganyika Province Category:Miombo ","title":"Marungu highlands"},{"id":"33619545","text":"Paul Kee (born 21 February 1967) is a retired Irish footballer who played in numerous positions, including striker and midfielder.

A single prototype was built, which was destroyed in a crash. No production followed, with the Ilyushin DB-3 serving as a torpedo bomber instead. Design and development In March 1934, the Tupolev design bureau (OKB) began work on a multi-role aircraft for Soviet Naval Aviation, intended to serve as a high-speed, long-range torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft and \\"cruiser\\" (i.e. long-range heavy fighter), and available in both landplane and floatplane versions. The task of designing the new aircraft, given the OKB designation ANT-41 and the Navy designation T-1 (Torpedonosets ‚Äì i.e. torpedo carrier) was assigned to the team led by Vladimir Myasishchev.Gordon and Rigmant 2005, p. 74.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p. 84. The ANT-41 was of similar layout to the contemporary SB bomber, which had been designed by another team (led by Alexander Arkhangelsky) at the Tupolev OKB, but was larger and more powerful. Like the SB, it was a mid-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal stressed skin construction. It was powered by two Mikulin AM-34 liquid-cooled V12 engines in close-fitting cowlings driving 3-bladed propellers and cooled by radiators mounted inside the wings inboard of the engines, which were fed by narrow ducts on the leading edge of the wing.Gunston 1995, p. 407.Gunston Tupolev Aircraft since 1922 1995, p. 97. A long (6.5 m (21 ft 4 in)) weapons bay under the fuselage could hold two torpedoes, or a single torpedo or an equivalent weight in bombs. The undercarriage of the landplane version was a retractable tailwheel undercarriage, based on that of the SB but strengthened to deal with the ANT-41's greater weight. History The first prototype ANT-41, a landplane, made its maiden flight from Khodynka Aerodrome, Moscow on 2 June 1936, with severe tail flutter encountered. It was destroyed in a crash during the 14th test flight on 3 July 1936, with the test crew escaping by parachute. The accident was caused by flutter causing wing failure, which was traced to inadequate aileron design.Gunston Tupolev Aircraft since 1922 1995, p.98. Later that year, the Ilyushin DB-3 was chosen to meet Soviet Naval Aviation's requirements for a torpedo bomber, and the ANT-41 was cancelled, with the second prototype unbuilt.

It is a specialized form of light therapy. First formulated in 1925 by American dermatologist William H. Goeckerman (1884‚Äì1954), Goeckerman therapy continues to be used due to its efficacy and safety profile. Individual institutions have modified the Goeckerman regimen and developed their own protocols. Standard therapy includes use of 2‚Äì4% crude coal tar in a petroleum base applied daily to the psoriatic plaques. The minimum period of time for tar application is 2-hours, although it has been recognized that greater periods of time produce better results. The patient is then exposed to broad-band ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, although narrow-band UVB may also be used. Laboratory studies have shown that the combination of coal tar and UV light reduces epidermal DNA synthesis. Modifications right In 1953, John Ingram, an English dermatologist, added topical anthralin paste to his Goeckerman regimen. This is known as the Ingram method. Cost Recent publications have compared Goeckerman therapy with treatment with more expensive biologic agents. Historically, Goeckerman therapy was performed as an inpatient treatment. However, today the treatment can be done with reduced cost as an outpatient. It has been stated by de Miguel et al., that an annual three-week outpatient course of Goeckerman treatment costs $10,000 to 12,000 but repeat treatment may be extended to two years with the use of a $2,000 home UVB treatment lamp. The authors state that biologic therapy costs $22,000 to 59,000 per year. Safety Goeckerman regimens use crude coal tar, which contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, a carcinogen. However, Goeckerman therapy is considered safe although use of tar may have the side-effects of contact dermatitis and mild local burning due to tar hypersensitivity. A retrospective study by Stern et al., of 1,373 patients concluded that there was an increase in skin cancers in those receiving repeated Goeckerman treatments compared to the control group. This has been refuted by other authors, including Pittelkow et al., who state there has not been an increase in skin cancers among those treated compared to the general population and Menter and Cran, who felt that the Stern study was too crude to have validity and felt a 10-year prospective study would be needed to confirm safety concerns. Efficacy With the increased use of biologic medications in treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis there has been a shift away from Goeckerman therapy. A 2007 comparative study of psoriasis treatment found Goeckerman therapy to be more efficacious at 12-weeks than biologics. It has also been successfully used in patients who have failed some biologic therapies.

This list article is a summary of occupy events that have occurred in cities in the United States. Locations =Ashland, Oregon= Occupy Ashland included a peaceful protest and demonstration against economic inequality, corporate greed and the influence of corporations and lobbyists on government which has taken place in Ashland, Oregon, United States since October 6, 2011. The protests began in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York. The protests included an occupation of the downtown Plaza and a daily picket outside the JPMorgan Chase branch in Ashland. The deputy chief of the local police, Corey Falls, has stated that there have been \\"virtually no problems\\" with the protests and that the group has been \\"small and cooperative\\", though one arrest was made for \\"illegally camping in the plaza\\". Some have felt that it is possible for the Occupy Ashland group to work together with local Tea Party members, since they both have goals of reducing the power and \\"stranglehold\\" that the upper class and the government has on the rest of the population. The protest began on October 6 with a group of 25 protesters handing out pamphlets in front of the city's Chase Bank. Police were called to the scene, but the protesters followed the directions to not clutter the streets and no citations were issues by officers. Gene Pelham, CEO of local Ashland bank Rogue Credit Union, stated that since the start of the protests, the number of new customers accounts for the bank had doubled for the month of October. Several members posed a request to local City Council officials at a council meeting, requesting that all of the Council switch their choice of bank away from Bank of America. The 25 bank protesters and more later, numbering around 250, showed up at 3 PM in the public Plaza in Ashland to attend the opening speeches. The original protest was only meant to be for two days over that weekend. However, the protesters ended up spending twenty-two days camped in the Plaza and also spent the days making small protest marches throughout the rest of Ashland, though these marches eventually dwindled. During this period, around 15 protesters were involved in the Plaza protest camp, with 40 total protesters involved in the daily marches. A group vote was held over the weekend of October 29 and the Occupy Ashland group members decided to lessen the amount of marches and camping in the Plaza. Instead, they decided to have group meetings every weekend to work on local issues, though this resulted in the loss of some members who felt that the Plaza should remain occupied, regardless of the actions of city officials. During late November and early December 2011, Occupy Ashland members began focusing on trying to encourage students at Southern Oregon University to become a part of the protest. The group organized a march, titled Occupy SOU, with around 50 people attending and they marched from the SOU campus to downtown Ashland. The Occupy Ashland speakers told students at the event that they need to \\"speak out against the high amount of student loan debt.\\" On January 16, 2012, a celebration march was held by Occupy Ashland members to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day. After Occupy Ashland had more than 300 local residents sign a petition that requested the city use a local bank for its financial endeavors, the Ashland City Council \\"voted unanimously\\" on December 20 to \\"conduct a review of the city's criteria for selecting a financial institution for city banking needs\\". Occupy Ashland member Evan Lasley stated on February 9, 2012 that, due to the group's campaign against using big banks, they have been able to convince \\"about 5.6 million people to move their money from big banks to community banking systems and credit unions in the last 6 months, more than all transfers in 2010.\\" Around 50 members of Occupy Ashland attended the Medford protest on October 15, 2011. On December 12, 2011 several of the Ashland protesters traveled to be involved in the Port of Portland protests. A protest against the National Defense Authorization Act was held on February 13, 2012, involving Occupy Ashland, Occupy Medford, Occupy Grants Pass, and Wake Up America Southern Oregon. On March 4, 2012, a \\"candlelight vigil\\" titled \\"March Forth on March 4th\\" will be held by Occupy Ashland and OSPIRG, focused on the \\"death of free and fair elections due to money's influence in politics\\", along with the problems that the in-statement of corporate personhood has caused. As stated by Emery Way, one of the organizers of Occupy Ashland, the protest has begun to focus on specific issues, such as \\"opposing the Mt. Ashland Ski Area expansion, bringing a homeless shelter to Ashland and reworking the city's camping ban among other homelessness issues, and opposing local foreclosures\\". Way also stated that the group was planning on running some members for Mayor and City Council in 2012, though no concrete decision had been made. Another major goal of the group, as explained by organizer Keith Haxton, is to \\"organize an occupation of Salem in conjunction with the beginning of Oregon's 2012 legislative session\\". During the early months of 2012, Occupy Ashland began working with Good Grief America to focus on \\"the economic and personal hardships associated with foreclosure\\" and have started a \\"Legalize Sleep Campaign\\" that focuses on ending homelessness. =Atlanta, Georgia= Occupy Atlanta is a protest and demonstration that began on October 6, 2011 in Woodruff Park, located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. It is inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York City on September 17. On Friday, October 6, 2011, the protesters at Occupy Atlanta did not reach a consensus on allotting time for U.S. Rep. and Civil Rights Movement icon John Lewis to address the crowd. The main argument against allowing Rep. Lewis to speak was that no one person is inherently more valuable than anyone else, and that allowing a speech at that time was not part of that day's agenda. He was invited to speak at time later in the day, during the \\"other business\\" part of the process, and this proposition was accepted by the assembly. Lewis was unable to attend because of prior commitments, but indicated that he was not offended by the incident. On October 9, the group posted an apology on its website and invited Lewis to speak. Lewis was not disappointed he wasn't able to address the crowd. After the incident, Lewis further voiced his support for the movement: > I stand with you. I support you, what you're doing to humanize American > corporations, humanize the American government and look out for those who > have been left out and left behind. On November 7, 2011, Occupy Atlanta protesters camped out in a home in Snellville. It belonged to a police officer, who had contacted Occupy explaining that the house had been foreclosed upon and that he and his family were shortly to be evicted. The protesters left on the 10th after the local sheriff said that the family could be arrested for accessory to trespassing. Occupy Atlanta has stated that they hope this action, and similar ones planned in the future, will bring attention to the foreclosure crisis. A week later, Occupy Cleveland took similar action and succeeded in preventing the eviction of a family from a foreclosed home; the family were given 30 more days. Around 1 AM on Wednesday, October 26, 2011, police blocked off motor vehicle access to Woodruff Park. Mayor Kasim Reed had revoked the executive order he established that allowed the protesters to lawfully stay in the park. Protesters numbering around 120‚Äì150 were warned to leave the park or they would be arrested. Reed characterized the situation as a crisis and over 150 officersGwynedd Stuart (October 27, 2011). \\"Thoughts in the aftermath of the Occupy Atlanta bust\\" Creative Loafing.

BBC. the SWAT team, and police on horseback and motorcycles were used. At one point during the arrests, protesters not in the park took over the streets. This is when police brought in their motorcycle police to try to break up the crowd that was forming on the streets. Instead of separating, the crowd of protesters marched towards the oncoming police motorcycles and forced them to turn around and head the other way. Fifty two protesters in the park were arrested. Among the arrested was Georgia state Senator Vincent Fort, who said of Reed, \\"He's using all these resources. ... This is the most peaceful place in Georgia.\\" During the day of Tuesday October 25, \\"An Associated Press reporter talked to [a] man with the gun slung across his back ... as he walked in the park. He wouldn't give his name, but said he was an out-of-work accountant who doesn't agree with the protesters' views, but was there, armed, because he wanted to protect the rights of people to protest. There's no law that prevents him from carrying the weapon in public, but several police followed him for about 10 minutes before moving off.\\" Also, a homeless shelter that housed more than 100 Occupy Atlanta protesters tested positive for tuberculosis. =Austin, Texas= Occupy Austin is an occupation and peaceful protest that began on October 6, 2011 at City Hall in Austin, Texas. It is affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York City, and also with the \\"Occupy\\" protests in the United States and around the world. At the center of the occupation is the General Assembly, where the community comes out and tries to come to consensus on proposals for action. The original intent of Occupy Austin, as with many of the other \\"Occupy\\" movements, was to denounce the role that large corporations had in promulgating the financial crisis. The protesters in Austin, as in other movements throughout the world, have described themselves as the \\"99 percent,\\" a reflection of their belief that the financial system rewards the richest 1 percent at the expense of everyone else. One of the features the Occupy Austin Event had at the beginning was that the occupation began progressing with little interference from the police and the city government. The organizers and occupiers had been mainly cooperative with the police, and some of the protesters had expressed appreciation for the role that the Austin Police Department has played during the occupation. On September 29, 38 people were arrested for resisting new rules imposed by City Hall Management. A discussion with an Austin Police Officer monitoring the situation indicates that a large percentage of the people actually occupying the City Hall area are transients who have taken advantage of the situation to camp downtown and partake of the free food provided. The influx of the homeless has had a negative impact on the cleanliness of the area and the general cooperation that has existed between the demonstrators and the Austin Police. The Police are attempting to preserve the rights of the protesters and protect the interests of the City. The protesters have remained peaceful and respectful of the Austin Police. The problems that are developing are a result of the damage done to the landscaping of the area by the large number of people, the unsanitary conditions of overuse and the increased expense of police presence and overtime pay for officers at a time when the City is experiencing budget problems. On October 7, 2011, Occupy Austin sponsored and led a march to Bank of America Center. A few hundred people participated in this march. On October 10, 2011, a march was held to celebrate Indigenous People's Day. On October 12, 2011, the City of Austin announced that the demonstration area in front of City Hall would be closed nightly between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., and that protesters would have to move during this time period. On October 13, 2011, at roughly 2:45 AM 4 protesters were arrested by Austin Police Department authorities when they refused to move as ordered. On October 13, 2011, the Library of Congress chose Occupy Austin's main web portal for inclusion in the historic collection of Internet materials focusing on public policy topics, and commenced archiving the web portal. On October 15, 2011, a march was held to the JPMorgan Chase Tower and to the Texas State Capitol. Over 1000 people participated in the march. Some protesters closed their accounts at Chase Bank. Chase Bank allowed customers who could document that they had Chase accounts into the building singularly to close their accounts. On October 28, the City of Austin declared in a memo that new restrictions had been approved and would begin being enforced. These included a prohibition of sleeping on the mezzanine, exhibiting unattended signs, and the operation of food tables during certain hours. On October 30 at approximately 12:30 AM, 18 demonstrators at the Austin City Hall mezzanine, some of whom were forming an impromptu human chain around three food tables, were arrested on charges of criminal trespassing. Subsequently, 20 additional demonstrators were arrested for refusing to vacate the area for cleaning. As per the terms of their charges, those arrested were barred from returning to the protest area for at least two years. Addressing the public in a press conference, Austin chief of police Art Acevedo stated \\"Austin is very fortunate that we have an activist community that understands that violence doesn't get you anything,\\" but that \\"once you're given the criminal trespassing warning, you either comply or engage in civil disobedience. That's what 38 folks did yesterday and that's why they were arrested,\\" reaffirming his position that \\"we're very kind, but we're going to do our job.\\" In a press release issued by the Occupy Austin General Assembly, spokesperson Jonathan Cronin asserted that \\"on Thursday, Chief of Police Acevedo had addressed the GA and had every opportunity to raise the proposed changes and answer questions about them. His silence about them, followed by these actions, has been taken [by many] as a provocation,\\" and that the incident was \\"entirely out of character from the good faith dealings we have had with city and police officials until now. Imposing these [new restrictions] apparently without due process is unnecessary and inflammatory.\\" Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, issued a statement saying that \\"If the police couldn't handle the situation, then it would have been appropriate to bring in a mediator. It's an absurd waste of tax money to spend police time and energy to break up a pure first amendment demonstration.\\" On October 31, a fundraiser with live music performances was held to help cover legal expenses for those recently arrested. On November 5, demonstrators marched to Wells Fargo in observation of Bank Transfer Day. =Boston, Massachusetts= Occupy Boston was a collective of protesters that settled on September 30, 2011 in Boston, Massachusetts, on Dewey Square in the Financial District opposite the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\\"Occupy Boston Takes Over Dewey Square.\\" Boston Globe, October 3, 2011\\"Boston protesters: End corporate control of govt.\\" Associated Press/Wall Street Journal, October 3, 2011John Stephen Dwyer \\"Who is occupying Boston, and why?

Accessed October 2011. Protesters camped overnight in Niagara Square as part of the demonstration. The leaders and march organizers of the movement were Chris Baker and Steve Norris. An early target of the protest included the Steven J. Baum P.C. law firm in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst. As the largest foreclosure law firm in the state, it had been criticized by activists and fellow lawyers for its aggressive focus on foreclosure without any effort to secure modifications where homeowners or businesses might be eligible. The firm also brought about criticism from their use of questionable robo-signed documents until a change in state court rules requiring an affirmation by the lawyer or client, greatly curtailed its new filings. Baum had attracted national attention after New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera published photos taken of its employees at its 2010 Halloween party, where costumes and decor ridiculed the homeless and attacked the firm's critics. A week after Occupy Buffalo picketed Baum's offices, the firm shut down due to a loss of business after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac forbade mortgage servicers from using the firm for foreclosure actions. As of the end of January 2012, the protest had dwindled to approximately 10 to 15 protesters daily, approximately half of which were homeless.Sommer, Mark (January 30, 2012).

Supporters wear red and almost 60 people ask the council to allow the encampment. A handful of those who speak on the issue ask for the council to start enforcing the 11 p.m. curfew in Lee Park. Occupy Charlottesville is a social movement in Charlottesville, Virginia that began on October 15, 2011,Fitzgerald, October 15, 2011 in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street and the rest of the Occupy movement. The downtown Lee Park encampment was taken down on November 30, 2011 when 18 members of the movement were arrested and charged with trespassing.Moomaw, December 1, 2011 Although the group has not yet established a second campsite, they continue to meet for their General Assemblies in addition to targeted actions.NBC29 January 14, 2012 The group's protests target social and economic injustice both locally and nationally. The Occupy Wall Street movement began on September 17, 2011 as a protest against economic and social injustice.#Occupy Wall Street Retrieved January 23, 2012 Soon thereafter, autonomous satellite protests sprung up across the world, most of them in the United States. In the weeks leading up to October 15 occupation in Charlottesville, protesters first met at Random Row books on October 5 and again on October 12, for the first Official General Assembly Among other topics, \\"they discussed and developed a set of shared values for community members, including social and economic justice, mutual respect, cooperation and non-violence with each other\\" The occupiers chose to take Lee Park, a public park in the North downtown neighborhood. Several meetings that occurred in the first half of October lead up to Occupy Charlottesville's first action, which was a march from McGuffey Park (a few blocks away from the group's eventual campsite) to protest at a luncheon for the University of Virginia's corporate sponsors, hosted by UVa President Teresa A. Sullivan. Later that night, the campsite was established in Lee Park. This physical presence lasted until the Charlottesville Police Department broke the encampment on November 30, 2011. The group remains active and continues to organize actions, as well as joining long-existing groups in actions of their own.Dunleavy, January 14, 2012 Charlottesville City Officials granted the group a three-day overnight permit on October 18, 2011.Strong, October 18, 2011 On October 26, the City Parks and Recreation Director, Brian Daly, granted the protesters an automatic permit renewal for the next 30 days, provided no problems arose.Moomaw, October 26, 2011 On November 1, three homeless men were arrested in Lee Park for various alcohol infractions, while two underage girls were taken to the hospital with \\"signs of alcohol consumption\\".

Charlottesville City Council expressed no intention of disbanding the encampment before the permit expired on Thanksgiving Day. City Councilor Kristin Szakos expressed her belief \\"that it's a First Amendment issue ... And I think the First Amendment isn't limited to certain times of the day', while then-Mayor Dave Norris proposed \\"a community discussion about turning a neighborhood park into a \\"24/7 free-speech zone.\\"Moomaw, November 11, 2011 On November 21, 2011, members of Occupy Charlottesville expressed their intention to continue their occupation to Charlottesville City Council. Many asked for the City to suspend the 11 p.m. curfew. Over 100 supporters packed the chambers in what Councilor David Brown called the best-attended meeting in his 8 years on the board. An overflow room was opened for people who could not fit in council chambers. About 60 people spoke to City Council regarding Occupy Charlottesville, a handful of them against its continued presence.Jaglois, November 22, 2011 Councilor response followed the public comments portion of the meeting. During this response portion of the meeting Councilor Szakos stated that she \\"[thinks] that free speech doesn't expire at 11 o'clock.

A desire was expressed to move the occupation to a new location, approved by the local city government. Mayor Dave Norris expressed his desire to find an alternative location for the occupiers other than a \\"neighborhood park\\". Although he expressed general support for the movement, he was resolved to end the Lee Park encampment. \\"I guess for me, the question is, is the movement stronger than this park? I think it is. I think it's clear that it is\\". City Spokesmen Ric Barrick sent out an email saying that Occupy Charlottesville would continue to receive 3-day permits for Lee Park until a suitable alternative location was found, and that no end date had been set for the city's thus-far tolerant stance toward the occupation.Moomaw, Graham. November 22, 2011 Despite the enthusiasm for the movement expressed at the November 21 City Council meeting an alternative location was not determined. City government opted to evict the protesters on November 30, 2011.Staff, November 1, 2012 After the 11:00 curfew came into effect, over 20 police officers moved in. Occupy supporters packed the sidewalk, City Council member Kristin Szakos among them. Eighteen arrests were made, sixteen of the arrestees were taken to the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail while the other two were issued summons. One protester, Veronica Fitzhugh, was given an indecent exposure charge in addition to trespassing. The next night, occupiers met at the city's \\"Free Speech Wall\\", which had notices posted on it that camping would not be allowed. Mayor Norris expressed displeasure with the spectacle, calling it the \\"death knell\\" for the group. \\"The decision they made on Tuesday night ... a majority of them agreed to work with the city on finding another venue, but obviously a significant number decided to poke the city in the eye on the way out of Lee Park and provoke a confrontation with the city.\\" Szakos was displeased that the city opted to evict the protesters. \\"I personally, as a councilor, feel very strongly that this is part of the speech that should be protected by the Constitution,\\" Szakos said. \\"And I personally disagree with us ordering them out.\\" Despite the enthusiasm for the movement expressed at the November 21 City Council meeting an alternative location was not determined. City government opted to evict the protesters on November 30, 2011. On December 15, 2011 a single male protester was cited for impeding traffic during a march to commemorate two months since the inception of the occupation. Lt. Ronnie Roberts, of the CPD said the group was large enough to block rush hour traffic on West Main Street.\\"The Daily Progress\\", December 15, 2011 On January 27, the Charlottesville General District Court found 17 of the 18 protesters who were arrested in November guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor for trespassing. Each of the convicted protesters must pay a $100 fine plus court costs. The 18th protester, Mario Brown had plead guilty and been sentenced to community service in December. Veronica Fitzhugh, who stripped naked to read a statement during the eviction, had her indecent exposure charge dismissed, as the court considered her actions to be \\"political, rather than sexual in nature\\". Jeff Fogel, a National Lawyers Guild attorney who represented Occupy Charlottesville was dissatisfied with the verdict. He said ...\\"The Supreme Court has been clear that politics should play no role in determining who gets the right to speak and not to speak on the streets of our city.\\"Vogel, January 30, 2012 Two members of Occupy Charlottesville, Bailee Hampton and Shelly Stern filed brutality complaints against the Charlottesville Police Department based on claims of police misconduct during their November 30 arrests. A police brutality probe was conducted by the CPD but they declined to release the results.Richmond Times- Dispatch, January 22, 2012 Dave Norris, who was mayor when Occupy Charlottesville was evicted, said the current policy of the CPD is that they don't release information about disciplinary action. He added that think \\"it would probably serve the community well to at least provide some transparency in terms of the actions that may have taken place.\\" However, Satyendra Huja, who had taken over Norris' job as Mayor by the time the police brutality investigation was complete, felt that it was unnecessary for the police to release the results of their probe. He felt that since the Charlottesville Police Department did not take any action against its officers, the brutality complaints were baseless.Moomaw, January 30, 2011 =Chicago, Illinois= Occupy Chicago is a peaceful protest and demonstration against economic inequality, corporate greed and the influence of corporations and lobbyists on government which has been taking place in Chicago since September 24, 2011. The protests began in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York. On October 10, protesters from Occupy Chicago joined with members of the \\"Stand Up Chicago\\" coalition and marched through downtown Chicago, with numbers estimated at around 3,000. Occupy Chicago has been consistently occupying the corners of Jackson and LaSalle in Chicago's financial district. Occupy Chicago remains unique among the major occupations across the country in that it lacks a permanent encampment. Protesters remain outdoors, exposed to the elements 24 hours a day. Due to city ordinances, protesters were told that all supplies had to be technically \\"mobile.\\" Protesters complied with the city by containing all of the occupation's supplies (including signs, food, and clothing) in carts on the sidewalk. It also has created a more fluid atmosphere at Occupy Chicago with individual protesters fluctuating in and out. Occupy Chicago is also unique in that unlike Occupy Wall Street it is positioned directly in front of major financial centers, including the Board of Trade, Bank of America, and the Federal Reserve Building. This proximity has resulted in the curious sight of traders watching the protesters while outside on breaks. It has also resulted in taunts from workers in the Board of Trade. On October 4, 2011 a sign was visible in the windows of the Board of Trade that read, \\"WE ARE THE 1%.\\" The sign was quickly taken down.Chicago Board of Trade to Occupy Chicago Protesters: \\"We Are the 1%\\" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/05/chicago-board-of-trade- to_n_996635.html Seeking to create a permanent, sheltered base, over 175 protesters were arrested under the orders of Chicago's mayor Rahm Emanuel on the morning of October 16 after refusing to take down tents and remaining in Grant Park near Chicago's lakefront after the park's posted closing hours. Remaining in any unfenced park between 11 P.M. and 4 A.M. or erecting a tent or other structure without a permit is a crime according to the Municipal Code of Chicago (MCC) and park district ordinances. One week later, during a second attempt at occupation during the evening of October 22 and morning of October 23, Chicago police arrested 130 demonstrators, again for refusing to leave the park after the posted closing hours. Two of those arrested were nurses and members of National Nurses United who had set up a medical tent to provide any needed medical services to the occupation. On October 27, 2011 Occupy Chicago planned a candlelight vigil in solidarity with Scott Olsen and Occupy Oakland. The 30 protesters were met with Chicago Police Department officers and Illinois State Troopers on order from governor Pat Quinn armed with tear gas masks, attack dogs, and police wagons. In a move to bolster law enforcement of the Occupy movement and upcoming G8 and NATO summits, in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's recently passed ordinance imposes harsher fines and rules for protests and demonstrations. A letter sent by Occupy Chicago to 50 of Chicago's aldermen reads: \\"Given what the ordinance actually says, it cannot be construed as an effort to protect the integrity of G8 and NATO conferences. This measure is a permanent attack on public protest in the City of Chicago. The consequences of this attack will be far reaching, and will be felt by protesters throughout the city, most of whom will never have any connection to the protests associated with these events.\\" Occupy Chicago divides work up between various committees which function independently. The idea of the committees is to identify individuals who have specific talents and facilitate them working together to support Occupy Chicago in smaller more focused groups. =Cincinnati, Ohio= Occupy Cincinnati was an ongoing peaceful protest and demonstration in Cincinnati, Ohio. The protest began as a march from Lytle Park in Downtown Cincinnati to Fountain Square on October 8, 2011. Protesters successfully applied for a permit to use Fountain Square until 1:00AM on October 9. Six protesters stayed in the park after the 1:00AM permit time and after the 3:00AM closing of the park.

Occupiers that day were contacted by Jesse Jackson who came down to Piatt Park at 5:45 PM to speak to the protesters as they reoccupied the park. Afterwards, the Cincinnati Police Department made 15 arrests. The Occupiers blocked the police access to the park until the tents were removed. Occupy Cincinnati moved back into the park once they left. Another Occupy movement has also developed in Cincinnati: \\"Occupy Western Hills.\\" It is not affiliated with Occupy Cincinnati, however. As of April 2012, Occupy Cincinnati had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions. =Dallas, Texas= Protesters and police during Occupy Dallas Occupy Dallas is a peaceful protest, demonstration and occupation that began on October 6, 2011 with a march to the Federal Reserve Building in Dallas, Texas. It is affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York City, and also with the \\"Occupy\\" protests that have been springing up around the United States and around the world. A series of meetings that were titled \\"The General Assembly\\" or \\"GA\\" were held to plan the beginning of the event on October 6, 2011, and have been held on an ongoing basis to create a consensus on policies and planning for the occupation. Committees known as \\"working groups\\" have been formulated to utilize the expertise of volunteers who wish to assist in the event. Occupy Dallas's aims are to non-violently reclaim control of the government from the financial interests that have corrupted them, and demands that public servants recognize that the people are the supreme authority. The intent of Occupy Dallas, as with many of the other \\"Occupy\\" movements, has been to denounce the role that large corporations have in the American legislative system. The protesters in Dallas, as in other movements throughout the world, have described themselves as the \\"99 percent,\\" a reflection of the belief that the financial system rewards the richest 1 percent at the expense of the majority of the population. On October 6, 2011, Occupy Dallas marched from Pike Park to the Dallas Federal Reserve Branch. On October 11, SMU economics professor Ravi Batra wrote an article stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement heralds the end of \\"crony capitalism\\". He argues that government policies since the Reagan Administration have greatly contributed to increase inequalities and economic problems in the U.S. and that the OWS movement should push for their repeal.

Protesters are concerned about fairness issues regarding wealth-distribution, banking regulation, housing issues and corporate greed.Skrzypek, Jeff (October 17, 2011.) \\"Occupy Eugene Protesters Shift Focus.\\" KEZI News. Accessed October 2011. The first protest march was held on October 15. The march started at the Wayne Morse Free Speech Plaza and continued downtown before marching over fairy street bridge. It was reported that close to 2000 people were in attendance from all over the state of Oregon. Occupy Eugene continues to hold regular protests and actions. Protesters have stated that they do not have a set group of leaders. Occupy Eugene meets on Tuesdays at 7 and Saturdays at 4 for their General Assembly, and Mondays at 7 for the weekly coordination meeting. Decisions are made through a process known as consensus. Occupy Eugene's consensus process operates in a similar fashion to how consensus is being handled in New York City by protesters involved in Occupy Wall Street. Although the exact method varies from Occupation to Occupation.Keefer, Bob (October 17, 2011.) \\"Taking a Stand: Some protest corporate greed as others walk against hunger.\\" The Register Guard. Accessed October 2011. As of October 18, 2011, The Eugene police department is allowing protesters to camp in downtown Eugene, although city law prohibits it.Debbas, Jessica (October 18, 2011.) \\"Occupy Eugene: EPD Makes Exception to City Rules.\\" KEZI News. Accessed October 2011.Debbas, Jessica (October 17, 2011.) \\"Eugene Police Allow Occupy Camp to Stay.\\" KEZI News. Accessed October 2011. Eugene police also stated that downtown camping won't be permanently allowed. Occupy Eugene's first location was downtown in an area known as the park blocks on the corner of 8th and Oak. It began in mid October 2011. According to a post on the Occupy Eugene Facebook page, the community was invited to march with the Occupiers to a new location after protesters conferred with Eugene's city manager and chief of police and settled upon Alton Baker Park. On Thursday, October 27, Occupy Eugene occupied the quad at the University of Oregon for half a day before moving their encampment to Riverfront Research Park, also known as Millrace Park, across Franklin Boulevard from the University, where they remained until Friday, November 4. On November 4, Occupy Eugene relocated their camp to Washington Jefferson Park between 6th and 7th Avenues. On December 27, the last remaining occupant left the camp at Washington Jefferson Park. As of January 23, Occupy Eugene's newest location, known as OEV or Occupy 5 is located at a donated warehouse near downtown Eugene. Growers Market Office- Occupy Eugene has an Office located at the Growers Market building on Willamette and 5th. Occupy Eugene Uses several online portals for communication, including the official site http://www.OccupyEugeneMedia.org. Several Facebook pages, The official Occupy Eugene YouTube channel, in addition to Occupy Eugene Video, Occupy Eugene Interview series an ongoing collaborative project operated by members of Occupy Eugene, Occupy Eugene Music and a theatre YouTube channels that are content specific multimedia portals designed to help facilitate communitcation and culture. Occupy TV is a community television based project that currently runs a talk show with members of Occupy Eugene. It is currently run on Comcast Cable Channel 29 Community Television of Lane County, Eugene, Oregon. It is also available from the Occupy Eugene Video channel on YouTube. Actions is a committee devoted to planning, scheduling and leading protests and or direct actions to facilitate official Occupy Eugene's message. The movement continues with a new goal: to proliferate free and open urban communes for their own sake. At the Occupy camp, the fourth major one in Eugene since 2011, fifteen people live for free in tents on public display near downtown as of November 1, 2014. They encourage others to join, and hope to grow their movement to turn urban open spaces into communes, with or without government permission, all around the world. =Houston, Texas= Occupy Houston is an ongoing occupation protest that stands in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street. The planned occupation officially started in Houston, Texas on Thursday October 6, 2011 when protesters returned from JP Morgan Chase Tower to establish an encampment at Hermann Square Plaza. During the JPMorgan Chase demonstration there were not any confrontations with the police and numerous different passerby were reported to have sympathized with the tone of the protesters. That same night the police were reported to have commented on how well behaved the protesters were. It wasn't long before Occupy Houston moved for the first time. During the first week of the occupation Occupy Houston respectfully volunteered to evacuate the park for the Bayou City Art Festival earning Occupy Houston the nickname of \\"The Nicest Protesters in the World\\", and \\"Affable Protesters\\" by Culture Map. A few of the artists participating in the Art Festival sympathized with Occupy Houston. The location Occupy Houston moved to was Eleanor Tinsley Park where the demonstrators roughed out torrential downpours before finally erecting tents. Shortly after the rain ended, HPD ordered Occupy Houston to dismantle the tents and Occupy Houston after holding an emergency GA, for an extended period of time, eventually complied. Though not requested by HPD, the free standing, temporary, open air pavilions were dismantled as well. Prior to moving to Eleanor Tinsley, Occupy Houston vowed to return to City Hall and they did. Yet after spending a few days at City Hall the encampment was moved one last time to Tranquility Park‚Äîthis time the pressing issue forcing the move was the Energy Day festival in Houston which has Hermann Square rented. Though Occupy Houston opted to acquiesce to the demands of the City by evacuating Hermann Square, it did not support the Energy Festival. Instead, Occupy Houston protested the festival on the grounds of its sponsorship by TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL Pipeline, and Valero which demanded a further $62.8 million tax refund. The night of the move (as with the initial move) a few remained, perhaps one or two, well into the morning in general protest. Their grievances included the renting of public space to private entities, as well as specifically the KBR display that was erected that night. Involved people held a Corporate House of Horrors during Halloween. Another notable event that Occupy Houston organized was a Bank Transfer Day divestment march on November 4, 2011. Bank Transfer Day was a national campaign to divest from banks and to bring the financial business to credit unions which are seen as being more community-friendly. Members of Occupy Houston marched on four different banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Amegy to divest and close their accounts. In Texas, 47,000 credit union accounts were opened in the month of November‚Äîmany of those new accounts have been attributed to the Occupy protests in Texas. The Official Planning for Occupy Houston started a week before the first protest. Occupy Houston has found amazing support from the residents in the city. It was reported that a 42 inch flat screen TV was donated, and $1,800 collected. In addition, numerous different bands and artists have played or showed support for Occupy Houston most notably including Bun B of UGK, and the Free Radicals. A few politicians and activists have visited the occupation as well such Dick Gregory and Houston Councilwoman Jolanda Jones. The Coffee Party also airs a show live from Occupy Houston once a week. Not all members of the city have been supportive of the protest though: Houston mayor Annise Parker denied a request to supply city electricity to the occupation or to provide a statement to refuse the enforcement of the civility statute that prohibits tents in city parks. Other Occupy communities have cited Occupy Houston as an example for the good organizational work. It was mentioned at Occupy San Diego that, \\"[Occupy Houston] just passed a proposal and action for a de-investment campaign. What are we doing with our GA? Let's get back on track, guys.\\" With the number of protesters decreasing, Mayor Annise Parker requested that they move off the tax supported land and have some sort of \\"End Game.\\" =Las Vegas, Nevada= Occupy Las Vegas (abbreviated OLV) is an occupation and peaceful protest that began on October 6, 2011. It is affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York City, and also with the \\"Occupy\\" movement in the United States and around the world. A series of meetings that were titled \\"The General Assembly\\" or \\"GA\\" were held to plan the beginning of the event on October 6, 2011, and were held to create a consensus on policies and planning for the occupation. The original intent of Occupy Las Vegas, as with many of the other \\"Occupy\\" movements, was to denounce the role that large corporations had in promulgating the financial crisis. The protesters in Las Vegas, as in other movements throughout the world, have described themselves as the \\"99 percent.\\" This statement comes from the fact that 1% of the population owns 44% of the wealth in the United States. One of the features the Occupy Las Vegas Event had at the beginning was that the occupation began progressing with little interference from the police and the city government. The organizers and occupiers had been mainly cooperative with the police, and some of the protesters had expressed appreciation for the role that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has played during the occupation. On November 3, a literal midnight meeting was held at \\"Area 99\\" which purported to create a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation named Opportunities Las Vegas, and reduced the rules for voting in the General Assembly to a simple majority. On November 5, a member of the non-profit Board of Directors stated that because of differences of opinion amongst the group that he would refuse to recognize the General Assembly's authority to in any way affect the rules of the Non-Profit due to the legal requirements and ramifications of administrating a Non- Profit. There was a theft of passwords off an unprotected computer, in which the passwords for the Go Daddy domain name OccupyLasVegas.org, was briefly pointed to an anti-Semitic hate site by an unknown party. In the aftermath of this incident, the owner of the server where the site data was stored obtained a new URL, OccupyLV.org on his own initiative. When the original domain was restored a new hosted site was attached to it, on the initiative of the domain name owner. As of November 20, the two sides agreed on little, except that they were now separate organizations, both claiming to be \\"Occupy Las Vegas.\\".Most welcome : Local News :: Las Vegas CityLife On October 6, 2011, Occupy Las Vegas sponsored and led a march on the Las Vegas Strip. It was estimated that 1000 people participated in this march. On October 15, 2011, a march was held in the Fremont Street Experience. Over 1000 people participated in the march. On October 21, 2011, the group began occupying a 2.5 acre site near UNLV, formerly used as an overflow parking lot by the nearby airport. The site has been informally dubbed \\"Area 99,\\" a reference both to the \\"We are the 99%\\" slogan of the overall movement, and the infamous Area 51 located in Nevada. It also has an alternate name of \\"Camp Peace.\\" On October 30, 2011, a zombie march was held on the Las Vegas Strip. Members of both factions of OLV came together to assist a small business on the verge of being foreclosed upon, on November 13‚Äì14, 2011. In conjunction with a call by Occupy Wall Street for a protest on November 17, members of the Occupy Las Vegas factions organized a protest at the Lloyd George Federal Building. Protesters occupied the northbound lanes of Las Vegas Boulevard, resulting in 21 arrests. The arrests are a first among Occupy Las Vegas demonstrations. =Los Angeles, California= Occupy Los Angeles participants at City Hall in Downtown Los Angeles, California Occupy Los Angeles (also referred to as Occupy L.A.) first manifested on October 1, 2011 on the grounds of Los Angeles City Hall following the original Occupy Wall Street protest. The camp experienced a relatively uncontentious relationship through its duration. On November 17, Occupy Los Angeles joined with a permitted organized labor march through downtown Los Angeles. The parade was generally orderly, though a circle of about twenty protesters surrounded three tents in the middle of a street in deliberate disobedience and were arrested. Later in the day, an unpermitted march went to a plaza at the base of the Bank of America tower, when police brought the march to a halt. More protesters were arrested for trespassing, 73 total for the day. Occupy is a social movement, not a political party, concerned with bringing equality back to the American system and then the world. The movement had several celebrity appearances including NOFX, Jesse Jackson, Bill Maher, Shepard Fairey, Tom Morello (from Rage Against the Machine) and Jeff Ross. Antonio Villaraigosa, mayor of Los Angeles, announced an eviction order deadline of Monday morning, November 28, at 12:01 a.m., giving the reason that \\"It is time to close the park and repair the grounds so that we can restore public access to the park.\\" Early Monday morning protesters and the encampment remained after the city ordered an end their protest. Four people were arrested for unlawful assembly. On Tuesday, November 29, 1,350 police raided Occupy Los Angeles. Five hundred armed police officers quickly entered the park out of City Hall doors. At 12:30 a.m. LAPD declared the Occupy L.A. site an unlawful assembly, and told demonstrators they had 10 minutes to clear the area or be arrested. A total of 292 people were arrested. Patrick Meighan, writer for the Fox animated sitcom Family Guy, was one of the 292 arrests made on November 29. He posted an account of his arrest. He also participated in an eight-part YouTube interview chronicling, in more detail, his experience the night of the raid. Patrick Meighan's account alleges police destruction of personal property, use of excessive force, and use of force to produce reactions that then were cited as resistance for justification of further use of force. Police destroyed tents providing shelter or medical service, which news outlets reported as garbage left behind by protesters. The officer who arrested Meighan had forced him into a painful wrist lock; when Meighan recoiled, he was thrown to the ground on his face, and then had his face ground into the pavement until he bled. In Meighan's report, he also alleges that police set high bail and then refused to accept payment of the bail or allow access to legal counsel. In his interview, he mentions a unique Los Angeles law that allegedly allows jailers to refuse bail, or refuse to process bail, at their own discretion. =Nashville, Tennessee= Occupy Nashville is an ongoing demonstration and occupation located at Legislative Plaza in Nashville, Tennessee. Special legislation attempting to oust the Occupy Nashville demonstration passed the Tennessee House of Representatives and Tennessee Senate in February 2012. On October 27 Governor Bill Haslam signed an executive order enacting a curfew at the state capitol.

On October 29, 2011 a reporter covering Occupy Nashville for the Nashville Scene was arrested with demonstrators for violating the executive-ordered curfew despite identifying himself as a member of the press. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in federal court on October 31 to halt the arrests. On November 17, U.S. District Court Judge Aleta Trauger signed an injunction barring the state from enforcing the curfew on Legislative Plaza until the court could decide whether the curfew violates protesters' constitutional rights or not. A decision is not expected until February. =Oakland, California= =Philadelphia, Pennsylvania= Occupy Philadelphia is an ongoing non-violent demonstration with an aim to overcome economic inequality, corporate greed and the influence of corporations and lobbyists on government. The protest has taken place at Dilworth Plaza, which is adjacent to Philadelphia's City Hall. =Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania= Occupy Pittsburgh is a peaceful protest and demonstration with an aim to overcome economic inequality, corporate greed and the influence of corporations and lobbyists on government.

The protests began on October 15, 2011 and drew as many as 4,000 people. The protests are ongoing, with an encampment at Mellon Green. Although the park is privately owned by BNY Mellon, it initially did not request protesters to vacate, the movement citing the \\"public space\\" provisions of the city code to justify their occupation. After BNY Mellon filed in court on December 12, 2011 to end the encampment, Occupy Pittsburgh members responded by serving notice to evict the corporation from Pittsburgh. On February 8, 2012, the movement peacefully left Mellon Green after a court order was issued. =Providence, Rhode Island= Demonstrators at Burnside Park, Providence, Rhode Island, November 19, 2011 Occupy Providence began on Saturday October 15, 2011. According to the Boston Globe, well over 1,000 demonstrators, including children and adults of various ages, peacefully marched through the capital city before setting up camp at Burnside Park in downtown Providence, RI. The march made its way through the streets of downtown Providence, pausing outside such institutions as Bank of America, Providence Place Mall, and the Statehouse. Though, their numbers have dwindled to an estimated 60‚Äì100 protesters. As of March 2012, Occupy Providence had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions. Occupy Providence is one of over 4000 \\"Occupy\\" protests across the globe to be inspired by Occupy Wall Street (which began in New York City on September 17, 2011). According to the official Statement of Purpose as published on the Occupy Providence website on October 24, 2011, participants seek socioeconomic change \\"by means of a truly democratic General Assembly.\\" The \\"Occupy\\" protests are concerned with furnishing an alternative to corporate and lobbyist-driven politics and with building \\"a society by, for, and of the people.\\" Occupy Providence is \\"non-violent, non-destructive, non- discriminatory and harassment-free\\" and prohibits all drugs and alcohol from the site of the occupation. Though a group of protesters met with Providence's Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare and other city officials on Thursday October 13, 2011, they decided to decline a city permit to inhabit Burnside Park. More than 100 tents were erected within the first week of Occupy Providence, despite some verbal pressure from city officials for a definitive exit timeline. At the outset of the demonstration, city officials showed cooperation with the Occupy participants as police cleared traffic for the October March 15 and General Assembly. No arrests or acts of violence have been reported to date. On October 24, 2011 Occupy Providence activists staged a public reading of a letter to Providence Mayor Angel Taveras. The letter, made audible using the human microphone system, thanked the Mayor for his cooperation thus far and requested that the protest be allowed to carry on in Burnside Park. Many Occupy Providence participants that have been interviewed by the press state having no intention of leaving the park, while others are considering moving to another location. On October 26, 2011 the Boston Globe reported Steven Pare's announcement that the city will consider taking legal action if protesters refuse to end the encampment. Pare cited concern for public health and safety and an ordinance prohibiting use of public parks past 9pm as grounds for action. =Rochester, New York= The Occupy Rochester NY encampment is located in Washington Square Park, Rochester, New York.\\"New York Civil Liberties Union steps up for Occupy Rochester.\\" Daily Record [Rochester, NY] 3 Nov. 2011.

It is one of several \\"Occupy\\" protest sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Other sites include Occupy San Jose and Occupy Oakland. On September 17, 2011, a small group of about 10 protesters set up camp in front of a Bank of America building in the Financial District. The protesters moved to Union Square for one day then relocated to the entrance to the Federal Reserve Building on September 29, 2011 where they set up tents, sleeping bags, and tarps. On October 7, 2011, the encampment consisting of tents, cooking gear, and other belongings was dismantled and taken away by the San Francisco police and city workers because it posed a public safety risk. One protester was arrested. The protesters, however, remained at the Federal Reserve site. An additional protest site was set up at Justin Herman Plaza on the evening of October 15, 2011. The San Francisco police and city workers dismantled the camp the next evening because it was in violation of city codes. Five protesters were arrested. The camp was rebuilt the next day, on October 17, 2011. Protesters attended the San Francisco Police Commission meeting on October 19, 2011, to protest their treatment on October 15. An initially contentious meeting ended when Police Chief Greg Suhr told the protesters that he is working with Mayor Ed Lee to provide port-a-potties and hand washing stations at Justin Herman Plaza. Police raided a section of the Occupy San Francisco camp in the early hours of November 16, dismantling 15 tents which formed an overspill from the main encampment in Justin Herman Plaza and arresting seven people. On November 16, hundreds of demonstrators, many of whom were California college students, marched through downtown San Francisco to protest the continuing tuition and fee hikes proposed and approved by the University of California Regents. Along the way, about 200 demonstrators staged a sit-in at a Bank of America branch. The bank was chosen because UC Regent Monica Lozano is on the bank's board of directors. Some demonstrators jumped on desks and wrote on the wall in chalk. One man was seen urinating in the corner. Roughly 100 demonstrators remained in the branch, set up a tent, sat down, and linked arms. 95 demonstrators were arrested for trespassing.San Francisco police arrest 100 in Bank of America protest, Los Angeles Times, November 17, 2011 The main encampment at Justin Herman Plaza was dismantled following a raid at approximately 1:00am on December 7. Seventy protesters were arrested on suspicion of illegal lodging in a public park. The site retained a police presence for several days, with signs posted stating the park was closed for renovation. Crowds swelled at the original protest site, outside the Federal Reserve building, and on December 8 it had developed into an encampment. The site continued to grow until Sunday, December 11, when police dismantled the encampment and arrested 55 protesters in the process. In January 2012, a few members of Occupy San Francisco stated they will be submitting an application with the California Department of Financial Institutions to charter a credit union. The credit union, to be named People's Reserve Credit Union, will follow the pattern of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh with low interest rate loans being granted to those people who generally do not qualify for credit. San Francisco Board of Supervisors member and mayoral candidate John Avalos has visited the Federal Reserve site and said of the October 7, 2011 camp dismantling: \\"With our unemployment rate nearing 10 percent, we have a responsibility to be a sanctuary for the 99 percent. Instead, last night we witnessed that 99 percent being detained, arrested and intimidated with force.\\" On October 27, 2011 the police massed at the Potrero Hill substation and planned a raid, under orders from the Mayor to clean up perceived health issues. Members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (the legislative branch of San Francisco) stood in solidarity with the Occupy San Francisco movement, and the police canceled their raid. The first march took place on September 29, 2011. On Wednesday, October 5, 2011, hundreds of people participated in a mid-day march from the Federal Reserve protest site to Civic Center Plaza. =San Diego, California= Occupy San Diego was located at the Civic Center in downtown San Diego, California. According to authorities, it had \\"a growing problem with violence and mounting trash\\". However this assertion was disputed by protesters and eyewitnesses, since Occupy protesters have been actively cleaning the site since October 2011. On November 30, protesters clashed with police as protesters set up a voter registration table. The day before, San Diego police arrested former democratic congressional candidate Ray Lutz for setting up a similar voting registration table, Lutz cited a California Supreme Court ruling which in part states that people are allowed to register voters, even on private property. Nine protesters were arrested on December 5, 2011, including one who had to be removed from a tree. On December 12, Occupy San Diego protesters joined with other occupy movements across the west coast in an attempt to shut down the ports in San Diego. About one-hundred people showed up to the event, and four people were arrested. Three protesters were arrested on December 22 while they were in their sleeping bags, a fourth man was arrested for recording the police activity with a camera. This brought the total number of arrests related to the movement in San Diego to 139. =San Jose, California= Occupy San Jos√© is located in City Hall Plaza in San Jose, CA. The demonstration was inspired by Occupy Wall Street and is part of the larger \\"Occupy\\" protest movement. The aim of the demonstration was to begin a sustained occupation in downtown San Jos√©, the 10th largest city in the United States, to protest perceived corporate greed and social inequality, including opposing corporate influence in U.S. politics, the influence of money and corporations on democracy and a lack of legal and political repercussions for the global financial crisis. =Seattle, Washington= Occupy Seattle was located at Westlake Park and Seattle City Hall in downtown Seattle, Washington. The protest, like the one in New York, is against wealth inequality, perceived corporate greed, and corruption in the banking and economic systems in the United States. Occupy Seattle began with a demonstration at the Federal Building in downtown Seattle on September 26, 2011. The movement then relocated to Westlake Park on October 1, 2011. In doing so, the movement began to grow into its own. At first, Westlake was mostly used as a gathering site. Small groups of 20 to 30 people remained overnight, but, the majority of the work still took place during the day. In time, the agenda of the day activities was expanded and organized to fashion a direct democracy led by a General Assembly and supported by work groups. Concern among some movement members about the feasibility of remaining at Westlake indefinitely, lead some members of the movement to take The Mayor up on his offer to camp at City Hall. The Westlake Camp was forced out of the park on the morning of October 17. Several efforts over the following weeks were made to retake the Westlake Location. However, those trying to retake Westlake were met with continuous harassment by the Seattle Police Department. Although City Hall was complete with power, security guards and relatively free from SPD harassment, many members of the movement felt that City Hall wasn't a sufficient main camp site due to decreased exposure to the mainstream populace. The limited space and terms of the permit, put a tremendous amount of pressure on those camping at City Hall. This came to a boiling point in late October/early November causing many occupiers to depart the site. Seattle Central Community College (SCCC) was established on October 29, 2011 and the nightly General Assembly moved to SCCC on November 4, 2011. The SCCC Camp was evicted on December 9 and much of the movement has moved indoors, in backyards of supporters, and several mini- occupies remain throughout the city. Some facilities and camping are also located at Seattle City Hall which continue on to this date. General Assemblies have been relocated to Washington Trade and Convention Center at 7pm on Tues, Wed, Fri and Sunday. According to a news report, the City of Seattle has spent an extra $104,869 as of October 14, 2011 in response to the protest for overtime pay for police and parks & recreation personnel.Thompson, Lynn (October 19, 2011.) \\"Occupy Seattle has cost city $105K so far.\\" The Seattle Times. Accessed October 2011. Police overtime pay comprised the majority of overtime expenses at $97,200. Ten protesters were arrested for obstructing the police on the evening of October 13 after refusing to vacate Westlake Park after it had closed. On October 15, the Occupy Seattle movement had its largest demonstration to date, with over 3,000 people rallying in Westlake Park.(October 17, 2011.) \\"Arrests after Occupy Seattle defies eviction.\\" CBS News. Accessed October 2011. On the morning of October 17, 2011, Seattle police informed campers at Westlake Park that tents had to be removed for city personnel to clean the park. It was reported that during this incident six demonstrators who didn't comply with the order were arrested. The city of Seattle issued permits for Occupy Seattle on October 18, 2011, which limits camping at Westlake Park and enforces the park's closure at 10:00 PM.(October 20, 2011.) \\"City issues permits for Occupy Seattle.\\" The Herald. Accessed October 2011. Another permit for protests occurring at Seattle's city hall plaza allows camping with the stipulation that tents are to be deconstructed by 7:00 AM. It was reported that police are enforcing a rule in Westlake Park in which umbrellas are only allowed to be used while being held, and are not allowed to be used as tent-like shelters. Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Harvard Law School who has called for a Second Constitutional Convention, praised the Occupy Seattle website for having an excellent design but felt there were too many demands listed, although he agreed that the demands needed to be addressed by Congress. Lessig felt that substantive reform begins with clarity of focus in an effort to find common ground with reformers from different parts of the political spectrum: On November 2, Occupy Seattle protesters demonstrated at a Chase Bank on 12th Ave, the demonstration was a reaction to Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's visit to Seattle. At 3:00 five protesters entered the bank and linked together via chain and pieces of PVC and facing out from the tellers. In addition about a dozen demonstrators sat in front of the police van to prevent it from moving and were eventually pulled away. After being warned to leave the bank Seattle Police arrested the demonstrators. During the demonstration ten police officers were physically assaulted by protesters, one officer was struck with an empty beer bottle, two suffered minor injuries. Pepper spray was used to provide cover for the officers under attack and disperse the assailiants.\\"SPD Blotter November 2nd 2001\\" On November 15, a march commenced from the Seattle Central Community College campus to Belltown. At one point during the march a 17-year-old female swung a stick at an officer. After officers moved in to arrest the female the officers were hindered in their efforts, after issuing an order to disperse the officers deployed pepper spray to move subjects away from them so they could arrest the female suspect.\\"SPD Blotter November 15th 2011\\" Police were filmed spraying the crowd of people with pepper spray. It was reported that the victims included \\"a 4-foot 10-inch, 84-year-old woman, a priest and a woman, Jennifer Fox, who claimed the pepper spray led to a miscarriage.\\"\\"Huffington Post November 16th 2011\\" The 84-year-old woman, Dorli Rainey, is a former mayoral candidate and retired school teacher who has been active in City government on education and transportation issues since the 1960s. That night, Rainey was en route to City Hall to attend a scheduled meeting of the Seattle City Council's Transportation Committee.\\"The Stranger Slog November 15th 2011\\" Rainey had served on the school board, and in the 1970s ran for a seat on King County Council. In 2009, Rainey, then 82 years old, made a brief run for Seattle Mayor before withdrawing from the race citing her age: \\"I am old and should learn to be old, stay home, watch TV and sit still.\\" However, regarding the possible miscarriage by Jennifer Fox, doubts have been cast on the truth of her claim.\\"The Seattle Times November 23rd 2011\\"Stranger Slog \\"November 22nd 2011\\" Dorli Rainey was notably photographed as she was being carried away by friends after having been hit with the police's chemical spray.\\"The Atlantic Wire November 2011\\" The demonstration's goal was advertised to \\"disrupt Wall Street on the waterfront\\" and in solidarity with Truck Driver and Longshoremens unions. The Occupy Seattle movement was not well received by Maritime Unions, Robert McEllrath President of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union said \\"Support is one thing, organization from outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda is quite another and one that is destructive to our democratic process.\\" However, port truckers across the nation indicated their solidarity with the day of port shut-downs, signaling their own poor working conditions. On December 10, at 1:30, an estimated 400 Occupy Seattle Demonstrators left Westlake Park along 2nd Ave as part of a larger effort to shut down West Coast ports. After reaching Terminal 18 protesters divided themselves into different zones; red, yellow, and green differentiating the likelihood of arrest. The demonstrators blocked traffic to Spokane Street in both directions. The protesters then took multiple sections of fencing and dragged it across the roadway leading to the terminal gate. There allegedly were numerous dispersal orders were given to the marchers, however police alleged demonstrators pulled more fencing into the roadway and began throwing burning flares, bags of bricks, and bags of paint, rebar and other debris at the police officers and police horses monitoring the demonstration. Eleven adults were arrested for various violations including Failure to Disperse, Obstructing and Assaulting an Officer. Nine were released on own recognizance while two were held overnight for felony assault on an officer. =St. Louis, Missouri= Occupy St. Louis (OccupySTL) began on October 1, 2011, as a protest against corporate greed, its influence over the economy, its corruption of government, and ensuing inequality. Although people possess differing viewpoints and diversity of views is a central tenet, commonly held themes seek an equal playing field in the economy with more equal opportunities for all people as well as accountability for corporate and financial malfeasance. Many of those in the movement argue that structural, systemic change is necessary and that incremental reform is insufficient and in any case not possible without popular countervailing power to the power of moneyed interests. It is located at Kiener Plaza in downtown St. Louis near an area which includes many financial institutions such as commercial banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Occupy St. Louis consists of concerned citizens and individuals from many different ideologies and backgrounds whom wish to address economic and political issues. It uses consensus decision- making and is a horizontal organization utilizing facilitators in lieu of leaders and has no official spokesperson. The encampment has consisted of more than fifty tents with a couple hundred continuous occupiers and many hundreds more activists. Several families occupied the space long term. The demographics consist of people from a large racial, gender, and political mix, many people of various ages and class backgrounds, laborers, professionals, large numbers of both employed and unemployed, the underemployed, military veterans, students and teachers, some homeless, as well as those of diverse sexual orientations. People have joined from some distance around the region in addition to the city and metropolitan areas. With the exceptions of views promoting violence or hatred, Occupy St. Louis is open to all political beliefs with Democrats, Republicans, independents, Greens, liberals, progressives, conservatives, libertarians, socialists, anarchists, communists, and the previously nonpolitical, among others, represented among those in the movement. Actions held by Occupy St. Louis include the occupation of Kiener Plaza, civil disobedience, demonstrations, protest marches, and picketing. OccupySTL has acted in solidarity with at least two strike actions and walkouts and has been supported by various trade unions and many individual unionists from the region. OccupySTL is participating in moving money from large commercial retail banks (in particular, Bank of America) to local credit unions or community oriented banks. It participated in Bank Transfer Day on November 5, 2011. It has called boycotts, supported buy local campaigns, organized mic checks and flash mobs at area stores on Black Friday, and participated in food drives. It cosponsored a \\"Green Friday\\" festival with barter trading, a fair trade market, arts and crafts workshops, live music, and roundtable discussions as a sustainable alternative to Black Friday.Green Friday ‚Äì A Sustainable Alternative to Black Friday OccupySTL has also supported and directly assisted a number of families unfairly foreclosed upon. A large rally and march in alliance with area unions held on October 14 attracted around 1000 people. OccupySTL participated in a rally and march as part of the November 17 Day of Action across the United States and world. This was in conjunction with the Occupy movement as well as local unions, MoveOn.org, and PROMO, among other organizations participating but not necessarily intercoordinating. Approximately 1,000 people marched from Kiener Plaza to the Martin Luther King Bridge, passing by various financial institutions and the regional Federal Reserve Bank before 14 were arrested for blocking traffic on one onramp of the bridge to highlight neglect of infrastructure and jobs. Banners were also unveiled on area overpasses. There are educational efforts such as daily teach-ins from a variety of organizations. A food tent was established to feed occupiers (as well as some of the city homeless). An on-site library of pamphlets, periodicals, and books has also operated. An interfaith was established by two chaplains, creating a space for interfaith worship, discussion, and fellowship. Occupy St. Louis initially faced a small number of citations and arrests for violation of the curfew at Kiener Plaza, a city park. Thereafter until November 11, however, the response from the St. Louis Police Department and Mayor Francis G. Slay had been relatively less repressive than that of many other cities and there were no large scale arrests, raids, or police violence. The mayor eventually blogged and city officials indicated to the media a list of violations, which was challenged by OccupySTL, as well as an ultimatum that occupiers vacate the plaza after curfew and remove all tents. After 11 pm on Veterans Day, the St. Louis police faced a crowd of about 400 to raid the plaza, arresting approximately 27, and confiscating (with the city parks department) the materials of occupiers left on site. Although there was no rough treatment of people by the police, some of these materials were thrown into garbage trucks and crushed despite explicit assurances that all items would be bagged and tagged for later retrieval by owners. OccupySTL marched in solidarity with the Veterans Day march earlier in the day but its activists challenged pervasive neglect of veterans. Since the Veterans Days eviction, Kiener Plaza has been continuously patrolled by park rangers and the city police who have strictly enforced the ban on tents and the 10 pm-6 am curfew. A preliminary injunction filed pro bono on behalf of Occupy St. Louis to cease enforcement of the curfew by arguing violation of First Amendment speech rights was denied in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. =Washington, D.C.= Occupy DC march of October 9, 2011 Occupy D.C. is a non-partisan occupation of public space in Washington, D.C. based at McPherson Square. The group has been demonstrating in McPherson Square since October 1, 2011, and in Freedom Plaza since October 6. Despite crackdowns on other Occupy projects across the country, federal authorities claimed on November 15 that they have no plans to clear McPherson Square Park. The National Park Service decided against eviction after meeting with activists and discussing health and safety conditions. As of January 31, the Occupiers remain in McPherson Square and Freedom Plaza, despite the National Park Service's ban, which went into effect at 12pm on January 30, 2012. Federal judge James Boasberg heard arguments on January 31 to determine whether or not to uphold the ban. According to occupyfreedomplaza.org , the movement contends that \\"money is not speech, corporations are not people, only people have Constitutional rights,\\" demanding the shift of power from the wealthiest 1% of Americans to the underrepresented 99%. The \\"Declaration of Occupy D.C.\\", released by the General Assembly of Occupy D.C. on November 30, 2011, provides a list of the group's grievances. The rat population has \\"exploded\\" around the Occupy D.C. camps at Freedom Plaza and McPherson Square. Washington D.C. Department of Health director Mohammad Akhter inspected the camps and said, \\"it's no different than refugee camps\\". Higher education Occupy movements have taken place on college campuses across the United States. UC Berkeley, UC Davis, San Francisco State University, UC Irvine,[\\"http://www.newuniversity.org/2011/11/news/23976/] November 8, 2011. Retrieved November 10, 2011. and Occupy Harvard are some institutions of higher education that have held occupations in support of the Occupy movement. Occupy Texas State at Texas State University is one of the first to form amount universities and colleges in Texas and is one of the largest with fifty dedicated members. Saint Mary's College of California held teach-ins to educate students on the Occupy movement and encourage them to get involved. Public opinion polls An October 12‚Äì16 poll found that 67% of New York City voters agreed with the protesters and 87% believed that they had a right to protest.Reuters (October 17, 2011) \\"New Yorkers support anti-Wall Street protests: poll\\" Reuters.com A national poll conducted by Public Policy Polling released on October 13, 2011 show 45% of Americans opposing the movement and 33% favoring it. A Siena poll of New York released on show of November 15s that two-thirds of New Yorkers do not believe that the movement represents \\"the 99%\\". Criticism Apart from dismissals by the Right, there have also been appreciative criticism from leftist scholars. One such critique concerns itself with the way in which the Occupy movement has focused its demands around a narrowly modern understanding of freedom that differs little from the claims of mainstream liberal pluralism: International activists involved in the Occupy Movement have seen it stall due a lack of synergy to work with other alternative movements calling for change. The biggest criticism is that the movement is without depth, without a lasting vision of an alternative future. Remarks from Occupy Wall Street participant Justine Tunney, a Google software engineer, who called on President Obama to appoint Eric Schmidt \\"CEO of America\\", have also sparked criticism, including from the vast majority of other Occupy participants, many of whom have observed that her politics are inconsistent with horizontalism. Many Occupy Wall Street protests have included anti-zionist and anti semitic slogans and signage such as \\"Jews control Wall Street\\" or \\"Zionist Jews who are running the big banks and the Federal Reserve\\". As a result, the Occupy Wall Street Movement has been consistently confronted with accusations of anti-Semitism. Impact on US Politics U.S. Presidential Candidate Buddy Roemer made headlines by becoming the first candidate to vocally support the Occupy Movement. Several of the Occupy Movement demands were already in line with President Barack Obama's view, such as not outsourcing American jobs, ending tax breaks for the super- wealthy, health care for all, and filling tax loopholes that permit individuals and companies from paying their fair share of taxes. Libertarian presidential candidate Carl E. Person has also reached out to the movement. In a 2011 interview on Fox News Sunday, Democratic Party chairperson Howard Dean stated that the occupy movement has \\"changed the dialogue\\" in terms of American politics. He remarked, \\"most people in this country believe now that there's 1 percent that has a lot and a 99 percent that gets treated not so well.\\" In April 2012, the Occupy movement in the U.S. evolved plans for the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida starting August 27 and the September 3, 2012 Democratic National Convention involving Occupy Charlotte.Occupy Movement Looks Toward Political Conventions April 23, 2012 IRS Documents obtained by Bloomberg News showed that \\"occupy\\" was one of the terms that appeared on versions of \\"be-on-the-lookout\\" lists used by IRS employees.

Judgment  The court held that the furniture was indeed subject to the lessor's tacit hypothec. Had Jacksons taken reasonable steps to protect its property and to enquire as to its whereabouts, and as to where the purchaser was living, it could not have failed to obtain the necessary information, enabling it to give due notice to the new landlord. It had ample time to do this; under the circumstances, the inevitable inference was that the company had impliedly consented to the furniture's being subject to the tacit hypothec of the landlord. The furniture, therefore, had rightly been attached in execution.

The plant will become a museum after a seismic refit of the building.  Olmsted Station Power House * Off U.S. Highway 189 * Provo, Utah  The Olmsted Station Power House was built in 1904, by L. L. Nunn and his brother and chief engineer, P. N. Nunn. The plant received its name in honor of Fay Devaux Olmsted, who played a key role in helping the Nunn brothers design the plant, contracted and died from Tuberculosis before the plant was completed. The plant, when running at full capacity, was able to provide twelve megawatts of power, which is enough for about 3,000 homes. Along with the Power station, these men established an institute, known as the Telluride Institute, which was home to approximately forty students. This institute was the first corporation sponsored electrical school in the U.S. and continued to operate until 1912 when Utah Power and Light Company attained the property. = History = In order to harvest the power of falling water, new technology needed to be invented. To facilitate this, the Nunn brothers worked with George Westinghouse, hoping he would be able to use falling water to power transformers, switches, and water powered generators. The Nunn brothers provided Westinghouse with a pouch of gold worth $50,000, and eventually, the technology was available so that the plant could be built and become an efficient energy source. The Olmsted power station was decommissioned in 2015. = Original Equipment = Although there have been extensions to the original equipment in both 1917 and 1948, the Olmsted Station Power House still retains some original equipment. The original equipment comprises Three general Electric generators (2300 volts), Three Lambard governors, One general electric water driven exciter with Pelton wheel (125 DC volts), Nine general electric transformers (2300‚Äì44,000 volts), Nine Westinghouse oil switches, One sycrometer, and Four general electric field rheostats.

Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court tested the basic constitutional right of prison inmates‚Äô access to legal documents prior to court. Prison authorities would consequently be required to provide legal assistance and counsel to inmates, whether it be through a trained legal professional or access to a legal library. Multiple prisoners alleged that they were denied access to the courts due to lack of an adequate legal library and assistance with court related documents.  Background  The case of Bound v. Smith was preceded by Johnson v. Avery, a similar case brought before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1969 concerning, once again, the extent of prisoners‚Äô rights within the confines of a jail or penitentiary. Johnson v. Avery involved a Tennessee convict who petitioned the courts regarding the prison's disciplinary action exacted on the inmate after breaking a prison rule. The rule states, \\"No inmate will advise, assist or otherwise contract to aid another, either with or without a fee, to prepare Writs or other legal matters. It is not intended that an innocent man be punished. When a man believes he is unlawfully held or illegally convicted, he should prepare a brief or state his complaint in letter form and address it to his lawyer or a judge. A formal Writ is not necessary to receive a hearing. False charges or untrue complaints may be punished. Inmates are forbidden to set themselves up as practitioners for the purpose of promoting a business of writing Writs.\\" The Court ruled in favor of the prisoners. Johnson v. Avery established that the assistance of a prisoner by a prisoner in filing and research of legal papers related to the criminal prosecution of said prisoner was completely legal under the facts of this case. There have been many cases, similar to Bounds v. Smith, that have established reasonable precedent regarding a prisoner's access to the courts. In the case of Cochran v. Kansas of 1942, it was confirmed that prisoners have a right of access to the courts and the prohibition of this access is unconstitutional. Specifically, Cochran v. Kansas ruled in favor of a petitioner, who was a prisoner, who wished to file with the federal courts a writ of habeas corpus. Again, a similar instance preceded Bounds v. Smith. In Burns v. Ohio of 1959, the Supreme Court ruled that docket and other fees imposed on inmates were constitutional violations. By 1963, in Douglas v. California, the Court even went as far as to rule that a prisoner must be provided legal counsel if it means he will receive a ‚Äúmeaningful appeal.‚Äù Time and time again, the rulings of additional court cases have struck down hindrances obstructing the right of prisoners access to the courts. Conflict wrong the case of Bounds v. Smith, respondents of the courts are those incarcerated within the Division of Prisons of the North Carolina Department of Correction. These respondents filed three actions alleging a violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights through denial of proper avenues to bresearch. Eventually the case was heard at District Court. The courts approved the motion based on a number of valid claims made by the respondents, specifically citing the lack of an adequate prison library system reason enough for a trial. Due to precedent established in, first, Johnson v. Avery, and then Younger v. Gilmore, the courts found that equality under law had been disregarded because of a severe lack of assistance for inmates wishing to prepare legal documents. Specifically in the case of North Carolina's prison system however, the substance of valuable legal assistance was scarce and thus presented a possibly more logistical problem than argued by the respondents. The District Courts did recognize this fact. The District Court ruled that North Carolina must develop and institute a plan that provided inmates with a form of legal assistance that satisfied a degree of Constitutionality. It was suggested to Senators that they create an effective and economic plan possibly providing lawyers and other legal professionals along with the expansion of state law libraries. And so, the state responded. A proposal designed to redefine the State's legal informational system was drawn up. The establishment of seven new libraries, spread across the state, was planned, along with the creation of additional smaller libraries. Use of the libraries required an appointment. Appointments were preferentially given to those with court dates within the next month. In accordance with the fact that libraries were not always located within prisons, transportation and housing would also be provided by the State. The State then sought to create a legal library system, in accordance to what the courts determined to be ‚Äúadequate.‚Äù The revamped libraries included a vast collection of law books, type writers, and a supply of legal forms. Additionally, the State trained inmates as assistants and typists, who were made readily available to aid fellow inmates. The new library system supported about 350 prisoners per week. Despite the changes and obvious improvements, prisoners were still unsatisfied with the new library and research system. Protestors of the new plan claimed it was inadequate in that it failed to satisfy the basic legal needs of every prisoner, thus denying citizens access to the courts. Respondents demanded a library in every prison. At the level of the District Court, however, the plan was seen as not only legally adequate, but economically sustainable. With these two conditions seemingly met, the Court rejected the respondents‚Äô objections. Along with the overruling of this objection, the District Court also concluded that, constitutionally, the State was not required to provide legal assistance to prisoners. Individual legal assistance was not necessary and the furnishings of attorneys were not necessary, with such a sufficient library at hand. This was the final decision of the District Court. With the approval of the plan, the State then applied for federal aid, hoping to cover up to 90% of the costs of building and maintaining the new prison libraries. The grant that the State applied to is the Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. Under federal laws, the applicants must satisfy a set of criteria in order to receive any sort of monetary aid. The State of North Carolina's application proposed what they believed to be ‚Äúmeaningful and effective access to the court‚Ä¶‚Äù According to the evaluators, however, the proposal lacked legal assistance in women's prisons across the state and thus the case was ordered to judicial evaluation. Both the State and respondents appealed the ruling, each discontent with the Court's rulings adverse to them. The case was then brought to the Court of Appeals, who denied the plan funding and additionally ordered it be abolished. The State of North Carolina then issued a writ of certiorari. The petition was granted by the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the court. He started by establishing that the court accepted the precedent built up from previous cases and confirmed that prisoners have a right to access of the courts. He states ‚ÄúPetitioners' hyperbolic claim is particularly inappropriate in this case, for the courts below scrupulously respected the limits on their role. The District Court initially held only that petitioners had violated the \\"fundamental constitutional guarantee,\\" ibid., of access to the courts. It did not thereupon thrust itself into prison administration. Rather, it ordered petitioners themselves to devise a remedy for the violation, strongly suggesting that it would prefer a plan providing trained legal advisors. Petitioners chose to establish law libraries, however, and their plan was approved with only minimal changes over the strong objections of respondents. Prison administrators thus exercised wide discretion within the bounds of constitutional requirements in this case. The judgment is: Affirmed.‚Äù Justice Rehnquist issued the dissenting opinion. He stated, ‚ÄúThere is nothing in the United States Constitution which requires that a convict serving a term of imprisonment in a state penal institution pursuant to a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction have a \\"right of access\\" to the federal courts in order to attack his sentence... In any event, the Court's opinion today does not appear to proceed upon the guarantee of equal protection of the laws, a guarantee which at least has the merit of being found in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It proceeds instead to enunciate a \\"fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts,\\" ante, at 828, which is found nowhere in the Constitution. But if a prisoner incarcerated pursuant to a final judgment of conviction is not prevented from physical access to the federal courts in order that he may file therein petitions for relief which Congress has authorized those courts to grant, he has been accorded the only constitutional right of access to the courts that our cases have articulated in a reasoned way.‚Äù Subsequent developments In Lewis v. Casey, the court limited the application of Bounds. Justice Scalia, writing for the court, stated: \\"In other words, Bounds does not guarantee inmates the wherewithal to transform themselves into litigating engines capable of filing everything from shareholder derivative actions to slip-and-fall claims. The tools it requires to be provided are those that the inmates need in order to attack their sentences, directly or collaterally, and in order to challenge the conditions of their confinement. Impairment of any other litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental (and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration.\\"Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. at 355.

The settlement became an important bridgehead and jumping-off point for the Roman campaigns during the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. It was later incorporated into the network of imperial cities, which significantly expanded Myrtilis as an urban center. The town was raised to the status of a Municipium in times of Emperor Augustus and was connected by road to the important Roman city of Pax Iulia. During the Migration Period, M√©rtola was invaded by Germanic tribes of the Suebi and the Visigoths. In this period (5th-8th centuries) commerce was reduced but still active, as evidenced by Greek tombstones from the 6th-7th centuries found in M√©rtola, which suggests the presence of Byzantine merchants in the town. During the Umayyad hegemony in spain, Mertola became a capital city ruled by a regional governor.

It was located on the grounds of the Briarcliff Estate, the former residence of Asa G. Candler, Jr., the son of the founder of Coca-Cola. Emory and the state of Georgia jointly developed the GMHI. Emory doctors provided some of the mental health services at GMHI, and some residents and fellows received part of their training in psychiatry there. Emory also had its own pediatric psychiatric outpatient programs based at the facility. The university also had 10 faculty scientists conducting 18 research studies at GMHI, focused on mental health, brain and central nervous system diseases. At its closing it had 141 beds and a $24.5 million budget. Due to rising costs, the Georgia Department of Human Resources proposed that the hospital close. They decided that they could send GMHI patients to other hospitals nearby and use the $24.5 million budget in other community mental health services. After the institute closed, the 42 acre campus was purchased by Emory University from the state of Georgia for US $2.9 million. The university planned to turn the property into a biotechnology research and business development centre. Unofficially the campus was referred to as \\"Emory West\\", and the university considered either renovating the existing 17 buildings or constructing new ones. Plans for the second campus were scaled back after faculty expressed a desire to remain at the main campus, but the university still planned to build the EmTech Bio Sciences Center as of 2000. In 2011, three of the old GMHI buildings, at the rear of the property, were demolished. Some of the scenes for the Netflix series Stranger Things were filmed here (as the fictional Hawkins National Laboratory site). The former psychiatric hospital was also used for an episode of the tv series Star. Due to one of the woman of the singing trio being detained for a psychiatric evaluation after a drug overdose their manager organized a clandestine recording session in the psych wing of the hospital. The group was pressed for time having gotten a last hour invite to enter a song in a major musical contest.

Grimaud, 220 U.S. 506 (1911), was a case argued before the Supreme Court of the United States. The case tested the constitutionality of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, which delegated to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (a part of the Federal Executive Branch) the power to make rules and regulations regarding the use of federal Forest Service lands and to punish violations of these rules as a criminal offense. The Court ruled, after a reargument, that such a delegation of rulemaking power was permissible because it was separate from true legislative power (which is only vested in Congress as the legislative branch).. Back story For years, shepherds in California had witnessed the establishment of forest reserves over a span of roughly ten years. In this time, the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 was established after wealthy capitalists from the northeast failed to monopolize the ranching industry. As a result, it left shepherds with less and less land to let their sheep graze, and this did not sit well with many of them. Six years later, Congress enacted the Organic Act of 1897. This law ‚Äúgranted management authority to the United States Department of the Interior, then the nation‚Äôs sole custodian of the public domain. As part of this process, rangers were hired, and regulations were set for the use of these reserves‚Äô various resources. When in 1905 the United States Forest Service was established as part of the United States Department of Agriculture, and the nation's forests transferred to its care, the number of rangers increased again, the permitting process intensified, and the related rules and fees were published widely.\\"How Counting Sheep Saved the U.S. Forest Service\\"‚Äù The new rules angered the shepherds, farmers, ranchers, miners, etc. especially those who were around when the land wasn‚Äôt protected by the government. It got to a point where these members of society began to directly defy the authority of these agencies. Miners sneaked onto reserves to pan for gold, loggers secretly harvested timber, and ranchers sneaked various livestock into and out of these protected lands. The case of the United States versus Pierre Grimaud begins in what is now Oakhurst, California. Pierre was one of these agitated workers; he just wasn‚Äôt lucky enough to break the law undetected. In the early 20th- century, Pierre Grimaud ‚Äì a farmer and shepherd ‚Äì who, with his partner PJ Carajous, attempted to sneak his flock of sheep into the Sierra Forest Reserve. On his endeavor to find a good spot for his sheep to graze, he was stopped by a forest ranger who asked to see Grimaud‚Äôs permit. Once it was revealed that Grimaud did not have a permit, and was essentially trespassing, the forest ranger arrested him and took him to court. The trial(s) Pierre Grimaud‚Äôs case was determined to be more complex than a simple case of trespassing. Grimaud and his lawyer rejected the charge that Grimaud‚Äôs behavior constituted a public offense against the United States because when Congress voted in support of the relevant forest legislation and accompanying ordinances, it was acting unconstitutionally; these ‚Äúrules and regulations,‚Äù they declared, were ‚Äúan attempt by Congress to delegate its legislative power to an administrative officer.‚Äù If, as they alleged, such delegation was unconstitutional, then Grimaud could not have committed a crime because there was no crime to commit.‚Äù Since Grimaud made this a case involving constitutional law, it was eventually moved up to the Supreme Court where Grimaud was ruled guilty as tried. Grimaud‚Äôs claim was an obvious con, and the Court knew it, but constitutional law is difficult to navigate. Finally, after four years the Supreme Court (specifically Justice Joseph Rucker Lamar) unanimously agreed that Grimaud ‚Äúdid knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully pasture and graze, and cause and procure to be pastured and grazed, certain sheep (the exact number being to the grand jurors unknown) upon certain land within the limits of and a part of said Sierra Forest Reserve, without having theretofore or at any time secured or obtained a permit or any permission for said pasturing or grazing of said sheep or any part of them, as required by the said rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture‚Ä¶‚Äù Grimaud's lawyers rejected these accusations, saying that when Congress initially voted to support the relevant forest legislation, it wasn't within their constitutional rights. Congress was supposedly delegating the power that they have over government property to an unqualified ‚Äúadministrative officer,‚Äù the park ranger. If this were proven to be true, then Grimaud could not have committed a crime because there was no crime to commit. Initially, jurors didn't buy this defense, and decided that Pierre was guilty. The defense then appealed, or demurred their case, which means that the case gets turned over to the district court. After more than a year of on again off again arguments, the District Court finally ruled in favor of Grimaud, overturning the lesser court in the process. From here, the case was appealed to The Supreme Court, where the ruling was once again overturned and the final ruling said that the Forestry Act was indeed constitutional and that Pierre Grimaud had broken the law. The reason Pierre could even suggest that his being tried was unconstitutional in the first place was the final ruling in the Field v. Clark case. This case established that ‚Äúcongress cannot delegate legislative power.‚Äù. However, according to the Supreme Court, ‚Äúthe authority to make administrative rules is not a delegation of legislative power, and such rules do not become legislation because violations thereof are punished as public offenses.‚Äù Historical Significance ‚ÄúThe immediate public reaction to Grimaud adopted the same view of the case.Logan Sawyer, \\"Grazing, Grimaud, and Gifford Pinchot: How the Forest Service Overcame the Classical Nondelegation Doctrine to Establish Administrative Crimes\\", \\"University of Virginia\\"‚Äù The public, in general, agreed with the Supreme Court's decision. While some of the shepherds may have hoped for more freedom to graze, their hopes weren't very high so news of Grimaud's loss in court wasn't that unexpected. The day after the Court's decision, James Wilson said that as a result of Grimaud's case, the controversy ‚Äúregarding the right to use grazing lands within the various national forests without permit from the department of agriculture will be brought to an end.https://litigation- essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid;=1&doctype;=cite&docid;=24+J.+L.+%26+Politics+169&srctype;=smi&srcid;=3B15&key;=81c22154d87cccccde70c479cb466849‚Äù This prediction was exactly correct. In 1911, the Department of Agriculture informed Congress that ‚Äúthe uncertainty and unrest caused by the widespread impression that the [grazing] regulations were not enforceable ceased immediately.‚Äù Prior to United States v. Grimaud, shepherds and farmers in California had no real reason to fear the rangers patrolling the national forest. However, after the ruling that the rangers‚Äô power was constitutional, the shepherds and farmers respected their authority. While the case of Grimaud v. United States was only explicitly mentioned in Light v. United States (another case of trespassing forest grounds protected by the US government), it more clearly defined what Congress could do: ‚Äúit could delegate power to an agency to adopt regulations subject to criminal penalties, provided that Congress itself legislated the penalties. Moreover, because criminal sanctions are the most severe type of sanction for violating an agency regulation, there was little doubt after Grimaud that Congress could provide other types of sanctions for violating agency regulations as well. Grimaud established that Congress can delegate authority to agencies to promulgate regulations that have a variety of legal consequences ‚Äì as long as Congress itself spells out by statute what those consequences are.The Harvard Law Review Association, \\"Harvard Law Review\\", \\"Pages 301-306\\"‚Äù Before the dispute between Pierre Grimaud and the United States government, there was a gray area surrounding this aspect of the central government's power. United States v. Grimaud permanently and clearly defined the extent of their power.

Plot The plot is introduced in newspaper headlines that Fifi, Minnie Mouse's pekingese, has been dognapped, along with a description of the suspect, Peg Leg Pete. A radio transmission detailing the suspect's get-away car is heard by police officer Mickey Mouse and his sidekick Donald Duck. The pair soon see Peg Leg Pete speed by in the car and they chase after him, Mickey driving a motorcycle and Donald riding in a sidecar. Despite Pete's evasive maneuvers he is unable to escape from Mickey and Donald, and they eventually follow him to his hideout in an abandoned sawmill. Inside, Pete chains Fifi to the wall and grabs a submachine gun. Mickey and Donald follow Pete into the sawmill and hold him at gunpoint. The film is filled with various gags showing the two law men as bumbling and incompetent, yet at every turn they are able to stay ahead of Pete, but not capture him. Finally, while Mickey and Donald are standing on a log, Pete turns on a circular saw positioned to cut the log. Mickey and Donald run to stay ahead of the blade, but eventually the end of the log comes and the saw blade shakes loose and spins out of control. The blade proves a threat for all three of the characters, but eventually Pete gets his peg leg caught in the center hole and brings it to a stop. Mickey and Donald restrain him with a corset, and in the final scene Mickey and Donald march Pete off to jail with the now-free Fifi angrily barking at him.

According to the Mdawuku wa Atonga (MWATO) (formerly the Nkhata Bay Tonga Heritage) there are also significant numbers of speakers living elsewhere in Malawi and in neighbouring countries. The Tonga language of Malawi is described as \\"similar\\" to Tumbuka, and Turner's dictionary (1952)Turner, Rev. Wm. Y., Tumbuka‚ÄìTonga‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary. Hetherwick Press, Blantyre (Malawi), 1952. lists only those words which differ from the Tumbuka, with the added comment that \\"the Tonga folk, being rapid speakers, slur or elide the final syllable of many words, e.g. kulira becomes kuliya, kukura becomes kukuwa, kutoa becomes kuto‚Äô.\\" Tonga (Nyasa), i.e. Malawian Tonga, is grouped in the Glottolog classification along with Tumbuka in a single group. Malawian Tonga is classified by Guthrie as being in Zone N15, whereas the Zambian Tonga is classified as Zone M64 and can thus be considered a different language. alt= Tones The Tonga language is tonal, with underlying tones High and non-High. Unlike Tumbuka, the high tones are not confined to the penultimate syllable of the word, but can be found in different places in different words.Mtenje, A.D. (1994) \\"Tone in Malawian Tonga verbs\\". Journal of Humanities, Nos 8/9, 1994/5. Most verb roots in Tonga are toneless, although there are a few such as bangul√° \\"shout\\" or sambil√° \\"learn/swim\\" which have a tone on the final syllable of the stem. When a tone is final, as in the verb bangul√° \\"shout\\", it tends to spread backwards to the penultimate syllable, giving the result bang«îl√° (where «î represents a rising tone). Tenses Some of the Chitonga tenses are formed as follows: Present habitual or continuous: * nd√≠vina ‚Äì I am dancing (root -vin-) Monosyllabic verbs or verbs starting with a vowel add -t(√∫)- in this tense: * nditurgha ‚Äì I eat, I am eating (root -ly-) * ndit√©nda ‚Äì I am walking/travelling (root -end-) Present Perfect * ndavina - I have danced * ndargha - I have eaten * ndayenda - I have walked Past simple: * ndinguv√≠na ‚Äì I danced * ndingurgha ‚Äì I ate * ndingwenda ‚Äì I walked Past habitual: * ndav√≠nanga ‚Äì I was dancing or I used to dance *ndarghanga ‚Äì I was eating or I used to eat *ndayendanga ‚Äì I was walking or I used to walk Simple Future: * nd√≠vinengi ‚Äì I will dance *ndirghengi ‚Äì I will eat *ndiyendengi ‚Äì I will walk An example of Tonga An example of a folktale in Tonga, Tumbuka and other languages of Northern Malawi is given in the Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi carried out by the Centre for Language Studies of the University of Malawi.Language Mapping Survey, p. 60-64. The Chitonga version goes as follows: (Translation: THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE Tortoise went to beg food from people. To carry his bag, he tied it to a long string and wore it round his neck. As he walked along, the bag was coming behind him. When he was on his way, Hare came up behind him and said, \\"I've found it, my bag!\\" Tortoise said \\"No, you're lying, see this string I've tied now I'm pulling it as I go.\\" Hare refused to accept this and said \\"Let's go the Court, it will judge us.\\" The Court examined the case and cut Tortoise's string which he'd tied the bag with. They took that bag and gave it to Hare. Another day when Hare was walking along, Tortoise found him and said, \\"I've got my tail!\\" Hare said, \\"Nonsense, this is my tail, Tortoise.\\" Tortoise refused to accept this and said, \\"What I've got is mine.\\" They went to the Court so that it could make a judgement. In that Court, the case went in Tortoise's favour. They cut off Hare's tail and gave it to Tortoise.) (The Tumbuka version of this story can be found for comparison in the article Tumbuka language#An example of Tumbuka.)

The tongue is meanwhile kept in velar vowel position as for [u] and these fricatives therefore inherently possess a u-glide, which is noticeable when they are used with any other vowel than u.\\" The 'concomitant lip frication' is evidently something like that of [f] and [v]. Doke transcribed these sounds simply . Lundwe and Kafwe Twa have a palato-glottal fricative . \\"This sound is produced with a tongue position similar to Ila but with considerable voiced frication in the throat at the same time.\\" Tonality and stress Tone is demonstrated by contrasting aze with high pitch on the first syllable ( = \\"with him\\") with aze with high pitch on the second syllable (= \\"he also\\").

Ideophones or imitation words Words in English such as \\"Splash!\\", \\"Gurgle\\", \\"Ker-putt\\" express ideas without the use of sentences. Smith and Dale point out that this kind of expression is very common in the Ila language: You may say Ndamuchina anshi (\\"I throw him down\\"), but it is much easier and more trenchant to say simply Ti!, and it means the same.Smith & Dale, volume 2, page 293. Some examples: * Muntu wawa - A person falls * Wawa mba - falls headlong * Mba! - He falls headlong * Mbo! mbo! mbo! mb√≤! - (with lowered intonation on the last syllable) He falls gradually * Mbwa! - flopping down, as in a chair * Wa! wa! wa! wa!- The rain is pattering * Pididi! pididi! pididi! - of a tortoise, falling over and over from a great height * Ndamuchina anshi - I throw him down * Ti! - ditto * Te! - torn, ripped * Amana te! - The matter's finished * To-o! - So peaceful! * Wi! - All is calm * Ne-e! - All is calm * Tuh! - a gun going off * Pi! - Phew, it's hot! * Lu! - Yuck, it's bitter! * Lu-u! - Erh, it's sour! * Lwe! - Yum, sweet! * Mbi! - It's dark * Mbi! mbi! mbi! mbi! - It's utterly dark * Sekw√® sekw√®! - the flying of a goose * nachisekwe - a goose Class prefixes As in many other languages, Ila uses a system of noun classes.

Thus: * Mung'anda mulashia - The inside of the house is dark. * Kung'anda kulashia - Around the house it is dark. * Ang'anda alashia - Darkness is upon the house. The Ila verb system The root is the part of the verb giving the primary meaning. To this can be added prefixes and suffixes: many elements can be united in this way, sometimes producing long and complex polysyllabic verb words. For example, from the root anga, \\"to tie\\", we can derive such a form as Tamuna kubaangulwila anzhyi? meaning, \\"Why have you still not untied them?\\" Prefixes can show: * tense * subject * object * voice (exceptional) Suffixes can show: * voice * tense (exceptional) * mood Here are some of the forms of the verb kubona, \\"to see\\". (Note that there are also negative forms, e.g. ta-tu-boni, \\"we do not see\\", that there is also a subjunctive mood, a conditional mood, a jussive mood and the imperative. Many subjunctive forms end in -e. The root of the verb is in two forms: * (i) simple stem: bona : code - SS * (ii) modified stem: bwene : code ‚Ç¥ * -SS tubona we (who) see * -‚Çµ tubwene we (who) have seen * -A-SS twabona we saw, see, have seen * -A-CHI-SS twachibona we continue seeing * -A-YA-BU-SS twayabubona we are engaged in seeing * -DI-MU-KU-SS tudmukubona we are seeing * -CHI-SS tuchibona we continue to see * -LA-SS tulabona we are constantly (usually, certainly) seeing * -LA-YA-BU-SS tulayabubona we are being engaged in seeing * -LA-YA-KU-SS tulayakubona we are habitually in the act of seeing * -DI-‚Çµ tulibwene we have seen * -CHI-‚Çµ tuchibwene we have been seeing * -A-KA-SS twakabona we saw * -A-KA-CHI-SS twakachibona we continued seeing * -A-KA-YA-BU-SS twakayabubona we were engaged in seeing * KA-SS katubona (Notice the position of tu here) we saw * KA-‚Çµ katubwene we did see * -A-KU-SS twakubona we were seeing * -A-KU-CHI-SS twakuchibona we were continuing to see * -A-KU-YA-BU-SS twakuyabubona we were engaged in seeing * -A-KU-‚Çµ twakubwene we had seen * -KA-LA-SS tukalabona we shall soon see * -KA- LA-CHI-SS tukalachibona we shall continue seeing * -KA-LA-YA-BU-SS tukalayabubona we shall be engaged in seeing The above English renderings are approximate. Certain suffixes add new dimensions of meaning to the root. Although these follow some logic, we again have to feel a way towards an adequate translation into English or any other language: * simple verb: bona - to see * relative or dative form: -ila, -ela, -ina, -ena: bonena - to see to, for somebody, and so on * extended relative: ilila, -elela, -inina, enena: bonenena - to see to, for somebody, etc. ililila - to go right away * causative: -ya + many sound changes: chisha - to cause to do, from chita - to do * capable, \\"-able\\": -ika, -eka: chitika - to be do-able * passive: -wa: chitwa - to be done * middle (a kind of reflexive that acts upon oneself - compare Greek): -uka: anduka - to be in a split position, from andulwa- to be split by somebody * stative; in fixed constructions only: -ama: lulama - to be straight; kotama - to be bowed * extensive: -ula: sandula - turn over; andula - split up * extensive, with the sense of \\"keep on doing\\": -aula: andaula - chop up firewood * equivalent of English prefix \\"re-\\": -ulula: ululula - to trade something over and over again, from ula - to trade * or the equivalent of the English prefix \\"un-\\", also: -ulula: ambulula - to unsay, to retract * reflexive - a prefix this time - di- : dianga - to tie oneself, from anga - to tie; dipa - to give to each other, from pa - to give * reciprocal: -ana: bonana - to see each other * intensive: -isha: angisha - to tie tightly * reduplicative: - keep on turning aside, from ambuka - to turn aside These can be used in composites: e.g. langilizhya - to cause to look on behalf of. Oral literature A text given by Smith and Dale, Sulwe Mbwakatizha Muzovu (\\"How Mr. Hare managed to scare Mr. Elephant\\") presents what might be called a \\"classical fabliau\\", with animals talking like people, just as in the Fables of Aesop or the Brer Rabbit stories in the African Diaspora.Joel Chandler Harris, Uncle Remus, or , Mr. Fox, Mr. Rabbit, and Mr. Terrapin, George Routledge, London, circa 1888. Is it fanciful to see the model for the mischievous, resourceful Brer Rabbit in the Sulwe of this story? It seems that slaves destined for the southern United States were captured and purchased in this area of Zambia.Smith & Dale, volume 1, page 39.Hugh Thomas, The Slave Trade: The History of the Atlantic Slave trade 1440-1870, Picador, London, 1997. page 706: \\"From...Ambriz and Benguela...500,000 slaves were probably shipped during the...era 1800-1830;...and...over 600,000 may have been shipped after 1830...\\" There is at least a statistical possibility that the Brer Rabbit cycle, with its use of ideophones or sound imitations, had an origin in the Ila language.

Content  The epistle's author writes to a Christian monastic community of men and women who have fallen into sin by having sexual relations with one another. The first portion of the epistle addresses the Christian woman as \\"virgin\\" while most of the remainder is addressed to the Christian man. Pseudo-Titus reminds his audience of their fear of eternal punishment as mentioned in the Book of Revelation as a means to deter the ascetic away from sensual temptation and sexual immortality. Pseudo-Titus gives ample citations and exegeses in support of strict celibacy, usually citing Paul first in a series of citations. The epistle reveals to its reader that the women serve the ascetic men in the monastic community. Pseudo- Titus suggests that since the men cannot behave righteously in the presence of their ascetic female members, that they ought to seclude themselves into a monastic community of their own. In support of this argument, Pseudo-Titus gives the illustration of the story of Susanna and the Elders, which exemplifies the Jewish elders who also could not practice chastity in the presence of women.

The line of Hadrian's Wall passes a couple of miles south of Scaleby.  Population  Scaleby has seen a significant decrease in population since the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th Century's. In the 1821 Census report the population of Scaleby was 618 compared to 2001 when this figure was a significantly lower 349.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data;_cube=N_TOT_POP&u;_id=10012120&c;_id=10001043&add;=N As Britain moved away from its traditionally agricultural industry Scaleby's population decreased simultaneously. The parish was always agriculturally based with peat once dug in the area http://www.thecumbriadirectory.com/Town_or_Village/location.php?url=scaleby and without the demand for primary products the village became unsustainable. In the 1831 Census report the three dominant industries in Scaleby were; Retail and Handicrafts; Agricultural Laborers and Non-Agricultural Laborers.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_IND&data;_cube=N_OCC_PAR1831&u;_id=10012120&c;_id=10001043&add;=Y It was due to this that Scaleby saw the level of migration it did. Workers were plying their trade elsewhere. More recently there has been far smaller variance in population. In the previous 20 years there had been an increase of 3% http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_rate_page.jsp?u_id=10012120&c;_id=10001043&data;_theme=T_POP&id;=2 and even more recently; the previous 10 years there has been a decrease of roughly 1%.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_rate_page.jsp?u_id=10012120&c;_id=10001043&data;_theme=T_POP&id;=1 Scaleby also experienced a decline in housing between 1850 and 1930, decreasing from 122 to 87 showing again how this small villages economy struggled to get out of decline it found itself in. With the vast amounts of farmland available in the 3464 acres that spans Scaleby-East and Scaleby-West agriculture remains the number one industry for this struggling parish.  History  Scaleby differs from many other villages, it is traditionally a parish and therefore is a district with only one church and one priest. This church is the Church of All Saints, an early 13th-century Church of England edifice with a 14th-century tower. It's a grade II listed English Heritage building with blocks of dressed red sandstone that are thought to be from the nearby Hadrian's Wall. This has many stunning features from the original round arch entrance to the white marble plaques to members of the Fawcett and Farrer families; therefore due to its sublime appearance and extreme importance it would be expected to be the hub of the parish village. However, just 0.5 miles from the centre of Scaleby is Scaleby Castle. A grade I English Heritage building that isn't open to the public. Scaleby Castle boasts a long and illustrious history, in reality making it the closest building to making Scaleby well known. It is unknown exactly when Scaleby Castle was built as it did not originate as a castle. The first recorded information about the castle is that it was granted to Richard de Talliol by Henry I at some point between 1100 and 1135. After many years of building and repairs it was declared a castle in 1367. The Castle continued to struggle with decay into the 1500s until Sir Richard Musgrave restored it. In 1645 the Castle was damaged by parliamentary troops. It remained ruinous from 1772 until the final restoration took place in the early 1800s. The Castle still stands today although there are still signs of what the building has been through with the three stories above the basement vault remaining ruined. This remains the main attraction to Scaleby, the moat flowing right around the Castle is another key feature contributing to the stunning appearance of the castle.  Scaleby today  Today Scaleby is home to 349 people of which 183 are males and 166 are females.http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b;=793023&c;=Scaleby&d;=16&e;=15&g;=432267&i;=1001x1003x1004&o;=1&m;=0&r;=1&s;=1336489180132&enc;=1&ds; Of the 259 members of the population 192 are economically active. This shows that there is wealth within Scaleby. Looking further into this, the number of people employed in service industries is 130, whereas there are only 66 people working in 'extractive and manufacturing industries'. This shows that Scaleby is beginning to move away from its traditional agricultural society and people are working in Hotel and Catering, Real Estate, Health and Social work.http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b;=793023&c;=Scaleby&d;=16&e;=15&g;=432267&i;=1001x1003x1004&o;=1&m;=0&r;=1&s;=1336489180132&enc;=1&dsFamilyId;=783 There is also a greater distance travelled by the population of Scaleby; on average people are travelling 36.71 km to work everyday.

(1): For the purposes of this Act, \\"copyright\\", in relation to a work, means the sole right to produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatever, to perform the work or any substantial part thereof in public or, if the work is unpublished, to publish the work or any substantial part thereof, and includes the sole right (a) to produce, reproduce, perform or publish any translation of the work, (b) in the case of a dramatic work, to convert it into a novel or other non-dramatic work, (c) in the case of a novel or other non-dramatic work, or of an artistic work, to convert it into a dramatic work, by way of performance in public or otherwise, (d) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to make any sound recording, cinematograph film or other contrivance by means of which the work may be mechanically reproduced or performed, (e) in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to reproduce, adapt and publicly present the work as a cinematographic work, (f) in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to communicate the work to the public by telecommunication, (g) to present at a public exhibition, for a purpose other than sale or hire, an artistic work created after June 7, 1988, other than a map, chart or plan, (h) in the case of a computer program that can be reproduced in the ordinary course of its use, other than by a reproduction during its execution in conjunction with a machine, device or computer, to rent out the computer program, and (i) in the case of a musical work, to rent out a sound recording in which the work is embodied, and to authorize any such acts Copyright Act, RS 1985, c C-42, s 3(1). =Supreme Court Definition of \\"Authorization\\": CCH v LSUC CCCH Canadian Limited v. The Law Society of Upper Canada, 2008 SCJ 12 at para 4.= The Supreme Court of Canada defines and discusses the definition of \\"authorization\\" in a 2004 case, CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada. In this case, the LSUC, which maintains and operates the Great Library at Osgoode Hall, engaged in two relevant behaviours. * It made photocopies of CCH‚Äôs copyrighted law reports for library members * It provided self-service photocopy machines for use by library members The relevant issue for the court with regard to \\"authorization\\" is whether the Law Society authorized copyright infringement by maintaining self- service photocopy machines, allowing members to illegally photocopy copyrighted material. The court found that it did not.CCCH Canadian Limited v. The Law Society of Upper Canada, 2008 SCJ 12 at paras 41-46. In the court‚Äôs analysis, it concluded that \\"authorization\\" in Canadian Copyright law has the following characteristics: # The definition of \\"authorize\\" is to \\"sanction, approve, countenance.\\"CCCH Canadian Limited v. The Law Society of Upper Canada, 2008 SCJ 12 at para 38. # \\"Countenance\\" in the context of authorizing copyright infringement, must be understood in the strongest dictionary meaning, namely \\"give approval to, sanction, permit, favour, encourage.\\" # Authorization is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of each particular case and can be inferred from acts that are less than direct and positive, including a sufficient degree of indifference. (For example, if there is a sufficient degree of control, passivity may be taken as authorization). # A person does not authorize infringement by authorizing the mere use of equipment [such as services and technologies that have a dual use (one which is infringing and one which is not, i.e. photocopier) that could be used to infringe copyright]. # Courts should presume that a person who authorizes an activity does so only so far as it is in accordance with the law. That is, there is a presumption that there is no knowledge of the infringing activity of potential primary infringers. Moreover, knowledge is not enough to attach liability. There must also be some legal capacity to control the activity of the primary infringer. Thus, the presumption can be rebutted if it is shown that a certain relationship or degree of control existed between the alleged authorizer and the persons who committed the copyright infringement. However, some aspects of authorization remain unclear. While \\"authorization\\" is considered a primary infringement (rather than secondary infringement, which will be discussed later), it is not clear whether liability for authorizing infringement requires that actual infringement has taken place. According to Vaver, an expert in the field, actual infringement is required. According to University of Toronto Law Professor, Ariel Katz, the decision in CCH is policy driven: preventing photocopying in libraries would shift the balance of copyright too far in favour of owner‚Äôs rights, and unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of copyrighted works for the good of society as a whole. =Authorization and Peer-to-Peer Networks: BMG Canada v John Doe BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241.= BMG was an attempt by the record companies to sue individuals for copyright infringement of their songs. The court said that, according to S. 80(1) Copyright Act, RS 1985, c C-42, s 80(1). of the Copyright Act, making a personal copy of a sound recording for one's own private purposes is not infringement.BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241 at para 24-25. The record companies went further, suggesting that the individuals were involved in authorization of copyright infringement, since they were members of a peer (shared) network. The court disagreed, and suggested that there is no difference between making personal copies and making a shared folder. The court uses an analogy: there is no difference between a library full of copyrighted materials with a self-service photocopier, per CCH, and making a shared folder on the Internet. Therefore, the mere fact of placing a copy on a shared directory in a computer where that copy can be accessed via a peer-to-peer service does not amount to distribution, and hence authorization.BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241 at para 27. According to the case, \\"before it constitutes distribution, there must be a positive act by the owner of the shared directory, such as sending out the copies or advertising that they are available for copying.\\" BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241 at para 28. Some experts, such as University of Toronto Law Professor Ariel Katz, suggest that the analogy to CCH is flawed, since library use is far more constrained and requires higher transaction costs than does Internet use. Secondary Infringement A person is a secondary infringer where he knows or should have known that a work either a) infringes a copyright or, b) would infringe a copyright had it been made in Canada (hypothetical infringement test) and, without the consent of the copyright owner he does anything set out in S. 27(2) of the Copyright Act [see below]. If a person turns a blind eye or honestly but mistakenly believes the goods are non- infringing, he will still be presumed to have the requisite knowledge. There can only be secondary infringement if there has been a primary infringement.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade- Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 190. =Related Provisions in the Canadian Copyright Act= S. 27(2) It is an infringement of copyright for any person to (a) sell or rent out, (b) distribute to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright, (c) by way of trade distribute, expose or offer for sale or rental, or exhibit in public, (d) possess for the purpose of doing anything referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c), or (e) import into Canada for the purpose of doing anything referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c), a copy of a work, sound recording or fixation of a performer‚Äôs performance or of a communication signal that the person knows or should have known infringes copyright or would infringe copyright if it had been made in Canada by the person who made it.Copyright Act, RS 1985, c C-42, s 27(2). =CCH on Secondary Infringement= According to CCH, S. 27(2) requires 3 things: # copy must be the product of primary infringement # secondary infringer must have known or should have known that he is dealing with a product of infringement # secondary dealing must be established (must have been a sale) =The Supreme Court of Canada on Secondary Infringement: Euro-Excellence v Kraft CanadaEuro-Excellence Inc v Kraft Canada Inc, 2007 SCC 37, [2007] 3 SCR 20.= Euro-Excellence Inc. v. Kraft Canada Inc. involves the plaintiff, Kraft Canada, who sues the defendant, Euro-Excellence, for importing chocolate bars with a copyrighted logo into Canada for the purpose of sale and distribution (parallel importation). Parallel importation takes place where a product is imported from abroad to be sold locally.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 191. The issue is whether parallel importation is secondary infringement pursuant to s. 27(2)(e). The case is composed of four distinct judgments:Drassinower, Abraham, \\"The Art of Selling Chocolate: Remarks on Copyright's Domain,\\" in Michael Geist ed, \\"Radical Extremism\\" to \\"Balanced Copyright\\" (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc, 2010) at 121. # Justice Rothstein (Majority): (writing for himself, Justice Binnie and Deschamps JJ): Pursuant to s. 27(2)(e), parallel importation is secondary infringement where the parallel importer is an assignee. Where the parallel importation is merely an exclusive licensee (like Euro-Excellence in this case), however, the act of parallel importation is not secondary infringement.Drassinower, Abraham, \\"The Art of Selling Chocolate: Remarks on Copyright's Domain,\\" in Michael Geist ed, \\"Radical Extremism\\" to \\"Balanced Copyright\\" (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc, 2010) at 126. # Justice Fish: Concurs with Justice Rothstein with respect to the exclusive licensee issue, but does not necessarily agree than liability would have attached to the parallel importer had the copyright holder been an assignee. His concern is that the Act was not meant to be an instrument of trade control to such an extent.Drassinower, Abraham, \\"The Art of Selling Chocolate: Remarks on Copyright's Domain,\\" in Michael Geist ed, \\"Radical Extremism\\" to \\"Balanced Copyright\\" (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc, 2010) at 127. # Justice Abella (dissent): (writing for herself and Justice McLachlin): The Act does make parallel importation an infringement even where the copyright owner is an exclusive licensee. # Justice Bastarache: Finds that a copyrighted logo should not prevent the sale/trade of a non-copyrighted chocolate bar. Section 27(2)(e) covers only copyrighted materials and not merely ancillary attachments to the products. With four judgments, it is hard to grasp where the law lies. According to Vaver, the case stands for the following: that an exclusive licensee cannot sue the importer of non-copyrighted materials (i.e. the chocolate bars) based on the incidental copyrighted subject matter associated with it (i.e. the wrappers).David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 194-195. That is, if the copyright had been assigned to Kraft Canada (rather than exclusively licensed), parallel importation of a genuinely copyrighted product (rather than the incidental copyright of the chocolate wrapper) would be an infringement according to S. 27(2)(e). Therefore, parallel importation of copyright materials is an infringement according to S. 27(2)(e) where the copyright owner is an assignee. =Critical Analysis: Does S. 27(2)(e) Really Cover Parallel Importation?= According to intellectual property expert and professor, Ariel Katz, S. 27(2)(e) is not meant to prevent parallel importation and the resulting market arbitrage. Rather, its purpose is to prevent regulatory arbitrage (protecting the integrity of Canada‚Äôs regulatory sovereignty). Section 3 of the Copyright Act does not give a general distribution right; it only gives the right to make copies and publish a work if it is unpublished. This means that a copyright owner does not have the right to prevent parallel importation if he owns the copyright in both countries, since he does not have the general right to distribute (so cannot exclude others). Thus, he should not be able to prevent parallel importation merely by assigning his copyright. He cannot assign a right that did not exist in the first place. Moreover, Canadian law does not prevent parallel trade domestically (that is, between provinces), so there is no reason to prevent it internationally.

Youth Roelens was born on 21 July 1858 in Ardooie as Victor Theodoor Roelens, the third son of Cesar Roelens and his mother, Rosalia Vervisch.Roelens ancestors were: Jacob Roelens (¬∞1681, ‚Ä† 9 August 1720, married to Joanna Salens on 22 November 1714); Jan-Baptist Roelens (¬∞12 April 1717, ‚Ä† 18 May 1784, married to Anna Catharina Callewaert on 10 October 1755); Felix Roelens (¬∞ 14 Jan 1775, ‚Ä† 21 June 1834, married to Anna Deynnecourt); Cesar Roelens (¬∞ 19 February 1817, ‚Ä† 15 September 1892, married to Rosalie Vervisch on 23 April 1852) Rosalie Vervisch was Victor's mother. She was born on 31 March 1819 and died on 14 December 1890 He had two older brothers Emiel and Adolf, and two younger sisters Lucia and Marie-Emily. His father was a gardener at the nearby Chateau des Comtes de Jonghe d'Ardoye. Being rather poor, the family received financial support from the castle lords and could send the three sons to college.Marie-Emily later became a nun at the convent of Pittem Like his brothers before him, Victor boarded the Sint-Jozef College of Tieltcurrent website Sint-Jozefsinstituut Tielt (in Dutch = Flemish) at the age of 13. Though all classes were in French, he quickly learned the language and came out at the top of his class in his first year. During a winter, whilst playing on a pond in Pittem, he slipped and broke his nose, whose altered shape would remain with him for the rest of his life. At college he supported the Flemish movement.see Albrecht Rodenbach, one of the leaders of the so-called \\"Blauwvoeterij\\" (Eng: \\"Blue footery\\") His dream about going to Africa was initially planted by two white fathers Charmetant and Moinet, who visited the college to talk about missionary work in Africa. It was further reinforced when his teacher Adolf Loosvelt volunteered to go to Africa. In his rhetorica year, and without anyone knowing, Victor sent three letters to three different religious orders, and eventually made up his mind to join the white fathers. Victor wanted to leave straight after college but his father insisted that he spend one additional year at the seminary in Roeselare to study philosophy. Northern Africa, Europe and Jerusalem In the autumn of 1880, at the age of 22, Victor travelled to and joined the Novitiate of White Fathers in Algiers, Algeria. In the presence of then bishop Charles Lavigerie, he graduated and became a member of the order of the white fathers on 23 September 1881. During his time in Algiers, Victor visited Carthage to attend the promotion to cardinalship of Charles Lavigerie. He later went back to Carthago to study for two years at the College of Saint- Louis. During this time he visited local neighbourhoods to care for the sick, and met his first share of disease as he had stomach problems. Cardinal Lavigerie made Victor a priest on 8 September 1884 in Carthago.Adriaan De Roover, \\"Victor Roelens, de Vlaamse Lavigerie\\" p. 9 - 32, Publ. \\"Nieuw Afrika\\", Antwerp, 24 June 1952 In 1884, Victor was appointed a teacher at the Apostolic School for Missionaries in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, near Brussels. Though it was not Victor's first choice to go back to Europe, it allowed him to visit his family. His health recovered. In 1887 we was called back to Carthage as a lecturer, and was also responsible for the operational running of the school.at the time the school counted 83 people Two years later he was sent to Jeruzalem to teach ecclesiastical history and bible studies in the seminary of Saint Anna. In that same school he later was asked to teach theology, which he had to study intensely as a consequence. During this time his mother passed away. On 31 May 1891 he received a letter of Cardinal Lavigerie with the announcement of his departure to central Africa. This elated him as his long-lasting dream finally came true.De Roover, p. 33-51 Central Africa - Mpala and Saint Louis Roelens found the time to briefly visit Belgium to meet his father and siblings, then left for Africa in July 1891 with a team of White Fathers bound for the Congo. He travelled via Marseille, where he boarded the ship Rio Grande and reached Zanzibar on 31 July. In Zanzibar he purchased supplies for the caravan and organised for 450 carriers and 40 soldiers to join them on the mainland. He sailed from Zanzibar on Monday 24 August 1891 at landed at Bagamoyo late that same day. After some further preparations, the caravan set off on 31 August by crossing the nearby river and moving inland through the former German East-Africa towards Congo. The caravan had many setbacks, such as severe drought, fevers, hunger and the threat of marauding banditsDe Roover, p. 64 on its way to Msalala in present- day UgandaThe region was also struck at the time by cattle plague (De Roover, p. 64). Cattle plague or rinderpest killed 80 to 90% of domestic and wild even-toed animals at that time. A part of the carriers left the caravan, having reached their native region. The caravan moved on, hampered severely by the winter rains, and reach the abandoned mission post at Kipalala a few weeks before the year end. Victor organised new carriers at nearby Tabora but this took weeks, as the locals were in full harvest season, so that they celebrated New Year's Day of 1892 in Kipalala. After three additional weeks, during which Victor could study the Kiswahili language, they moved on through the grassy plains, facing new threats such as hyenas, and reached Karema, Tanzania on the shore of lake Tanganyika on 14 February 1892 at 3 PM. They were greeted by Monseigneur Lechaptois and some missionaries. Victor saw how local orphans were emaciated and weak, and realised how hard his upcoming task would be.Some children had been kidnapped by slave traders. Local missionaries succeeded in buying some back. (De Roo, p. 75) After five days of rest the caravan boarded two 12 meter long boats. One boat carried Victor, the other Mgr. Lechaptois. They rowed across the 80 km wide lake with the help of local fishermen. Victor reached the small outpost of Saint LouisA military stronghold that had been founded two years earlier by captain Joubert, a military envoy of king Leopold II of Belgium. This settlement had already assembled some 15 villages around it, but would later be abandoned, see later on in this article at 11 PM.Mgr. Lechaptois, whose boat had veered slightly off course, spent the night on a nearby shore and arrived the next morning. He was greeted by captain Joubert, whom Victor had known from his time in Maison Carr√©e in Algiers.Captain Joubert resided there with his wife Agnes and their children. (De Roover, p. 77) The next day, a mass led by Mgr. Lechaptois was the first sung service in the region.De Roover, p. 78 Different teams were formed who would continue to various destinations. Father Marquesformer pro-vicar of Upper Congo, see p 175 of this document would lead a team going to Kibanga with father Engels and brother Franciscus.Victor's acquaintance Ameet Vyncke had arrived in Kibanga ten years earlier and died there seven years later whilst father Victor Roelens and brother Stanislas would start a new mission post of Saint-Louis, next to the existing military stronghold. That same day, the boats with the other teams departed, and Victor went to the mission post of Mpala for a few weeks to study the language, region and customs prior to starting the new mission post. During this time he assisted the local missionaries in caring for the many sick in the surrounding villages. On 16 March, Victor arrived back at Saint Louis and started the construction of a missionary outpost next to the existing military settlement of captain Joubert. Later that same week, Victor baptised his first seven children, which gave him much energy and courage.De Roover, p. 83 Three weeks later a 12 by 7 meter wooden house was ready. Mgr. Lechaptois came back from Kibanga and visited Victor around that time. Victor happily showed the progress on the building and farmland that had been made. He also spoke out in favour of schooling local people and for locals to have the possibility of becoming priests, so that they could help spread the gospel in their own villages. However, Mgr. Lechaptois thought it too early and ordered him to first focus the efforts of the natives into construction work and farming.Nothing if not stubborn and tenacious, Victor's own letters show that he made up his mind at that point to try it anyway as soon as the new mission post was able to do so (De Roover, p. 86 - 87) Like other missionaries in the region, Victor had to overcome many tough challenges. Any construction work was under constant threat of destruction from termites, rodents and torrential rains. Caravans bringing supplies were slow and goods often got broken, stolen or lost en route. Yet the biggest challenge facing the locals were diseases like pox, syphilis and feet infections caused by funza fleas, which missionaries had to fight with little or no medicine. Most of the missionaries were frequently ill with fever themselves, and most did not survive for more than a few years. A few weeks into his new mission post, Victor fell ill with hematuric fever, which became so bad that he received last rites, but he survived and recovered.Hematuric fever is an often lethal condition that took many of the local missionaries' lives. Victor would survive 18 bouts during his lifetime. He visited the military stronghold at Albertvillenow Kalemie during three days, and met the Belgian captain Jacqueswho was later to become a general, see Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude who was fighting Arab slave traders active in the region during this period.Albertville was at this time only accessible by lake Tanganyika as all land routes around it had been captured by Arab slave traders. The journey to Albertville was very dangerous, proven by the sorry fate of Alex Vrithoff, who had been with captain Joubert in Saint-Louis just a few weeks earlier, and who was killed on his way to AlbertvilleCaptain Jacques would receive military help from captain Joubert and from Alexandre Delcommune, who had been accompanying geologist Gaston Briart on a secret mission to search for minerals in the Katanga region In October of that year, Roelens received news that father Marques had died from hematuric fever at Kibanga, and that father Engels had fallen ill with it. Mgr Lechaptois sent father Herrebaut to Kibanga to replace both these men. With Herrebaut gone, Roelens had to abandon the mission post at Saint-Louis and moved back to Mpala with brother Stanislas. Having arrived there, Roelens in turn fell ill with a new bout of hematuric fever. Baudouinville / BoudewijnstadBoudewijnstad (Dutch) or Baudouinville (French) is now present-day Kirungu Early the following year, Mgr Lechaptois also ordered that the mission post at Kibanga be abandoned. Their missionaries moved back south and many villagers followed in their wake. To cope with the influx of around one thousand people, Roelens was charged with finding a new location for a new mission post. On 6 February, Roelens travelled to Saint- Louis stayed for two weeks,during which he baptised, celebrated mass, cared for the ill and stocked up on additional suppliesthe date of 6 February is confirmed in Emiel Delhaye (in Dutch) then left with brother Franciscus and travelled the region for a week, identifying a swamp that could be easily drained as the site of the future mission post \\"Baudouinville\\" (French) / \\"Boudewijnstad\\" (Dutch)Its name had been decided by cardinal Charles Lavigerie in honour and memory of prince Baudouin of Belgium before returning to Saint- Louis for final preparations. Around Easter, and just days before setting off, Roelens had another bout of hematuric fever, forcing him to return to Mpala instead and recover for a few weeks. At long last, on 8 May 1893, father Roelens and brother Franciscus pitched up their tent on the site of the new mission post.for some pictures see Missionaries in Congo (in Dutch = Flemish) Work started the following week with the cutting of trees and the erection of wooden food storages.The first stone structures would be built in 1895 Fairly quickly a few hundred locals moved in to stay in the relative safety of the encampment, providing labour for the ambitious project. In July 1893, more than 100 orphans arrived from other posts in the region, bringing the total number of inhabitants of Baudouinville to more than one thousand.De Roover p. 124 In October, the seasonal rains washed away the growing crops and destroyed thousands of clay bricks that were drying in the field. Both presented a severe setback. In the same period, a letter from Europe arrived, announcing that father Roelens had been appointed as provicar of Upper Congo,Upper Congo at that time was a region of 900 by 300 km which added to the already considerable workload of \\"bwana Mrefoe\\".\\"bwana Mrefoe\\" was Roelens' nickname, meaning \\"the long master\\", referring to his height In December, the eighth bout of hematuric fever struck him. At the end of that year, three stone- baking ovens had been erected to prepare for brick making and the erection of stone buildings in Baudouinville. In May 1894, the ground work for the warehouse started, and the roof was finished by August of that year.On 1 June 1894, the missionary work in Upper Congo had resulted in 752 new catholics who had been baptised by the missionaries; 4771 catechumens; 203 male and 233 female children who had been bought from Arab slave traders and were freed in this wayAlso in 1894, commander Descamps, the successor of captain Jacques, had succeeded in pushing back the Arabs from Albertville, creating more stability in the broader region. The finishing of the warehouse liberated time for provicar Roelens, who set off to tour the region twice that year, going as far as lake Mweru.During a stop at Karema to re-supply and meet Mgr Lechaptois, Roelens also met five nuns travelling to Baudouinville. They were the first female missionaries to reach middle Africa, and piqued the curiosity of the locals, who were not used to women carrying out official duties. As a small anecdote, also the two turkeys that they carried along attracted much attention, as these animals had never been seen before in the region The bishop Roelens' work in Baudouinville did not stay unremarked in Europe, and on 30 March 1895 he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Upper Congo and Titular Bishop of Girba. This caused Roelens to travel back to Europe in the company of father Dromaux. They set off around New Year's Day of 1896 and took three months to reach Zanzibar, where they boarded a ship to Europe, reaching Marseille on 16 April 1896 and being sworn in by cardinal Goossens at the chapel of Leliendaal in Mechelen on 10 May 1896. Roelans also met pope Leo XIII in the Vatican during this trip. Roelens travelled back to Baudouinville by way of Zanzibar in 1897, meeting the English, French and German consuls and the sultan of Zanzibar there.De Roover, p. 133 He crossed over to Chinde in Mozambique where he boarded the Sir Henry Johnston and sailed up the Zambezi river, then moved across land to the Shire river and travelled to Fort Johnston, now Mangochi. He crossed lake Malawi on board the Wissman, which called at English, German and Portuguese settlements along the way and arrived in Karonga six days later. There Roelens organised a caravan of 250 people, which left Karonga on 23 July. They crossed the Saisi river and travelled through the forest to the mission post of Kala on lake Tanganyika, where they boarded a rowing boat. Eight days of sailing later they reached Karema, and one more day took them to Saint-Louis, where they met with captain Joubert. Still one day later, Roelens finally reached Baudouinville, where he was met by a crowd of a few thousand people who celebrated his return. He had been away for 20 months. Immediately upon his return he learned about the deaths of several missionaries, most of whom had been felled by hematuric fever, and he was confronted again with endemic disease, rodent plagues, funza fleas and other harsh realities in middle Africa at that time. On the other hand, with the Arab slave traders gone, the region had become more peaceful,allowing many native people, such as the Watemba tribe, to move back to their abandoned villages and construction in Baudouinville had progressed handsomelyThe stables had been finished and cows were being raised there.One advantage of travelling to Europe had been that bishop Roelens had learned how to inoculate cows Bishop Roelens started to further organise life in the settlement, a.o. by striving to print books for use in schools and formulating his vision to start a religious school and train locals into becoming clergy and new missionaries. Around Easter of 1898, bishop Roelens was struck by another bout of hematuric fever, which forced him to stay in bedIn that same year, great drought, locusts, termites and plundering by marauding gangs were some of the other challenges they had to overcome. Thus he missed the inauguration of the church in Mpala, the first church in the broader region. During these days of illness he nevertheless continued to work from his bed, and ordered the construction of a large cathedral in Baudouinville,He ordered it to be 52 metres long, 22 metres wide and to have a tower of 30 metres high (De Roover p. 159) to be overseen by brother Franciscus. Sources of chalk stone and iron ore were available in the wider region and caravans of locals transported it to the city. Work started, and the cathedral foundations reached ground level in August. On 15 August 1898 the first stone was ceremonially laid.Its inscription is still visible today: \\"V. Roelens Episc. Djerbensis posuit 15 Aug. 1898 Also in 1898, the first six locals had indicated that they wanted to study and become a priest. Even though none of that first group made it in the end, it was the first sign that Roelens' plans now started to deliver results, vindicating his vision about local education and involvement that he had held ever since his first days in Africa (see higher). In 1899 bishop Roelens had to overcome major setbacks once more: a fire destroyed the stables in February, killing all animals except for one cow, and later that year brother Franciscus, who oversaw the cathedral construction, had to leave Africa for health reasonsBrother Franciscus had fallen ill with hematuric fever the previous December, with his temperature reaching 41.3 degrees Celsius (De Roover, p. 180) He had recovered but relapsed in February 1899 and was so weakened that he was forced to travel to Europe, leaving on 10 November 1899, see biography of Emiel Delhaye (in Dutch). This robbed Roelens of a capable wharf leader and a long-term companion In 1902, several missionaries passed away,They were brother Arthur, who had come to Upper Congo in 1900, died of hematuric fever; brother Franciscus, who had returned from Europe in 1901 and passed away on 23 April; and father Herrebaut making Bishop Roelens the sole survivor of the initial caravan of 1891. In the course of 1902, he received a visit from major Justin Malfeyt, governor of East Congo.for a biography in French, see Justin Malfeyt M. Malfeyt, more familiar with life on the west coast, learned about the many challenges of life in inland Africa and was impressed by the progress visible at Baudouinville. He tried to convince bishop Roelens to create mission posts in the Lualaba district to counter Islamic influence, but Roelens initially refused as it would spread his scarce resources too thinly over too large an area. Nevertheless, Roelens accepted an invitation to visit \\"Stanleystad\\" (Dutch), currently Kisangani to which he set off from Mpala with father Van Acker on 7 July on board of the San Vitori. The journey was disrupted by fever of bishop Roelens, forcing them to rest some days in a military settlement in the Lualaba region.It was at the same place that fathers Lippens and Debruyne had been killed by an Arab gang They then travelled on, only to see father Van Acker fall ill, stranding them for a while at Lokandu,see Ghost town Lokando before finally reaching Stanleystad. There Roelens met with Malfeyt and some twenty state and railway officialsDe Roover, p. 211 to discuss the matter of mission posts in the Lualaba region. After about three weeks, Roelens and Van Acker started the journey back to Baudouinville. They first sailed to Ponthierstadpresent day Ubundu and disembarked there on 18 November to cross the Kasongo region over land. They suffered from heavy rains which forced them to rest for a week at Kabambare, then crossed the Lowa river with great difficulty, and met further difficult conditionsDe Roover, pages 214 - 221 so that they reached lake Tanganyika only on 5 February 1903 at Lusenda.It was in Lusenda that Roelens learned about the death of father Cafmeyer on 16 August 1902, see also Missionary work of Bruges (in Dutch) They stayed there until 13 JuneDe Roover, p. 223 when they pressed on and reached Baudouinville three weeks later. Roelens was elated with how the cathedral had progressed, and after the long and hard journey was happy to be back in his own quarters. An additional source of joy was a letter which had come and was waiting, announcing funds donated by an organisation in BrugesMore specifically the \\"Brugse Congobond\\" (Dutch), i.e. an organisation working to assemble funds for missionary work in Congo. See De Roover, p. 226. Bishop Roelens decided to allocate it to starting a new mission post in the Maniema region and to honour the gift by giving it the name of \\"Sint-Donaas- Brugge\\".This is referred to in Father Alfons Simons (in Dutch)The location of the new mission post was a tactical move to stem the growing influence of Islam in that region, see De Roover p. 230 On 23 November 1903, Mgr Roelens gave his first sermon in the newly devoted cathedral, being elated with joy after all the years of hardship and setbacks.De Roover p. 234 In March 1904, Bishop Roelens discussed the new mission post with father De Vulder, who set off shortly afterwards to the Kasongo region in Maniema. In June Mgr Roelens travelled to Maniema himself to safeguard a mission post which was under threat of forced movement by military campaignsThe mission post was located in the house of Mr. Mohin, a former consul in Zanzibar. Major Malfeyt wanted to use its location on a hilltop to serve as a military stronghold. Mgr Roelens flatly refused to do so, citing that missionary work offers more security than trenches and cannons (De Roover p. 237) He then travelled on to Lusenda, Kabambare, Nyembo and the new mission post of Sint-Donaas-Brugge, facing extreme heat. In Lusenda, Mgr Roelens fell ill with a liver disease. The Italian doctor Moriondo, whom Roelens had met on his journey to Stanleyville, ordered Roelens to travel to Europe and recover. Roelens was able to leave Lusenda only on 1 NovemberDe Roover p. 242 and return to Baudouinville.Upon his return he learned of the death of father Rotsaert, who had caught tetanus and died after much suffering and pain. Shortly after also father Van Acker passed away. With six missionaries dead, Roelens feared he would have to give up on several mission posts. After having appointed father Huys as his replacement, Mgr Roelens left for Europe and arrived four months later by boat in Antwerp on 8 August 1905. He met the Belgian king. Letters he received during the summer announced the death of five more missionaries, and a letter in spring comes with even worse news: the very lethal sleeping sicknessThe local people called the disease mongota, and those hit by it were called bamongota had broken out in the region. Having a very high mortality rate and a then still unknown cause,Teams of European doctors and bacteriologists would arrive in 1906, such as Dr. Koch who came to the Sese islands in lake Victoria in August 1906 the disease killed thousands wherever it appeared, leaving missionaries and local people powerless. It spread quickly along lakes and rivers throughout the whole of central Africa. All that people could do was to relocate uphill, to stay away from water, and as much as possible also from each other. In Roelens' region, Mpala was the first to be hit, forcing the religious school to be transferred to the as yet untouched Lusaka. Fighting the sleeping sickness Roelens arrived back from Europe in Upper Congo in May 1906. Father De Vulder in Kasongo was the first to brief him on the strange effects of the sleeping sickness and on the abandonment of several mission posts as a result.Lusenda and Sint-Lambrechts-Luizi were abandoned; Sint- Donaas-Brugge was moved to Bena Nkuvu but nearly all men died, leaving only widows and orphans (De Roover, p.256) Only Baudouinville had been spared until that time. The cruel disease, which struck men far more often than women, and the devastating effects it had on the local population and on the missionary work, caused Roelens much consternation and despair, yet he did not think of quitting.De Roover, p. 253The disease caused much pain in its victims and at the same time drove them crazy. Stories abounded about people scratching open their own bellies till they bled, or destroying whatever they found near them in a state of frenzied aggression, even sometimes lighting up a hut and jumping into the flames. To protect themselves from sudden frenzied attacks, caretakers took to chaining their patients to stakes and immobilising them. After a short while, frenzy gave way to bouts of deep sleep from which victims could nearly not be roused. Patients woke less and less, until finally some did not even wake up to drink or eat. Others, in the final stages of the disease, having become blind or unable to speak, crawled about helplessly. Some patients even sweat blood (De Roover, p.255) Father Kindt had left Africa for the Pasteur Institute in Paris in a bid to find the cause and develop a medicine, and returned with knowledge of the cause (trypanosomes), the vector (a fly with the scientific name glossina palpalis but commonly known as the tsetse fly), medicines (atoxyl and strychnine)Even though Roelens had spent almost all his funds on the expensive medicine atoxyl, a turnaround could not be achieved. Treatment took a long time and locals tended to stop after four or five injections, causing them to still succumb in the end. and in possession of a microscope with which he could check throat smears for the presence of the disease.De Roover, p.259-260 Shortly afterwards Dr. Guastella arrived in Baudouinville on a mission from the Belgian government, soon to be joined by doctor Schwertz. It was decided to abandon Saint-Louis in an attempt to save close by Baudouinville. Dr. Schwertz, after having come back from a trip to Mpala, correctly identified that the tsetse fly staid on the banks of rivers and lakes, but not inland, and that it stayed in shady environments and not in direct sunlight.This explained why men were hit more often than women: it was only men to went out fishing and passed frequently near the water's edge He proposed the bold plan to deforest all river and lake banks to rob the tsetse fly of its habitat by burning the bush and then taking out all roots to prevent them from growing back. As roots often went down to more than a meter, and as Mpala was 50 kilometers away, the task was gargantuan yet Roelens supported the idea and crossed the region personally to convince all villages to come out and help. Over the course of months, the banks from Baudouinville to Mpala were cleared, and this indeed significantly brought down the number of patients in the region.Around this time, father Huys became titular bishop of Rusicade, providing Roelens with a much needed assistant bishop at a time where Roelens' health was again deteriorating, at one time collapsing in Kipungwe with stomach aches. He had to be carried back in a stretcher, and had to endure daily gastric lavages. (De Roover, p. 266) In those years of disease and many setbacks, the catechist school in Lusaka saw the graduation of its first local student, Stefano Kaoze. He was the sole remaining student of the group of twenty young men that had been picked by Mgr Roelens in Mpala to study Latin, and the first to become a white father himself. Mr Kaoze was the embodiment of Roelens' original vision, that had finally come to fruition. On 8 September 1909, Baudouinville celebrated the 25 year priesthood jubilee of Mgr. Roelens, who could look back on two and a half decennia of hard labour with many setbacks but also many great successes.Mgr Huys had returned in time from Europe to take part, and also captain Joubert was present at the festivities Shortly afterwards Mgr Roelens travelled back to Europe for health reasons, this time staying away for three years.De Roover, p. 277 First world war and first black priest During his time in Europe, Mgr Roelens engaged in much diplomacy in Belgium, where a political battle was raging about the colonies. Roelens defended the missionary work in the face of political opponents and critics, organised protest marches, and eventually managed to have the Minister of Colonies speak out in favour of missionary work in parliament. When he at last returned to Africa, Mgr Huys was able to proudly report the founding of two new mission posts, Lulenga and Bobandana, in the Kivu region. It was in the mission post of Tielt-Sint-Peter, in the north, that Roelens heard about the start of the first world war of 1914. This resulted in a German blockade of lake Tanganyika, so that Roelens could not return to Baudouinville by boat. As a result, he stayed in Kivu, much to the benefit of his health. He also met Stefano Kaoze there. Roelens managed to reach Baudouinville on 26 December 1916. On 21 July 1917, Roelens' birthday and 25 years after the first missionaries had arrived in the region, Stefano Kaoze became the first local man to be consecrated as a priest in the cathedral of Baudouinville, now in the presence of 4 bishops, 30 priests and by then governor Malfeyt from Stanleyville. Mgr Roelens promised Stefano that he would take him along on his next trip to Europe, on the condition that Stefano learn FlemishDe Roover, p. 280 Stefano did go along on Roelens' trip to Europe, which became something of a celebratory voyage. In Rome they were present at the beatification of the martyrs of Uganda when pope Benedict XV detected the black Stefano in the crowd and stopped to give him his special blessing. The crowd was so taken by Stefano that it took him the rest of the day to leave Saint-Peters square.De Roover p. 281 Later that same week they travelled to Flanders, where Cardinal Mercier and king Albert received Stefano as well. Stefano returned to Africa the following winter, and Mgr Roelens in the following spring.Stefano toured Flanders from spring to the following winter, at one point visiting the seminary in Roeselare, heart of the flemish movement, and there sung the Flemish anthem on stage and in flemish. (De Roover, p.282) Having found additional funds, Mgr Roelens decided to create a Great Seminary in Kapulo, thus creating a local school to educate priests, as an answer to the increasing numbers of local students. Thirty five years after starting, this was the jewel on Roelens' crown.In that same year, captain Joubert passed away in Santa-Maria-Moba. He was carried to Baudouinville to be buried there In 1938, Mgr Roelens was hospitalised in Albertville with stomach problems when Mgr Huys, having travelled to Mpweto, suffered a heart attack that left him half blind. He was taken to Elisabeth town when he had a second heart attack. He reached Albertville a few monts later but died there. The Vatican appointed a new coadjutor and Mgr Roelens felt that it was time to step aside and leave things in the hands of a younger generation. He retired as Apostolic Vicar of Baudouinville on 22 September 1941 and was succeeded by Mgr MorlionDe Roover, p. 283 In the last years of his life, he stayed at Baudouinville, relieved of all duties. He became hard of hearing. In the late afternoon of 5 August 1947, Mgr Roelens received black seminarists from Kapulo on a visit. Seeing him feeling weak, none dared to leave the room, but he comforted them and sent them home. Later that evening his situation deteriorated and he was given last rites. Two sisters kept him company. When he suddenly shivered from cold, he tried to get his hands under the blanket. A sister rose to help him, then returned to her seat, only to discover that he had died by the time she sat down. It was 9 PM on 5 August 1947. Victor was aged 89. He was buried the next day. Stefano Kaoze, his first black priest, attended the service.

The film was based on the novel The Fanatic of Fez by M. V. Heberden. Action in Arabia was written by Philip MacDonald and Herbert J. Biberman. The supporting cast includes Gene Lockhart and Robert Armstrong, and the plot involves trouble and intrigue with the Nazis in Damascus, who scheme to seize control of the Suez Canal. Plot In the spring of 1941, American journalist Michael Gordon (George Sanders) and his colleague, William Chalmers (Robert Anderson), arrive in Damascus. When Chalmers is murdered, Gordon sets out to find out why. He is helped along by glamorous secret agent Yvonne (Virginia Bruce), who is on the trail of a group of Nazi saboteurs. Intrigue centers around the actions of Josef Danesco (Gene Lockhart) who offers to sell information, as well as French diplomatic official Andre Leroux (Andr√© Charlot) and Eric Latimer (Alan Napier), the owner of the Hotel International, both suspected of having connections with the Nazis. Gordon enlists the help of Mathew Reed (Robert Armstrong), a member of the American Consulate and uncovers a plot to maneuver the Arabs into an insurrection as a diversion for an attack on the Suez Canal by the Nazis. Abdul El Rashid (H.B. Warner), the revered Arab leader, has been deceived by Kareem (Jamiel Hasson), a pro-Nazi chieftain. When Gordon proves Leroux to be a German provocateur to Abdul El Rashid, it results in the deaths of Reed and Leroux and the wounding of Gordon, but the plot to attack the Suez Canal is thwarted.

She has been beatified by the Roman Catholic Church. Life Louise was born on 28 December 1461, the Feast of the Holy Innocents, to the Amadeus IX, Duke of Savoy, and his wife, Yolande of Valois, the sister of King Louis XI of France.\\"Bl. Louise of Savoy\\", Franciscan Saints and Blesseds, Irish Franciscans OFM Through her mother, Louise was a collateral descendant of the Franciscan saint, Elizabeth of Hungary. She was born the fifth of their ten children. Her father was a very pious ruler who gave much attention to works of charity in his duchy. He suffered from epilepsy, which, added to his retiring nature, led him to leave the mechanisms of government in the hands of his wife. He himself was beatified in 1677. Louise showed an inclination to the spiritual life at a very young age. While still a child, she was found to be fasting on only bread and water on the Vigil of any major feast day of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Despite the active court life around her, she was drawn to prayer and solitude. Yet she was marked by a spirit of obedience, and when her mother insisted that she dress well in keeping with her station, she would obey. She would wear a hairshirt under her lovely garments, though. When she was older, Louise naturally was drawn to enter a monastery. Her uncle, the King, however, arranged that she marry on 24 August 1479 to Hugues de Chalon, (d.3 Jul 1490) of the House of Ch√¢lon-Arlay, to which she was agreeable. In her typical attitude of obedience, she saw the hand of God in this arrangement. The Prince proved to be a pious young man who supported his wife's efforts at living a life of faith and self-denial in the midst of their luxuries. Louise set a high tone of morality for her court, starting with her attendants. She would demand that any man found to be using foul language be required to make a donation to the poor as a penance. They held the usual court events, such as dances, but did not participate in the revels. This life of happiness soon ended, though, as her husband, the Prince, died when she was 27 years of age. As she had no children, the young widow then determined to follow her calling as a nun, refusing many offers of marriage. She used her vast wealth to meet many needs of the poor and entered the monastery of the Poor Clare nuns in Orbe, now part of modern Switzerland. In the cloister, she showed herself to be a model of humility and obedience, preserving nothing of her royal origins. Louise died at the age of forty-two. She was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839. Her feast is observed by the Poor Clares on the date of her death.

Mobile CSCL includes any in- class and out-of-class use of handheld mobile devices such as cell phones, smart phones, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) to enable collaborative learning. Overview The adoption of mobile devices as tools for teaching and learning is referred to as M-Learning. M-Learning is a rapidly emerging educational technology trend. The New Media Consortium has listed adoption of mobiles for teaching and learning on a \\"One Year or Less\\" Adoption Horizon.\\"One Year or Less\\" Adoption HorizonJohnson, L., Smith, R., Willis, H., Levine, A., and Haywood, K., (2011). [The 2011 Horizon Report. Austin, Texas: The New Media Consortium. M-Learning research comprises a range of mobile devices and teaching and learning applications. However, the research available for collaborative applications that involve mobile devices is limited. Examples of collaborative mobile learning applications can be found in examples from early adoption of PDA technology, and in recent examples of location-based, mobile collaborative games. History Wireless-enabled handheld devices have been used as early as 2004 to facilitate collaborative learning. Devices such as PDAs and PocketPC's traditionally lack cellular connectivity, but are capable of wireless connectivity. This connectivity enables collaborative learning through software-based, decision-making tools and shared display of learning material. = Elementary school learners = Wireless interconnected handhelds have been used to foster collaborative construction of words among elementary school students.

Students in each group were asked to answer the same multiple choice physics question. Students could only proceed once the group established consensus on an answer. The software was further developed to mediate the interaction of students in small-groups facilitating their collaboration in activities related to different subject areas. In these activities the groups of students share a set of questions that includes multiple responses that they have to analyze and decide the answer they want to submit as a group. This requires shared commitment and individual responsibility in order to make collective decisions and reach consensus. The methodology uses technology-supported face- to-face collaborative learning as a tool for the assessment of learning.Nussbaum, M., Gomez, F., Mena, J., Imbarack, P., Torres, A., Singer, M., & Mora, M.

Mentira was developed using the ARIS iOS game platform.ARIS iOS = Foreign language learners = A mobile-device-supported peer-assisted learningDefinition of \\"peer-assisted learning\\" (MPAL) system runs on tablet computers and is used to facilitate collaborative reading activities of elementary English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. An MPAL system consists of a phonological-skills training module and a peer-assessment module. Online helpers (typically more advanced students) can assist their peers in the peer-assessment module via Skype. While evaluating their peers' oral reading, online helpers identify mispronounced words by marking the words with a stylus. The MPAL system is then used to assess the readers' performance as a \\"fail\\" or \\"pass\\" based on the accuracy ratio provided. MPAL successfully promotes EFL learners' motivation to improve reading skills, and makes them engaged in reading activities; thereby ensuring that learners have timely online assistance anytime and anywhere.Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, and Kuo-En Chang (2007) A mobile-device-supported peer-assisted learning system for collaborative early EFL reading. Language Learning & Technology, Vol. 11, p. 130 ‚Äì 151  Collaborating in discussion boards on a mobile device  Discussion boards provide the ability for students to collaborate with others and build knowledge collectively. Although students may use personal computers to participate in discussion boards, computer-based discussions do not offer frequent, integrated access to learning applications anytime, and anywhere.W. Y Hwang; J. H Su; J. L Hsu; H. J Huang (2010). A study on ubiquitous computer supported collaborative learning with hybrid mobile discussion forum. IJMLO - International Journal of Mobile Learning and Organisation, Volume 4, p. 98 - 112. Mobile devices help students to keep up-to-date with the current discussions and eliminate the accumulation of unread messages.Mac Callum, K. (2008). Mobile technology in collaboration: evaluation of a web-based discussion board. IJMLO - International Journal of Mobile Learning and Organisation, Volume 2, p. 318 - 328. Mobile use of discussion boards promotes collaborative learning by making it easier for students to interact with each other.  Mobile blogging and collaborative learning  Blogging encourages collaboration in a variety of learning settings. Mobile blogging enables students to publish, view, and respond to comments anytime and anywhere. The mobility offered through mobile blogging greatly enhances communication and interaction in several ways. Mobile blogging augments physical space through information exchange, coherently aggregates the efforts made by all students, and archives student work for future reference.Roschelle, J., & Pea, R. (2002). A walk on the WILD side: How wireless handhelds may change computer- supported collaborative learning. International Journal of Cognition and Technology, 1(1), 145-168.Huang, Y.-M., Jeng, Y.-L., & Huang, T.-C. (2009). An Educational Mobile Blogging System for Supporting Collaborative Learning. Educational Technology & Society, 12 (2), 163‚Äì175. Collaborative learning through mobile blogging provides a positive emotional experience for students, and makes it easier for them to learn cooperative skills, even when they do not meet face-to-face.  In-class collaborative mobile learning  An audience response system (ARS) is a system in which learners are able to provide instantaneous feedback via a mobile device to questions posed by an instructor. After students submit feedback (typically to multiple choice or true-false questions), the instructor can display the submitted feedback anonymously in diagram form.√Ç Applications of ARS include administrative uses (i.e. taking attendance), formative assessment (i.e. what is the answer to this question?), and collaborative questions.MacArthur, J. R., & Jones, L. L. (2008). A review of literature reports of clickers applicable to college chemistry classrooms. Chem. Educ. Res. Pract., 9(3), 187-195. Given the potential of enhancing learning through the use of an ARS, many instructors have shown a keen interest in the collaborative application of the technology. One notable collaborative application of an ARS is a method called peer instruction (PI). Developed by Eric Mazur and his group, PI emphasizes the interaction between students as a key component to the learning process. In a typical scenario, an instructor first provides new content in a short lecture. Students individually provide a response to the instructor's questions, then, afterwards, collaboratively discuss their answers in a small group before submitting group answers to the questions. Students' feedback is provided by a mobile device linked to an ARS. PI prescribes that the student interaction involves student defending their chosen answer so as to arrive eventually at a consensus for the group's response to the question.Crouch, C. H., & Mazur, E. (2001). Peer Instruction: Ten Years of Experience and Results. American Journal of Physics, 69(9), 970-77. One other notable collaborative application of an ARS is the method Assessing-to-Learn (A2L).Assessing-to-Learn A2L takes a slightly different approach from PI with regard to learner collaboration. Instead of having learners debate each other for a group answer, the A2L method has learners working on a problem related to the question presented to the learners during a lecture. Once each group of learners has determined a method of solving the problem, they provide their response via the ARS. Afterwards, the instructor displays all group responses and facilitates a class discussion in which each group elaborates upon and defends their method to the other groups.Dufresne, R. J., & Gerace, W. J. (2004). Assessing-To- Learn: Formative Assessment in Physics Instruction. The Physics Teacher, 42, 428.

This differs from work-life balance: while work-life balance may refer to the health and living issues that arise from work, work‚Äìfamily balance refers specifically to how work and families intersect and influence each other. Work‚Äìfamily balance in the U.S. differs significantly for families of different social class. Middle-class family issues center on dual-earner spouses and parents while lower class issues center on problems that arise due to single parenting. Work‚Äìfamily balance issues also differ by class, since middle class occupations provide more benefits and family support while low-wage jobs are less flexible with benefits. Solutions for helping individuals manage work‚Äìfamily balance in the U.S. include legislation, workplace policies, and the marketization of care work. History Family structure (how the family is organized) historically has been influenced by social-level forces, many of them economic.Coontz, Stephanie. 2000. \\"Historical Perspectives on Family Studies.\\" Journal of Marriage and the Family 62: 283-297. According to family historian Stephanie Coontz, marriage and family formation in the 17th century was heavily influenced by desires to form economic and political alliances. Children were seen as a method of ensuring the passage of political and economic power to future generations.Coontz, Stephanie. Marriage: A History. New York: Penguin, 2006. Influenced by the Englightenment, several changes to marriage occurred: the move toward individualism and the loosening of church influence over families after the Protestant Reformation resulted in the flourishing of the two-parent farm family. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the two-parent farm family was the dominant family model, in which both parents working side by side on family farmsPew Research Center. 2010. \\"The Decline of Marriage and Rise of New Families.\\" Retrieved January 7, 2011 (http://pewsocialtrends.org/2010/11/18/the-decline-of-marriage-and-rise-of- new-families/). The two-parent farm family ceased to be the dominant family model after the Industrial Revolution occurred.Barkley, Paul W. 1976. \\"A Contemporary Political Economy of Family Farming.\\" American Journal of Agricultural Economics 58(5): 812-819. The 1920s was the first time that the majority of children lived in two-parent breadwinner-homemaker families (one where the father supported the family financially and the mother supported the family domestically). In 19th century farm settings, children were an important part of their families' agricultural livelihoods.Hammel, E.A., Sheila R. Johansson, and Caren A. Ginsberg. 1983. \\"The Value of Children During Industrialization: Sex Ratios in Childhood in Nineteenth-Century America.\\" Journal of Family History 8: 346-366. As industrialization occurred and families shifted from rural agricultural settings to urban ones, the number of children per household also declined. Children became less of an economic benefit and more of a cost: urban life necessitated educating children which was costly.Wells, Robert V. 1975. \\"Family History and Demographic Transition.\\" Journal of Social History 9(1): 1-19. During the 1910s and 1920s, women delayed childbirth for economic opportunities that were present in urban areas.Cookingham, Mary E. 1984. \\"Combining Marriage, Motherhood, and Jobs Before World War II: Women College Graduates, Classes of 1903-1935.\\" Journal of Family History 9(2): 178-195. However, this trend reversed during the Great Depression because of the lower number of economic opportunities available for women. As a result, Depression Era women were more likely to marry and have children earlier. In 1900, roughly 40 percent of single women were employed versus only five percent of married women (Preston, 2003). This 35 percent gap persisted for many years. Goldin (1992), in a study of women college graduates in the twentieth century, concluded that those graduating between 1900 and 1920 had to make \\"a distinct choice between family and career\\".Barnett, Rosalind Chait. 2004. Preface: Women and Work: Where Are We, Where Did We Come From, and Where Are We Going?Journal of Social Issues. The Works Progress Administration opened about 3,000 part-day Emergency Nursery Schools for about 75,000 children from 1933 to 1935, which provided child care to help eligible adults looking for work and which employed teachers in an industry where two-thirds of private nursery schools had closed during the Depression.https://www.npr.org/2015/01/24/379530251/u-s-once-had- universal-child-care-but-rebuilding-it-wouldnt-be-easy Men were drafted into the military in large numbers during World War II, and women with young children were needed to supplement single women and those with older children at wartime factories. Problems with women leaving children in unsafe situations while working began to appear.https://thinkprogress.org/heres-what- happened-the-one-time-when-the-u-s-had-universal- childcare-c965a3178112#.1kl2xmgdd ENS capacity peaked at 130,00 children in 1944.http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/programs/child-care-the-american- history/ Wartime New Deal measures such as the Lanham Act and Servicemen's Dependents Allowance Act of 1942 provided federal funding for day care centers starting in 1942. The breadwinner‚Äìhomemaker model regained dominance during the twenty-year period immediately after World War II. The economy relied upon the male breadwinner to earn the income to support his family financially, while women were relied upon to do the care work and other forms of domestic work to support her husband's earnings. As the economy went into recession during the 1970s, women entered the workforce in large droves. Families could no longer survive on the single income of the male breadwinner and both sexes were relied upon for financial support. The dominant family model starting in the 1970s was the dual-earner family where both parents worked. Women also entered college in higher percentages.Torr, Berna M. 2011. \\"The Changing Relationship between Education and Marriage in the United States, 1940-2000.\\" Journal of Family History 36(4): 483-503. However, the economy was still assumed to run on an outdated breadwinner-homemaker model as evidence by the following things: women made significantly less income than men, they were still expected to do the majority of domestic work, and the nine-to-three o'clock school schedule of children still existed. The recession of the 1970s also further pushed the correlation between income and family structure. As more and more previously lucrative manufacturing jobs were sent overseas, men without college educations could no longer support their families on a single wage. Women's labor force participation rates have steadily increased since the 1940s Since the 1970s, the relationship between marriage and college education has also been positive. Congress passed the Comprehensive Child Development Act in 1971, which subsidized child care to make it universal, but the bill was vetoed by President Richard Nixon.https://thinkprogress.org/why- america-gave-up-on-the-fight-for-a-family-friendly-workplace-and-why-its- starting-again-54f536b27572#.lmabnqak4 =Legislation= Historically significant pieces of legislation have been enacted at the federal level to address the sex disparities in the workplace. These pieces of legislation attempt to address the wage gap in the U.S., gender discrimination in hiring and firing, and the occupational rights of workers in taking family and medical leave. Despite these significant legislative efforts, the U.S. still lags behind other developed countries in progressive family-friendly work policies.Bianchi, Suzanne M. and Melissa A. Milkie. 2010. \\"Work and Family Research in the First Decade of the 21st Century.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 72: 705-725. Equal Pay Act of 1963 The Equal Pay Act of 1963 attempted to abolish wage and payment discrimination between men and women.http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VII mandates against gender discrimination in the workplace.http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm It makes gender discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and childbirth illegal. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 is an amendment to Title VII that explicitly prohibits discrimination against pregnant women.http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires employers to provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, and care for an ill family member.http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA. Effects on families The structural economic changes have influenced specific aspects of the family.Edin, Kathryn and Rebecca Joyce Kissane. 2010. \\"Poverty and the American Family: A Decade in Review.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 72:460-479. However, not all families are affected in the same way. In the U.S., whether or not a family is dual or single-earner is related to their social class and income.Conger, Rand D., Katherine J. Conger, and Monica J. Martin. 2010. \\"Socioeconomic Status, Family Processes, and Individual Development.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 72:685-704. The economic changes in the past couple of decades have affected middle-class and lower-class families very differently in many aspects, especially since the 1970s economic recession. These family inequalities significantly affect the intersection of Race (United States Census) and Social class in the United States as well. =Problems affecting middle-class families= Middle-class families have certain class-specific problems that arise when family and work intersects. Many of them have to do with the balance parents must create between their career aspirations and their familial desires. Because the middle class has greater access to more stable occupations and the chances for occupational mobility, many middle class American families must deal with the ultimate decision between balancing their families with their jobs. Although the figures vary depending on parents' household income, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates families spend anywhere from $134,370 to $269,520 raising a child from birth through age 17.Simon, Robin W. \\"The Joys of Parenthood, Reconsidered.\\" Contexts 7.2 (2008): 40-45. Print. Delayed fertility Middle-class women oftentimes delay motherhood until after the peak of their fertility at age 29‚Äì30, a delay that has become more common in the last two decades.Abma, Joyce C. and Gladys M. Martinez. 2006. \\"Childlessness Among Older Women in the United States: Trends and Profiles.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 68 (1045‚Äì1056) Motherhood is delayed because of the higher educational and career aspirations middle-class women oftentimes makeMartin, S. P. 2000. \\"Diverging fertility among US women who delay childbearing past age 30.\\" Demography, 37 (523‚Äì533)‚Äîthe career incentives are too great to pass up.Caucutt, Elizabeth M., Nezih Guner, and John Knowles. 2002. \\"Why Do Women Wait? Matching, Wage Inequality, and the Incentives for Fertility Delay.\\" Review of Economic Dynamics 5:815‚Äì855. While middle-class women on average have children at age 29, lower-class women typically have children much earlier in their lives because of the lack of incentives to delay childbirth. According to Edin and Kefalas, lower-class women do not make the same delay because they are oftentimes lacking the career and educational incentives that middle-class women have. The delay in fertility becomes a problem among middle-class women when they delay childbirth past their fertility peak.Stone, Pamela. 2007. \\"The Rhetoric and Reality of 'Opting Out.'\\" Contexts 6:14‚Äì19. Since fertility peaks at a certain age, pushing childbirth past that age significantly decreases the probability that certain women will be able to have children. The media has been an influence on women's fertility choices:Barber, Jennifer S. and William G. Axinn. 2004. \\"New Ideas and Fertility Limitation: The Role of Mass Media.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 66:1180‚Äì1200. popular celebrities who have managed to have children well into their forties and other medical miracles covered in the media oftentimes give women false hope that they themselves will also be able to bear children later in life. For every success story, however, there are many more disappointments.Gibbs, Nancy. \\"Making Time for A Baby.\\" Time, April 15, pp. 1‚Äì6. Ideology of motherhood Although American women have made significant strides in the workplace, they are still culturally and socially required to be mothers first and foremost.Fursman, Lindy. 2002. 'Ideologies of Motherhood and Experiences of Work: Pregnant Women in Management and Professional Careers.\\" Berkeley Collection of Working and Occasional Papers. The cultural ideas of motherhood in the U.S. have given birth to a new ideal: a working mother who not only has a wonderful career but also manages to flawlessly balance her family and domestic duties as well. This ideal is known as the \\"supermom.\\"Hays, Sharon. \\"The Mommy Wars: Ambivalence, Ideological Work, and the Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood.\\" In Family in Transition, edited by Arlene S. Skolnick, 40-56. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 2003. The media is a culprit in this depiction: A study examining the portrayal of mothers in magazines showed that the most popular magazines in the U.S. still continue to promote the traditional role of motherhood while undermining homemakers by portraying them as superficial and negative.Johnston, Deirdre D., and Debra H. Swanson. 2003. \\"Invisible Mothers: A Content Analysis of Motherhood Ideologies and Myths in Magazines.\\" Sex Roles 49: 21-33. Instead, only the Supermom type is portrayed and rarely critiqued.Dillaway, Heather and Elizabeth Pare. 2008. \\"Locating Mothers How Cultural Debates About Stay-at-Home Versus Working Mothers Define Women and Home.\\" Journal of Family Issues 29(4): 437-464. As a result of this Supermom ideal, cultural contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women. Inequalities in care work Despite the career gains women have made, their husbands have not reached parity in terms of their domestic work and care work.Hochschild, Arlie Russell. The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home. New York: Penguin, 1989 Women in the developed world, including the U.S., still do hours more of housework than their male counterparts, despite their success in the workplace.Craig, Lyn and Killian Mullan. 2010. \\"Parenthood, Gender and Work-Family Time in the United States, Australia, Italy, France, and Denmark.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 72: 1344-1361. Working mothers on average do more work and sleep less than their husbands.Maume, David J., Rachel A. Sebastian, and Anthony R. Bardo. \\"Gender, Work-Family Responsibilities, and Sleep.\\" Gender and Society 24(2010): 746-768.Blair-Loy, Mary and Jerry A. Jacobs. \\"Globalization, Work Hours, and the Care deficit Among Stockbrokers.\\" Gender & Society 17(2003): 230-249 The perception of who does more housework is also skewed by whether or not the husband or the wife is reporting.Braun, Michael, Noah Lewin-Epstein, Haya Stier, and Miriam K. Baumgartner. 2008. \\"Perceived Equity in the Gendered Division of Household Labor.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 70:1145-1156. Unsurprisingly then, working mothers do not spend a significantly lower amount of time with their children compared to women who do not work‚Äîworking mothers simply sleep less on average. As a result, many middle-class families have resorted to alternative methods of child care.Owens, Erica and Gail Ring. 2007. \\"Difficult Children and Difficult Parents : Constructions by Child Care.\\" Journal of Family Issues 28(6):827-850. A common option is to buy child care, such as day care providers and centers. =Problems affecting lower- class families= Lower class families have been heavily influenced by income as well. Lower-class families have a different set of work‚Äìfamily balancing issues, many of which are much more difficult to solve than those of middle- class families. Single-parenting Lower-class families are disproportionately made up of single mother households. According to Kathryn Edin, this is because of the lack of incentive to marry other lower-class men among lower-class women, and the desire to save marriage for more quality prospects. Unlike middle-class women, lower-class women do not have the same financial and marriage incentives to marry especially in the face of likely divorce. As a result, lower class mothers have less incentive to delay their childbearing to later years. Many of the problems shared by single parents are disproportionately felt by the lower class for these very reasons.Zhan, Min and Shanta Pandey. 2004. \\"Postsecondary Education and Economic Well-Being of Single Mothers and Single Fathers.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 66:661-673. The inability to use the income and time of two spouses has a harmful effect upon the work opportunities of lower-income mothers. Another factor is income: single-mothers tend to work lower income wage,jobs which come with few benefits such as maternity leave, health insurance, childcare,Press, Julie, Jay Fagan, and Elisa Bernd. 2006. \\"Child Care, Work, and Depressive Symptoms Among Low-Income Mothers.\\" Journal of Family Issues 27(5): 609-632. and flexible schedules. Low-wage work oftentimes is characterized by weekly schedule changes,Wessels, Anke. 2003. \\"Displacing mothers from work and welfare.\\" UNESCO. little flexibility, and extreme short notice for changes.Backett-Milburn, Kathryn, Kaura Airey, Linda McKie, and Gillian Hogg. 2008. \\"Family comes first or open all hours?: How low paid women working in food retailing manage webs of obligation at home and work.\\" The Sociological Review 6(3):474-496. As a result, lower class mothers have a greater a time crunch and more conflict in balancing their work needs with those of their children. Single mother home environments are much poorer because of nonstandard hours and schedules.Lleras, Christy. 2008. \\"Employment, Work Conditions, and the Home Environment in Single-Mother Families.\\" Journal of Family Issues 29(10):1268-1297. Care work Single-mother and lower- class families have a much more difficult time negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to single-parent families because the single- parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do. Few low-income mothers are happy with their childcare arrangements especially in light of the fact that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions.Usdansky, Margaret L. and Douglas A. World. 2008. \\"When Child Care Breaks Down : Mothers' Experiences With Child Care Problems and Resulting Missed Work.\\" Journal of Family Issues 29(9):1185-1210. In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased. Solutions The United States has lagged behind the social benefits that support working families when compared to other developed countries. Of the twenty-one richest countries in the world, only the United States does not mandate paid parental leave, and among the industrialized Western nations only the United States does not mandate paid vacations.Gerson, Kathleen. \\"Finishing the Gender Revolution.\\" The Unfinished Revolution: How a New Generation Is Reshaping Family, Work, and Gender in America. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2010. Print. Many solutions to the family-work balance problem have been observed in other countries and proposed in the U.S. Solutions specific to the U.S. have also developed recently. Recent U.S. policy has focused on \\"restoring marriage\\" rather than providing direct support to children. =Care crisis= The care crisis in the United States refers to the lack of care work as the result of globalization.Hansen, Karen V., Rosanna Hertz, and Cameron Macdonald. 2002. \\"Care and Kinship : An Introduction.\\" Journal of Family Issues 23:703-715. For the middle class, there has been an ongoing debate over who should take care of children: family members or child care providersHickman, Lisa N. 2006. \\"Who Should Care for Our Children? : The Effects of Home Versus Center Care on Child Cognition and Social Adjustment.\\" Journal of Family Issues 27:652-684. However, the debate is slowly shifting to one concerning parents and child care providers to domestic workers. Globalization and the entrance of women into the workforce has prompted the mass immigration of transnational care chains - poor women who leave their home countries and go to developed countries to work specifically as domestic workers.Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette. Domestica: Immigrant Workers Cleaning and Caring in the Shadows of Affluence. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. This has become an option for many middle and upper-class families. Poor families, however, still do not have the same care work markets that middle-class families do. Relying on formal child care providers is less disruptive and risky, but providers still pose a significant price problem. =Workplace= There are many workplace policies that can alleviate the burden of work‚Äìfamily balance for many middle-class families. Some options in family-friendly workplaces include providing paid leave or options for reduced hours.Singley, Susan G. 2005. \\"Transitions to Parenthood: Work-Family Policies, Gender, and the Couple Context.\\" Gender and Society. 19: 376-397 Workplaces are realizing that employees with well balanced family and work lives are actually valuable to firms:Bloom, Nick, Tobias Kretschmer, and John van Reenen. 2011. \\"Are Family-Friendly Workplace Practices a Valuable Firm Resource?\\" Strategic Management Journal 32:343-367. workplace childcare assistance can increase productivity and morale among employees, as well as lessen turnover, accidents, and absenteeism.Sahibzada, Khatera, Leslie B. Hammer, Margaret B. Neal and Daniel C.

Workplace supports such as personal time off, paid leave, on-site or nearby childcare, financial assistance for childcare, and other family-friendly policies are Western European workplace norms that could solve the work‚Äìfamily balance problem in the United States. There are many other options of work‚Äìfamily policies that lead to happier and more productive workers.Cardenas, R. & Major, D. (2005). Combining employment and breastfeeding: Utilizing a work-family conflict framework to understand obstacles and solutions. Journal of Business and Psychology, 20(1), 31-51. Some of these options include educational classes, such as classes on the wellbeing of a newborn or family, put on by the company, that has been shown to be associated with less reported work‚Äìfamily conflict.Frye, N. & Breaugh, J. (2004). Family-friendly policies, supervisor support, work-family conflict, family-work conflict, and satisfaction: A test of a conceptual model. Journal of Business and Psychology, 19(2), 197-220. A room that would allow for breast milk pumping could be one of the most helpful work‚Äìfamily policies for a company and family. A 1995 study found 86% of breastfed infants experienced no illness during the 1-year duration of the studyCohen, R., Mrtek, M., Mrtek, R. (1995). Comparison of maternal absenteeism and infant illness rate among breastfed and formula-feeding woman in to corporations. American Journal of Health Promotion, 19(2), 148-153. and another study found breastfeeding infants decreases the chances of acute infections.Murtaugh, M. (1997). Optimal breastfeeding duration. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecological, and Neonatal Nursing, 97, 1252-1255. Breastfeeding will help the company because breastfeeding has been linked to lower health care costs. This prolonged breast feeding saved one company $240,000 in health care savings and $60,000 in reduced absenteeism. Some other work‚Äìfamily policies that could help the family and company include various scheduling options, such as paid vacation, flex schedules, working from home, part-time work, and job sharing. Employees who have this flexibility increase productivity and have less work‚Äìfamily spill overHill, J., Erickson, J., Holmes, E, and Ferris, M. (2010). Workplace flexibility, work hours, and work-life conflict: Finding an extra day or two. Journal of Family Psychology, 24(3), 349-358. and they are less likely to miss work due to family related issues.Hammer, L., Bauer, T., & Grandey, A. (2003). Work-family conflict and work-related withdrawal behaviors. Journal of Business and Psychology, 17(3), 419-436. One extremely important aspect of all these policies is the management support and work environment that go along with it. It has been shown multiple times that the work culture influence whether employees take advantage of work‚Äìfamily policies.Secret, M. (2000). Identifying the family, job, and workplace characteristics of employees who use work-family benefits. Family Relations, 49(2), 217-225. This work culture is a better predictor of use of policies than individual's needs or values. If an individual feels that using a policy will affect his/her chances of advancement he/she is more likely to refuse to use the policy. This is why management support is a big part of this work‚Äìfamily policy. However, many constrains still exist. These workplace policies are largely only offered at higher salary jobs, which are once again out of reach for the poor. The huge lack of government funding at the state and federal levels also make these workplace policies unrealistic at this point. =Government support= If government support for workplace family-friendly policies or childcare subsidies was stronger, more solutions could be attempted. For example, child care subsidies by the government actually result in less childcare and work disruptions and could impact low-income families as well by making childcare more affordable.Prohaska, Ariane and John F. Zipp. 2011. \\"Gender Inequality and the Family and Medical Leave Act.\\" Journal of Family Issues 32(11):1425-1448. However, government support is not at the level of other developed countries. Legislation such as the Family and Medical Leave Act had little impact on gender inequality in care work and was strongly opposed by businesses.Forry, Nicole D. and Sandra L. Hofferth. 2011. \\"Maintaining Work: The Influence of Child Care Subsidies on Child Related Work Disruptions.\\" Journal of Family Issues 32(3):346-368. :Fewer than half of working parents stay home when their children are sick, even though research shows that sick children recover more quickly when a parent is there. ‚Ä¶54 percent of working women are not entitled to any paid leave for taking care of a sick child or other family members.Crittenden, A. (2001). Conclusion. In A. Crittenden, The Price of Motherhood (p. 239). New York: Holt. If our society were to follow in the footsteps of other countries who allow paid time off for taking care of sick children or even for having children our country might be able to get rid of the welfare program. Mothers wouldn't need welfare because they could have a job and be able to take care of children. Employers would have to allow parents to leave work to take care of children and they would have to pay them for it as well. When the parent is still getting a paycheck there would be no need for welfare programs to supplement another income or for a lack of income.

Women and Means: Women and Family Property in Colonial Brazil, Journal of Social History. Vol. 24, No 2 (Winter 1990) pp. 277-298 The Iberian Peninsula, which is made up of Spain, Portugal and Andorra, has traditionally been the cultural and military frontier between Christianity and Islam, developing a strong tradition for military conquest and male dominance. Patriarchal traditions were readily transferred from the Iberian Peninsula to Latin America through the encomienda system that fostered economic dependence among women and indigenous peoples in Brazil. As the largest Roman Catholic nation in the world, religion has also had a significant impact on the perception of women in Brazil, though over the past century the Brazilian government has increasingly broken with the Catholic Church in regard to issues related to reproductive rights. Brazil is thought to possess the most organized and effective women's movement in Latin America, with visible gains having been made over the past century to promote and protect the legal and political rights of women.Fiedler, A. M., & Blanco, R. I. (2006). The Challenge of Varying Perceptions of Sexual Harassment: An International Study. Journal of Behavioral and Applied Management, 7, 274-291 Despite the gains made in women's rights over the past century, women in Brazil still face significant gender inequality, which is most pronounced in the rural areas of Northeastern Brazil.Caipora (Organization). Women in Brazil. London: Latin American Bureau, 1993. Brazil has come a long way to gain equal rights but there is still much to be done. For instance, they are many women going to universities but still aren't seen equal in the workforce and their isn't many of them seen as managers or executives. Consideration of reports submitted by states parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: combined initial, second, third, fourth and fifth periodic reports of states parties : Brazil. New York: United Nations, 2002 In 2010, the United Nations ranked Brazil 73rd out of 169 nations based on the Gender Inequality Index, which measure women's disadvantages in the areas of reproductive rights, empowerment and labour force participation. Women's movements in Brazil have traditionally been led and supported by upper middle class women, and tend to be reformist rather than revolutionary in nature, though clear exceptions exist, most notably with regard to agrarian land reform movements.Schmink, Marianne. Women in Brazilian Abertura Politics. Signs. Vol. 7, No. 1 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 115-134 Though suffrage was granted to women in Brazil in the 1930s, it was not until the 1970s and onwards that a broader, more potent women's movement took hold in Brazil. In 1979, the year of its publishing, Brazil signed and ratified CEDAW, a convention by the United Nations that aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. Women in Brazil enjoy the same legal rights and duties as men, which is clearly expressed in the 5th article of Brazil's 1988 Constitution. The World Economic Forum released a study indicating that Brazil had virtually eradicated gender differences in education and health treatment, but that women lagged behind in salaries and political influence. According to the Labor and Employment Ministry, women were paid 30 percent less than men. In 2005, UN Special Rapporteur Despouy noted a strikingly low level of women's representation in the judicial system, where women occupied \\"only 5 percent of the top posts in the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor's Office.\\"Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Brazil. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Many women have been elected mayors and many women have been federal judges. The first female assumed office in the Senate in 1979. Women became candidates for vice president for the first time in 1994. As of 2009, 9% of the seats in the national parliament were held by women. Suffrage movement Bertha Lutz in 1925, leading figure of the feminist movement in Brazil Women in Brazil were granted the right to vote in 1932. Though a feminist movement had existed in Brazil since the mid- nineteenth century and women did petition for suffrage to be included in the 1891 Republican Constitution, the drive towards enfranchisement only began in earnest under the leadership of feminist, biologist and lawyer, Bertha Lutz. Following the publication of an article in leading Brazilian newspaper Revista da Semana, which called upon women to prove their worthiness to men through their achievements and organize in order to demand the right to vote, various women's organizations appeared. Lutz founded her own organization in conjunction with American suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in 1922, the Brazilian Federation for the Advancement of Women, which would become the leading suffrage organization of Brazil and was affiliated with the International Women's Suffrage Alliance. Brazilian suffragettes were literate, professional women who made up only a small percentage of the female population in Brazil, the latter which remained largely illiterate. Hence, the campaign for suffrage was by no means a mass movement, and was decidedly moderate in nature. The conservative character of the suffrage movement provoked little resistance from government, and suffrage was declared by Get√∫lio Vargas in 1932 and later confirmed in the 1934 Constitution. Two years after women's suffrage was declared in the 5th Constitution of Brazil, two women were elected to Congress, ten females were elected mayors and assemblywomen, and thirty women were made councilwomen in Brazil. Though government jobs had been available to women in the past, women had not held electoral positions until after suffrage was won and the number of women in government continued to grow throughout the twentieth century. Constitutional rights =5th Constitution of 1934= Appointed by the Provisional Government in 1933 to draft the first page of the new Constitution, Bertha Lutz included various provisions to promote equal rights between men and women. Not only were women granted the equal right to hold government office and earn equal pay for equal work, but also were given preference over men in all government jobs dealing with the home, motherhood, children, and working conditions for women. The preferential treatment afforded to women in regard to certain government positions was controversial at the time. =Citizens' Constitution of 1988= The Citizens' Constitution declared women equal to men in all legal respects, explicitly stating in Article 5 of Title II that \\"men and women have equal rights and duties under the terms of this Constitution.\\" The National Council on Women's Rights, formed in 1975, advocated successfully on behalf of including gender conscious legislation in the new constitution.Deere, Carmen Diana. Empowering Women: Land and Property Rights in Latin America. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. At the suggestion of the Council, a clause was added to the document announcing that land distributed by agrarian reform could be assigned and titled \\"in the name of the man, woman, or both, independent of civil status.\\" This was the first time in Brazilian history that women could legally be named beneficiaries of agrarian reform measures. The 1988 constitution also declared for the first time that urban and rural women and men had the same rights to social security benefits.Dore, Elizabeth. Gender Politics in Latin America: Debates in Theory and Practice. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1997. Despite the declaration of such rights, as of 2000, institutions had not been established to enable or enforce gender equality in land reform. Furthermore, the Constitution promised \\"....protection of the labour market for women through specific incentives, as provided by law\\", and established a minimum required maternity leave of one hundred and twenty days and the introduction of paternity leave. Economic rights Brazilian girl in Sao Francisco do Sul, Brazil Export agriculture and largely feminized labor forces in Latin America has expanded significantly in the last three decades. Research has illustrated how farms in northeast Brazil purposefully construct gendered divisions of labor and how women often experience worse pay and conditions than men. According to The World Bank, 42% of people employed in the non-agricultural sector were women. The law provides 120 days of paid maternity leave to women and seven days to men. The law also prohibits employers from requiring applicants or employees to take pregnancy tests or present sterilization certificates, but some employers sought sterilization certificates from female job applicants or tried to avoid hiring women of childbearing age. Violations of the law are punishable by jail terms for employers of up to two years, while the company may be fined 10 times the salary of its highest-paid employee. Sexual harassment is a criminal offense, punishable by up to two years in jail. The law encompasses sexual advances in the workplace or in educational institutions and between service providers or clients. In the workplace it applies only in hierarchical situations, where the harasser is of higher rank or position than the victim. Although the legislation exists and was enforced, accusations remained rare, and the extent of the problem was not documented. =Property rights= Though women possess significant property rights under the current Brazilian Constitution, de facto inheritance and land reform regimes undermine women's ability to acquire and retain property in Brazil. Under the Civil Code of Brazil, married women could not lawfully acquire or possess their own property until 1962.Crake, Nikki, and Maxine Molyneux. Gender and the Politics of Rights and Democracy in Latin America. New York: Palgrave, 2002. The inheritance law differs based on matrimonial regimes, of which there are four: Partial Property Ruling (Comunh√£o Parcial), Community Property Ruling (Comunh√£o de Bens), Separate Property Ruling (Separa√ß√£o de Bens), Final Partition of Acquisitions (Participa√ß√£o Final dos Aq√ºestos). These were unfavorable to women, although they have been reformed in the 21st century. The regimes have been criticized as positioning widows as mere custodians of property for children, rather than legitimate property owners. Indeed, studies show that a woman's ability to exercise her right to inherited property is largely influenced by whether she is viewed as a potential agriculturalist. Women are often denied access to inherited property because they do not inherit from their fathers and are not recognized as worthy heads of productive units. Though consensual unions were recognized by the 1988 Constitution, women in consensual unions were not endowed with the same inheritance rights as married women until 1994. With the return to civilian rule in 1985, President Jos√© Sarney made the more equitable distribution of land one of his attested objectives, issuing a directive to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform and Land Development in 1986 urging that beneficiaries of land be chose \\"independently of sex.\\" In conjunction with the democratic opening of the 1980s, a rural women's movement emerged with calls for inclusion of women in rural unions and guarantee of social security benefits, such as paid maternity leave and retirement pensions, for rural women. The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), which is the largest organization of agricultural workers in Brazil, tackled women's rights for the first time during its fourth congress in 1985, when it decided to extend membership to more women and actively work to end gender discrimination. Demands for more equitable agrarian property rights, championed by organizations such as the Central Workers' Union, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Women's Council led to agrarian reform measures in the 1988 Constitution.Eva Alterman Blay. \\"Social Movements and Women's Participation in Brazil.\\" International Political Science Review. Vol. 6. No. 3. Women in Politics (1985). pp. 297-305. Grievances regarding equal land distribution in Brazil continued, evident in the Marcha da Margaridas of 2000, in which over fifteen thousand women marched on the capital to demand joint allocation of land to couples, rather than just men. The 2003 Civil Code improved women's rights, providing for gender equality in the acquisition, management, and administration of property brought into the union or acquired after marriage.http://usaidlandtenure.net/sites/default/files/country- profiles/full-reports/USAID_Land_Tenure_Brazil_Profile.pdf However customary rules continue to be applied in practice, especially in rural areas, undermining women's property rights. =Employment and contracts= Though large segments of the female population remained illiterate through the turn of the century, a growing number of middle-class women began to pursue higher education and work outside of the home. Many early female workers found employment in schools, government and commercial offices. The formation of the Union of Professional Women in the 1920s, which embraced university and professional women, played a large role in the suffrage movement. By 1936, over a million Brazilian women worked outside the home, which led to changing perceptions of women's family roles and a remodeling of the nation's commercial usages. Despite the growing number of women in the workforce, women's employment remained highly segregated based on perceptions of appropriate work for women. Up until the 1950s, domestic service was the largest category of female employment, with most other women engaged in government bureaucracy, social services, as well as other informal labor. Women's labor rights were not fully addressed until 1978, with the passage of a law declaring that women be paid equally for equal work, which was confirmed in the 1988 Constitution. Working-class women began to organize on behalf of women's issues in the 1970s. Working-class women's organizations, such as the Housewives‚Äô Association of S√£o Paulo and the Mothers‚Äô Club of S√£o Paulo, became increasingly important arenas for women to express grievances with regard to informal care work and the cost of urban living. Women's involvement and leadership among unions have been less successful, as is the case in other Latin American countries. The first Congress of Female Metalworkers of S√£o Paulo, held in 1978, was harassed and threatened by employers to the extent that only 300 of the 800 women who had signed up actually attended to conference. Current female participation in the Brazilian labor market is 65 percent for women compared to 85 percent for men. Domestic workers have become increasingly organized through global professional networks and trade unions, though domestic labor remains a significant, and vastly under-regulated, form of work for women. =Prostitution and sex workers' rights= Though the exchange of money for sex is legal in Brazil, it is illegal to operate a brothel or employ prostitutes and such offenses are punishable by up to five years in jail. Prostitution is not considered a profession and hence sex workers do not have labor rights. Fernando Gabeira, founder of the Green Party, recently introduced a piece of legislation to Congress to establish prostitution as a recognized profession, however the bill was defeated in 2007. The Center for the Study of Prostitution (NEP), which is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Brazil's National Network of Sex Professionals, continues to advocate on behalf of the recognition of prostitution as a profession under standard labor and social security laws. These organizations have played a significant role in public health initiatives aimed at preventing and treating HIV/AIDS. Carmen Lucia Paz, a former prostitute and researcher at NEP, has become one of the most vocal champions of sex worker rights in Brazil.Alessandra S. Chacham, Simone G. Diniz, et al. \\"Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs of Sex Workers: Two Feminist Projects in Brazil.\\" Reproductive Health Matters. Vol. 15. No. 29. (May, 2007). pp. 108-118 Education As far as education is concerned, the literacy rate for women is similar to that of men. The literacy rate (defined as 15 years of age or older with the ability to read and write) was estimated in 2010 as 90.7% female and 90.1% male.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/fields/2103.html Women already represent more than a majority in many of the college courses. In the areas of Health and Human Sciences, they account for 66% and 71% of all students, respectively. As a whole, 53% of all Brazilians who are in universities are women. The progress in education for women started some decades ago. Since the 1930s women have had a higher number of years in school, on average, than men when it refers to the lower levels of scholarity. Since the 1970s, they surpassed men in the higher levels. Until the mid-to-late nineteenth century, education for girls focused on domestic skills.Lind, pg. 87. In 1879, Brazilian institutions of higher learning admitted upper-class, mostly urban, white women- while the rest of the female population remained illiterate.Lind, pg. 87. Currently the literacy rates between men and women are relatively proportionate to the populationLind, pg. 87. and the level of education of women is now greater than that of men. In 1970, there were approximately 19,000 women professionals in Brazil, including engineers, architects, dentists, economists, professors, lawyers, and doctors. By 1980, there were about 95,800 women in these fields.Winter. At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, psychology, literature, and arts classes are composed almost entirely of women, in contrast to agriculture and national defense courses, in which extremely low numbers of women are enrolled.Neft, Naomi; Levine, Ann D. (1997). Where Women Stand: An International Report on the Status of Women in 140 Countries. Random House. pp. 210-220. Family =Marriage= The legal minimum age for marriage without parents assistancy is 18 for both women and men. The average age at first marriage is 22.6 years for women and 25.3 years for men. In the past, under Brazil's civil code, the husband was the legal head of the family, with complete authority over children and family decisions. Nowadays the things are pretty different, in the first article of Civil Code Article of 2002 the new direction the current legal is clear demonstrated by the replacement if the expression \\"every man\\" for \\"everyone\\". The legislature recognized that civil now a consensus that both, man and woman shall enjoy the same privileges and responsibilities towards the society, therefore, are equally responsible, or is obliged, in proportion to their property, and the support of the charges family and children's education. They also have the option to add the surname of male to female or the female in the male. It is not mandatory. Through marriage, man and woman mutually assume the condition spouses, among these duties are loyalty, which is maintaining monogamous relationship, mutual fidelity, living together in the marital home; mutual assistance; support, custody and education of children; mutual respect and consideration. =Divorce= Divorce became legal in Brazil in 1977, with the law permitting each person only one divorce in a lifetime and only after a three -year legal or five-year de facto separation. This condition was lifted in 1988. Men can remarry immediately after the divorce papers are signed, but women must delay their marriage for 270 days. Religion and spirituality Women during a Candombl√© ceremony in Bahia. Women have been suppressed and excluded from participation in public activity in Roman Catholic institutions in Brazil. It has been a history of limitations, but with an exception: women, particularly those of indisputable African lineage, have dominated the syncretistic Afro-Brazilian religious groups. There are Afro-Brazilian religions that combine elements of African tribal religions, Amerindian religions, Catholicism, and Kardecism (French Spiritism) that are women centered.Burn, Shawn Meghan. Women Across Cultures. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2005. Print. The main features include curing and public rituals in which female mediums are possessed by spirits. These religions coexist with Catholicism. Reproductive rights Guajajara mother with child in Maranh√£o Reproductive rights are a critical issue in Brazil. Major health problems have been caused by back-street abortions and attempts to make sterilization the main form of contraception for women.Caipora Women's Group. Women in Brazil. London: Latin America Bureau (Research and Action), 1993. Print. The oldest and largest foreign-funded private organization with a population control program is the Family Welfare in Brazil (BEMFAM), which is funded by the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Notably, Brazil's birth rate is well below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. While adult prostitution is legal, various associated activities, such as operating a brothel, are illegal. While no specific laws address sex tourism, it is punishable under other criminal offenses, such as pedophilia and corruption of minors. The government released a \\"code of conduct to combat sex tourism and sexual exploitation\\" and conducted campaigns in the most affected areas. The states of Pernambuco, Esp√≠rito Santo, Amazonas and Paran√° and the Federal District enacted laws requiring certain businesses to display signs listing the penalties for having intercourse with a minor. Rio de Janeiro and Bahia states had previously enacted similar legislation. Women's groups reported that prostitutes encountered discrimination when seeking free medical care. Trafficking of women for the purpose of prostitution is a serious problem, and it is known that international criminal groups and mafias are involved in this activity. =Contraception= Until the legalization of contraceptives in the early twentieth century, Brazilian law placed contraception, abortion and immorality in the same classification. Three factors that have impacted contraceptive laws on Brazil are the influence of the Catholic Church, the legacy of Iberian culture, and the historically conservative approach to the status of women in Latin America. Bem-Estar Familiar no Brasil (BEMFAM), which is funded by the International Planned Parenthood Federation, is the leading NGO in the country dedicated to family planning.Stephan, Jan and Edmond H. Kellogg. \\"The World's Laws on Contraceptives.\\" The American Journal of Comparative Law. Vol. 22. No. 4. (Autumn 1974) pp. 615-651. A laissez-faire attitude adopted on the part of the Brazilian government in the 1960s has led to the predominance of private organizations in the provision of family planning services.Petchesky, Rosalind and Karen Judd. Negotiating Reproductive Rights: Women's perspective across countries and cultures. New York: Zed Books, 1998. The government has taken measure to extend planning to poorer Brazilians by subsidizing birth control pills and sterilization at government clinics. The current birth rate in Brazil is at a replacement rate of about 2.18 births per woman estimated for the year 2011. Brazil has witnessed one of the most dramatic reductions in family size in modern history in part due to increased access to family planning services. Indeed, the fertility rate in Brazil has steadily decreased over the past four decades due in some measure to the growing use of contraceptives, sterilization and abortion. =Sterilization= Sterilization has become increasingly popular in Brazil since it became legal and free for women over 25 in 1996, and is regulated by the Health Ministry. It had already been a popular practice among poor communities before the legalization of sterilization, and was practiced in private clinics. In 1994, over sixty percent of women in Goi√°s, and over seventy percent of women in Maranh√£o and Mato Grosso were sterilized. After the 1996 law, sterilization became part of the population control policy of the Brazilian government.Caetano, Andr√© J. and Joseph E. Potter. Politics and Female Sterilization in Northeast Brazil. Population and Development Review. Vol. 30, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 79-108 Though some view sterilization as an inexpensive form of birth control and a useful tool in population control, others see the mass use of sterilization in Brazil as contrary to promoting women's choices in contraceptive use. Sterilization is most common among Afro-Brazilians in the Northeast of the country who are too poor to afford other types of contraception and uneducated on the long term consequences of sterilization. Scholars such as Andre Caetano and Joseph E. Potter claim that sterilization has been used as a political means of garnering votes while controlling population growth among poor, minority populations. The prevalence of female sterilization in Brazil is among the highest in the world. The most widely used method of contraception in 1996, relied on by 40% of women in union, was female sterilization. This single method was responsible for more than half (52%) of all contraceptive use in Brazil. The only other method used by a considerable proportion of women was the pill (21%). According to a 1996 study, \\"sterilized women who were young at the time they had the surgery and those who had limited knowledge of sterilization and other contraceptive options are more likely than other women to seek a reversal of the procedure.\\" A 2003 study in Campinas concluded that \\"in order to reduce the number of young women who choose surgical sterilization over equally effective, but reversible methods, it is necessary to act early in life.\\" =Abortion= Abortion is illegal in Brazil except for the case of rape, when the mother's life is in danger or in cases of fetuses with anencephaly which was recently adapted in 2012. Though abortions are against the law, it is estimated that over one million abortions are performed in Brazil each year, though data on abortion incidence is not systemically collected. Over two hundred thousand women are treated for abortion complications each year in Brazilian hospitals.IPAS.org The punishment for a woman performing an abortion on herself or consenting to an abortion is one to three years of imprisonment. The punishment for those performing abortions is one to four years of imprisonment, and this number increases by one-third if harm is caused to the women or one-half if the abortion leads to the death of the woman.Reed Boland, The Current Status of Abortion Laws in Latin America: Prospects and Strategies for Change, The Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics, vol. 21, issue 69, Spring 1993. Feminist movement activists go on the streets since June 4, 2011 to protest against the law that makes abortion illegal. The protest is called \\"Marcha Das Vadias\\" which was inspired by the Canadian protest that happened in Toronto, Canada two months prior with the same intents. The new President Jair Bolsonaro elected on October 28, 2018 chose the pastor Damares Alves as the Minister of Women, Family and Human's Rights of Brazil. Alves claims the new government wishes a Brazil a \\"country without abortions\\" but the previous exceptions will not be changed. In early August 2020, a 10-year-old girl discovered that she was pregnant after being repeatedly raped for 4 years by her uncle. The pregnancy‚Äôs threat to her life led the girl‚Äôs parents to decide upon aborting the child. According to Brazilian law, abortion is legal, in cases of rape & when the mother‚Äôs life is in danger However, taking court‚Äôs permission beforehand is necessary. The anti-abortion activist published the girl‚Äôs name and hospital‚Äôs name which agreed to do the abortion. The protestors then blocked the hospital from being accessed and harassed the hospital staff. However, the girl finally succeeded in reaching the hospital, hiding in a truck and got the abortion performed on 17 August 2020. Rape and sexual violence =Sexual harassment= Views on sexual harassment in Brazil have been influenced by both culture and sexual harassment laws, making for a disconnect between official regulations and general attitudes. Researcher Rebecca Merkin found that unlike their American counterparts, Brazilian women do not express decreased job satisfaction when faced with sexual harassment, illuminating the greater acceptability of sexual harassment in Brazil as compared to the United States.Merkin, R. \\"South American perspectives on sexual harassment: The standpoint in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile\\", Journal of Behavioral and Applied Management, 10. 2009, 357-376. Following the passage of the 1988 Constitution, a law was passed in 1991 outlawing sexual harassment and making it a crime punishable by a fine of up to $20,000. In 2001, a contentious law was passed under the civil code raising the punishment for sexual harassment to one to two years of jail time. Despite the presence of strict regulations, Brazil has one of the worst reputations in the world in terms of the harassment of women in the workplace and in the home. Fiedler and Blanco assert that men rarely follow sexual harassment laws, and that few sexual harassment cases have been brought to trial in Brazil. In 2015 Brazil was stated as the sixth most violent country when the subject is rape. It is only behind El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago. =Age of consent and statutory rape= The age of consent in Brazil is 14, regardless of gender or sexual orientation and any type of sexual activity is permitted after the age of 18. Statutory rape can only be committed by those above the age of 18, and is punishable by 8 to 15 years imprisonment. However, according to US State Department, men who have killed, sexually assaulted, or committed other crimes against women are unlikely to be brought to trial. Brazil has recently overtaken Thailand as the world's most popular destination for sex tourism, which involves travel for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with prostitutes. Sex tourism is most common in the Northeast of Brazil, especially in the city of Fortaleza, where child prostitution is rampant. While no specific laws address sex tourism, it is punishable under other criminal offenses, such as pedophilia and corruption of minors. The government released a \\"code of conduct to combat sex tourism and sexual exploitation\\" and conducted campaigns in the most affected areas, which are predominantly in the Northeastern region of the country. The states of Pernambuco, Espirito Santo, Amazonias, Parana and the Federal District enacted laws requiring certain businesses to display signs listing the penalties for having intercourse with a minor. =Domestic violence= Between 10 and 15 women are murdered per day in Brazil.\\"Brazil femicide law signed by President Rousseff\\", BBC News, 10 March 2015. \\"Study: In Brazil, 10 women killed daily in domestic violence\\", Helena de Moura, CNN, July 12, 2010. A government sponsored study found that 41,532 women were murdered in Brazil between 1997 and 2007. Domestic violence was not a part of the Brazilian criminal code until 2006, when the federal criminal domestic violence code was passed by President Lula.Roure, Jody G. \\"Domestic Violence in Brazil: Examining Obstacles and Approaches to Promote Legislative Reform\\" Columbia Human Rights Law Review. Vol. 41 No. 67. Fall 2009 The Law of Domestic and Family Violence was the first official codification of domestic violence crimes, and tripled the previous punishments associated with domestic violence. Brazil's adoption of the domestic violence code was mainly influenced by its participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the urging of the international legal community, and the tenacity of local grassroots movements. The formation of women's police units and a federally funded hotline to serve victims of gender violence have significantly advanced the protections offered to women in Brazil, though domestic violence in Brazil remains prevalent and thus a major obstacle in attaining equal rights for women. In 2015, Brazil enacted a law against femicide. Sports It was illegal for women to play soccer in Brazil from 1941 to 1979. Racial differences There are serious and controversial issues about differences in the situation of women with different races and ethnicities in Brazil. As a whole, black and Amerindian women enjoy considerably less quality of life than white women, with this being a reflection of the general characteristics of the social and economic gap that has separated social classes in Brazil for centuries, thus not indicating any specific problem about gender and women's rights. Black women's life expectancy in 2004 was 69.52 years, while white women could expect to live 73.80 on average. However, there is, at least apparently, no legal or institutional circumstance that generates those ethnic differences, but lower standards of life have always been related to a much larger percentage of mulatto, black and Amerindian people in Brazil, as in many other countries. In the last years, there is a tendency of soft decrease in Brazil's racial inequality.PNUD Brasil Human rights The human rights movement has had a significant impact on the women's rights movement since the 1970s, when the human rights emerged as an ideology and practice of development.Moyn, Samuel. The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2011 Hence, the women's movement in Brazil has often been understood in the larger context of a push towards greater political participation and socioeconomic equality. Since the explosion of human rights, women's movements in Brazil have become more connected with broader political issues, and have been articulated within the context of more general social issues related to democratization and socioeconomic inequality. Most of those women involved in the feminist movement of the 1970s were also involved in other political movements, such as the human rights movement, and the formation of leftist political parties. The Amnesty International movement was one that gained much support from feminists, evident in the establishment of the Feminine Movement for Amnesty of the 1970s. At the same time, feminist movements have attempted to maintain balance between their specific goals and wider political demands. Despite the influence of the human rights movement upon women's movements in Brazil, women's rights were not internationally recognized as human rights until the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, held by the United Nations in Vienna.http://www.unfpa.org/rights/women/htm Key activists and organizations * N√≠sia Floresta * Bertha Lutz * Brazilian Federation for the Advancement of Women * Carmen Luc√≠a Paz * National Council on Women * Feminine Movement for Amnesty * Center for the Development of Brazilian Women * Union of Professional Women * Brazilian Women's Center * Family Welfare in Brazil (BEM-FAM) * National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG) * Center for the Study of Prostitution (NEP) * Brazil's National Network of Sex Professionals See also * Feminism in Brazil References External links Category:Women's rights in the Americas Category:Women in Brazil Category:Feminism in Brazil ","title":"Women's rights in Brazil"},{"id":"33621571","text":"Sengele is a Bantu language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

At the 2006 census, its population was 19,535, in 5,693 families. Welcome to Rudehen. Rudehen is located just past the fork between Haraz and Firoozkooh roads. The Alborz mountain range sits to the North. It is surrounded by mountains to the North, and Mt. Ghorch, Mt. Soori, and others to the South separating it from the central plateau of Iran. It is 1850 meters above the sea level and has a total area of 50 square kilometers. Before the construction of Tehran- Mazandaran Road, the area was called Damavand in historic reference. After the construction of the road in 1903, however, Rudehen was referred to as a place for rest midway of the road. As an example, in Matla-ol-shams written by Sani- al-doleh, it reads: \\"Rudehen is about 3 kilometers away from Bumahen near the Ah river and is on the left side of the road. It has 15 families, all are immigrants from Urmieh. Sani-al-doleh in 1875 and British Oliver Darsi in 1830 both passed the road and mentioned the name of the villages which are now part of the town or the surrounding areas. In the eastern part, the village of Kreiton and Ana building complex are now part of Rudehen. The villages of Mehrabad and Golahak are being encroached upon by development accelerated by the construction of the Islamic Azad University. Rudehen's municipality was founded in 1965. According to the national census in 1976, the population of Rudehen and suburb was 5237 out of which 6.57% were inhabited in the town and the rest in the surrounding villages. Rudehen had a population of 12000 when the Islamic Azad University (IAU) was founded in 1983. They were mostly local established families who, until the university development, remained comprised the village population. Local commuting patterns, housing, and job development increased dramatically with the establishment of the Islamic Azad University. (Prepared by M.

He was invited by Joe Zawinul to play at his concert at the Parc Floral Paris 2002, but he could not honour the invitation. Since 2004, he has lived and performed in Madagascar, where he created the \\"Vatomanga Band\\" which appeared for the first time in quartet form during the Madajazzcar Festival 2005 and gradually enlarged to a septet after 2010. In 2011, the band took the name MadaJazz.MadaJazz  Biography  = Early life = Vatomanga started with classical music at age four at the National Center for Music education (CNEM) in Antananarivo, Madagascar. He was taught by Mrs Alisera and Seta Ramaroson Andrianary (flutist, saxophonist and composer), both renowned teachers there. Choosing the flute as his first instrument, Vatomanga continued training with Seta at the Cercle Germano-Malagasy (CGM) of Antananarivo. A precocious child, he composed for piano at age eight and played frequently in classical concerts (NCCM, CGM) from age ten. His mother, he claimed, had a great influence on his tastes and his passion for music: classical music, blues, gospel and traditional Malagasy music (such as the hira gasy, the Kalon'ny Fahiny, Ny Antsaly, Rakotozafy and Rakoto Frah in particular); she learned to play valiha (the Malagasy bamboo zither) when he started on flute. = Jazz = At age fourteen, at Seta's invitation, Vatomanga attended a concert given by American saxophonist and flutist of Caribbean origin, TK Blue (Talib Kibwe). Following the concert, he learned on the flute, from ear and by heart, the theme and the solo of \\"Pinnacle of Joy\\"Pinnacle of Joy of the album Egyptian Oasis (1987) of the American jazzmen. He, therefore, decided to learn the saxophone and a new form of expression for him: improvised music. Seta, also a jazz saxophonist,Annick Sedson, \\"Seta Ramaroson duet with Raphael Sudan\\", in the new, August 16, 2011 taught him jazz basics, especially harmonization of improvisation. Further encouraged by Silo Andrianandraina (also a young Malagasy jazzman), a friend from second class in high school, Vatomanga listened and explored the world of jazz fundamentals, particularly through the works of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, George Shearing, Oscar Peterson, Sonny Rollins, Stan Getz, Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and John Coltrane. \\"Trane\\" in particular became a great influence. Attuned to his African roots, he listened to South African jazz, including Makeba, Hugh Masekela and Bheki Mseleku.\\"Bheki Mseleku, South African Jazz Pianist,\\" in The Independent, 16 September 2008, daily At age fifteen, he began learning the saxophone in a band with Solomiral, an Antananarivo jazz fusion band, then informally with Toty Band and a more traditional music group from Southern Madagascar, Tsimihole. In 1992, he participated in his first Madajazzcar Festival, accompanied by an informal group created for the occasion. Bassist Olver \\"Toty\\" Andriamampianina became Vatomanga's second mentor. Seta and Toty provided him constant encouragements to pursue a musical career. Throughout the years of his BSc diploma, he attended the Jazz Club of Mahamasina, founded by pianist and composer Sammy Andriamanoro.Anjara Rasoanaivo, \\"Sammy Andriamanoro: a musical genius full of humility\\" in Midi Madagasikara 'August 7, 2009, daily Sammy taught him jazz standards for one year. After earning his BSc in 1993, Vatomanga enrolled in Mathematics at the University of Aix- Marseille III (France) and completed two years of courses, while continuing his music. In 1994 he passed the entrance examination at the Conservatoire d'Aix-en-Provence where he studied jazz for a year, alongside math. During this period, he met Alain \\"Belain\\" Rabeson, cousin of drummer Tony Rabeson. Bassist, drummer and jazz teacher, Belain invited him to play in his Bossa Nova and Samba band. Accompanied on drums by Belain, in 1995 he entered Conservatoire √† Rayonnement R√©gional de Marseille ‚Äì jazz section - where he studied for one year. Under Belain's coaching, in 1996 he entered the American School of Modern Music of Paris (affiliate of Berklee College of Music) where he covered the course in three years instead of five. There, he deepened his skills in composition, arrangement and conducting. In the fifth year, he received a scholarship to pursue a final year at Berklee, but declined.

She also wrote four novels; some critics have drawn parallels between the events in these novels and her relationship with Thackeray. Biography Brookfield was born on 25 March 1821, the youngest daughter of Sir Charles Abraham Elton, a former soldier. She lived with her seven sisters and five brothers, along with her father and mother Sarah in Clevedon Court, near Bristol. Sir Charles was a published author, writing an elegy about two of his sons who had drowned in the Bristol Channel, and was friends with both Charles Lamb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1837, the family moved to Southampton, and due to Jane's height her father nicknamed her \\"Glumdalclitch\\". In 1838 she was courted by and became engaged to William Henry Brookfield, the priest at the local church, twelve years her senior. After he found a better job, as curate of St James's Church, Piccadilly, the couple married on 18 November 1841. Jane maintained an influential literary salon, which included among others Thackeray and her husband's old college friend Alfred Tennyson. It was her close friendship with Thackeray for which she is best remembered and in the mid-1840s they were on intimate terms. D. J. Taylor in her biography in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states \\"the relationship between him and Jane was almost certainly not sexual (there may have been a chaste embrace or two ...)\\". Thackeray incorporated some of her characteristics into two of his characters: Amelia Sedley in Vanity Fair (1848), and Laura Bell in Pendennis (1850). In 1851, William Brookfield barred Thackeray from further visits to or correspondence with Jane. The friendship was never renewed; Thackeray's health worsened steadily through the 1850s and he died in 1863. Jane Brookfield wrote four novels that were published several years after Thackeray's death, all between 1868 and 1873. Some critics have seen echoes of the friendship with Thackeray in these novels. She ceased writing after her husband died in 1874. Jane herself died in 1896 at the age of 75. Family The couple were survived by their two sons Arthur Montagu Brookfield (1853‚Äì1940) who became a British army officer, diplomat author and Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1903; and Charles Hallam Elton Brookfield (1857‚Äì1913) an actor.

The building is at 1200 U Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. in the U Street Corridor (Cardozo/Shaw) neighborhood. It was designed by John Anderson Lankford. The building was commissioned by the Grand United Order of True Reformers in 1902. It was dedicated on July 15, 1903. History The Grand United Order of True Reformers started as a temperance organization and in 1876 Browne was invited to spearhead a new branch of the movement in Richmond, Virginia. When interest in the organization began to decrease Browne began shifting the organization from a temperance society to an insurance organization, a movement that required Browne to move to Richmond in 1880. Over time the organization grew in size to where it managed a bank, ran a newspaper entitled the Reformer, owned several properties, and at one point in time was the largest black fraternal society and black-owned business in the United States. During the True Reformer Building's dedication in 1903, the Reverend William Lee Taylor stated that the goal was to \\"put up a building in Washington that would reflect credit upon the Negro race.\\" It is significant that the building took shape as a result of an African American architect, with African American financing, and built with African American hands. The Reformer Building was the first building in the United States to be designed, financed, built, and owned by the African American community after Reconstruction. It was designed by John Anderson Lankford, the city‚Äôs first African-American registered architect. The building was commissioned by the Grand United Order of True Reformers in 1902 and was dedicated on July 15, 1903. In 1909 a book was published about the organization's first 25 years. During Browne's life the organization enjoyed success, however it suffered crippling setbacks in 1910 due to employee embezzlement and businesses defaulting on large unsecured loans, causing its collapse. A.W. Holmes was president of the group in 1911 as retrenchment was sought and board membership included Adolphus Humbles of Lynchburg, Virginia. Ownership changes As seen from Ben's Chili Bowl in 2007 with Duke Ellington mural (now gone) The Knights of Pythias bought the building in 1917. From 1937 to 1959, the Boys Club of the Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia, leased the building; Eleanor Roosevelt rededicated the building. Other tenants have included: Washington Conservancy, the DC Chapter of the National Negro Business League, the First Separate Battalion. Duke Ellington gave his first performance here. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The Public Welfare Foundation bought it in 1999. It was renovated from the winter of 2000 until February 2001 according to designs by Sorg & Associates. Public art Duke Ellington Mural G. Byron Peck's mural to Duke Ellington on the side of the building used to overlook the U Street Metro station. It was completed in 1997, and located on the sidewall of Mood Indigo. It was relocated to the True Reformer Building.http://murallocator.org/2010/01/duke-ellington-mural/ The mural was removed in 2012 for restoration.

The 541 page novel, inspired by classic fantasy novels and folk tales, is the story of two seventh-graders who are drawn into a hidden, magical forest, while trying to rescue a baby kidnapped by crows. They get caught up in an epic struggle, and learn of their connection to a magical parallel world while confronting adult authorities who are often cowardly or dishonest. The natural beauty and local color of Portland, Oregon, features prominently in the book. Ellis collaborated closely with Meloy throughout the writing phase to produce 85 illustrations, which, along with the old-fashioned book design, were particularly praised by reviewers. The majority of reviews were positive, on balance, saying the book was an engrossing story appropriate for its target age, but they also noted that the plot sometimes dragged, that familiar fantasy motifs were sometimes overused, and that stereotypical Portland culture was a little overplayed. Wildwood was on the New York Times Best Seller list of Children's Chapter Books for two weeks and tied for the 2012 E.B. White Read Aloud Award. Plot =Part One= Prue is in a park with Mac when \\"a murder of crows\\" swoops down and carries him away. Prue runs after him (followed by her classmate Curtis), and sees the crows carry him into the Impassable Wilderness. Prue goes home to her parents and manages to make it look like she still has Mac. The next morning, she heads for the Wilderness, but discovers Curtis has once more followed her. Prue does not want Curtis along, but before she can send him back, they are separated while fleeing from Coyote Soldiers. Curtis is captured and taken to Alexandra (the leader of the coyotes), while Prue rides a mail truck to South Wood. There, Prue finds a Kafkaesque bureaucracy and dysfunctional government. Police state tactics and paranoia over foreign threats are used to keep the regime in power. Prue eventually meets the Crown Prince Owl Rex of the Avian Principality, who tells her how Alexandra came to be exiled shortly before he himself is arrested. Alexandra's son Alexei died in a horse-riding accident, and then her husband Grigor died of heartbreak; to remedy his death, Alexandra hired the two greatest toymakers in all of Wildwood to fashion her son a new body that was later brought to life by recalling his soul via Black Magic. Later Alexei learned the truth of his death and rebirth and purposefully destroyed a crucial part of his inner workings, resulting in his second death. Alexandra was exiled for the use of Black Magic and plotted her revenge. Owl Rex proposes that Prue cross Wildwood and find help from the Mystics of North Wood. Meanwhile, Alexandra is flattering Curtis with a fancy uniform and commissions him into the coyote army as an officer. In a battle against bandits, Curtis breaks a howitzer by dumb luck, becoming a coyote war hero in the operation. He then finds Mac in Alexandra's headquarters and she shows him her plan to sacrifice the baby to the magical ivy of the Wood, which will allow the ivy to spread rapidly and consume the Wood and its inhabitants. Alexandra offers to share the power with Curtis, but he says no and is locked away in a cage suspended from the ceiling with some other captured bandits and unfaithful coyotes. =Part Two= Prue flies to North Wood on the back of an eagle sent by Owl Rex, but is shot down by a coyote archer. She is found by Brendan, the King of the Bandits, who offers to help. However, they are captured in a coyote attack and Brendan is imprisoned with Curtis while Prue is taken to Alexandra. Alexandra promises her that she will find Mac, convincing Prue to leave the Woods. In prison, Curtis reveals Alexandra's plan and then leads an escape, earning the trust of the coyote and bandit prisoners. Prue returns home, where she learns from her parents that they were only able to conceive Prue and Mac because they had made a deal with Alexandra to use her magic, but that Alexandra's price was the second child that Prue's mother bore. Realizing that she has been tricked, Prue returns to Wildwood to rescue Mac. =Part Three= Back in the Impassable Wilderness, Prue travels to see the Mystics in charge of North Wood. Meanwhile, Curtis and the other escapees rejoin the bandits and set out to stop Alexandra. Prue alerts the North Wood Elder Mystic, Iphigenia, to the danger and the citizen militia gather farming implements and kitchen utensils for weapons and march south. Prue rides her bicycle ahead and convinces the bandits to join forces. Just as the sacrifice is about to occur the armies meet in an ivy-filled ruin. Brendan gives a speech to inspire his forces, christening the combined army the Wildwood Irregulars. The Battle for the Plinth ensues, and the Wildwood Irregulars are near defeat. As Alexandra prepares to carry out the sacrifice, Iphigenia confronts her. Curtis and the remnants of the army make a final push, expecting to be cut down when above them the sky is filled with an army of eagles and other birds from the Avians. The battle turns against the coyote army, but Prue discovers that she can control plants the way the Mystics can and uses her new skill to make the tree boughs snatch Mac from Alexandra. Brendan shoots Alexandra with an arrow and the Ivy consumes her. Brendan is now in command of the ivy and is told by Iphigenia to make it sleep, and he does so. The victorious Wildwood Irregulars regroup and press on to the gates of South Wood and demand that the corrupt government resign. As a new, peaceful order begins among the factions of The Wood, Prue and Curtis part ways as new friends: she goes home with Mac while Curtis remains behind to start a new life as a bandit. Characters In Wildwood, everyone is either of The Wood, or is an Outsider, or, in the special case of the protagonists, a \\"half breed\\", that is, an Outsider who is able to enter The Wood. A sort of \\"aura or shine\\" makes it possible to visually identify which of these things a person is. The first human Prue meets in The Wood is an old man driving a mail truck, Richard, the South Wood Postmaster General. She sees in him something she \\"couldn't put her finger on that seemed to exude from him, something that made him seem like no one she'd ever met before. It was a kind of aura or shine, like the way a familiar landscape is transformed in the light of a full moon.\\" The natives of The Wood are consistently able to recognize Prue and Curtis as Outsiders, who ought not to be able to enter through the Periphery Bind surrounding The Wood, while only the people of the pastoral and meditative North Wood can see with an unexplained sense that Prue and Curtis have a dual nature, born outside The Wood yet unhindered by the magical barrier that keeps the Outsiders out. =Prue= Prue McKeel, age 13, is a precocious seventh grader with a talent for nature drawing, an encyclopedic knowledge of birds from a book, and takes Honors English with her classmate Curtis. Like her parents, and Curtis, Prue is \\"very-Portland\\", with stereotypical interests like yoga, vegetarianism, and single-speed bicycles, which she repairs and tunes herself. Prue is decisive, determined, and courageous, finding inspiration in Nancy Drew in her effort to rescue her brother, and along the way, save Curtis and The Wood itself. Unlike Curtis, she is not cowed by anyone, standing up to Lars Svik the Governor-Regent of South Wood, Crown Prince Owl Rex of the Avian Principality, and even the fearsome Alexandra, the Dowager Governess, as well as her parents. Because Prue's birth came about by Alexandra using witchcraft to overcome Prue's parents' difficulty conceiving a child, she shares some essence of The Wood, along with being an Outsider, which is what made it possible for her to cross the magical barrier that protects The Wood. Meloy said that Prue is a composite character, \\"partly Carson as a kid,\\" with her \\"inner world\\" coming from Ellis's childhood. She is also based on the niece of a friend, a girl with \\"an amazing independent streak that we've always admired.\\" =Curtis= Curtis Mehlberg is a 13-year-old, and a seventh grade classmate of Prue's, though not her close friend at the beginning of Wildwood. In the past Prue and Curtis shared an interest in drawing superhero fan art, but Prue has moved on to botanical illustration, leaving Curtis and his love of comic books behind. He is an awkward \\"persecuted loner\\" who lacks Prue's confidence, and is, at first, easily intimidated and manipulated by Prue, Alexandra, and others. He grows in the course of the book, gaining a more definite sense of who he is after being forced to choose sides and stand up to the Dowager Governess Alexandra. His relationship with Alexandra recalls the seduction of Edmund Pevensie by the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. After being hustled into an ill-fitting role as an officer in the coyote army, he inadvertently distinguishes himself in battle. Later, by free choice, he becomes a full member of the bandits, and decides to stay behind with them in Wildwood, even as Prue returns home to St. Johns. Like Prue, Curtis is a \\"half-breed\\" who has a dual nature that allows him to enter The Wood, but the exact nature of this connection not revealed in Wildwood, other than Curtis speculating that he has a strange reclusive aunt, and a number of odd relatives. Curtis's choice to stay in Wildwood leaves behind a grieving family in Portland. Meloy said that reading fantasy stories growing up, about \\"kids going to other worlds or crossing over to another place, it would invariably involve them coming back at the end,\\" and \\"Whenever that character made a choice to come back, it didn't feel true to me for some reason.\\" Meloy wanted to experiment with a character who did what Meloy wanted to do, even though he had a happy childhood and loving family. Meloy was able to connect with Curtis: \\"I think of Curtis as being a version of myself.\\" As a child, Meloy \\"desperately longed to be taken away to another world.\\" =Alexandra= Alexandra, the exiled Dowager Governess of South Wood, is the main antagonist of Wildwood. She is charming and beautiful, and vastly more sophisticated and civilized than her anarchic coyote soldiers she only recently domesticated. In spite of her ruthlessness and murderous intentions, she is a somewhat tragic figure as a grieving mother whose madness is somewhat explained by the loss of her child. Ellis said, of the illustration of Alexandra holding a knife over Mac, \\"as a mom of a little kid, just drawing that made my blood run cold.\\" The action of Wildwood is driven by her plot to take revenge on everyone and everything in The Wood, in which she intends to use Prue's brother Mac as a blood sacrifice in a spell to control The Wood's Ivy, which will then grow out of control and consume every living thing in The Wood. The invasive threat of the magical ivy apocalypse that Alexandra plotted in the book is similar to the threat of an \\"ivy desert\\" monoculture from invasive English ivy (Hedera helix) in the real Forest Park. =The Bandits= The bandits are a small community of thieves led by the Bandit King, Brendan, a wild, tough man, whose curly orange hair is always tangled in leaves and twigs from the forest. Curtis helps him and a few other bandit prisoners escape from Alexandra's prison, and so he is named a bandit. Their small community isn't very thriving, especially with the economy being down. The bandits are threatened by the Dowager Governess' ivy, as well as the whole forest, and so he is cornered into having to fight along the citizens of North Wood and Prue. Setting The St. Johns Bridge. In the universe of Wildwood, this is the Ghost Bridge, existing only when a rune magic spell is cast and not apparent in everyday life. Without the St. Johns Bridge, the impassable Wilderness is all the more isolated. The premise of Wildwood is that Forest Park in Portland is \\"its own secret country, populated by a diverse and strange people\\". The real Forest Park is about long and wide, containing of natural woods, mostly second growth forest with some old growth, all within the city limits. This place fired Meloy's imagination, and the fantasy version of Forest Park is Wildwood's \\"most distinctive element\\". Outsiders, the people of Portland, call it the Impassable Wilderness, and they know it only as a forbidden, taboo area, never visited and rarely spoken of. Children are taught to stay away and even learn, eventually, to stop asking why it is forbidden. Unknown to the Outsiders, it is filled with magical talking animals and people, some living in the pastoral, almost medieval conditions of North Wood, while the country of South Wood is industrialized with technology typical of the 19th and early 20th Century. North Wood and South Wood are separated by Wildwood, an untamed no man's land filled with bandits and ostensibly wild coyotes. Travelers, and the Postmaster's truck, make the risky journey from the northern and southern countries by the Long Road through Wildwood. Tucked between Wildwood and South Wood is the Avian Principality, a nation of birds. Nearly every location in the imaginary setting is carried over from Portland's actual geography. The story begins in the protagonists' neighborhood, St. Johns, before moving across the Willamette River and into the impassable Wilderness, that is, The Wood. Pittock Mansion, located just south of Forest Park, appears under its real name, but serves as the seat of government of South Wood, while the Oregon Zoo is represented as the South Wood Prison. The Audubon Society of Portland is in the approximate location of the Avian Principality. Ellis said there are a number of large trees in Forest Park, but no specific tree served as the model for the North Wood Council Tree. The St. Johns Bridge, is missing and unknown to the people of Wildwood's Portland. The only access Prue and Curtis have to pursue the crows into the impassable Wilderness is a risky dash over the train tracks of the Railroad Bridge, which is based on the Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1. The St. Johns Bridge does appear briefly, as the Ghost Bridge, conjured by a rune magic spell. In a question and answer session with Meloy and Ellis, a young reader suggested the Ghost Bridge could be interpreted as an apparition of a bridge that once existed in the past, implying that Wildwood takes place in our world's future. Meloy replied that this is not the case, and that he has \\"another story in mind\\" as to the origin of the Ghost Bridge, and that Wildwood is meant to be more or less contemporary with our time. A stereotypical view of Portland's youth culture is expressed through Prue, Curtis and Prue's parents. Literary critic Anna Minard describes the kids as \\"bespectacled, bike-riding, vinyl-browsing, Kurosawa-referencing children.\\" Descriptions of real elements of Portland are combined to create what critic Claire Dederer calls a \\"richly satisfying weave of reality and fantasy.\\" Style Wildwood echoes several classic fantasy and children's tales, notably J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth books, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The kidnapping of a child by crows comes from Irish folktales of the Sluagh, and from Maurice Sendak's Outside Over There where a girl rescues her brother kidnapped by goblins. The literary tone of Decemberists songs is apparent in the writing style, with a weakness for the charms of archaic language and sesquipedalianism. Wildwood is more soft fantasy than hard fantasy, in that historical and technological consistency and plausibility are not a high priority, giving the book a whimsical, or stream of consciousness, tone. The factions of The Wood use a variety of anachronistic technologies, including cutlasses, blunderbusses, and flintlocks, concurrent with howitzers and semi-automatic pistols, and vehicles like animal-drawn wagons and carts alongside bicycles, trucks and trains. No attempt was made to maintain a consistent level of technological advancement or to rationalize why a particular piece of equipment was used; rather, Meloy said, they could \\"pick coolest version of whatever piece of technology\\" they wanted, and Ellis said they \\"just picked whatever we liked.\\" When she first meets the South Wood postman Richard, he threatens her with a shotgun, which in the same paragraph is referred to as a double-barrelled rifle, then on the next page it is called a shotgun again. Though the text pointedly mentions Prue's single-speed bicycle, the illustrations twice show her bike having derailleur gears, which are only present on multi-speed bikes. =Illustrations= Carson Ellis's illustrations, ever present on Decemberists album covers, are consistent with the folklore roots of the band's songs, love of nature, and romanticized historical periods, having a dark and playfully macabre tone reminiscent of Edward Gorey and Roald Dahl. Carson Ellis's favorite Wildwood drawing, a badger pulling a rickshaw, was included in the story solely so she could draw it. Ellis said that her favorite drawing among Wildwoods 85 illustrations is of a badger pulling a rickshaw, a relatively minor illustration compared with the full page color plates depicting pivotal scenes in the book. Meloy said that the scene it illustrated, of a friendly animal who appears at an opportune moment to offer Prue a ride after she escaped from captivity in the Pittock Mansion, was not vital to the plot, and an editor wanted to cut it from the book. But Meloy had written it specifically because he thought Ellis would enjoy drawing the badger and rickshaw, so he fought to keep it in. Booklists Daniel Kraus highlighted the image as representative of the book, commenting, \\"If you like stories in which spunky kids emerge from secret tunnels only to be greeted by smartly outfitted badgers operating rickshaws, this is your book.\\" Ellis commented, \\"That's one of the moments when the story seems really stream-of-consciousness. Prue pops up out of a manhole, and a badger comes by with a rickshaw and gives her a ride free of charge, and it's like, why not? It's such a great image.\\" =Genre= Most news articles and book reviews call Wildwood a children's novel,Sources that call Wildwood a children's book:   * or middle grade book,Sources that call Wildwood a middle grade or middle school book:  * but some class it as young adult fiction (YA or YAL). HarperCollins recommended the book for ages 9 and up. The book's 541 page length was comparable to many of the books Meloy enjoyed at Wildwoods target age, and Ellis noted that \\"a 10 year old kid can be a voracious reader.\\" The book is also marketed to adults, including Decemberists fans and adult fans of children's and young adult literature. Background Meloy and Ellis first conceived the idea for the book before Meloy formed the indie folk-rock band The Decemberists in 2000. When they first moved to Portland, Meloy and Ellis were living in a warehouse where they \\"had this idea of working on a novel together ... because we enjoyed making up stories and playing off one another's creative impulses.\\" Meloy was influenced by books that he read growing up, including Tolkien, and Lloyd Alexander's The Chronicles of Prydain. Meloy cites Piers Anthony's Xanth novels as a \\"direct influence\\", noting the \\"world within the real world and the implausibility of the whole enterprise\\". Ellis was influenced by The Chronicles of Narnia series as a child; the illustrations in the seven books of the Narnia series were a direct inspiration on her work. Unlike her previous work, where the text is completed before the illustrations are created, for Wildwood, Ellis collaborated with Meloy throughout the writing process. Carson Ellis and Colin Meloy at a book signing in Portland. After writing the first 80 pages, Meloy put the book on hold for several years while he worked on his music and Ellis focused on her book illustrations. When work finally resumed on the novel, the title changed from How Ruthie Ended the War to Wildwood, the character of Ruthie became Prue, and the object of her quest changed from her lost father to her kidnapped brother. The early version of the story was, according to Meloy, \\"wildly inappropriate for children.\\" Once they resumed work on the novel, Ellis said it took about two years to complete. Meloy feared his entry into fiction writing would be seen as \\"dabbling\\"; he wanted to avoid creating a \\"vanity project\\" like Madonna's picture books. Publication Five publishers sought the rights to the Wildwood series before being won by the HarperCollins imprint Balzer + Bray, with a first print run of 250,000 copies. Meloy and Ellis live on the edge of Forest Park and frequently hike its trails, where they found inspiration for geography of the series. Meloy and Ellis developed the idea for the impassable Wilderness from their experience in Forest Park, drawing maps of the fictional forest and using it to create the plot and characters. Illustrated endpapers in the book feature a large map of the forest with accompanying detail maps. A special edition of the book () was also printed: it is hand-bound, signed and numbered, with a slipcase and a three-color fold-out map, among other additions. Reception Wildwood was on The New York Times Best Seller Children's Chapter Books list for two weeks, ranking 7th the first week and 9th the second. The book won, in a tie with Colin Meloy's sister Maile Meloy's The Apothecary, the 2012 Middle Reader E.B. White Read Aloud Award. Overall, the book received positive reactions. Critics praised the quality of the illustrations, noting the old-fashioned style of the hardcover edition with maps on the end papers and a select set of color plates. The A.V. Clubs Tasha Robinson found the book, in spite of its flaws, \\"a perfect balance of middle-school-age-appropriate simplicity and more challenging writing that makes the book adult-accessible.\\" Meloy's rich descriptive language, of action, and especially the natural setting, were among the book's strengths, while a lack of character development and over- reliance on familiar fantasy tropes were cited as weaknesses. Similarly, The New Yorker found that the use of familiar motifs could sometimes be \\"formulaic\\" but it was nonetheless a well told tale that was \\"never condescending\\", and that Meloy's original contribution to conventions of the genre was his allegorical exploration of contemporary political and military struggle, including diplomacy, revolution, and ethnic cleansing. The most frequent criticism was that the pace dragged in some places, which some critics speculated was necessary setup for subsequent novels in the series. Some critics said they were \\"rankled\\" at the \\"arch\\" and \\"Portland-y\\" mention such local lifestyle tropes as cork flooring and recycling bins. Prue's riding to the final battle on her bicycle caused The New York Timess Claire Dederer to quip, \\"bicycle heroism: it doesn't get any more Portland than that.\\" The regionalisms came on strong enough to bring to some critics' minds the Portlandia TV series that pokes fun at the oddities of Portland culture. Salons David Daley has called on pundits to \\"stop comparing everything to Portlandia\\", saying reference to the satirical comedy show \\"has become a lazy shorthand for oddball, quirky cool.\\" The first negative review of Wildwood appeared following the release of the novel in the UK. The Stirling Observer's Gregor White said that the story begins well, and agreed with other critics that the setting is an impressive work, but in sum judged that the book \\"somehow ends up as one big shoulder shrug of indifference.\\" While other critics had reservations about the novel switching back and forth between the story threads of Prue and Curtis after they become separated early in the story, White said this \\"flitting back and forth\\" is an insurmountable \\"structural problem\\" that is \\"intensely wearing\\". Rachel Brown of The Atlantic thought that \\"it makes perfect sense that Colin Meloy, the loquacious and imaginative lead singer of the quirky Portland-based rock band The Decemberists, would write a children's book.\\" In contrast, critic Anna Minard from Seattle's The Stranger and Patrick Ness, in The Guardian, feared that Wildwood could be one more of a stream of \\"baldly mediocre books written by celebrities\\", citing children's books by Joy Behar, Jerry Seinfeld, Jimmy Fallon, Gloria Estefan, and Madonna. Minard and Ness also worried that the book would pander to adult Decemberists fans, while only \\"dressed trendily in kid-friendly wrapping,\\" but Minard was pleasantly astonished that the book did none of these things, and was not a \\"vanity project\\", landing well in range of its middle reader target and avoiding the affected pitfalls of a pop musician as writer. Ness, noting the repetition of the adjective \\"suddenly\\" in one paragraph, hoped for tighter writing in future novels, but overall found the book successful and not the work of a \\"dilettante wanting to dabble.\\" Coincidentally, Colin Meloy's sister, novelist Maile Meloy, also released a juvenile fiction book in 2011, saying, \\"I feel like everyone I know is writing one.\\" Stephen Heyman of The New York Times warned that Wildwood might be too violent for some readers, having many of the horrors so frequently found in Decemberists songs, including battles when people and animals die by musket and cannon fire, sword blows, and falling, and references to torture, and the threat of the blood sacrifice of a baby at the book's climax. Sequels In 2011 Meloy said intended to write at least two more books for the Wildwood Chronicles while his band, The Decemberists, was on hiatus. He planned the second Wildwood novel to have Prue return to The Wood, \\"her life very much in danger\\". The plot was to involve \\"scheming industrialists trying to worm their way into Wood\\" from the Outside, and show a much \\"weirder Portland\\", with the supernatural not confined to The Wood. Meloy said he would no longer constrain the denizens of The Wood to the native species of Forest Park. The second book in the series, Under Wildwood: The Wildwood Chronicles, Book Two, was released on September 25, 2012. The third and final book in the series, Wildwood Imperium, was released on February 3, 2015. Film adaptation In 2011, Oregon-based animation studio, Laika optioned Wildwood for a stop motion animated feature film and produced the trailer for the book.

Lodge and cabins The complex is located near the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau in the northern end of the park, centered on the Bryce Canyon Lodge, designed by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood. The National Historic Landmark district includes the Lodge and fifteen so- called \\"Deluxe Cabins,\\" the survivors of a complex that included more than sixty cabins and service structures surrounding the Lodge. Historic district The historic district, which was expanded from the original National Historic Landmark district in 1995, includes service structures and a greater portion of the wooded landscape around the main Lodge. Buildings in the historic district include a recreation hall, a dormitory for employees, a pump house, a linen house, and the remaining six standard cabins. Description The dormitory, the only structure in the complex that was not designed by Underwood's office, was designed in a compatible style by the Office of the Chief Engineer of the Utah Parks Company and reviewed by the Park Service. Built between 1937 and 1938, the one-story building is a \\"studs- out\\" structure linke others in the neighborhood, with sheathing mailed to the inside face of the building's frame, leaving the frame exposed to the outside. Unlike other stud-out structures in the neighborhood, the dormitory lacks diagonal framing members. The building has a hipped roof. A porch on the north side shelters the main entry. The east and west elevations also have entry doors. The interior comprises a central hallway with accommodations to either side. A former recreation room has been converted to additional dormitory space. The remodeled interior does not contribute to the building's significance. The recreation hall, also known as the girl's dormitory, was built about 1927. The one-story frame studs-out structure is covered with a hipped roof. The interior is divided into three major rooms, the largest of which is a recreation room with a large stone fireplace. The interior has not been extensively remodeled, and contributes to the building's significance. Standard cabin The pumphouse is built similarly to the deluxe cabins, with vertical log framing, and is believed to have been designed at about the same time. The small rectangular building has a gable roof. It has two rooms divided from each other by a stone wall. One room contains a pump, and the other is a storage area. The sheathing and wood roof rafters are exposed to the interior. The linen house is nearby. A studs-out building, it is believed to have been built at about the same time as the standard cabins. The building is filled with shelves and is used for linen storage. The interior is liberally covered with graffiti left there by concessions employees, the earliest dating to the 1950s. There are six standard cabins remaining, all built about 1925. All are one-story studs-out structures with hipped roofs. The shingles are applied in a wavy pattern similar to that of the main lodge. Bathrooms and possibly ceilings were added to the cabins in 1940-41. The cabins stand between the lodge and the deluxe cabins, with the pump house and linen house at the farthest end. All, including the two utility structures, were designed by Underwood.

She won a November 2011 special election to the Iowa Senate representing the 18th district in suburban Linn County, and was re-elected to the redrawn 34th district the following year. A member of the Democratic Party, Mathis co-chairs the Administration and Regulation Appropriations Subcommittee and serves on Education, Commerce, Economic Growth, Human Resources and full Appropriations committees. She is also the legislative liaison to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Mathis also is the Chief Community Officer for a child welfare and juvenile justice agency, Four Oaks. Early life and education Mathis was born on a farm in rural DeWitt, Iowa in 1958. Her mother, Mary Eleanor Rumann, was a schoolteacher and nurse who served in World War II. Her father, James Edward Rumann, was a farmer and school board member who also served in the war. Mathis received her bachelor's degree in 1980 from the University of Iowa, where she double-majored in broadcasting and film and in journalism. To put herself through college, she worked weekends as a production assistant at WMT-TV.  Career  = Journalism = After graduating from college, she joined KWWL as a reporter and anchor, doing \\"a little bit of everything\\" from their newly opened Cedar Rapids bureau. Soon after joining the station, she moved to Waterloo to become an evening co-anchor alongside Ron Steele at the age of 23. Taking a break from broadcasting, she joined the faculty of Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa in August 1996, where she taught electronic media. In 1998 she became a news anchor, reporter and producer at KCRG-TV, where she remained for nine years. In July 2007, she retired from broadcasting to become vice president for community relations for Horizons‚ÄîA Family Service Alliance, a non-profit counseling and assistance agency in Cedar Rapids. She later became chief community officer for Four Oaks. =Iowa Senate= Mathis was nominated in September 2011 by the Iowa Democratic Party to run for the state senate seat vacated by Democrat Swati Dandekar. Mathis faced Republican candidate Cindy Golding in a special election held on November 8, 2011. The election was politically significant for the state, as the Republican Party controlled the Iowa governorship and General Assembly, and the Democrats stood to lose their one-seat majority in the state Senate. Mathis won the election by 56 to 44 percent and was sworn in on November 21, 2011. She sat on the Commerce, Economic Growth, Human Resources, and Ways and Means committees. She was challenged for re-election in November 2012 by Ryan Flood, a libertarian Super PAC director and financial services representative. She ran in the newly drawn 34th district, and largely agreed with her challenger on lowering Iowa's property taxes and opposing a gas tax increase. Neither candidate took a stance on a proposed casino in nearby Cedar Rapids. Mathis was elected with around 60 percent of the vote. Personal life She is married to Mark Mathis III, who owns the advertising agency ME&V.; They live outside the city of Robins, and have two children, Mark IV and Mary Fran. Mathis has also taught part-time at the University of Iowa's School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and remains a member of the Wartburg Board of Regents.

He is a two-time Academy Award nominee who is best known for the animated films World of Tomorrow, It's Such a Beautiful Day, Rejected, and World of Tomorrow Episode Two. In 2014, his work appeared on The Simpsons. Eight of his short films have competed at the Sundance Film Festival, a festival record. He is also the only filmmaker to have won the Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize for Short Film twice. Hertzfeldt's work has been described as \\"some of the most influential animation ever created\\", \\"some of the most vital and expressive animation of the millennium\\", and \\"some of the most essential short films of the last 20 years\\". In his book The World History of Animation, author Stephen Cavalier writes \\"Hertzfeldt is either a unique phenomenon or perhaps an example of a new way forward for individual animators surviving independently on their own terms... he attracts the kind of fanatical support from the student and alternative crowds usually associated with indie rock bands\\". Hertzfeldt's feature film It's Such a Beautiful Day was listed by many film critics as one of the best films of 2012 and the L.A. Film Critics Association named it runner-up for Best Animated Feature Film of the year. After a limited UK release in 2013, the film was ranked #3 on Time Out London's list of the 10 Best Films of 2013 and #4 on The London Film Review's list of the same. In 2014, Time Out New York ranked It's Such a Beautiful Day #16 on its list of the \\"100 Best Animated Movies Ever Made,\\" and in 2016, The Film Stage critics ranked the film #1 on their list of \\"The 50 Best Animated Films of the 21st Century Thus Far.\\" In 2019, The Wrap named It's Such a Beautiful Day the #1 \\"Best Animated Film of the 2010s.\\" The same year, the Vulture film critics ranked it #12 on their overall list of the \\"Best Movies of the Decade.\\" In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked World of Tomorrow #10 on its list of the \\"40 Greatest Animated Movies Ever\\". Despite its short running time, The A.V. Club called it \\"possibly the best film of 2015.\\" In 2019, Indiewire ranked World of Tomorrow #17 in its overall list of the \\"100 Best Movies of the Decade\\". World of Tomorrow Episode Two: The Burden of Other People's Thoughts premiered in 2017 and received rare \\"A+\\" reviews from Indiewire and Collider, where it was described as \\"another soulful sci-fi masterpiece.\\" The Daily Beast called it \\"a must-see animated masterpiece\\" and \\"one of the best films of the year.\\" Hertzfeldt primarily supports his work through self-distribution such as ticket sales from theatrical tours, DVDs, VOD, and television broadcasts. He has refused all advertising work. Hertzfeldt lives in Austin, Texas. He spent many years in Santa Barbara, California after attending college there. He has kept a blog on his website since 1999. Early life Hertzfeldt was born on August 1, 1976 in Alameda County, California, the son of an airline pilot and a county library clerk. Some publications have his place of birth as Fremont, California while others name the smaller Castro Valley, California. He is of half Swedish descent. Hertzfeldt attended Mission San Jose High School in Fremont. In his childhood, Hertzfeldt drew homemade comic books and at the age of 15, he began to teach himself animation with a VHS video camera. Two of Hertzfeldt's teenage VHS cartoons can be seen on the \\"Bitter Films: Volume 1\\" DVD collection. While at film school, Hertzfeldt was drawn to animation as it was a less expensive form to work in. He could not afford to buy the numerous rolls of 16 mm film required to shoot live action. He has stated, \\"I think I've always approached animation from a strange angle, a bit like a regular filmmaker who just happens to animate. Editing, writing, sound‚Äîthose are the things that usually come first in my head. Animation is often just the busy work I need to get through to connect the dots and tell the story.\\" Hertzfeldt has never held a job other than creating his animated films. His earliest teenage video animations found film festival exposure, and in film school at the University of California, Santa Barbara he was able to find international distribution for each of his 16mm student films. He is a 1998 graduate with a B.A. in Film Studies. Technique Hertzfeldt's work commonly features hand-drawn stick figures, in stories of black humor, surrealism, and tragicomedy. Some films contain existential and philosophical themes while others are more straightforwardly slapstick and absurdist. His animation is created traditionally with pen and paper, often with minimal digital aid. Hertzfeldt uses antique 16 mm or 35 mm‚Äìfilm cameras to photograph his drawings and often employs old-fashioned special effect techniques such as multiple exposures, in-camera mattes, and experimental photography. While some of these techniques are as established as an occasional stop-motion animation sequence or a universe of moving stars created by back-lit pin holes, other effects are new innovations on classical methods, as seen with the in-camera compositing of multiple, split-screen windows of action in the Everything Will Be OK films. Hertzfeldt's student films in the 1990s were photographed on 16mm. From 1999 to 2011, Hertzfeldt photographed his films on a 35mm Richardson animation camera stand, believed to be the same camera that photographed many of the Peanuts cartoons in the 1960s and 1970s. Built in the late 1940s, it was reportedly one of the last remaining functioning cameras of its kind left in the world, and Hertzfeldt found it to be a crucial element in the creation of his films and their unique visuals. In 2015, Hertzfeldt released his first digitally animated short film, World of Tomorrow, which was created at the same time as another digital piece, an animated guest appearance on The Simpsons. Both pieces were still hand-drawn by Hertzfeldt, but on a Cintiq tablet instead of paper. Discussing film and digital technology with The New York Times in 2008, Hertzfeldt noted: It's not unusual for Hertzfeldt to write, direct, produce, animate, photograph, edit, perform voices, record and mix sound, and/or compose music for one of his films, at times requiring years to complete a single short by working alone. The animation for one of his films may often require tens of thousands of drawings. Hertzfeldt frequently scores his pictures with classical music and opera. The music of Tchaikovsky, Bizet, Smetana, Beethoven, Richard Strauss, and Wagner have all appeared in his films. On occasion, Hertzfeldt has also scored portions of his films himself, with a guitar or keyboard. =Approach to writing= Hertzfeldt described his relaxed writing process in a 2015 Reddit \\"AMA\\" session: In another Reddit \\"AMA\\", on the subject of creativity, Hertzfeldt suggested the following: Student films, 1995‚Äì1998 Hertzfeldt made four 16mm animated student films while studying film at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Ah, L'Amour and Genre were produced at the ages of 18 and 19. Ah, L'Amour would win the HBO Comedy Arts Festival Grand Prize for \\"World's Funniest Cartoon\\". His first dialogue short, Lily and Jim, was released in 1997, and tells the story of a disastrous blind date. Its partially improvised vocal performances helped the short win twenty five awards, including the Grand Prize at the New Orleans Film Festival. His final student cartoon, Billy's Balloon, is about an inexplicable attack on small children by malevolent balloons. It was nominated for the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, and won the Grand Jury Award at the 1999 Slamdance Film Festival. In total, it won thirty three awards. The popularity of each student short at film and animation festivals‚Äîand eventually around the world from screening on MTV and other networks‚Äîhelped fund the next one, and eventually financed the production of his first film after college. Independent animation, 2000‚Äì2017 =Rejected= Soon after graduating from film school, Hertzfeldt purchased his own 35mm rostrum camera and made his next animated short, Rejected. Released in theaters in 2000, the short won 27 awards and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film the following year. It is now considered a cult classic and one of the most influential animated films ever made, especially after it found its way onto the internet in the early 2000s and became a viral sensation. In 2009, it was the only short film named as one of the \\"Films of the Decade\\" by Salon. In 2010, it was noted as one of the five \\"most innovative animated films of the past ten years\\" by The Huffington Post. Indiewire film critic Eric Kohn named Rejected one of the \\"10 best films of the 21st century\\" on his list for the BBC Culture poll in 2016. The film presents itself as a reel of rejected commercial work by a fictional version of Don Hertzfeldt. The commissioned animated vignettes grow more and more abstract and inappropriate as the animator suffers a mental breakdown, until they literally fall apart. Although the film is fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done advertising work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention. In appearances Hertzfeldt has told the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he could come up with for the companies, run off with their money, and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for Rejected's theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis. =The Animation Show= In 2003, Hertzfeldt created The Animation Show with Beavis and Butt-head creator Mike Judge. It was a biennial North American touring festival that brought independent animated short films to more movie theaters than any distributor in history. The programs were personally curated by Hertzfeldt and Judge. A second Animation Show edition toured throughout 2005, featuring Hertzfeldt's short film The Meaning of Life and new films by animators like Peter Cornwell and Georges Schwizgebel. The third season of The Animation Show began its nationwide release in January 2007, featuring new work by animators Joanna Quinn and Bill Plympton, as well as Hertzfeldt's own Everything Will Be OK. A stated goal of The Animation Show was to regularly \\"free the work of these independent artists from the dungeons of Internet exhibition,\\" and bring them into proper movie theaters where most of the short films were meant to be seen. The Animation Show meanwhile launched a supplemental DVD series of animated short films, with content that often varies from the annual theatrical programs. These DVDs were distributed by MTV. In a March 2008 entry in his blog, Hertzfeldt announced he had decided to leave The Animation Show, after having programmed (and contributing films to) three tours. A fourth season of the program was released in theaters in summer 2008, with no involvement from him. =The Meaning of Life= Hertzfeldt at his desk during the production of The Meaning of Life Almost four years in the making, Hertzfeldt's twelve-minute The Meaning of Life premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and toured film and animation festivals in 2005‚Äì2006. Though its abstract nature puzzled some critics, it received mostly positive reviews. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the film \\"the closest thing on film yet to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" In the film, the evolution of the human race is traced from prehistory (mankind as blob forms), through today (mankind as teeming crowds of selfish, fighting, or lost individuals), to hundreds of millions of years into the future as our species evolves into countless new forms; all of them still behaving the same way. The film concludes in the extreme future, with two creatures (apparently an adult and child subspecies of future human), having a conversation about the meaning of life on a colorful shore. In 2009, Hertzfeldt noted, \\"I don't often make the same sort of movie twice in a row. It's always been whatever's next in my head. From a commercial standpoint I guess I‚Äôve made some pretty inscrutable decisions, like following up 'Rejected' with a sprawling abstract film about human evolution, but it's really just been whichever ideas won't go away at the time. There's always a lot of new things I‚Äôd like to try.\\" In 2014, Time Out New York named the film one of the \\"thirty best animated short films ever made.\\" =Everything will be OK, I Am So Proud of You, and It's Such a Beautiful Day= A line around the block for An Evening with Don Hertzfeldt Everything Will Be OK was released in 2006 and became Hertzfeldt's most critically successful piece to date, receiving his strongest reviews. The film was described as \\"probably the best work he's done in his very incredible and consistently amazing young career.\\" The 17-minute animated short was based on the character, Bill, from his webcomic \\"Temporary Anesthetics\\". The Boston Globe called the film a \\"masterpiece\\" with the Boston Phoenix declaring Hertzfeldt a \\"genius.\\" The short film was a cover story on the Chicago Reader, receiving four stars from critic J.R. Jones. Variety film critic Robert Koehler named Everything Will Be OK one of the Best Films of 2007. Everything will be OK is the first chapter of a three-part story about Bill, a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows. Bill's seemingly mundane life, narrated in humorous and dramatic anecdotes, gradually grows dark as we learn he may be suffering from a possibly fatal mental disorder. Scenes throughout the trilogy are often divided into multiple windows of action on the screen at once, against a background of pure black. Animated still photographs are also incorporated inside certain windows, as well as a handful of the colorful special effects and experimental film techniques that Hertzfeldt first utilized in The Meaning of Life. Like many of Hertzfeldt's films, most of the trilogy's special effects were captured in-camera. Everything Will Be OK won the Grand Jury Prize for Short Filmmaking at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, the Lawrence Kasdan Award for Best Narrative Film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, the Grand Prize at the London Animation Festival, and 34 other awards. I Am So Proud of You, the second chapter in the story, was released in autumn 2008. Upon its release, Hertzfeldt traveled with I Am So Proud of You and a selection of his other films to 22 cities on a sold-out American tour (with two stops in the UK and three in Canada). '\\"An Evening with Don Hertzfeldt\\" presented a 35mm selection of his work followed by an onstage interview and audience chat with him. I Am So Proud of You also played at film festivals throughout 2009 and won 27 awards. The third and final chapter, It's Such a Beautiful Day, premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Hertzfeldt traveled with It's Such a Beautiful Day in 2011 and 2012 on another North American theatrical tour to 30 cities. Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, \\"There is a moment in each installment of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed to make me feel this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning.\\" =Wisdom Teeth= In October 2009, Hertzfeldt premiered Wisdom Teeth, an unannounced, new five- minute cartoon at the \\"Evening with Don Hertzfeldt\\" screening at the Ottawa Animation Festival. It later screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2010 and the Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal, where it was awarded a Special Jury Mention. In 2010, it appeared as part of a series on the Showtime Network called \\"Short Stories\\". =It's Such a Beautiful Day, the feature film= Hertzfeldt with fans at Sun Ray Cinemas in Jacksonville in April 2012 In 2012, Hertzfeldt edited together the three chapters of his short film trilogy to create a seamless new feature film of the story. His first feature film, the movie shares the same title as the third chapter of the story, It's Such a Beautiful Day, and went into limited release in movie theaters during autumn 2012. The film was subsequently released on DVD, as well as on-demand in HD on Vimeo, iTunes, and Netflix. It's Such a Beautiful Day was very well received by film critics. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association named it their runner-up for Best Animated Feature Film of the year, behind Frankenweenie. Indiewire ranked Hertzfeldt the 9th best Film Director of the Year in its annual poll (tied with Wes Anderson), and The A.V. Club film critics ranked the film # 8 on their list of the Best Films of 2012. Slate Magazine named \\"It's Such a Beautiful Day\\" their pick for Best Animated Feature Film of 2012. In the United Kingdom, the film was ranked # 3 on Time Out London's list of the 10 Best Films of 2013, and # 4 on The London Film Review's list of the same. In 2014, Time Out New York ranked It's Such a Beautiful Day # 16 on their list of the \\"100 Best Animated Movies Ever Made.\\" Critic Tom Huddleston described it as \\"one of the great outsider artworks of the modern era, at once sympathetic and shocking, beautiful and horrifying, angry and hilarious, uplifting and almost unbearably sad.\\" =The Simpsons= In 2014, Hertzfeldt wrote, animated, and directed a surreal and futuristic two-minute \\"couch gag\\" for the premiere episode of the 26th season of The Simpsons. It was the longest opening gag in the show's history and was described by Spin Magazine as \\"mind-melting,\\" and \\"two of the strangest minutes of television ever to air on a major network during prime time.\\" The sequence depicts Homer accidentally using a time-traveling remote control that regresses him to his original 1987 character model, then propels him into a distant future incarnation of the show called The Sampsans where he and his family have evolved into grotesque, mindless, catchphrase-spouting creatures. Future Homer sadly remembers past futuristic episodes, in which he still had an emotional connection with Marge and the children. Simpsons producer Al Jean called it \\"crazier than we thought,\\" and \\"the most insane one we've ever done.\\" =World of Tomorrow= In January 2015, Hertzfeldt's first digitally- animated short film, World of Tomorrow, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and won the Grand Jury Prize, his second. Illustrator Julia Pott performs the voice of the short's lead character, opposite Hertzfeldt's then- four-year-old niece, who was recorded while drawing and playing. Her spontaneous, natural vocal reactions and questions were then edited into the story to create her character. On finally making the leap to digital animation after twenty years of working with pencil and paper, Hertzfeldt joked, \\"I kind of feel like it‚Äôs like a rock band who traditionally was guitar, guitar, guitar and then for their new album, they‚Äôre like, we‚Äôre going electronic! But [then] they only use Casio keyboards and drum machines... It‚Äôs not the cutting edge CG we‚Äôre all used to.\\" Critics were universally positive in their reviews, describing the science fiction film as \\"one of the most satisfying shorts since Chris Marker's landmark 1962 La Jetee and almost certain to be the highlight of this year's Sundance, full stop,\\" \\"dazzling, enthralling\\" and \\"astonishing.\\" The film next won Best Animated Short at the SXSW Film Festival. Indiewire called the short film \\"one of the best films of 2015,\\" and The Dissolve named it \\"one of the finest achievements in sci-fi in recent memory.\\" The A.V. Club described the film as \\"visionary\\" and \\"possibly the best film of 2015,\\" in spite of its short running time. The Austin Film Critics Association gave Hertzfeldt a Special Honorary Award in recognition of the film. World of Tomorrow was released on-demand on Vimeo in March 2015, simultaneous with its run in film festivals. At the end of its film festival run, the film won over 40 awards. World of Tomorrow won two Crystal Awards from the Annecy Animation Festival, a Special Jury Award, and the Audience Award. The film also won two awards from the Ottawa International Animation Festival, Best Script and the Audience Award. In 2016, World of Tomorrow won the animation industry's Annie Award for Best Animated Short Film. In 2016, World of Tomorrow was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Short Film at the 88th Academy Awards, Hertzfeldt's second career nomination. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked World of Tomorrow # 10 on its list of the \\"Greatest Animated Movies Ever.\\" =World of Tomorrow Episode Two: The Burden of Other People's Thoughts= World of Tomorrow Episode Two premiered in 2017 at Fantastic Fest in Austin and received rare \\"A+\\" reviews from Indiewire and Collider, where it was described as \\"another soulful sci-fi masterpiece.\\" The Daily Beast called it \\"one of the best films of the year... a must-see animated masterpiece.\\" Hertzfeldt traveled with the film to theaters on a \\"winter mini-tour\\" in December 2017. The screenings opened with a surprise new two-minute cartoon, in which an animated Hertzfeldt introduces the program from the caverns of an alien planet. World of Tomorrow Episode Two won the Grand Prize at Montreal's Sommets du cin√©ma d'animation, an Audience Award at Fantastic Fest, and a Special Jury Award from the London Animation Festival. In January 2018, the film played opening night at the Sundance Film Festival. =World of Tomorrow Episode Three: The Absent Destinations of David Prime= On August 03 2020, Hertzfeldt released a trailer for World of Tomorrow Episode Three: The Absent Destinations of David Prime, which was released digitally on October 09. Other work In December 2013, Hertzfeldt released a graphic novel, The End of the World, through independent publisher Antibookclub. The 216 page book was described in his blog as containing many years of leftover film ideas, reshaped into an experimental new story. \\"If the films were albums, I guess these would be the B-sides,\\" he wrote. In 2019, Random House announced they would be printing a new edition of The End of the World in wide release. In 2013, Hertzfeldt animated a 30-second piece called \\"Day Sleeper\\" for the National Film Board of Canada. It was created using their iPad app, a tribute to experimental animator Norman McLaren. Influence and legacy Hertzfeldt's work has been credited with being a prominent influence on surrealism and absurdism in animation in the 2000s, including influencing Adult Swim's brand of animated comedy. In 2008, Comedy Central noted his work as having \\"influenced an entire generation of filmmakers.\\" In 2012, Hertzfeldt was ranked #16 in an animation industry and historian survey of the \\"Top 100 Most Influential People in Animation.\\" Hertzfeldt has also been noted as an influence among many webcomics, including Hyperbole and a Half, xkcd, and Cyanide and Happiness. Awards and honors Hertzfeldt has had more films play in competition at the Sundance Film Festival than any other filmmaker, with eight: Rejected, The Meaning of Life, Everything Will Be OK, I Am So Proud of You, Wisdom Teeth, It's Such a Beautiful Day, World of Tomorrow, and World of Tomorrow Episode Two. He returned to the Sundance Film Festival in 2013 to serve on the Short Film Awards Jury. In 1999, at the age of 22, Hertzfeldt was nominated for the Short Film Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Billy's Balloon, where he was the youngest director in competition. The same year Billy's Balloon won the Slamdance Film Festival Grand Jury Award. In 2000, at the age of 23, Hertzfeldt was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for his fifth short film, Rejected. He lost to Micha√´l Dudok de Wit for Father and Daughter. In 2001, Hertzfeldt was named by Filmmaker Magazine as one of the \\"Top 25 Filmmakers to Watch.\\" In 2002, Hertzfeldt joined the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2007, Hertzfeldt's Everything Will Be OK won the Grand Jury Award for Short Film at the Sundance Film Festival, a prize rarely given to an animated film. In 2007, according to the animation industry website Cartoon Brew, Everything Will Be OK advanced to the final round of voting as a contender for an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short, but did not make the ultimate list of five nominees. In 2007, Hertzfeldt accepted an invitation from the George Eastman House's motion picture archives to indefinitely store and preserve the original film elements and camera negatives to his collected work. In 2009, Rejected was the only short film named one of the \\"Films of the Decade\\" by Salon.com. In 2010, it was noted as one of the five \\"most innovative animated films of the past ten years\\" by The Huffington Post. In April 2010, at the age of 33, Hertzfeldt received the San Francisco International Film Festival's \\"Persistence of Vision\\" Lifetime Achievement Award \\"for his unique contributions to film and animation,\\" and \\"for challenging the boundaries of his craft.\\" Hertzfeldt was the youngest director named in the \\"They Shoot Pictures, Don't They\\" list of \\"The 100 Important Animation Directors\\" of all time, In 2012, Hertzfeldt received the Ted M. Larson memorial award from the Fargo Film Festival, for his \\"contributions to film culture.\\" In 2015, Hertzfeldt won the Grand Jury Award for Short Film a second time at the Sundance Film Festival, for World of Tomorrow. In December 2015, Hertzfeldt received a special award from the Austin Film Critics Association, \\"in celebration of a career of remarkable short filmmaking and contributions to animation spanning two decades, with 2015's award-winning \\"World of Tomorrow\\" being recognized as his best work to date.\\" Hertzfeldt has been nominated for three Annie Awards for Best Animated Short Film. He lost for Rejected in 2001 and Everything Will Be OK in 2007 and won for World of Tomorrow in 2016. In 2016, World of Tomorrow was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 88th Academy Awards, Hertzfeldt's second nomination. DVD and Blu-ray releases Hertzfeldt owns the rights to all of his work and has self-distributed his films under the moniker \\"Bitter Films\\" since the 1990s. Bitter Films' first DVD release was a 2001 limited edition DVD \\"single\\" of the short Rejected. The DVD included a deleted scene, audio commentary, and a few hidden pages. It is now out of print. Don Hertzfeldt Volume One: 1995‚Äì2005 was released in 2006, collecting the first 10 years of his work. All of the short films were remastered and restored in high definition from their original film negatives. The DVD was made available only to fans via the Bitter Films website, with the first 750 pre-orderers receiving an \\"exclusive mystery gift\\" (either a 35 mm‚Äìclipping from Rejected that was autographed by Don, or a unique drawing by Don on a post-it note). This DVD marked the first time his student films such as Genre and Lily and Jim were made widely available to the public. Many of these works were only previously found on limited-release VHS collections of animated shorts, long out of print. The special features for Don Hertzfeldt Volume One: 1995‚Äì2005 included a time-lapse documentary of the making of The Meaning of Life called \\"Watching Grass Grow\\", The Animation Show Trilogy cartoons, Lily and Jim deleted dialogues and outtakes, Rejected trivia captions, The Meaning of Life special effects audio commentary, an over 140-page \\"archive\\" section (of rare footage from Hertzfeldt's earliest cartoons, original pencil tests, deleted sequences, abandoned footage, and sketch to scene comparisons), Lily and Jim audio commentary, Rejected audio commentary, and a retrospective booklet, with liner notes by Hertzfeldt In 2007, Everything Will Be OK was released as another DVD \\"single\\". Special features on this release included over a hundred pages of \\"archival\\" material (sketches, storyboards, deleted materials), and a hidden feature that played a narration-free version of the film. I Am So Proud of You was released as a similar \\"single\\" in 2009. It featured a similar 148 page \\"archive\\" of production materials, as well as the hidden narration-free feature. Don Hertzfeldt Volume 2: 2006‚Äì2011, a DVD collection of all work from 2006‚Äì2011 (including the feature film version of It's Such a Beautiful Day) was released in November 2012. Special features for the release included over 40 minutes of live Q&A; material from the touring program, the cartoon Wisdom Teeth, a deleted scene from It's Such a Beautiful Day, and a 24-page booklet. Advance pre-order customers for the release also received a 35 mm‚Äìfilm strip clipped from a release print of It's Such a Beautiful Day, and other free gifts. From July to August 2015, Don Hertzfeldt ran a Kickstarter campaign to publish his films It's Such a Beautiful Day and The World of Tomorrow for the first time on Blu-ray, to help finance future productions. The campaign raised over $215,000. With rising pledges he remastered additional short films The Meaning of Life, Rejected, Billy's Balloon, Wisdom Teeth, and Lily and Jim and added them to the Blu-ray as well. Also included was an interview, a surprise film, and the first preview of a future project. The disc run was limited, primarily available to Kickstarter supporters and fans who contacted Bitter Films directly. Hertzfeldt prefers not to sell his animation artwork. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, his website Bitter Films annually auctioned off artwork instead to raise thousands of dollars for local Santa Barbara charities. Other original drawings have been occasionally given away through the Bitter Films online store through special promotions. Because Hertzfeldt also rarely does signings, his artwork is rare for animation collectors and fans to own. View on advertising Hertzfeldt has been offered numerous lucrative advertising deals, including ad campaigns for Cingular Wireless and United Airlines, which he has declined. He has made various comments over the years about his distaste for corporate America and says he will never be involved with the advertising world. He has said, \\"The goal isn't to try and make as much money as I possibly can; the goal is to try and make good movies.\\" In a 2015 Vanity Fair interview, Hertzfeldt said: In a March 2009 blog entry, Hertzfeldt compared filmmaking to his love of hiking and exploring new places: something he does just because he \\"enjoys doing it and will probably always enjoy doing it.\\" He compared doing advertising to being paid to not go explore the woods, but to walk around someone's house eight hours a day wearing a sandwich board with a picture of a product on it. \\"Money's not the reason I take walks. It doesn't really factor into it. I take walks because I enjoy doing it. It's something I'd do if I was rich, and it's something I'd do if I were poor.\\" In the commentary for Rejected on the Bitter Films Vol. 1 DVD, Hertzfeldt stated that \\"You never want to lie to your audience... you can trick them, you can disturb them, you can annoy them, but you can never lie to them. To me commercials are nothing but lies.\\" Nevertheless, several international ad campaigns have borrowed heavily from his unique style and bear enough resemblance to Hertzfeldt's work as to be mistaken for it. The most well-known instance of this is a series of television ads for Kellogg's Pop-Tarts, which use black and white stick figures, \\"squiggly\\" animation, surreal humor, and even an occasional crumpling paper effect, all very similar to Hertzfeldt's style. Despite all these similarities, Hertzfeldt was not involved in any way. In Canada, the not-for-profit corporation Encorp has used a Hertzfeldt-like style of short animation clips on TV and the Internet to promote its \\"Don't Mess With Karma\\" campaign to encourage recycling. One of the latest ad campaigns to use an art style similar to Hertzfeldt's is Krystal fast food restaurant to promote their Blitz Energy Drink.

The cathedral was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and is famous for being the traditional location for the coronation of the kings of France. The cathedral church is thought to have been founded by Bishop Saint Nicasius in the early 5th century. Marking an important conversion, Clovis, King of the Franks, was baptized a Christian here about a century later. Construction of the present Reims Cathedral began in the 13th century and concluded in the 15th century. A prominent example of High Gothic architecture, it was built to replace an earlier church destroyed by fire in 1221. Although little damaged during the French Revolution, the present cathedral saw extensive restoration in the 19th century but was severely damaged during World War I. The church was again restored in the 20th century. Reims Cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Reims. The cathedral, a major tourist destination, receives about one million visitors annually.Reims Cathedral page on culture.fr.  History  According to Flodoard, Saint Nicasius founded the first church on the site of the current cathedral at the beginning of the 5th century, probably in 401, on the site of a Gallo-Roman bath. The site is not far from the basilica built by Bishop Betause, where Saint Nicasius was martyred by beheading either by the Vandals in 407 or by the Huns in 451. The dedication of the church to the Virgin Mary suggests that the latter of the two dates is the correct one, given that the first church to be named after the Virgin Mary was the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in the 430s. The Reims church, measuring approximately by , was where Clovis, King of the Franks, was baptized by Saint Remigius on Christmas Day some time between 496 and 508. A baptistery was built in the 6th century to the north of the current site to a plan of a square exterior and a circular interior. The cathedral in the time of Archbishop Hincmar In 816, the Frankish emperor Louis the Pious was crowned in Reims by Pope Stephen IV. The coronation and ensuing celebrations highlighted the poor condition of the church, then the seat of an archbishop. Over the next decade, Archbishop Ebbo of Reims rebuilt much of the church under the direction of the royal architect Rumaud, only ceasing in 846, under the episcopate of Archbishop Hincmar, who adorned the church's interior with gilding, mosaics, paintings, sculptures and tapestries. On 18 October 862, in the presence of King Charles the Bald, Hincmar dedicated the new church, which measured and had two transepts. At the beginning of the 10th century, an ancient crypt underneath the original church was rediscovered. Under Archbishop Herv√©, the crypt (which had been the initial centre of the previous churches above it) was cleared, renovated, and then rededicated to Saint Remi. The altar has been located above the crypt for 15 centuries. Beginning in 976, Archbishop Adalbero began to enlarge and illuminate the Carolingian cathedral. The historian Richerus, a pupil of Adalbero, gives a very precise description of the work carried out by the Archbishop: On 19 May 1051, King Henry I of France and Anne of Kiev married in the cathedral. Whilst conducting the Council of Reims in 1131, Pope Innocent II anointed and crowned the future Louis VII in the cathedral. In the middle of the 12th century, Archbishop Samson demolished the fa√ßade and adjoining tower in order to build a new cathedral with two flanking towers, likely in imitation of the Abbey of Saint Denis in Paris, whose choir dedication Samson himself had attended a few years earlier. In addition to these works to the west of the building, a new choir and chapels began to be built east of the cathedral, which measured . At the end of the century, the nave and the transept were of the Carolingian style while the chevet and fa√ßade were early Gothic. =Our Lady of Reims= On 6 May 1210, the Carolingian-early Gothic cathedral was destroyed by fire on the feast day of Saint John Before the Latin Gate, allegedly due to \\"carelessness.\\" One year to the day afterwards, in 1211, Archbishop Aubrey laid the first stone of the new cathedral's chevet. In July 1221, the chapel of this axially-radiating chevet entered use. Four architects would succeed each other until the completion of the cathedral's structural work in 1275: Jean d'Orbais, Jean-le-Loup, Gaucher of Reims and Bernard de Soissons. Documentary records show the acquisition of land to the west of the site in 1218, suggesting the new cathedral was substantially larger than its predecessors, the lengthening of the nave presumably being an adaptation to afford room for the crowds that attended the coronations.For detailed chronology of rebuilding see P. Frankl / P. Crossley, Gothic Architecture, Yale University Press, 2001 (Revised Ed.), p. 322 notes 10‚Äì14. In 1233 a long- running dispute between the cathedral chapter and the townsfolk (regarding issues of taxation and legal jurisdiction) boiled over into open revolt. Several clerics were killed or injured during the resulting violence and the entire cathedral chapter fled the city, leaving it under an interdict (effectively banning all public worship and sacraments). Work on the new cathedral was suspended for three years, only resuming in 1236 after the clergy returned to the city and the interdict was lifted following mediation by the King and the Pope. Construction then continued more slowly. The area from the crossing eastwards was in use by 1241 but the nave was not roofed until 1299 (when the French King lifted the tax on lead used for that purpose). Work on the west fa√ßade took place in several phases, which is reflected in the very different styles of some of the sculptures. The upper parts of the fa√ßade were completed in the 14th century, but apparently following 13th-century designs, giving Reims an unusual unity of style. Charles VII in 1429, by Jules Eug√®ne Lenepveu, showing Joan of Arc at right. Unusually the names of the cathedral's original architects are known. A labyrinth built into floor of the nave at the time of construction or shortly after (similar to examples at Chartres and Amiens) included the names of four master masons (Jean d'Orbais, Jean-Le-Loup, Gaucher de Reims and Bernard de Soissons) and the number of years they worked there, though art historians still disagree over who was responsible for which parts of the building. The labyrinth itself was destroyed in 1779 but its details and inscriptions are known from 18th-century drawings. The clear association here between a labyrinth and master masons adds weight to the argument that such patterns were an allusion to the emerging status of the architect (through their association with the mythical artificer Daedalus, who built the Labyrinth of King Minos). The cathedral also contains further evidence of the rising status of the architect in the tomb of Hugues Libergier (d. 1268, architect of the now-destroyed Reims church of St-Nicaise). Not only is he given the honour of an engraved slab; he is shown holding a miniature model of his church (an honour formerly reserved for noble donors) and wearing the academic garb befitting an intellectual. The towers, tall, were originally designed to rise . The south tower holds just two great bells; one of them, named ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äù by Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine in 1570, weighs more than . Following the death of the infant King John I, his uncle Philip was hurriedly crowned at Reims, 9 January 1317. During the Hundred Years' War the cathedral and city were under siege by the English from 1359 to 1360, but the siege failed. In 1380, Reims cathedral was the location of Charles VI's coronation and eight years later Charles called a council at Reims in 1388 to take personal rule from the control of his uncles. After Henry V, King of England, defeated Charles VI's army at Agincourt, Reims along with most of northern France fell to the English. The English held Reims and the Cathedral until 1429 when it was liberated by Joan of Arc which allowed the Dauphin Charles to be crowned king on 17 July 1429. Following the death of Francis I of France, Henry II was crowned King of France on 25 July 1547 in Reims cathedral. On 24 July 1481, a new fire caused by the negligence of workers on the roof took hold in the attic, causing the destruction of the framework, central bell tower, and the galleries at the base of the roof, and caused the lead of the roof to melt, causing further damage. However, recovery was quick with Kings Charles VIII and Louis XII making donations to the Cathedral's reconstruction. In particular, they granted the Cathedral an octroi in regards to the unpopular Gabelle tax. In gratitude, the new roof was adorned by fleur-de-lis and the royal coat of arms \\"affixed to the top of the fa√ßade\\". However, this work was suspended before the arrows were completed in 1516. Although Reims was an important symbol of the French monarchy, the chaos of the French Revolution did not damage it to the same extent as at Chartres Cathedral, where the structure of the cathedral itself was threatened. Some statues were broken, the gates were torn down, and the royal Hand of Justice was burned. The Smiling Angel, north portal of west facade. The original was damaged by shrapnel from German artillery shells. In 1860, Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc directed the restoration of Reims Cathedral. In 1875, the French National Assembly voted to allocate ¬£80,000 for repairs of the fa√ßade and balustrades. =First World War= On the outbreak of the First World War, the cathedral was commissioned as a hospital, and troops and arms were removed from its immediate vicinity. On 4 September 1914, the XII Saxon corps arrived at the city and later that day the Imperial German Army began shelling the city. The guns, located away in Les Mesneux, ceased firing when the XII Saxon Corps sent two officers and a city employee to ask them to stop shelling the city. The bombardment damaged the cathedral considerably, blowing out many windows, and damaging several statues and elements of the upper facade. On 12 September, the German Army decided to place their wounded in the cathedral against the protests of Maurice Landrieux, and spread 15,000 bales of straw on the floor of the cathedral for this purpose. That day, however, the town was evacuated of German soldiers before French General Franchet d'Esperey entered the city. Six days later, a shell exploded in the bishop's palace, killing three and injuring 15. Scaffolding around the north tower caught fire, spreading the blaze to all parts of the timber frame superstructure. The lead in the roofing melted and poured through the stone gargoyles, destroying in turn the bishop's palace. Images of the cathedral in ruins were shown during the war by the indignant French, accusing the Germans of the deliberate destruction of buildings rich in national and cultural heritage. Restoration work began in 1919, under the direction of architect Henri Deneux, a native of Reims; the cathedral was fully reopened in 1938, thanks in part to financial support from the Rockefellers, but work has been steadily going on since. =Modern era= In 1955 Georges Saupique made a copy of \\"Le Couronnement de la Vierge\\" which can be seen above the cathedral entrance and with Louis Leygue copied many of the other sculptures on the cathedral facade. He also executed a statue of St Thomas for the north tower. The Franco-German reconciliation was symbolically formalized in July 1962 by French president Charles de Gaulle and German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, where in 1914 the Imperial German Army deliberately shelled the cathedral in order to shake French morale. The cathedral, former Abbey of Saint-Remi, and the Palace of Tau were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1991. On his 74th Pastoral Visit, Pope John Paul II visited Reims on 26 September 1996 for the 1500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis. While there, the Pope prayed at the same chapel where Jean-Baptiste de La Salle celebrated his first Mass in 1678. On 8 October 2016, a plaque bearing the names of the 31 kings crowned in Reims was placed in the Cathedral in the presence of Archbishop Thierry Jordan and Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, one of many pretenders to the French throne. =French royal church= The prestige of the Holy Ampulla and the political power of the Archbishop of Reims resulted from King Henry I of France, who was crowned here in 1027 and permanently established Reims Cathedral as the location of the coronation of the French monarch. All but seven of France's future kings would be crowned at Reims. The coronation of Charles VII in 1429 marked the reversal of the course of the Hundred Years' War, due in large part to the actions of Joan of Arc. She is memorialized at Reims Cathedral with two statues: an equestrian statue outside the church and another within the church. Exterior Gallery of Kings Reims Cathedral, view from northeast The cathedral's exterior glorifies royalty. In the center of the front facade and above the rose window is the Gallery of Kings, composed of 56 statues with a height of , with Clovis I in the center mid-baptism, Clotilde to his right, and Saint Remigius to his left. The three portals are laden with statues and statuettes; among European cathedrals, only Chartres has more sculpted figures. The central portal, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is surmounted by a rose window framed in an arch itself decorated with statuary, in place of the usual sculptured tympanum. The \\"gallery of the kings\\" above shows the baptism of Clovis in the centre flanked by statues of his successors. Exterior view of the chevet The facades of the transepts are also decorated with sculptures. That on the North has statues of bishops of Reims, a representation of the Last Judgment and a figure of Jesus (le Beau Dieu), while that on the south side has a modern rose window with the prophets and apostles. Fire destroyed the roof and the spires in 1481: of the four towers that flanked the transepts, nothing remains above the height of the roof. Above the choir rises an elegant lead-covered timber bell tower that is 18 m (about 59 feet) tall, reconstructed in the 15th century and in the 1920s. The total exterior length is 149.17 meters and its surface area is 6,650 square meters. Interior Nave The interior of the cathedral is 138.75 m (about 455 ft) long, 30 m (approx. 98 feet) wide in the nave, and 38 m (about 125 feet) high in the centre. It comprises a nave with aisles, transepts with aisles, a choir with double aisles, and an apse with ambulatory and radiating chapels. It has interesting stained glass ranging from the 13th to the 20th century. The rose window over the main portal and the gallery beneath are of rare magnificence. North aisle The cathedral possesses fine tapestries. Of these the most important series is that presented by Robert de Lenoncourt, archbishop under Fran√ßois I (1515‚Äì1547), representing the life of the Virgin. They are now to be seen in the former bishop's palace, the Palace of Tau. The north transept contains a fine organ in a flamboyant Gothic case. The choir clock is ornamented with curious mechanical figures. Marc Chagall designed the stained glass installed in 1974 in the axis of the apse. The treasury, kept in the Palace of Tau, includes many precious objects, among which is the Sainte Ampoule, or holy flask, the successor of the ancient one that contained the oil with which French kings were anointed, which was broken during the French Revolution, a fragment of which the present Ampoule contains.  800th anniversary  In 2011, the city of Reims celebrated the cathedral's 800th anniversary. The celebrations ran from 6 May to 23 October. Concerts, street performances, exhibitions, conferences, and a series of evening light shows highlighted the cathedral and its 800th anniversary. In addition, six new stained glass windows designed by Imi Knoebel, a German artist, were inaugurated on June 25, 2011. The six windows cover an area of and are positioned on both sides of the Chagall windows in the apse of the cathedral.

He is known for his complex lyrics, intricate delivery, and internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 327. Biography Monch released three albums as part of the rap duo Organized Konfusion with partner Prince Poetry: The self-titled Organized Konfusion, Stress: The Extinction Agenda and The Equinox. The duo handled a large amount of production on these albums themselves. All albums received positive critical reviews, but moderate sales. As a result, the duo split up after recording their final album The Equinox in 1997. Prince Poetry has since denied the possibility of an Organized Konfusion reunion. Pharoahe Monch then signed to Rawkus Records, an indie label. After making several guest appearances on albums like the best-selling Rawkus compilation Soundbombing II, Monch's much-hyped debut, Internal Affairs was released in 1999. The first single of the album, \\"Simon Says\\", became a hit single, peaking at No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also featured in the 2000 cinematic releases Charlie's Angels and Boiler Room. Despite its success, the song caused controversy when Monch was later sued for the song's use of a sample from Akira Ifukube's Gojira Tai Mosura in the hook. The uncleared sample use caused a halting in his album's distribution. After Internal Affairs and the controversy over its hit song, Pharoahe would not release another solo project for several years. He did still make some songs and guest appearances however. In 2000 he featured with Mos Def and Nate Dogg on the hit song \\"Oh No\\" from the Rawkus compilation record Lyricist Lounge 2. He contributed the song \\"Fuck You\\" to the Training Day soundtrack in 2001, and rapped the theme song to Madden NFL 2002. He also provided vocals on the track \\"Last Dayz\\" on the 2001 Adam F Album Kaos: The Anti-Acoustic Warfare and remixes of the track on the follow-up Drum & Bass Warfare, released the following year. In 2003 Pharoahe released his final single through Rawkus Records, \\"Agent Orange\\", a war inspired song which revisited the 1991 Organized Konfusion track \\"Releasing Hypnotical Gases\\". There were rumors his next album, at first tentatively titled Innervisions, was to be released under Denaun Porter's new Shady Records imprint Runyon Ave. They reached out to Stevie Wonder and were at the beginning processes of recording the album but apparently the deal fell through; Monch later announced a deal with Street Records Corporation, home of Wu-Tang Clan, David Banner and Terror Squad. On December 19, 2006, Pharoahe Monch released his first and only official mixtape, The Awakening, hosted by Clinton Sparks, DJ Boogie Brown. In June 2007, Monch released his second solo album Desire to critical acclaim. Monch said about the album; \\"...it's very soulful, very gospel, a fresh, new sound for me.\\" The album's lead single was the self-produced track \\"Push\\", with \\"Let's Go\\" as its B-side. The song's music video and single were released in late September 2006. Pharoahe Monch released a second music video entitled \\"When the Gun Draws\\" at a Brooklyn music festival in February 2007. The track was inspired by a song he did with Prince Po entitled \\"Stray Bullet\\" which was featured on the Stress: The Extinction Agenda album. A final video was made for the title track \\"Desire\\" in late 2007. It was directed by New Zealand director Andy Morton and shot on the Rock the Bells tour with full band. The video features both MeLa Machinko and Showtyme. On July 9, 2009, Pharoahe Monch allowed hip hop website HipHopDX.com to leak a song from his forthcoming album W.A.R. (We Are Renegades). The song was called \\"Shine\\" and featured vocals by MeLa Machinko and was also produced by Diamond D. On February 14, 2010, another song from Monch was leaked, which is called \\"Clap (One Day),\\" produced by M-Phazes. Pharoahe Monch released his third solo album W.A.R. (We Are Renegades) in March 2011. It featured guest appearances from Jill Scott, Styles P, Citizen Cope, Jean Grae, Royce da 5'9\\", Immortal Technique, Vernon Reid, Phonte, Mr. Porter, Mela Machinko, Showtyme & DJ Boogie Blind. Pharoahe revealed that the album is a \\"throwback to 1993, '94 hip-hop\\" and featured production by Exile, Marco Polo, M-Phazes, Fatin, Diamond D, Mike Loe, Samiyam, Adam Deitch, Eric Krasno and Pharoahe Monch himself. Four singles have been released from the album: \\"Shine\\", \\"Clap (One Day)\\", \\"Black Hand Side\\", and \\"Assassins\\".

The album is a conceptual follow up to his third album, W.A.R. (We Are Renegades). The album featured two singles, \\"Damage\\" and \\"Bad M.F.\\", both produced by Lee Stone. In late 2017 Pharoahe Monch was featured in a song by Keyon Harrold titled \\"Her Beauty Through My Eyes\\" from Keyon's latest album Mugician. Rapping technique Pharoahe Monch is acclaimed for his complex rapping technique \\\\- AllMusic says he has, \\"a reputation as one of underground hip hop's pre-eminent lyricists, crafting intricate and intelligent raps.\\" Kool Moe Dee ranks him at 26 in his best MCs of all-time list, from his book, There's a God on the Mic,Kool Moe Dee, 2003, There's A God On The Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, p.147. noting: \\"Pharoahe Monch is like an eloquent linguistics professor moonlighting as a rhyme serial killer terrorist, challenging the listeners' I.Q. while daring him or her to keep up.\\" Monch compares writing and recording his lyrics to writing and filming a movie - in the book How to Rap he says he will 'punch-in' vocals so he can \\"retake some things, just like a film\\",Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 276. and he 'rewrites' lyrics, saying he will \\"go back as a screenwriter and rewrite scenes and leave more to the imagination.\\"Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 198-199. For his biggest hit, \\"Simon Says\\", he comments that he wrote the choruses before he wrote the verses,Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 190. and fellow rapper and collaborator O.C. notes that Monch will write single lines down and then use them five years later.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 164. His vocal delivery is inspired by Jazz music and musicians such as John Coltrane.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 255-256.

History H√∏jris in the middle of the 19th century, prior to the extensive alterations H√∏jriis traces its history back to the beginning of the 15th century. The first known owner is Johan Skarpenberg, a knight in the service of Queen Margrethe I, who owned several other estates in the area, including Sp√∏ttrup Castle in Salling on the other side of the water. He is buried at Viborg Cathedral. The current castle dates from the second half of the 19th century. In the 20th century H√∏jriis was hit hard by the adverse times for Danish manors. The building fell into a state of despair and was left uninhabited from 1865. This situation lasted until 1994 when the property was acquired by the current private owners. Architecture The castle is a three-winged complex built in the Historicist style which dominated Danish architecture at the time of its construction. The north-west wing and the tower were designed by Hans J√∏rgen Holm and built in 1859. The north-east and south-west wings were designed by August Klein and built in 1876. The complex is surrounded by moats. H√∏jriis Castle today H√∏jriis is still under restoration. The estate comprises 434 ha of land.

A , it was originally named during its previous service with the United States Navy. It was the first destroyer escort to be operated by the Philippine Navy, and is the only member of its class ever operated by the service. Rajah Soliman was also the flagship of the Philippine Navy during its time in commission, which ended with the sinking of the vessel in 1964. Acquisition and service The ex- was transferred to the Philippine Navy on 31 October 1960, as a loan under the terms of the Military Assistance Program; on 21 April 1961, the ship was sold outright to the Philippines. Rajah Soliman served as the Philippine Navy's flagship during her service life. In June 1964, the ship entered a refit period at the Bataan National Shipyard, located in Mariveles, Bataan, for repairs to her engine. Sinking, raising, and disposal On 29 June 1964, Typhoon Winnie, also known as Typhoon Dading, hit the Bataan Peninsula; the storm surge associated with the cyclone struck Rajah Soliman, which was at the time docked at the shipyard's pier. The storm battered the ship's superstructure and starboard side against the pier, causing Rajah Soliman to capsize and sink at the dock. The effects of the storm also caused the wreck to fill with mud, sand and other debris. After the storm, an attempt to salvage the ship was made by the Philippine Navy; the attempt failed as a result of the necessary equipment not being available. The United States Navy agreed to salvage the ship as a training exercise, and between December 1964 and January 1965, two U.S. Navy salvage ships, and , used the parbuckle salvage technique to raise Rajah Soliman's wreck from the harbor floor. After the vessel had been successfully raised, it was towed to the Ship Repair Facility at Subic Naval Base, located nearby. A survey of the raised Rajah Soliman found that the ship had been damaged beyond economical repair. Designated for disposal, the hulk was sold for scrapping on 31 January 1966 to Mitsubishi International Corp.

He was the older brother of the chess master Richard R√©ti, but unlike his brother, Reti did not write his surname with an acute accent on the 'e'. Biography Reti was born in U≈æice in the Kingdom of Serbia and studied music theory, musicology and piano in Vienna. Among his teachers was the pianist Eduard Steuermann, an eminent champion of Schoenberg and a supporter of modern music. Reti was in contact with Schoenberg at the time of that composer's earliest atonal works, and in 1911 gave the first performance of his Drei Klavierst√ºcke Op.11. Reti's compositions have not remained in the repertoire, but he was an active composer and received a number of high-profile performances. At the end of the first International Festival of Modern Music in Salzburg, in 1922, his 'Six Songs' were performed alongside Schoenberg's Second Quartet; three years later, at the 3rd ISCM Festival in Prague, his Concertino for Piano and Orchestra shared a programme with Martinu's 'Half-Time' and Vaughan Williams's 'A Pastoral Symphony'. In 1938, his David and Goliath Suite was performed by Eduard van Beinum and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra. In 1948, Jean Sahlmark was the soloist in her husband's First Piano Concerto. Reti's output also includes several volumes of piano pieces and songs, an opera (Ivan and the Drum), as well as symphonic and choral music. Between 1930 and 1938 Reti was chief music critic for the Austrian newspaper Das Echo. Together with the composer and musicologist Egon Wellesz, he was involved in establishing the International Festival of Modern Music, and founded the International Society for Contemporary Music in 1922. In 1939 Reti emigrated to the United States and later became an American citizen. He became a member of the American Musicological Society, and came to hold a fellowship at Yale. From 1943 he was married to the pianist, teacher, musicologist and editor Jean Sahlmark, who helped prepare for publication his two posthumous books. He died in Montclair, New Jersey. Reti is best remembered today for his distinctive method of musical analysis, which he claimed revealed the 'thematic process' in music. His approach did not concern itself, however, with tracing the obvious thematic and motivic 'developments' displayed on the musical 'surface', but rather sought to demonstrate the way in which surface thematic variety is underpinned by a less apparent unity. For Reti, \\"the different movements of a classical symphony are built from one identical thought\\", [TPM, p. 13] and the composer \\"strives toward homogeneity in the inner essence but at the same time towards variety in the outer appearance. Therefore he changes the surface but maintains the substance of his shapes.\\" [TPM, p. 13] Reti's way of showing 'maintained substance' would usually involve constructing a music example which juxtaposed a number of contrasting themes; the 'homogeneity in the inner essence' was represented by the notes printed at full size; the 'variety in the outer appearance' would be relegated to small type. In focusing on shared features and hidden similarities in shape and contour, the tonal or harmonic significance of the various 'significant' notes in the themes would usually be ignored. So too would rhythm‚Äîwith the result that Reti's method focuses on relatively abstract 'pitch cells' rather than rhythmically defined 'motifs'. In addition to admitting inversional and retrograde relationships between cells, Reti also introduced the process of 'interversion', in which the notes of a cell would be re-ordered. Reti's analytical procedure is best understood concurrently to the work of other contemporary German analysts of the time such as Schenker and Schoenberg. Like Schenker, and Schoenberg, Reti's analysis of musical works was primarily motivic, tracing the evolution of a musical work from a melodic kernel. The preoccupation the three aforementioned theorists had with such procedure stems from a metaphysical belief that the works of the \\"great masters\\" (as exemplified in the First Viennese School) were unified thematically often, from a single idea. The metaphysical basis of this idea was the fact that such unity, was thought to be a metaphor for the unity of God's creation. Thus in Reti's analysis the \\"thematic process\\" is explored, in Schenker the analysis takes the form of a reductionist procedure, and in Schoenberg the unity of a musical work from a \\"Grundgestalt\\" (basic shape) is asserted. Reti's method, which is to be seen in the context of early-20th-century musicology, has been criticized by the music theorist Nicholas Cook, who regards Reti as having been over-concerned with proving the validity of his method, at the expense of producing convincing analyses of individual works.Cook, 1987, pp.2-3  Writings  * 'Salzburg - Verhei√üung und Gefahr', 23.

The film, which deals with LGBT rights issues in Serbia, features footage of the 2010 Belgrade gay pride parade. Despite the controversial subject, The Parade sold over 350,000 tickets in Serbian cinemas in the first 11 weeks of distribution, 150,000 in Croatia after 8 weeks, 25,000 in Slovenia, 40,000 in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 20,000 in Montenegro. Plot A group of gay activists are trying to organize a pride parade in Belgrade. Among them is Mirko Dedijer, a struggling theater director who mostly makes a living by planning lavish and kitschy wedding ceremonies. Organizing such a parade is no easy task in Serbia as evidenced by the violence at the 2001 attempt. Now, almost a decade later, the situation is not much better ‚Äì nationalist and right wing groups pose just as much threat particularly as the police refuse to secure the event. Mirko's effeminate boyfriend Radmilo, a veterinarian, is not as political and is content with keeping a low profile. Although the two try to live discreetly, both experience abuse from the homophobic majority. In parallel, we meet Mi≈°ko Dra≈°koviƒá a.k.a. Limun, a macho Serbian veteran of the Yugoslav Wars in his mid-to-late forties. No stranger to criminal activities, divorced Limun operates a judo club that doubles as a bodyguard agency (whose clientele mostly consists of nouveau riche businessmen and female turbo-folk singers) while dating Biserka, a younger, low-brow ditsy trophy girlfriend who runs a beauty parlour. His son from a previous marriage, Vuk, works in an auto repair shop and is a member of a fringe right wing skinhead group that attacks gay people. The paths of the two couples cross. Radmilo performs a life-saving operation on Limun's beloved bulldog, the victim of a drive-by shooting that served as a warning to its master. Simultaneously, Biserka seeks out Mirko with a view of hiring him to plan hers and Limun's wedding. The eventual meeting of the two couples goes horribly wrong with Limun's violent and homophobic side emerging, which serves as the catalyst for Mirko (who had already obtained an Immigrant Visa for Canada) to leave Radmilo and Biserka to leave Limun. Biserka decides to end contact with Limun but calls Mirko to apologize. Radmilo picks up the phone and, learning of the circumstances of Biserk and Limun, sees an opportunity and formulates a plan. He then shows up at Limun's agency/judo club offering Mirko's services in organizing his wedding party in return for Limun's personnel securing the gay parade. Limun reluctantly accepts, and, though Biserka returns to him, his Serbian staff refuse to protect homosexuals, partly due to the likely reaction of their community. Seeing no other option, Limun decides to contact former wartime adversaries, most of them who engaged in petty smuggling across the borders during the Yugoslav wars. Limun and Radmilo embark on a recruiting trip all over ex-Yugoslavia. They manage to sign up for their mission: Roko (45) a Croat war veteran who now runs a kafana, Halil (50) a Bosniak who owns a video rental parlour, and Azem (45), an Albanian from Kosovo who makes a living by selling drugs, mostly to the US troops stationed there. When Limun's attempt to train the gay activists in martial arts fails, the skinheads refuse to be bought off and the police decline a bribe to protect the parade, the tiny group is attacked and brutalized. However, the film ends by celebrating a successful parade the following year.

He wrote the first screenplay draft for Parada in 2004 before coming back to it in 2007 after failing to secure financing for his other film project titled 1999. In that time he experimented with framing the screenplay within different genres, but eventually decided that politically incorrect comedy is the best platform to tell this story. He penned the final version of the script over three weeks during summer 2008 while on vacation on the island of Mljet. By fall 2009, Dragojeviƒá was ready to start shooting with the original plan being to shoot the parade scenes at the actual 20 September 2009 gay pride parade in Belgrade that ended up getting called-off due to security concerns. The shooting actually began a year later at the 2010 parade and continued in late March 2011 on locations in Croatia (Pag, Rab, and Obrovac) and Macedonia (Bitola). According to one of its producers Biljana Prvanoviƒá, Parada cost ‚Ç¨1.3 million to make and its funding came from European Council's Eurimages fund, Croatian Audio-Visual Center (HAVC), Serbian Ministry of Culture, Slovenian Ministry of Culture, Macedonian Ministry of Culture, and embassies of Germany, the Netherlands, and France in Belgrade as well as Serbian companies Dunav Osiguranje, Prva Srpska Televizija, and Serbia Broadband. Dragojeviƒá complained in interviews that over hundred companies in Serbia turned him down for funding due to not wanting to be associated with a gay-themed project. Listed as the film's producers are: Biljana Prvanoviƒá of the Delirium Films from Serbia, Igor Nola from the Croatian Audio-Visual Center (HAVC), Eva Rohrman from Slovenia's Forum Film, Vladimir Anastasov from Macedonia's Sektor Film, and Mike Downey from the UK's Film and Music Entertainment (F&ME;). =Director's statement= Release and box office =General theatrical release= After the media screening on 28 October 2011, Parada premiered in Belgrade's Sava Centar on Monday, 31 October and in Serbian movie theaters from 1 November. Premiere in Novi Sad was held on November the 1st and in Ni≈° on 18 November. In Montenegro, premiere took place in Podgorica on 16 November. In late January 2012, Serbian government's Ministry of Education and Science (headed by cabinet minister ≈Ωarko Obradoviƒá and vice-minister Zoran Kostiƒá, both from the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)) sent out a notice to school boards across Serbia about free screenings of Parada for principals and teachers of elementary and secondary schools, essentially recommending the movie as a work that promotes tolerance. The idea initiated by the movie's director Dragojeviƒá was to organize free screenings (the expense was covered by the film distributor and movie theater owners) for principals and teachers and then leave it up to their discretion whether they want to take their pupils to the cinema at a cut price as part of overall education on homosexuality. Dragojeviƒá managed to get the theater owners to cover the free screenings for principals and teachers because according to Zoran Cvetanoviƒá, the owner of Art vista theaters \\"the potential of a number of teenagers seeing the film, even at a cut price, meant increased business for us, especially since that demographic was noticeably absent during Parada's commercial theatrical run\\". Some, such as Miodrag Sokiƒá, the president of Belgrade's gymnasia forum, criticized the fact that the Ministry decided to support someone's private commercial project: \\"In the last four years (since this ruling coalition has been in power), no other movie got a recommendation from the Ministry in this manner. Supporting a movie, even as an extracurricular activity, is meddling in the school curriculum and that is serious stuff. I don't blame the movie's director Dragojeviƒá, but I really have a problem with the Ministry's recommendation\\". In March and April 2012, Serbian police arrested several individuals suspected of participating in online copyright infringement and illegal distribution of film copies. The premieres in Bosnia and Herzegovina were respectively held, only in Republika Srpska entity, on 7 November in Bijeljina and on 10 December in Banja Luka, In Croatia, premieres were held in December ‚Äì December 12 in Zagreb, December 13 in Rijeka and December 14 in Split. For a time there were discussions over whether the film will be shown with subtitles in Croatia, but in the end the distributor decided against it. Much like in Serbia, the Croatian theatrical audience also responded in great numbers. After its first day of general release in the country on seven screens across Croatia, Parada was seen by 1,500 people, which according to the local distributor is on par with Hollywood blockbuster openings in Croatia. Initially projected to sell more than 60,000 admission tickets in the country, which would be more than all Croatian films combined sell recently in a single year, Parada ended up selling more than 150,000 thus overtaking 2005's ≈†to je mu≈°karac bez brkova? at the second spot of the Croatian all-time theater list (first is still 1996's Kako je poƒçeo rat na mom otoku with more than 200,000). Final figure of tickets sold reached almost 170,000. In mid March the film got refused from Visia cinema in Dubrovnik that's managed by the Catholic Church's local diocese. Since that particular movie theater is the only operational one in the entire city, Parada effectively got banned from the city of Dubrovnik. Explaining the decision, Mate Uziniƒá, the bishop of Dubrovnik, listed two reasons for refusal of Parada ‚Äì first, that it promotes sin and homosexual lifestyle, and secondly, that \\"it present a view of the Homeland War that the Dubrovnik Diocese can't get behind\\". In Macedonia the premiere was held in Skopje on 16 December, followed by Bitola on the 17th. In Slovenia, the premiere was held in Ljubljana on December 20. By early March 2012, the film got a 'golden ribbon' in Slovenia for 25,000 admission tickets sold in the country's theaters. So far only Slovenian productions or co-productions were able to reach the figure, the last one being 2001's No Man's Land. On 25 January, the film started playing in theaters in Bosnia and Herzegovina's other entity, Federacija BiH, though no special event premieres were held there. The movie soon reached the 18,000 admission tickets figure. From 2 March, the film went into theatrical release in Austria, following a premiere at Vienna's UCI Kinowelt Millennium City multiplex. =Festival circuit= The film has been accepted for the 2012 Berlinale's Panorama programme as the only film from former Yugoslavia out of twenty that applied for the festival. At the festival, the movie's producers struck a distribution deal for the French market with Sophie Dulac Distribution as well as a distribution deal for the Bulgarian market. The film had a premiere showing in Berlin on 13 February 2012, as well as two more press screenings. Parada received the Panorama Audience Award for feature film among 23,500 votes. It also won the Siegess√§ule (German LGBT magazine) readers' award as well as the Ecumenical Jury (representing the Protestant and Catholic Churches' international film organisations ‚Äì Interfilm and Signis) special mention.

Furthermore, audio commentaries from Srdjan Dragojevic, Nikola Kojo and Milos Samolov. Reaction Press' Branko Rosiƒá gave the film a highly favourable notice, comparing its \\"hilarious dialogues\\" to Dragojeviƒá's highly regarded earlier works, such as Lepa sela lepo gore and Rane. Danas columnist and well- known Serbian novelist Svetislav Basara wrote about Parada in his regular column, praising its narrative form and extolling its virtue. Another established Serbian writer, Marko Vidojkoviƒá, devoted one of his columns in Kurir to the movie, describing the experience of watching Parada in one of Belgrade's multiplexes. Since at the time of his column, the movie was already a verified box office hit, approaching 200,000 admissions in Serbia alone, Vidojkoviƒá praised Dragojeviƒá for \\"effectively organizing the biggest pride parade in the Balkans in his trademark Malcolm McLarenesque manner\\". The movie's and its director's politics also sparked reaction in the Serbian non- mainstream and fringe media. Ajla Terziƒá of the far-left portal Pe≈°ƒçanik refers to Parada as the cinematic equivalent of kavurma, a cheap cholesterol- filled dish that's \\"consumed by lowbrow and low income masses who do so because it is affordable, thus disregarding its horrendous nutritional effects\\". Bo≈æidar Maslaƒá of the centre-right portal NSPM concentrated on the movie's poster in his notice, feeling that it \\"ripped-off the Belgrade Zoo logo\\" and seeing it as yet another plagiarism in Dragojeviƒá's cinematic career. Jelena ƒêuroviƒá's (of the far left-wing Agitpop) take on Parada is prefaced with an admission of a personal crush on Srƒëan Dragojeviƒá she developed back in the early 1990s when he first appeared on the Serbian public scene, which was followed by a long list of personal disappointments in him due to her having problems with the political, ideological, and sociological aspects of his career choices and movies. However, she likes the politics of Parada and claims to be back to square one with Dragojeviƒá. Republika Srpska vice-president Emil Vlajki wrote at length about Parada in Fokus daily, seeing it as another tool of the US-sponsored \\"mental genocide\\" while labeling Dragojeviƒá \\"a talented director who sold his soul to the devil for fistful of dollars\\". Following its 12 December premiere showing in Zagreb, Parada got a short affirmative notice from Veƒçernji list's Milena Zajoviƒá. Similarly, after the Split premiere two days later, Slobodna Dalmacija's Marko Njegiƒá wrote an affirmative report from the event. Croatian novelist Ante Tomiƒá wrote about Parada in his regular Slobodna Dalmacija column, praising it as \\"an example of marvelous artistic manipulation where the author shamelessly used horrendous politically incorrect technique to make a film that, when viewed as an overall unit, couldn't be more politically correct\\". Mima Simiƒá, Croatian film critic and an LGBT activist, touched on the film and its commercial success during her interview for BH Dani, calling it \\"calculated and cunning work whose main goal is to regain audiences of former Yugoslavia and win Western markets\\". She further thinks the subject of gay rights as a symbol of transition in eastern Europe is \\"a gold mine that Dragojeviƒá is fully taking advantage of\\". She concludes by saying the film shows the Balkans are beginning to understand that \\"it's not really OK to beat up gays\\". In parallel with its domestic theatrical success, Parada started receiving notices and getting reviewed abroad. One of the first notices was Paul Canning's on international LGBT website Care2 followed by a notice in Screen International as the film posted great numbers in Serbian and Croatian cinemas. It was also the subject of an affirmative entry by Phil Hoad on his blog on The Guardian website. With the film's showing at the 2012 Berlinale, Parada received affirmative notices in major outlets such as Reuters, Der Spiegel, Agence France-Presse, and L'Orient Le Jour, as well as online outlets such as Gay Star News, Splitsider, and Europa. Following the Catholic Church's decision to ban the film in Dubrovnik, Parada got a notice from Associated Press as well as another one from Reuters. Critical reception =Serbia= In the mainstream Serbian print media, the film received generally positive reviews and notices. Politika's Dubravka Lakiƒá stated that, by \\"employing shallow, occasionally lowbrow humour delivered through effective jokes and quick yucks\\", Dragojeviƒá made a \\"thoroughly watchable, rhythmically populist film that sends out a call to tolerance and a message that love always triumphs\\". Blic's Milan Vlajƒçiƒá classified the film as a \\"bitterly unbridled comedy that significantly departs from what usually constitutes a situation comedy in Serbia\\". He went on to compare Parada's \\"uncontrolled and slightly anarchic humour, filthy street lingo, and playing with stereoypes\\" with Mel Brooks' Producers and Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka, concluding that Dragojeviƒá \\"avoided banal moralizing while packing the film with funny stereotypes\\". Danas' Pavle Simjanoviƒá compares aspects of Parada with Mike Nichols' The Birdcage and even Norman Jewison's The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming while expressing concern that Dragojeviƒá's film won't have the intended effect of \\"ridding the stubborn majority of its phobias towards this stigmatized minority\\" because the director at some point stopped making a comedy and instead turned to creating a political pamphlet. The movie got its most glowing review from Miroljub Stojanoviƒá writing in NIN magazine who sees Parada as \\"an uncompromising, subtle, and primarily intelligent film, which examines today's Serbia with such minutia that it possess all the qualities of hyperrealism\\". He concludes by saying that \\"Parada is not only the Serbian society's ultrasound, it is its MRI\\". Writing for B92 radio-television's web portal, in a mixed review Slobodan Vujanoviƒá feels that though it causes many of the film's faults, Parada' topicality is a sign of bravery and virtue on Dragojeviƒá's part. He further sees \\"this satirical comedy with a sad ending\\" as a \\"rough, arrogant, objective, and angry criticism of our society as well as the sociopathic nature of some inhabitants of former Yugoslavia who don't mind being soaked in human blood up to their elbows, but won't be caught dead shaking hands with a faggot\\". While approving of Parada' comedic aspects, Vujanoviƒá has issues with the moral stance of its satirical ones, feeling that some the film's cliche characters, especially the former wartime adversaries \\"all of whom are psychopaths who engaged in some horrible stuff during the war\\", receive an undue redemption. The reviews in the Serbian online media are more mixed. Although he still gave Parada passing marks, Popboks' ƒêorƒëe Bajiƒá has problems with the film's overall tone and its \\"lack of tact and subtlety\\", concluding that it \\"hits the target when it comes to delivering a loud and unconstrained pastime, but fails when it tries to be anything more than that\\". The review by KakavFilm.com is essentially more of the same while the review published by Filmovanje.com feels Parada could've been a great movie had Dragojeviƒá been more direct, brave, and worthwhile\\" concluding that \\"as it is, at times, you're not sure whether you're watching Tesna ko≈æa or ≈†i≈°anje\\". Writing for far-left portal E-novine, Vladan Petkoviƒá was extremely critical, seeing Parada as \\"nothing more than a marketing trick\\" while citing its main problem to be the fact that \\"protagonists are caricatures while antagonists are stereotypes\\". He continues: \\"Dragojeviƒá tried his hardest to pack the film with witty dialogues and thus provide new material for the Balkan movie audiences' favourite activity ‚Äì citing movie one-liners. And I must say I laughed a few times at some original jokes, but for that to truly work well, the movie must be good as a whole unit (such as Maratonci..., Ko to tamo peva, Varljivo leto '68, Kako je propao rokenrol...), which Parada isn't. It stays in the realm of politically correct fuck-about that's camouflaged in political incorrectness\\". On the other hand, Marko Radojiƒçiƒá of medio.rs gave Parada a particularly favourable review, praising its casting, direction, attention to detail as well as its overall message, and City Magazine gave the film another glowing review, calling it Dragojeviƒá's best work. The film also received online notices from Slobodan Georgijev in BalkanInsight. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= Though still not widely reviewed, it got a negative notice from RS newspaper Nezavisne novine's Branko Tomiƒá who commends the movie's trailer, but reprimands Dragojeviƒá for \\"not being brave enough to shake up Serbia out if its slumber by showing it a passionate gay kiss\\". He further feels that the public set \\"big social expectations for the movie based upon the trailer and the director's earlier works\\", but thinks they will not be met and that the movie will disappear in the viewers' minds shortly after leaving the theater. Though it did not start playing in Federation BiH's cinemas until 25 January, Parada got some online reviews even before that date. Mirko V. Iliƒá of depo.ba gave the film a negative review, seeing it as a \\"mixture of camp comedy (first 100 minutes) and drama about two Serbias (the rest of the film)\\" and labeling the former \\"solid, well directed, and not bad\\" and the latter \\"unbearably bad\\". He further feels the movie is calculated and disingenuous for not showing a gay kiss and thinks \\"the movie will not help cure the Balkaniod Belgrade whose prominent representative is also Dragojeviƒá himself judging by his previous films\\". =Croatia= Vjesnik published a positive review with Bo≈æidar Trkulja seeing Parada to be about various forms of love, which Dragojeviƒá \\"skillfully mixes and frames into a compact, humour-laden, and pleasant cinematic experience\\". The review by Jutarnji list's Jurica Paviƒçiƒá is punctuated by his claim that \\"gifted cynic Dragojeviƒá who primarily possesses propensity and capacity for ridicule and whose previous movies are built on superior and often antipathetic sarcasm ... has finally delivered something which he never did before ‚Äì a movie with lots of tenderness\\". In between comparing aspects of Parada with films by Akira Kurosawa and John Sturges, Paviƒçiƒá praises the actors, criticizes the film's production design, and concludes by praising Parada as a \\"lovable, shamelessly and purposely populist work that gives you a bitter political lesson wrapped in cotton candy\\". Writing in Novosti, the weekly aimed at the Serb minority in Croatia, Kino Radiƒá gives the film an extremely negative review, feeling that Dragojeviƒá \\"turned to hyperbolization of stereotypes, both gay and ethnic, in order to be ideologically controversial as well as to, through populism, attract a large audience, all of which would've been fine had the movie been uproariously funny, but it is dominantly unfunny and, as it goes on, increasingly boring\\". He further reproaches Dragojeviƒá for \\"drastically losing the rhythm\\" and calls him out for \\"ideological malice which the director already exhibited previously in Lepa sela lepo gore and now continued in Parada through the Albanian narcodealer character who is not only the most deplorable of all criminals in the multiethnic group, but also has the most perverse sexual habits having once engaged in a sexual act with a zebra and giving it an STD, all of which is supposed to be funny\\". Mladen ≈†agovac of moj-film.hr concentrates more on Parada's political than stylistic aspects in his positive review, and in this regard singles out the character of Mirko \\"whose transformation from effeminately feeble gay person into a confrontational one represents both a call to reason and a war cry that will surely serve to soften the bizarre, nationalistically-rooted, anti-gay views of the people across Balkans\\". Marcella Jeliƒá of tportal.hr gave Parada a negative review, feeling Dragojeviƒá made \\"a series of morally deeply problematic decisions in the film, the most obvious of which is presenting hardened criminals, chauvinists, war profiteers, and thugs as sympathetic and charming characters\\". She concludes by exclaiming: \\"Still, I'd be willing to forgive all of its shortcomings had Parada been truly funny, but it isn't except in a few rare moments. As it is, its only saving grace is that its noble aim justifies its means. It's just too bad its means are so boring\\". Robert Jukiƒá of film-mag.net also didn't like the film, seeing it as \\"a fairly uneven product that balances between comedy and drama in which Dragojeviƒá sinks his teeth into some hot topics such as corruption and war profiteering, but the end result is pale and aloof\\". He also feels its humour is forced and pandering while expressing doubt whether the movie will appeal to Croatian cinema-going public \\"because homophobia is not such a big problem in our country like it is in the neighbouring one\\". All Srdjan Dragojevic's Parades =Slovenia= review by Delo ‚Äì the greatest Pride Parade review by Simon Popek =Abroad= With its showing at the 2012 Berlinale, the movie started getting reviewed abroad. Calling Parada \\"a rude and raunchy challenge to Balkan homophobia\\", Screen International's Mark Adams praises \\"broad comedy fare that revels in its stereotyping and takes no prisoners\\" as well as Dragojeviƒá for \\"directing with a good deal of intelligence and being very much aware that his unsubtle characters offer an entertaining look at the culture clash between brutal Balkan machismo and a gay community\\". On the other hand, Jay Weissberg of Variety disliked the movie very much, writing: \\"Parada sees itself as a genial satire, but Srƒëan Dragojeviƒá's tired and tiresome caricatures are just embarrassing. Using formulaic traits ‚Äì effeminate gay men, over-macho nationalists ‚Äì to convince audiences to confront their homophobia might work for anyone still thinking Paul Lynde is fresh, but viewers who've watched gay-themed pictures mature since the 1970s will cringe at this naively well-meaning but hopelessly dated farce\\". In The Hollywood Reporter, Karsten Kastelan writes, \\"In this hilarious, raunchy comedy directed by Srdjan Dragojevic, a homophobic gangster is charged with protecting a gay pride parade in Belgrade\\".

His paintings typically comprised verse or biblical text set in fine borders with one or more inset illustrative pictures. History Henry Saxon was born in Ashton-under-Lyne in 1918 and as he grew up his grandfather encouraged him to follow his artistic talent. At the age of fourteen he joined the Manchester School of Art and studied art and, in particular, calligraphy.Miniature Art Society of Florida, Inc.. (Florida, 2000). p. 80 At 21, Henry joined the Army Medical Corps, married at 23 and lived in Africa until the end of the World War II. He then returned to England to join his wife Agnes. In 1940 he produced most of the 67 illustrations for a medical text on radiography: 'The Handbook of Radiography' by John A. Ross MA(Camb), MRSC (Eng), LRCP (Lond), DMRE (L'pool).

(London, 1995). Paintings Through his life, Henry produced many hundreds of miniatures. The calligraphy is typically exquisite, normally of poems or passages of scripture and beautifully set. The work starts with the draft text using a fine lead pencil, sanded to an even sharper point. Then with specially adapted pens, ground down by hand to produce a fine tip the text is completed and any gold leaf brushed onto the required sections. Then the borders and any paintings are incorporated.Burton, Sue Painting Miniatures. (London, 1995). p. 132, =Candle in the Wind= This illuminated script of a song, Candle in the Wind, written and popularized by Elton John. It was painted after the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 at which the song was sung by its composer. It features a classically illuminated first letter with a gold border and scroll text title. Heraldic roses, approximately 18, decorate and tumble around the relatively 'large' illuminated and highly decorative initial letter G; note the white burning candle in the centre of the G. A very fine line border in gold leaf, decorative at two of the corners, surrounds the whole illumination and text. =Magnificat= A totally unique oval miniature of the head of the Virgin Mary with a gold crown; there is an extravagant use of gold leaf for the crown. This miniature is painted in an icon style. Henry is conveying his own beliefs through this miniature. The amazing feature is the background, which looks alive, without solid colour but shimmering (Henry's background in printing would have helped him with the intricate Pointillism). This is a moment of cosmic significance, as the Virgin Mary accepts the task of bearing the Son of God. He achieved this through complex colour and use of dark and light. Scrolled wording of Mary's words: \\"My soul magnifies the Lord\\" is at the base of the miniature. Henry constantly looked for new ways of expression to enhance the calligraphy text he chose, and this is an unusual and strong demonstration of this trait. =A Good Wife and Mother= An oval miniature with biblical text from Proverbs Chapter 32, a border of scrollwork in autumnal colours growing in intensity to the base of the oval. Classic simplicity. =Silver by Walter De La Mare= The very delicate illustration, title and initial letters of each verse are in blue on a white background. The title is set in the top border which includes objects which are hinted at, you have to delve into this miniature and explore it to discover these. This miniature was placed in an exhibition of miniatures by seventeen contemporary miniaturist at the Medici Galleries in Grafton Street, Bond Street, London in 1985. This is the only miniature by Henry that has been printed and reproduced. =Thou Who wast Rich Beyond all Splendour= Three verses of a hymn by Bishop Frank Houghton (1894‚Äì1972) describing the mystery of the Incarnation of Christ. The two small miniature illustrations depict the splendour of the Godhead at the top and the lowly nativity scene at the bottom. The border is in a rich blue with scroll work of gold leaf draws attention to the reference of 'saphire-paved courts'. The nativity has similarities to one within a group of pictures from an English manuscript \\"Psalter: ms. Arundel 83, British Museum Six scenes from the childhood of Christ, folio 124 R.\\" of the 14th century at the British Museum, A plate of which is within Treasures of Illumination English Manuscripts of the Fourteenth Century (c1250 to 1400) described by The Rev. Canon F. Harrison, MA, FSA Chancellor and Librarian of York Minster. (1937) London: The studio Ltd. New York: The Studio Publications Inc. =To the Cuckoo by William Wordsworth= Amazing and very details scroll work on the border surrounding the 7 verses, the lettering and calligraphy is very small. 8 small miniatures each surrounded by a border of gold-leaf are present, 5 different shapes have been used for these. 5 of these small miniatures have burst of light with a bird which gives a sense of movement and flight. The slightly larger miniature of a cuckoo at the top centre also incorporates boughs and leaves of a tree. There are two small portraits within each side of the border one a school boy and the other a more mature man reflecting, both of these illustrate the wording within the poem. This miniature is painted in predominantly blue but also with green. =Prayer of Dedication= Two borders surround the text from Ignatius Loyola (1491). The outer border a fine line of gold-leaf. The inner border is also outlined with gold leaf and is totally filled with scroll work of reds and pinks changing through to purples and to blues, the main swathes are in green. The top and right section of the border are narrow compared to the bottom border and the left border which has yet a further increase. A small raised square miniature framed by curved gold leaf is on the top left corner of the border; it depicts the head of Christ at the crucifixion. The background to this small miniature of Christ's death can be compared to that of the miniature of the Magnificat the response to announcement of Christ's conception, and of both it could be said: \\"The amazing feature is the background, which looks alive, without solid colour but shimmering. This is a moment of cosmic significance.\\" The contrasts between the two backgrounds are in the colouring: the announcement of the conception is full of colour but the crucifixion is in solely brown tones. This miniature displays calligraphy which is comparatively large for Henry, showing it probably was a miniature painted after his stroke, Henry displayed a strong determination to overcome his disability and continue with his fine miniature art work. =The Shepherd Boy Sings in the Valley of Humiliation= This miniature is a consideration of the difference between contentment and the burden of much with text by John Bunyan. One wonders why such an ornate illumination with much use of gold leaf has been chosen. There is gold leaf on the pinnacles, borders, and in the scroll work, it is also on the border around the small raised miniature painting of the humble shepherd boy. Perhaps it is all to create a great contrast between the simplicity of the shepherd boy with \\"here little\\" and the richness in gold illustrating the \\"hereafter bliss\\". A detailed description of the sequence of producing this miniature is found in The Techniques of Painting Miniatures. This miniature was exhibited as part of the 2nd World Miniature Exhibition in Hobart Tasmania in the year 2000. Note on Piano Key Miniatures An old piano was left outside a house in Harrow, ready for refuse. The keys were examined and found to be ivory. Henry sought permission to keep the unworn and unchipped keys. Most of the piano key sized miniatures he crafted were on ivory from this source. =Pitstone Mills= A Windmill with brick factory chimneys in the background (now demolished). Sense of power of the wind depicted in the clouds and the contrast of the golden calm of harvest gathered in. (Piano key) =The Lord is my Shephard= Two miniatures were painted of this text on piano keys for his first wife Agnes, one with a predominance of reds and the other with blues. Exceptional detail on a very small 'canvas'. (Piano key) =Loves Eternal Knot= A red background, the colour of love, which has edging at times straight and at other points intricately curved. The short text is presented on 2 scrolls but the centrepiece is an unending knot presented in gold leaf. (Piano key) =The Lord Bless and Keep Thee= Surrounding this blessing a large amount of gold leaf is used on the border. The top border uses features which convey cathedral or church arches and pinnacles, (this was developed and also used in the miniature 'The Shepherd Boy Sings'): this feature is portrayed in early illuminations in The Saint-Omer Hours 1350 British Library London Add. ms.36684 Books of Hours and Their Owners, John Hartman Thames and Hudson 1997 Adoration of the Magi. On this upright oblong piano key the heavenly blessing depicted by gold cathedral pinnacles plus a starry sky is seen to be transferred and descending to the bottom of the miniature with the word 'THEE'. (Piano key) =Treasure= This picture features on the cover of The Magic of Miniatures with Psalm 121 and \\"A Poem\\" by Cecil Spring-Rice inside. Miniatures without Illumination or Calligraphy =Swiss Alps above Wengen= A line drawing of a Swiss chalet, path and tree within the alps. A wash of walnut was applied to the Bristol board. Touches of white can be seen on the mountains.

Young Arran James was born in 1606 at Hamilton Palace in Lanarkshire, the son of James, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton, and the Lady Ann Cunningham, daughter of James, 7th Earl of Glencairn. Following the death of his insane great-uncle James, Earl of Arran, in 1609, the infant was styled Earl of Arran.Scots' Peerage Vol IV pp. 375‚Äì6 =Heir to the Throne of Scotland= The young Earl of Arran's close ancestor was the Princess Mary, daughter to James II of Scotland and Mary of Gueldres. After the death in 1612 of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, James became third in line to the throne of Scotland, after Charles, Duke of Rothesay, and his sister Elizabeth. =Education= James VI's first visit to Scotland since the Union of the Crowns occurred in early 1617, whilst in Scotland, he was apparently charmed by The 2nd Marquess of Hamilton, and invited him to court in London. The Marquess duly arrived in London in August of that year, with his eleven-year-old son, Lord Arran. Although like most noblemen's sons of the time he had a private tutor, James Bale, Arran's time spent at court in the ensuing years did not consist of much formal education. To remedy this, Arran was sent to Exeter College, Oxford; he matriculated on 14 December 1621. =Art collection= The future 1st Duke of Hamilton was interested in art from a young age and collected Venetian paintings through his agent Viscount Basil Feilding.'To Much Bewiched with Thoes Intysing Things': The Letters of James, Third Marquis of Hamilton and Basil, Viscount Feilding, concerning Collecting in Venice 1635-1639, by Paul Shakeshaft, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 128, No. 995 (Feb., 1986), pp. 78+114-134 An inventory of his collection was made sometime after Charles I's retreat from London in November 1642 and before 12 April 1643, which included 600 entries, of which half were Venetian paintings from the collections of Bartolomeo della Nave and others. A good portion of this collection later came into the hands of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels and forms a key part of the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna today. =Marriage= The Marquess meanwhile had been intriguing with George, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Like all ambitious upstarts at court, Buckingham was keen to consolidate his new-found fortunes by allying himself and his family with established and wealthy families. Buckingham proposed to wed Lord Arran to his niece Mary, daughter to William, Viscount Feilding, an undistinguished Warwickshire squire. Lord Hamilton, despite his misgivings regarding Buckingham's lowly origins, was impressed enough by his influence with the King, to accept his suggestion. On 16 June 1622, the fifteen-year-old Arran married 9-year old Mary Feilding in the presence of the King. Arran was not consulted and later came to bitterly resent it. Marquess of Hamilton Portrait by Dani√´l Mijtens of James, then Earl of Arran, in 1623 (age 17). Painting is owned by Tate Britain, London. Lord Arran succeeded as The 3rd Marquess of Hamilton in April 1625. On 2nd March 1625, the 2nd Marquess died at Whitehall of a seizure. His death was blamed on fever, although the speed of his death and his age, thirty-six, made many suspect poison. King James died three weeks later. The new 3rd Marquess of Hamilton, as Lord Arran now became, received all his father's titles, and also the same annuity his father had received from the court of ¬£2,500 sterling. At the coronation of King Charles I, young Lord Hamilton bore the Sword of State at Westminster Abbey.Burnet, p.135 In 1628, Lord Hamilton was made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, a privy counsellor in both England and Scotland, and in the same year was made Master of the Horse, a post he stayed in until 1644.:Burnet, p.136 He represented the King of Bohemia at the baptism of the infant Prince Charles.Burnet, p 136  Hamilton's army in Germany In 1631 Hamilton took over an army to assist Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War in Germany. He raised these based on warrants to levy 6,000 men in England and a further 6,000 in Scotland. There has been much historical debate as to how many men landed initially, how many served in total and how effective these were. What is now known is that the initial contingent of 8,000 landed in Germany and other regiments, such as those of Sir Frederick Hamilton and Alexander Lord Forbes which were raised on warrants designed for the Marquis, actually arrived in Germany but served in the army group of Swedish commander √Öke Tott.Grosjean, An Unofficial Alliance, pp.88-93; Murdoch and Grosjean, p.54 Having no military training, Hamilton was assigned Major General Alexander Leslie as his mentor and other Scottish officers after Leslie was wounded. The command structure of the Hamilton Army was largely Scottish and was drawn from a mix of existing Scottish commanders in Swedish service. Major General Alexander Leslie and 'Dear Sandy' Alexander Hamilton (General of Artillery) were to be supported by Lieutenant General Archibald Douglas, also of the artillery. Although collectively these men believed they served in the \\"Scots Army\\", Marquis Hamilton actually took the title of \\"General of British\\" from the existing commander with that title, General James Spens who confusingly was compensated with the title \\"General of Scots\\" thereafter.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.54. Despite being under-resourced, Hamilton's forces did greater service than they are usually given credit for. Under-clothed, and lightly armed, they lost many men to disease early on, but those who survived did very well. They guarded the river Oder while Gustavus Adolphus fought Tilly at the Battle of Breitenfeld. Thereafter Hamilton's army linked up with that of the Swedish field marshal, Johan Ban√©r, and the combined force attacked Magdeburg. To Hamilton's chagrin, Ban√©r wished to retire from the siege due to the cold and his response shows that even though not an experienced soldier, Hamilton was not without courage and made his feelings on the subject abundantly clear to Ban√©r: Thereafter the two armies split. Never being allowed to unite all the regiments he had raised into one single force, many of his regiments continued to fight in other theatres of the Thirty Years' War. Moreover, having been caught up in a serious dispute with the Swedish king, the marquis and many of his officers were discharged from service on 22 October 1632. He returned to Britain taking with him Sir James Hamilton of Priestfield, Colonel James Ramsay 'the fair' and Colonel John Hamilton along with a cohort of Scots.Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.61-62. Numerous others of the Hamilton army remained in Swedish service, not least generals Alexander Hamilton and Alexander Leslie, but also numerous of the lesser officers and the surviving common soldiers. Hamilton and Scotland On his return to Great Britain, Hamilton became Charles I's chief adviser in Scottish affairs. In May 1638, after the outbreak of the revolt against the new Prayer-Book, he was appointed commissioner for Scotland to appease the discontents. He described the Covenanters as being \\"possessed by the devil\\", and instead of doing his utmost to support the king's interests is said to have been easily intimidated by the covenanting leaders. Nevertheless, on 27 July 1638 Charles sent Hamilton back to Scotland with new proposals for the election of an assembly and a parliament, episcopacy being safeguarded but bishops being made responsible to future assemblies. After a wrangle concerning the mode of election he again returned to Charles. Having been sent back to Edinburgh on 17 September 1638, he brought with him a revocation of the prayer-book and canons and another covenant to be substituted for the national covenant. On 21 November 1638, Lord Hamilton presided over the first meeting of the assembly in Glasgow Cathedral, but dissolved it on 28 November 1638 on its declaring the bishops responsible to its authority. The assembly, however, continued to sit notwithstanding, and Hamilton returned to England to give an account of his failure, leaving the enemy triumphant and in possession. War was now decided upon, and Hamilton was chosen to command an expedition to the Forth to menace the rear of the Covenanters. However, he now faced his former military mentor Alexander Leslie, and the artillery specialist, Alexander Hamilton. Realising the strength of hs opposition when he arrived in the Forth on 1 May 1639, he found Royalists had seriously underestimated their opposition. This included his own mother, Anne, Dowager Marchioness of Hamilton, who served as a colonel in the Army of the Covenant and was said to have threatened to shoot her son dead if he landed his forces in Scotland.Edward Furgol, A Regimental History of the Covenanting Armies, 1639-1651 (John Donald, Edinburgh, 1990), p. 26. A correspondent wrote, \\"She goeth in armour and with a pistoll by her side readie charged, and wishes him there, saying shee would burie the bullets in his bowells.\\"HMC 6th Report: Hood (London, 1877), p. 352. Whatever prompted his hesitance, the proposed plan to land proved impossible and Hamilton was recalled in June. On 8 July 1639, after a hostile reception at Edinburgh, he resigned his commissionership. He supported The 1st Earl of Strafford's proposal to call the Short Parliament, but otherwise opposed him as strongly as he could, as the chief adversary of the Scots; and he aided Henry Vane the Elder, it was believed, in accomplishing Strafford's destruction by sending for him to the Long Parliament. Hamilton now supported the parliamentary party, desired an alliance with his nation, and persuaded Charles in February 1641 to admit some of their leaders into the council. On the death of Strafford (12 May 1641) Hamilton was confronted by a new antagonist in The 5th Earl of Montrose, who detested both his character and policy and repudiated his supremacy in Scotland. On 10 August 1641 Hamilton accompanied Charles on his last visit to Scotland. His aim now was to effect an alliance between the king and Archibald Campbell, 8th Earl of Argyll, the former accepting Presbyterianism and receiving the help of the Scots against the English parliament, and when this failed he abandoned Charles and adhered to Argyll. In consequence he received a challenge from Lord Ker, of which he gave the king information, and obtained from Ker an apology. Montrose wrote to Charles declaring he could prove Hamilton to be a traitor. The king himself spoke of him as being \\"very active in his own preservation\\". Shortly afterwards the plot‚Äîknown as \\"The Incident\\" ‚Äî to seize Argyll, Hamilton and the latter's brother, William Hamilton, Earl of Lanark, was discovered, and on 12 October 1641 they fled from Edinburgh. Hamilton returned not long afterwards, and notwithstanding all that had occurred still retained Charles's favour and confidence. He returned with him to London and accompanied him on 5 January 1642 when he went to the city after the failure to secure the five members. In July that year Hamilton went to Scotland on a hopeless mission to prevent the intervention of the Scots in the impending English Civil War, and a breach then took place between him and Argyll. Duke of Hamilton, and execution Arms of James, Duke of Hamilton On 12 April 1643, Hamilton was further ennobled. At Oxford, King Charles conferred upon the Marquess the titles of Duke of Hamilton, Marquess of Clydesdale, Earl of Cambridge, the Baronies of Aven and Innerdale; in addition he also regranted the Earldom of Arran. Earlier, in February 1643, proposals of mediation between Charles and Parliament came from Scotland, Hamilton instigated the \\"cross petition\\" which demanded from Charles the surrender of the annuities of tithes in order to embarrass The 1st Earl of Loudoun, the chief promoter of the project, to whom they had already been granted. This failing, he promoted a scheme for overwhelming the influence and votes of Argyll and his party by sending to Scotland all the Scottish peers then with the King, thereby preventing any assistance to Parliament coming from that quarter, while Charles was to guarantee the establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland only. This intrigue was strongly opposed by Montrose, who was eager to strike a sudden blow and anticipate and annihilate the plans of the Covenanters. Hamilton, however, gained over the Queen, Henrietta Maria, for his project, while Montrose was condemned to inaction. Hamilton's scheme, however, completely failed. He had no control over the parliament. He was unable to hinder the meeting of the convention of the estates which assembled without the King's authority, and his supporters found themselves in a minority. Finally, on refusing to take the Covenant, Hamilton and Lanark were obliged to leave Scotland. They arrived at Oxford on 16 December 1643. The Duke of Hamilton's conduct had at last incurred Charles's resentment and he was imprisoned in the house of a baker called Daniells, with only two servants and not allowed to leave the house. He was sent, in January 1644, a prisoner to Pendennis Castle, in 1645 being removed to St Michael's Mount, where he was liberated by Lord Fairfax's troops on 23 April 1646. In 1646, Charles conferred on the Duke the heritable office of Keeper of Holyroodhouse.Bain, p. 140 Subsequently he showed great activity in the futile negotiations between the Scots and Charles at Newcastle. In 1648, in consequence of the seizure of Charles by the army in 1647, Hamilton obtained a temporary influence and authority in the Parliament of Scotland over Argyll, and led a large force into England in support of the King on 8 July 1648. He showed complete incapacity in military command; was kept in check for some time by John Lambert; and though outnumbering the enemy by 24,000 to about 9,000 men, allowed his troops to disperse over the country and to be defeated in detail by Oliver Cromwell during the three days 17‚Äì19 August 1648 at the Battle of Preston, being himself taken prisoner on 25 August. He was tried on 6 February 1649, condemned to death on 6 March and executed by decapitation on 9 March. Character assessment Hamilton, during his unfortunate career, had often been suspected of betraying the King's cause, and, as an heir to the Scottish throne, of intentionally playing into the hands of the Covenanters with a view of procuring the Crown for himself. The charge was brought against him as early as 1631 when he was levying men in Scotland for the German expedition, but Charles gave no credence to it and showed his trust in the then 3rd Marquess of Hamilton by causing him to share his own room. The charge, however, always clung to him, and his intriguing character and hopeless management of the King's affairs in Scotland gave colour to the accusation. There seems, however, to be no real foundation for it. His career is sufficiently explained by his thoroughly egotistical character. Usually Hamilton is thought to have taken no interest whatever in the great questions at issue, and was neither loyal nor patriotic, and only desired peace and compromise to avoid personal losses. It has been said that \\"He was devoid of intellectual or moral strength, and was therefore easily brought to fancy all future tasks easy and all present obstacles insuperable\\".

P. Giannini (May 6, 1870 ‚Äì June 3, 1949) was an Italian-American banker who founded the Bank of Italy, which became Bank of America. Giannini is credited as the inventor of many modern banking practices. Most notably, Giannini was one of the first bankers to offer banking services to middle- class Americans, rather than only the upper class. He also pioneered the holding company structure and established one of the first modern trans- national institutions. Background Amadeo Pietro Giannini was born in San Jose, California, to Italian immigrant parents. He was the first son of Luigi Giannini (1840‚Äì1877) and Virginia (n√©e Demartini) Giannini (1854‚Äì1920). Luigi Giannini immigrated to the United States from Favale di Malvaro near Genoa, Liguria in the Kingdom of Sardinia (later part of Italy) to prospect in response to the California Gold Rush of 1849. Luigi continued in gold during the 1860s and returned to Italy in 1869 to marry Virginia, bringing her to the US and settling in San Jose. Luigi Giannini purchased a 40-acre farm at Alviso in 1872 and grew fruits and vegetables for sale. Four years later Luigi Giannini was fatally shot by an employee over a pay dispute. His widow Virginia, with two children and pregnant with a third child, took over operation of the produce business. In 1880, Virginia married Lorenzo Scatena (1859‚Äì1930) who began L. Scatena & Co. (which A.P. Giannini would eventually take over). Giannini attended Heald College but realized he could do better in business than at school. In 1885, he dropped out and took a full-time position as a produce broker for L. Scatena & Co. Giannini worked as a produce broker, commission merchant and produce dealer for farms in the Santa Clara Valley. He was successful in that business. He married Clorinda Cuneo (1866‚Äì1949), daughter of a North Beach, San Francisco real estate magnate, in 1892 and eventually sold his interest to his employees and retired at the age of 31 to administer his father-in-law's estate. He later became a director of the Columbus Savings & Loan, in which his father-in-law owned an interest. Giannini observed an opportunity to service the increasing immigrant population that were without a bank. At loggerheads with the other directors who did not share his sentiment, he quit the board in frustration and started his own bank. Bank of Italy Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco on October 17, 1904. The bank was housed in a converted saloon as an institution for the \\"little fellow\\". It was a new bank for the hardworking immigrants other banks would not serve. Deposits on that first day totaled $8,780. Within a year, deposits soared above $700,000 ($13.5 million in 2002 dollars). The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fires leveled much of the city. In the face of widespread devastation, Giannini set up a temporary bank, collecting deposits, making loans, and proclaiming that San Francisco would rise from the ashes. Immediately after the earthquake, he moved the vault's money to his home outside the fire zone in then-rural San Mateo, 18 miles away. A garbage wagon was used to haul the money, hidden beneath garbage. The fires had heated the vaults of other big banks, so that the sudden temperature change from opening them risked destroying the contents; many vaults were kept closed for weeks. During this period Giannini was one of the few bankers who could satisfy withdrawal requests and provide loans, operating from a plank across two barrels in the street. Giannini made loans on a handshake to those interested in rebuilding. Years later, he would recount that every loan was repaid. As a reward to the garbage man whose wagon transported the bank's assets, Giannini gave the man's son his first job when he turned 14. Branch banking was introduced by Giannini shortly after 1909 legislation that allowed branch banking in California. Its first branch outside San Francisco was established in 1909 in San Jose. By 1916, Giannini had expanded and opened several other branches. Giannini believed in branch banking as a way to stabilize banks during difficult times as well as expand the capital base. He bought banks throughout California and eventually Bank of Italy had hundreds of branches throughout the state. Bank of America Bank of America, Los Angeles had been established in 1923 by Orra E. Monnette. Giannini began investing in the Bank of America, Los Angeles because conservative business leaders in Los Angeles were less receptive to the Bank of Italy than San Franciscans had been. Bank of America, L.A. represented a growth path for Giannini, and Monnette, President and Chairman of the Board, was receptive to Giannini's investments. Upon finalizing the merger, Giannini and Monnette concurred that the Bank of America name idealized the broader mission of the new bank. By 1929, the bank had over 400 banking offices in California. The new institution continued under Giannini's chairmanship until his retirement in 1945; Monnette retained his Board seat and officer's position. Furthermore, as a condition of the merger, Monnette was paid for handing Giannini the \\"Foundation Story\\" rights to the bank, a decision that Monnette later came to regret. Prior to Monnette's creation of the Bank of America Los Angeles network, most banks were limited to a single city or region. Monnette was the first to create a system of centralized processing, bookkeeping and cash delivery. By diversifying the scope of community that the Bank of America served following its merger, the institution was better prepared to ride out minor, local economic issues.Ira Brown Cross, Financing an empire: history of banking in California (The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1927), pp. 318, 330 and 370. Giannini helped nurture the motion picture and wine industries in California. He loaned Walt Disney the funds to produce Snow White, the first full-length, animated motion picture to be made in the US. During the Great Depression, he bought the bonds that financed the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. During World War II, he bankrolled industrialist Henry Kaiser and his enterprises supporting the war effort. After the war, he visited Italy and arranged for loans to help rebuild the war-torn Fiat factories. Giannini also provided capital to William Hewlett and David Packard to help form Hewlett- Packard. Giannini founded another company, Transamerica Corporation, as a holding company for his various interests, including Occidental Life Insurance Company. At one time, Transamerica was the controlling shareholder in Bank of America. They were separated by legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1956, when Congress passed the Bank Holding Company Act, which prohibited bank holding companies' involvement in industrial activities. Giannini had long been a Republican, but with the collapse of the Republican Party in the Great Depression, he concerned himself with Democratic state politics. In the 1934 California gubernatorial election Giannini worked hard to block left-wing novelist Upton Sinclair from winning the primary for the Democratic nomination.

It has all the elements of Rajput architecture and draws largely on the plan of palaces of Orchha and Datia. The central high dome on the pillars, the Bengal domes on the sides, the windows with colored glass, carved stone 'jalis', domed bastions at the corners, extended porch and other exquisitely stone-carved elements, make the palace worth visiting. The palace is set in the middle of well-laid gardens with water channels and marble fountains. The carved stone works of Jalis, Jharokas, Chhatris, Chhajas, murals and many other artistic stone carvings, colored glass work on windows and door panels all have been done by the architect and craftsman from places like Jaipur, Rajasthan, Bengal and Saurashtra, and local Kutchi artisan community, the Mistris of Kutch and Suthars. The mixture and mingling of architect and style of different regions of India, as such, can be distinctly seen in design & architect of the Vijaya Vilas Palace. The balcony at the top affords a superb view of the surrounding area. The tiny intricate windows gives one feeling to be out in open, through which cool sea wind passes out. The campus also houses a Chhatri of Vijayaraji, who died in 1948, to whom this palace was very dear. Present Status Vijaya Vilas Palace has its own private beach which offers air-conditioned tented accommodation. The royal family of Kutch State now reside permanently in the palace, who earlier used it only as a summer resort. It was after the 2001 Gujarat earthquake in which one of the wings of their other palace at Bhuj - the Ranjit Vilas - was heavily damaged, they moved into Vijaya Vilas Palace. The Palace also houses a museum.

Simply defined as a competition between two or more states to have superior armed forces; a competition concerning production of weapons, the growth of a military, and the aim of superior military technology. The term is also used to describe any long-term escalating competitive situation where each competitor focuses on out-doing the others.  Examples  = Pre-First World War naval arms race = 1909 cartoon in Puck shows (clockwise) US, Germany, Britain, France and Japan engaged in naval race in a \\"no limit\\" game. The size and power of battleships grew rapidly before, during, and after World War I: a result of competitive shipbuilding among a number of naval powers, brought to an end by the upright=1.8 From 1897 to 1914, a naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany took place. British concern about rapid increase in German naval power resulted in a costly building competition of Dreadnought- class ships. This tense arms race lasted until 1914, when the war broke out. After the war, a new arms race developed among the victorious Allies, which was temporarily ended by the Washington Naval Treaty. In addition to the British and Germans, contemporaneous but smaller naval arms races also broke out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire; the Ottomans and Greece; France and Italy; the United States and Japan; and Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. =Nuclear arms race= United States and Soviet Union/Russia nuclear weapon stockpiles During the Cold War, an intense period between the Soviet Union and the United States and some other countries. This was one of the main causes that began the cold war, and perceived advantages of the adversary by both sides (such as the \\"missile gap\\" and ‚Äúbomber gap‚Äù) led to large spending on armaments and the stockpiling of vast nuclear arsenals. Proxy wars were fought all over the world (e.g. in the Middle East, Korea, Vietnam) in which the superpowers' conventional weapons were pitted against each other. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, tensions decreased and the nuclear arsenal of both countries were reduced.  Other uses  An evolutionary arms race is a system where two populations are evolving in order to continuously one-up members of the other population. This concept is related to the Red Queen's Hypothesis, where two organisms co- evolve to overcome each other but each fails to progress relative to the other interactant. In technology, there are close analogues to the arms races between parasites and hosts, such as the arms race between computer virus writers and antivirus software writers, or spammers against Internet service providers and E-mail software writers. More generically, the term is used to describe any competition where there is no absolute goal, only the relative goal of staying ahead of the other competitors in rank or knowledge. An arms race may also imply futility as the competitors spend a great deal of time and money, yet with neither side gaining an advantage over the other.

The exodermis is a membrane of variable permeability responsible for the radial flow of water, ions, and nutrients. It is the outer layer of a plant's cortex. The exodermis serves a double function as it can protect the root from invasion by foreign pathogens and ensures that the plant does not lose too much water through diffusion through the root system and can properly replenish its stores at an appropriate rate.  Overview and function  The exodermis is a specialized type of hypodermis that develops Casparian strips in its cell wall, as well as further wall modifications. The Casparian strip is a band of hydrophobic, corky-like tissue that is found on the outside of the endodermis and the exodermis. Its main function is to prevent solution backflow into the cortex and to maintain root pressure. It is also involved in ensuring that soil is not pulled directly into the root system during nutrient uptake.Cronquist, A (2019-06-21). \\"Angiosperm  Description, Evolution, Characteristics, & Taxonomy\\". Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved 2020-05-26. Exodermis cells are found on the outermost layer of almost all seeded vascular plants and the outer layer of the cortex of many angiosperms including onion, hoya canoas, maize, and sunflower plants but not on seedless vascular plants. As with most plant species, there is a large variety in the thickness and permeability of the exodermis, to better allow the plants to be suited to their environments. Although the term barrier is used to describe the exodermis, the exodermis behaves more like a membrane through which different materials can pass through. It can modify its permeability so that in response to different external stimuli, it can change to better suit the root's requirements.Volder A, van Iersel M, Raviv M, Lieth JH, Bar-Tal A (2019-01-01). \\"Chapter 2 - Root Growth, Physiology, and Potential Impact of Soilless Culture on Their Functioning\\", Soilless Culture (Second Edition), Elsevier, pp. 15‚Äì32, doi:10.1016/b978-0-444-63696-6.00002-5, , retrieved 2020-05-26 This serves as a function for survival, as root systems are exposed to changing environmental conditions and thus the plant needs to modify itself as necessary, either in thickening or thinning of Casparian strips or by changing the permeability of the band to certain ions. It also has been found to modify the permeability during the root growth and maturation.  Growth and Structure  Roots are specialized for the uptake of water, nutrients (including ions for proper function). Similar to the endodermis, the exodermis contains very compact cells and is surrounded by a Casparian band, two features which are used to restrict the flow of water to a symplastic fashion (through the cytoplasm) rather than apoplastic fashion which (through the cell wall) flow through passages through the cells' membranes called plasmodesmata. Plasmodesma are small junctions that provide a direct connection between the cytoplasm of two neighboring plant cells. Similar to gap junctions found in animal cells, they allow an easy connection between the two cells permitting the transfer of ions, water and intercellular communication. This connection in the cytoplasm allows for neighboring plants to act as if they have one cytoplasm; a feature that enables the proper function of the exodermis. Apoplast and symplast pathways through plasmodesma cells. The apoplast is located outside the plasma membrane of the root cells and is the location at which inorganic materials can diffuse easily according to their concentration gradient. This apoplastic region is broken up by Casparian strips. Sattelmacher, B (2001-02-01). \\"The apoplast and its significance for plant mineral nutrition\\". New Phytologist. 149 (2): 167‚Äì192. doi:10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00034.x. ISSN 0028-646X. The Casparian band is involved in the exodermal cell's ability to regulate water flow movement through the membrane as it is the hydrophobic nature of this band that controls the water entry and exit from the root. Exodermal cells have also found to develop another layer of thickened, tertiary hydrophobic substance on the inside of their plasma membrane walls known as the suberin lamellae which form a protective layer on the inside of the cortex of the exodermis. This layer is composed of a protein called suberin and is also hydrophobic meaning it also contributes to the ability of the exodermis to control water input. This added protection can result in the accelerated aging of the Casparian strips. Maturation of exodermal tissue occurs in three distinct stages: Stage 1 sees the development of the Casparian strips in the cell wall between the exodermis and the endodermis. Stage 2 includes the deposition of suberin and other hydrophobic polymers and cell membranes of individual exodermal cells. It also serves in forming the connection between the plasmodesma and the Casparian strip. Stage 3 includes the addition of cellulose and lignin with occasional deposition of suberin into the cell walls to strengthen them. Since suberin and the Casparian band are responsible for inhibiting nutrient and fluid uptake, it forces it across the exodermis and endodermis and into the root cortex. Exodermal cells can be found very close to the tip of the root, with some plants demonstrating exodermal cells as close to 30 mm from the tip.  Passage cells  A passage cell is short cells that form a thin layer along the long axis of the plant exodermis. These cells are an structural feature in the exodermis as they allow the uptake of ions Calcium and Magnesium, hence why they are commonly associated with exodermal cells. Their role does not correspond to any particular tissue meaning that they are found in all areas of the exodermis as they are needed. They are found frequently in herbaceous and woody species and are found to be more common in areas of lower rainfall, as the development of these cells decreases the amount of water lost through the radius of the plant. Although they do contain Casparian strips, the following development and maturation of suberin lamellae and thicker cellulose walls do not progress. Passage cells are partially responsible for growth and development. As the plant ages and growth slows, the number of passage cells begin to decrease, resulting in a complete lack of passage cells altogether. In response to dehydration, some passage cells, particularly those located in aquatic environments, have developed pads that are composed of lignin and cellulose and are designed to close the cells to prevent further loss of ions and water to the environment via diffusionHeilmeier H, Hartung W (2014-06-06). The aquatic resurrection plant Chamaegigas intrepidus-adaptation to multiple abiotic stresses and habitat isolation. Botanica Serbica. 38. 69-80.  Changes in response to external stimuli  Being involved in water uptake and regulation of solutes into and out of the membrane, the exodermal cells must adapt to their external environment to ensure that the plant can survive. Because there are so many individual species of plant, each with different environmental conditions and with different nutrient requirements, it is the variability of this membrane that provides the option to ensure appropriate nutrient levels are reached. Exodermal cells can modify their Casparian strips to fit changing stimuli. Exodermal barriers can change their permeability as necessary to ensure that adequate nutrients are reaching the plant. In microenvironments, where macronutrient levels are low (such as phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium) development in the exodermis, Casparian strips and the suberin lamellae.In areas with high-stress conditions such as heavy metal concentration, high salt concentration and other inorganic compounds, the exodermal cells are wider and shorter, ensuring that these toxic components cannot enter the root complex and cause damage to the system.

ISSN 0032-0935. Categories Plants are found all over the world in a variety of different environmental conditions, each with their challenges in survival. There have been many investigations conducted into the specific nature of these cells for specific plants each with their specializations. In environments with low water supply, such as in drought or desert conditions, the deposit of tertiary layers in the plant's exodermis can be found up far higher in the apex of the root system. In areas with a high water environment, such as wetlands and in areas that are predominantly anaerobic or hypoxic, plants' exodermis layers were found to develop patchy exodermal layers to aid the diffusion of oxygen into the root system more effectively.Enstone DE, Peterson CA (2005-04-05). \\"Suberin lamella development in maize seedling roots grown in aerated and stagnant conditions\\". Plant, Cell and Environment. 28 (4): 444‚Äì455. doi:10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01286.x. ISSN 0140-7791. As the plant begins to age and mature the level of suberisation in the plant cells will increase, causing a decrease in the total amount of water that can enter the plant root complex. It will also cause an increase in the selectivity of the ions that are able to cross the barrier and be absorbed, slowly becoming more susceptible to large osmotic changes. The apoplastic nature of the exodermis means that selectivity should decrease with age not increase, however evidence and conflicting results between studies suggest otherwise and warrants further investigation.

Lignin is a biopolymer that has been found to develop naturally in the Casparian strip to strengthen and thicken the cell wall of the plants. As the root begins to encounter higher soil density and conditions where the soil has higher water content, the root cortex and surrounding structures begin to thicken. In areas where there is less soil, (from high wind areas or poor soil quality) exodermal growth is severely hindered.

San Mateo Creek then carries its waters over Crystal Springs Dam northeast to San Francisco Bay. History After discovering San Francisco Bay from Sweeney Ridge on November 4, 1769, the Portol√† expedition descended on what Portol√† called the Ca√±ada de San Francisco, now known as San Andreas Creek, to its confluence with San Mateo Creek. Just downstream from here was Laguna Creek's confluence with San Mateo Creek. Crossing San Mateo Creek just above its canyon, Portola's party proceeded south along Laguna Creek and camped on a lake which Portol√† called Laguna Grande, now covered by Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir. The campsite is marked by California Historical Marker No. 94, \\"Portola Expedition Camp\\", located at Crystal Springs Dam, on Skyline Boulevard, 0.1 mi south of Crystal Springs Road. Then Portola continued south and descended from the foothills along San Francisquito Creek to established his base camp at El Palo Alto, in modern-day Palo Alto, California. The Laguna Creek and Laguna Grande place names are shown on the 1856 plat maps/dise√±os of Rancho de las Pulgas and Rancho Ca√±ada de Raymundo and Easton's 1868 map of San Mateo County. Raimundo, a native of Baja California, was sent out by the padres of Mission Santa Clara to capture runaway Mission Indians in 1797. On August 4, 1840, he was granted the Rancho Ca√±ada de Raymundo and on the 1856 Rancho Pulgas and 1868 Easton maps, the valley of Laguna Creek was referred to as the Ca√±ada de Raymundo and Laguna Grande became alternatively known as Lake Raymundo. Laguna Creek was also alternatively known as Ca√±ada Raimundo Creek. The two Crystal Springs lakes and San Andreas Lake used to be known as Spring Valley Lakes for the Spring Valley Water Company which owned them. The Spring Valley Water Company named the lakes, the Spring Valley Lakes, after the company. The original Spring Valley was between Mason and Taylor Streets, and Washington and Broadway Streets in San Francisco, where the water company started. When the company went south for more water, the Spring Valley name was carried south too. Laguna Grande was submerged when the Spring Valley Water Company built an earthen dam in 1877 (this was the first Crystal Springs Dam), forming Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir. The old earthen dam became a causeway between Upper and Lower Crystal Springs Reservoirs when the latter was formed by Herman Schussler's concrete Crystal Springs Dam, which dammed up San Mateo Creek to form the lower reservoir in 1888. The causeway is now crossed by Highway 92. Filoli, the estate of Spring Valley Water Company tycoon William Bourn, is now an historic site. The staff there currently refers to Laguna Creek as \\"Orchard Creek\\", and its tributaries on the historic estate as Fault Creek and Spring Creek. Watershed Just above and below Canada Road, at Edgewood Road, two small reservoirs were built on Laguna Creek, apparently to store water for fighting wildfires. View is north by northeast, with Ca√±ada Road in background. The official source of the Laguna Creek mainstem is in Edgewood County Park on the Serpentine Trail, along which it gently descends westerly until being forced into a culvert near the Interstate-280 underpass for the Edgewood Trail. It emerges on the west side of I-280 and continues west until it crosses Edgewood Road just north of Ca√±ada Road. It is confined in a small reservoir northeast of Ca√±ada Road, then passes beneath into another small reservoir west of Ca√±ada Road, after which it joins the south fork of Laguna Creek. The south fork of Laguna Creek originates near the Sunset (Sunset Way) Trailhead, and descends in a small canyon along the Clarkia Trail until it reaches an earthen berm protecting the PG&E; substation. After two right angle turns around the substation it passes into a culvert under I-280, emerging southwest of the I-280 overpass over Ca√±ada Road. From here the south fork flows northwest along the west side of Ca√±ada Road, passing Homestead Pond, then after crossing Phleger and Old Ca√±ada Roads, it is joined by West Fork Laguna Creek (a short creek that flows down along Old Ca√±ada Road). After that the south fork joins the Laguna Creek mainstem northwest of the intersection of Edgewood Road and Ca√±ada Road. From here Laguna Creek is joined on the left (heading downstream) on the Filoli property by locally named Fault Creek, then Spring Creek, then on the right by the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct and Pulgas Water Temple just before entering Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir. Laguna Creek used to be 1.8 miles longer, or total, before its confluence with San Mateo Creek was submerged by the Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir in 1888. Adobe Gulch is the northernmost of several tributaries (and the only one named by the USGS) that descend the eastern flank of the Santa Cruz Mountains to Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir (and historically, Laguna Creek). Ecology Coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) on Laguna Creek tower over the oaks (just below Filoli's lower parking lot on main entrance road). San Mateo County historian Frank Stanger cited sizeable groves of redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) in the Laguna Creek watershed. In the area around Filoli he described two historic lumber mills. The historic \\"Smith Mill\\" on Fault Creek was destroyed by fire in 1854. Pinckney's mill in \\"the largest gulch\\", which would be Spring Creek, was built in 1855 and later purchased by S. L. Mastic. Although information on these mills is limited, they support the idea that \\"the area was thoroughly logged\\". A large redwood tree remains on Laguna Creek between the lower Filoli parking lot and main entrance gate. Fog drip may play a key role in the precipitation in the upper watershed. On Cahill Ridge (just west of San Mateo Creek and east of Pilarcitos Creek, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, Oberlander measured fog drip beneath tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter 125 feet tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most precipitation and in five weeks of measurement (July 20-August 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced 59 inches of precipitation, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced 7-17 inches of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids giant helleborine (Epipactis gigantea) and phantom orchid (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops. Both the Laguna Creek mainstem and south fork Laguna Creek originate northeast of I-280 in the Edgewood County Park and Nature Preserve, where the Friends of Edgewood Natural Preserve work to preserve the unique serpentine native grasslands, habitat which is critical to the threatened Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis). Along the Crystal Springs Trail, just southwest of Ca√±ada Road and its I-280 overpass, is the Homestead Pond. This 12 acre pond and marsh is host to Western pond turtles (Actinemys marmorata) and is adjacent to the south fork of Laguna Creek. The pond is the site of a restoration effort by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission which will include removal of non-native eucalyptus trees and planting of native oaks and grasses. Although Laguna Creek generally runs dry in summer, on October 17, 2012, two-year-old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were observed in cold, spring-fed perennial pools along the Filoli property. This finding is notable considering that it was the very end of the dry season in a low rainfall year [63% of normal (182 mm of normal 492 mm in San Francisco)].

The central section of Huaihai Road is one of the two major shopping streets in central Shanghai; the other is Nanjing Road. Compared with the more touristy Nanjing Road, Huaihai Road is more upscale, and is the preferred destination of local residents. Huaihai Road comprises three sections, the main section being Middle Huaihai Road in the former French Concession of Shanghai. Middle Huaihai Road is also well known by its former French name Avenue Joffre (). Huaihai Road East was in the original French Concession and was formerly known as Rue Ningpo (ÂØßÊ≥¢Ë∑Ø), while Huaihai Road West was an extra-settlement road built by the Shanghai International Settlement and formerly known as Jordan Road (Âñ¨Êï¶Ë∑Ø) Location Today's Huaihai Road comprises three sections, which were formerly three distinct streets. West Huaihai Road, formerly called Jordan Road, is long and forms part of the boundary between Changning District and Xuhui District. East Huaihai Road, formerly Ningbo Road, is long and was the boundary road between Huangpu and Nanshi districts before the two districts merged. Middle Huaihai Road, the main section, is long. Most of this section lies in the former Luwan District (which was also merged into Huangpu in 2010), and extends west into Xuhui and Changning districts. History Intersection of Avenue Joffre with Rue Cardinal Mercier in the 1930s, with Cathay Theatre on the left. =Middle Huaihai Road= Middle Huaihai Road was built in 1901 as Rue Sikiang (), after the Xi River. The eastern portion of the road east of Chungking Road (now Chongqing Road) was built first in the expanded French Concession, while the western portion was an extra-settlement road built as an extension to the initial Rue Sikiang. Five years later it was renamed Route Paul Brunat (). In 1914 a further expansion of the French Concession took in the remainder of the road. It was renamed again in 1915 to Avenue Joffre to honor the French general Joseph Joffre, who visited Shanghai and attended an official renaming ceremony in 1922. The eastern portion of the road had a large concentration of shikumen residences, while the western portion was, by the 1920s, mostly lined with large houses and modern mansion blocks. In the 1920s Avenue Joffre became an enclave of a large community of Russians fleeing the Communist revolution in their homeland, which led to the middle section of the street becoming a commercial centre, lined with European-style shops, cafes and restaurants. The Japanese occupied Shanghai during World War II, taking over the foreign concessions in 1941. In 1943 Avenue Joffre was renamed Taishan Road () after Mount Taishan. The name only lasted two years, and after Japan was defeated the Kuomintang government renamed the street Lingsen Road in honor of Lin Sen (Ling Sen), the former President of the Republic of China who had died in 1943. However, the Communists in turn defeated the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, and took over Shanghai in 1949. A year later the Communist government gave the street the current name, to commemorate its victorious Huaihai Campaign. =East Huaihai Road= The relatively short East Huaihai Road was built between 1874 and 1898 as Rue Ningpo. The road ran immediately north of the moat to the north of the city wall of the Shanghai Old City. The road name comes from the fact that the road runs through land that was previously the property of the Siming Gongsuo, the fraternal association of residents with family origin in Ningbo, who established premises and a graveyard at this location in 1797. This area was granted to the French as part of the original French Concession in 1862, and the French authorities' attempt to resume land and relocate graves to build the road led to violent confrontations in 1874 and 1898. As part of the terms settling the dispute, the road was named after the association's home city.Goodman, B, \\"The Locality as Microcosm of the Nation?: Native Place Networks and Early Urban Nationalism in China\\", Modern China Vol. 21, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 387-419 Rue Ningpo was renamed \\"East Huaihai Road\\" in 1950, thus avoiding the duplication of name with \\"Ningpo Road\\" in the former International Settlement. =West Huaihai Road= West Huahai Road was built as Jordan Road, an extra-settlement road, by the Shanghai Municipal Council (the governing authority of the Shanghai International Settlement). The road was mostly lined with high-end apartment buildings and large houses owned by Chinese and foreign elites. In the 1930s it was renamed Rockhill Avenue (), then West Huaihai Road in 1950. Shopping The same intersection (now of Middle Huaihai Road and South Maoming Road) in 2007 The long Middle Huaihai Road has a large number of shops lining its route, from small boutiques to major department stores and shopping malls, as well as hotels and restaurants. Major buildings include IAPM Mall, Lippo Plaza, Shui On Plaza, Central Plaza, Shanghai Square, Shanghai Times Square, Hong Kong Plaza, and K11, most hosting shopping malls or department stores on the lower floors with offices on top. The eastern section of Middle Huaihai Road near the popular Xintiandi precinct has recently seen an influx of a large number of Western luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Rolex, Coach, Inc., Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A., Balenciaga, Dior, Burberry, Moschino, Valentino SpA, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Miu Miu, Marks & Spencer, UGG, Tiffany & Co., Cartier, Gucci, Prada, Victoria's Secret, Herm√®s, Vivienne Westwood, Giorgio Armani SpA, Chanel and Ermenegildo Zegna. Many of the stores were opened in 2010 to coincide with the Shanghai Expo. Transportation A section of Line 1 of the Shanghai Metro runs underneath Middle Huaihai Road with three stations: Changshu Road (interchange with Line 7), South Shaanxi Road (interchange with Lines 10 and 12), and South Huangpi Road, all named after streets that intersect with Huaihai Road. The area is also served by Middle Huaihai Road Station on Line 13 while the western parts of the road are served by Shanghai Library Station (Line 10), Jiaotong University Station (Line 10 and 11) and Hongqiao Road Station (Line 3, 4 and 10).

The word Epirus means infinite Earth. The Greeks saw Eprius as a wilderness filled with barbarians (\\"Athens Greece Guide\\"). The ruins are located in Dramisos, near Tsacharovista (Ewegen). The name of the oracle is derived from Dodone, which is an oceanic nymph (Nicol, page 128). Dodone gets its name, according to commentaries originally by Epaphroditos, from Dodona, one of the Nymphai Okeanides.Callimachus, Aitia Fragment 2.7 (from Stephanus Byzantius s.v. Dodone). It was created to honor the Greek God Zeus. At Dodona, Zeus was known as ‚ÄúZeus Bouleus‚Äù. Which means Zeus the Counselor and ‚ÄúZeus Naios‚Äù (also spelt as ‚ÄúNaos‚Äù). The translation of Naios means the god of spring. This was fitting because there was a spring located near the oracle. In addition, there was a sacred tree outside the temple, which was used by the priests. The priests, called Selloi, were known for sleeping on the ground and not washing their feet (Sacks, et al.). They interpreted the rustling of the leaves as divine messages from Zeus (Nicol, page 128). The priests would interpret the rustling leaves for a certain cost, and the outcome of this prediction improved with an increased fare (Ewegen). In Greek inscriptions found on the site, they mention Dione as well as Zeus Naios. Dione has been mentioned in several texts with regards to the oracle at Dodona. Dione as a name is the feminine form of Zeus (\\"DIONE.\\"). In most texts Zeus‚Äô wife is identified as the goddess Hera, however Dione has been mentioned as the mother of Zeus‚Äô daughter Aphrodite. In other cases Dione is solely mention as the daughter of Oceanus, and some writers have said she is the mother of Dionysus (\\"Dione\\"). Therefore, it is thought that Dodona was built for both Dione as well as Zeus (Kristensen, William Brede, 1960).Kristensen, William Brede, The Meaning of Religion: Lectures in the Phenomenology of Religion. (1960) The Hague, The Netherlands: M. Nijhoff. Furthermore, Dodona served as both a political center as well as a religious sanctuary, although it was second to the oracles of Apollo in Delphi.*Ewegen. \\"Can Owens afford a Pyrrhic victory?.\\" Denver Post, 21 July 1997, 2nd edition B-09. Web. Accessed 4 Apr. 2013. Alongside Zeus, Titan Dione was worshiped at Dodona. In some older stories Diona, not Hera, is the mother of Aphrodite. Diona‚Äôs name is the feminine version of Zeus (Dios). She had three priestess at her shrine known as the Peleiades or Doves. The name came from Diona‚Äôs daughter Aphrodite who had a sacred dove. The Peleiades had the ability to read prophesy:Strabo, Geography 7, Fragments 1a. > Perhaps there was something exceptional about the flight of the three > pigeons from which the priestesses [of Dione at Dodona] were wont to make > observations and to prophesy.

The earliest mention of Dodona in Greek literature was in Homer's lliad, which describes the priests (Selloi) as having unwashed feet who slept on the ground.

Plato‚Äôs Phaedrus also mentions the oracle at Dodona (Jowett) as it says: > That the words of the oak in the holy place of Zeus at Dodona were the first > prophetic utterances (Nicol, page 143).

A fragment of Hediodic literature describes Dodona as a district of ‚Äúcorn fields, herds and flocks of shepherds‚Ä¶ where Zeus dwells in the stem of an oak‚Äù. Herodotus notes he learned through a local legend that an Egyptian priestess who had been taken away by the Phoenicians founded the oracles. Therefore, the priestesses of the oracle are often referred to as doves to represent the Egyptian lost priestess (\\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 8, Slice 5 \\"Dinard\\" to \\"Dodsworth\\" \\" 372). According to Strabo the oak tree is thought to be the first plant created that could provide a food supply. Strabo notes that the same geographer believes that the doves ‚Äúare observed for the purposes of augury, just as there were some seers who divined from ravens.\\"Strabo, Geography 7, Fragments 1c. A legend regarding Dodona depicts the ship sailed by Jason and the Argonauts (the Argo) had the ‚Äúgift of prophecy‚Äù because it had a piece of the sacred oak from Dodona (\\"Ancient/ Classical History\\") Sent to fetch the fleece, Jason called in the help of Argus, son of Phrixus; and Argus, by Athena's advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona. When the ship was built, and he inquired of the oracle, the god gave him leave to assemble the nobles of Greece and sail away. (Rhod) Dodona rapidly expanded, early in the 4th century BCE: a temple was built to worship Zeus; and King Pyrrhus developed festivals and games to be held every four years during the 3rd century.

They are filter feeders, extending a plume-like fan of radioles from the end of the tube in order to catch plankton and detritus floating past.

It is the second most important station in the city after Remscheid Hauptbahnhof. The station is located west of the old centre of Lennep and is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. History  On 1 September 1868, the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company () opened the first section of the Rittershausen‚ÄìOpladen line from Oberbarmen (then called Rittershausen) to Lennep. A committee of dignitaries from Barmen and the district of Lennep was established in 1844 to promote a rail link between the district of Lennep‚Äîwhich was a significant centre of industry (including the production of iron and steel goods and cloth)‚Äîand Cologne. A Barmen‚ÄìLennep‚ÄìCologne line was initially planned passing through the Dh√ºnn valley. Then in June 1858, the Lennep Chamber of Commerce asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Public Works in Berlin for a branch line from Rittershausen (now called Wuppertal-Oberbarmen) via Lennep to Remscheid, which was approved and opened in 1868, although there continued to be calls for an extension to Cologne. A new line was opened on 12 May 1876 to Wermelskirchen, rather than running through the Dh√ºnn valley; this was extended to Opladen via Burscheid on 1 October 1881. Lennep was soon connected by the branch line to Remscheid (now considered to be part of the Wuppertal-Oberbarmen‚ÄìSolingen railway), by a link to Krebsoge station on the Wupper Valley Railway (opened on 1 March 1886) and indirectly to the Wipper Valley Railway at Bergisch Born via the line to Wermelskirchen opened in 1876, giving it more rail connections than its neighbouring cities so that it soon became a hub for rail transport in the Bergisches Land. The station had its own locomotive depot from 1893 to 1960. In 1929 the town of Lennep was incorporated into Remscheid. However, it took until 18 May 1952 before the station was renamed from Lennep to Remscheid-Lennep station. It had always been more important than Remscheid Hauptbahnhof. This changed, however, with the closure of the Wupper Valley Railway in 1956 and passenger services on the Wipper Valley Railway in 1986. Finally in 1995 freight traffic was abandoned between Remscheid-Lennep and Wipperfurth on the remaining part of the Wipper Valley Railway. Rebuilding  The station was rebuilt from early 2009 until June 2010. As a result, the station now has two side platforms, which are connected by an underpass. In addition, the old station building was restored and tracks that were no longer needed were dismantled. Rail services The station is served by line S 7 of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn, branded as Der M√ºngstener, operated every 20 minutes from Monday to Friday and generally every half hour on weekends and at off- peak times, using (LINT 41) vehicles. It is served by bus route 240, operated by Wiedenhoff at 60-minute intervals and by bus route 336, operated by Oberbergische Verkehrs-AG at 60-minute intervals. It is served by six bus routes operated by Stadtwerke Remscheid, 654 (20 minute intervals), 655 (20), 659 (20), 664 (20/40) and 671 (30-60).

Overview This road is an important transport corridor for traffic destined to and from Tanzania and that to and from the interior of Kenya and beyond. This will ease traffic pressure on the Likoni Ferry. The bypass will decongest Mombasa Island. Four bridges will be built in the swamps and across the open ocean water, as part of the highway. Other road improvements in addition to the highway include a dual carriageway between Miritini and Kipevu, a road measuring connecting Moi International Airport to the bypass which passes west of the airport and clover-leaf interchanges at Miritini and Kipevu. A free trade zone, the Dongo Kundu Free Trade Zone, with 6,200 sites and ability to accommodate more than 10,000 business units is part of the planned development. Kenya National Highway Authority is the developer of the project. Funding The construction contract was awarded to China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation. The three phase project is budgeted at KSh25 billion (approx. US$251 million). The first phase of construction was the Miritini to Kipevu section, budgeted at KSh11 billion (approx. US$110.31 million), borrowed from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. *Note: US$1.00 = KSh99.72 on 2 April 2016 Construction The first phase of this three-phase project was completed and commissioned in June 2018.

He was then elevated to the British House of Lords as one of Harley's Dozen.  Life  Windsor was the second son of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth, by his second wife Ursula Widdrington, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Thomas Widdrington, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and Frances Fairfax. He was made a Page of Honour to James II in 1685 (a post he held until the king was deposed in 1688) and a few months later was returned to Parliament for Droitwich, despite being only around sixteen at the time. Lord Willoughby de Eresby wanted both him and Peter Legh expelled as minors. Windsor took no part in the proceedings of Parliament and was not re-elected in 1687. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 Windsor had served as a cornet in Lord Plymouth's Horse under his father. He continued to serve in the Army as a captain in Sir John Fenwick's Regiment in 1687, as a lieutenant-colonel in Viscount Colchester's Regiment between 1690 and 1694, as a colonel of horse between 1694 and 1697, 1702 and 1707 and 1711 and 1712 and of the 3rd Dragoon Guards between 1712 and 1717. He was promoted to brigadier in 1702, to major-general in 1704 and to lieutenant- general in 1710. In 1692 he was appointed Groom of the Bedchamber in King William's private household, serving until the King's death in 1702. In 1699 he was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Viscount Windsor, of Blackcastle. This being an Irish peerage he was still eligible for election to the English House of Commons, and in 1705 he was once again returned to Parliament for Bramber, a seat he held until 1708. Between 1708 and 1712 he represented Monmouthshire. The latter year he was created an English peer as Baron Mountjoy, in the Isle of Wight, as one of twelve peers created to secure a Tory majority in the House of Lords. Lord Windsor married Lady Charlotte Herbert, only daughter of Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke, and Henriette de K√©roualle (sister of Louise de K√©roualle, the principal mistress to King Charles II of England), and widow of John Jeffreys, 2nd Baron Jeffreys, in 1703. In 1709, they brought a petition to the House of Lords (which adjudicated on matters of noble titles and estates) seeking permission to sell the Jeffreys estates in order to pay their debts. They had one son and at least four daughters. She died in November 1733. Lord Windsor died in June 1738 and was succeeded in his titles by his son, Herbert. He inherited the Lower Avon Navigation from his father, who had acquired the rights to it from the future King James II of England.

On March 24, 2012, The Loneliest Planet was awarded the top prize of \\"Lady Harimaguada de Oro\\" (The Golden Lady) at the Las Palmas de Gran Canaria International Film Festival, where actress Hani Furstenberg also won for Best Actress. On April 14, 2012 the film also won the Golden Tulip International Competition award at the 31st International Istanbul Film Festival. On October 11, 2011, it was announced that Sundance Selects, a division of IFC Films, had acquired North American distribution rights. The film's theatrical release in the United States was on October 26, 2012. The film is adapted from McSweeney's writer Tom Bissell's short story \\"Expensive Trips Nowhere,\\" published in his collection God Lives in St. Petersburg. Plot Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Nica (Hani Furstenberg) are in love and engaged to be married. They are seasoned travelers on a trip in the country of Georgia, formerly a republic of the Soviet Union. They hire a local guide (Bidzina Gujabidze) to take them backpacking through the breathtaking scenery of the Caucasus Mountains. While on their journey, they meet an older man with two boys on their route; he is suspicious of the two foreigners. After a short conversation with their guide, the older man suddenly aims a hunting rifle aggressively at Alex and Nica at point-blank range. For a moment, Alex's reaction is to shield himself behind Nica. He immediately regains his composure, and pushes himself in front of Nica to face the stranger's gun, while their guide in turn persuades the stranger to lower his gun and go on his way. A seemingly traumatized Nica walks away on her own. A few scenes show the couple not speaking or walking together while on their journey to the mountains, although Alex repeatedly attempts to reconnect with Nica. At one point, they cross a stream where Nica accidentally falls only to be saved by the local guide. Alex tries to offer a shivering Nica some help but she rebuffs him. At night, the local guide tells Nica the story of his failed marriage, and they kiss. Soon after, Nica returns to Alex and the couple have sex. At dawn, the trio start packing up their camps, and it remains ambiguous as to whether or not the couple have finally reconciled.

It was built between 1844 and 1848, and is a three-story, dressed stone building in the Greek Revival style. The front facade is five bays wide and features six fluted Ionic order columns. The building houses the Blair County Historical Society. Note: This includes Baker Mansion was originally home to ironmaster Elias Baker and his family. Baker purchased the nearby Alleghany Furnace in 1836 in partnership with his cousin Roland Diller. Elias brought his wife, Hetty, and their two sons, David Woods and Sylvester, from Lancaster County to what was described as a \\"tolerable good mansion house\\" near the furnace. Shortly after they arrived, a daughter, Anna, was born. A fourth child, Margaretta, was born in 1839, but she died of diphtheria at the age of two. In 1844, Elias Baker bought out his cousin's share in the furnace. That same year, he contracted with Baltimore architect Robert Cary Long, Jr. to design him a new home. Work got underway on the mansion in 1845 but many problems and delays retarded its completion until 1849. The total cost was about $15,000. The cost overruns, coupled with falling prices for iron, pushed Mr. Baker to the brink of financial ruin before the home was finished. Still, Baker, ever the determined businessman, pressed ahead and achieved his dream house. He would enjoy it for fifteen years until his death in 1864. Hetty Baker remained a widow until her death in 1900. David Woods Baker married Sarah Tuthill in 1851 and they had one daughter, Louise, in 1852. However, Woods was killed in a steamboat boiler explosion just two and a half weeks after the birth of his daughter. Louise later married Ernst Beckman and returned with him to live in his native Sweden. Sylvester and Anna both remained single and lived in the mansion until their deaths. After Anna died in 1914, the mansion was closed until 1922, when the Blair County Historical Society leased the building and opened it as a museum. With the community's support for a major fundraising campaign, the society was able to purchase the house in 1941. Since then, the mansion has served as the Society's headquarters and has become a beloved community landmark. In 2001, the Society completed an exterior rehabilitation, returning the building to its original appearance. Work has begun on interior rehabilitation. The project is financed in part from a state Redevelopment Assistance Capital grant and from local matching funds the Society is working to raise. In February 2015, Joseph DeFrancesco was named Executive Director of the Blair County Historical Society. In July of that year, the BCHS received an award from the Central Pennsylvania Community Foundation for Technology. In August 2015, the double parlor was restored back to original condition.

He named at least 18 plants new to science ‚Äî some in that family and some not ‚Äî and published many papers elucidating relationships within the Crassulaceae. As a mark of the respect he earned among his peers, more than a dozen plants have been named for him.

After service as a navigator in the Army Air Corps from 1942 to 1946, Moran received his Ph.D. in Botany from the University of California, Berkeley in 1951. His doctoral dissertation was titled \\"A Revision of Dudleya (Crassulaceae).\\" Moran conducted a botanical survey of the Channel Islands for the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History and performed taxonomic work for the Santa Barbara Botanical Garden and the Bailey Hortorium at Cornell University before joining the San Diego Museum of Natural History as curator of botany, succeeding Ethel Bailey Higgins in 1957. Moran specialized in the systematics of the Crassulaceae (the stonecrop family), and in the floristics of the Baja California peninsula. In addition to a large number of technical research papers, Moran published The Flora of Guadalupe Island and the treatment of the Crassulaceae for the Flora of North America (Vol. 8, published in 2009).

She has lent her voice mainly for Malayalam and Tamil film songs for over 300 films. Some of her hit songs of that time are ‚ÄòKathodu Kathoram‚Ä¶' and ‚ÄòDevadoothar Padi‚Ä¶'(Kathodu Kathoram),‚Äòpoo venam pooppada venam‚Ä¶' (Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam), and ‚ÄòTharum Thalirum‚Ä¶' (Chilambu). Career Lathika debuted at the age of 16 with the scene \\"Pushpathalpathin..\\" composed by Kannur Rajan for I. V. Sasi's ‚ÄòAbhinandam' (1976). She sang the duet with K. J. Yesudas, who, she says, has always been her mentor. Over the years Lathika also has had the \\"good fortune\\" to sing in the debut films of some of the most famous composers in Malayalam including Ravindran Master (‚ÄòChoola'), Ouseppachan (‚ÄòKathodu Kathoram') and S.P. Venkatesh (‚ÄòRajavinte Makan'). Although Lathika, had earlier sung playback for a number of songs and was a star on the ganamela circuit in and around Kollam and Tamil Nadu, it wasn't until she was introduced to Bharathan that she began to be noticed in the music industry. It was music director Raveendran, who introduced her to film director Bharathan. She sang the song ‚ÄòVarnangal Gandhangal...' in his ‚ÄòChamaram' (1980), for which Raveendran Master composed this one song [the others were composed by M. G. Radhakrishnan. Then her turn came for the music production of ‚ÄòIthiri Poove Chuvanna Poove' (1984) when they needed a female artist to hum a pallavi. In those days S. Janaki was the reigning melody queen and such a senior artist couldn't be brought in only to hum a few lines. That's when Raveendran suggested her name. She was called for an audition and Bharathan liked her voice so much that he gave her the song ‚ÄòPon Pularoli‚Ä¶' to sing. From that time onwards, Bharathan ensured that Lathika got to sing in almost all his films, such as ‚ÄòDum Dum Dum Dhundhubinatham‚Ä¶' (Vaishali) and ‚ÄòHridayaraga‚Ä¶' (Amaram), to name a few. Her last song for him was ‚ÄòOthiri Othiri Mohangal‚Ä¶' in Vengalam. Nilaavinte poomgavil.......... from the movie 'sreekrishna parunthu' is one of her most popular song. Her other notable songs include 'poovulla meda kaanan....' from the film 'Pandu pandoru rajakumari' along with G. venugopal, 'aathma sugandham' from the movie 'bhadrachitta' etc. Throughout her career, Lathika has had several songs credited to other singers ,especially K.S.Chitra, by popular media and persons. This has been attributed to slight similarities between her songs and Chithra's. The singer has always been uncomplaining about the matter.

One example of the type was converted for use in the Dole Air Derby endurance race of 1927. Development The Catron & Fisk Airplane and Engine Co was founded in 1917, developing several aircraft in series including the CF-10, a 22-passenger airliner. The company was reorganized as International, accounting for the aircraft's dual identity as the International CF-10. The 'Spirit of Los Angeles' modified the CF-10 with long range fuel tanks and update Wright Whirlwind engines to compete in the Dole Air Derby. Design The CF-10 was a large twin engined triplane originally powered with Curtiss OX-5 engines. The aircraft featured a conventional landing gear arrangement, with paired main wheels. The twin engines were mounted to either side of the fuselage between the middle and lower wings. The middle wing did not have a full span, each wing only protruded from the engine nacelles outboard, leaving a gap next to the fuselage for visibility. The fuselage was octagonal in shape with a large windowed cabin, and a two-seat open cockpit placed high to the rear of the aircraft. One example, later known as the Pride of Los Angeles, was painted bright orange. Operational history In 1927, actor Hoot Gibson, and five other California businessman sponsored The Pride of Los Angeles, a modified version of the International CF-10, for an attempt at winning the Dole Air Derby. Gibson had his name painted on the nose, and face painted on the sides for publicity. On 12 August 1927 before the air race, pilot James L. Giffin, navigator Ted Lundgren, and passenger Lawrence Wiell left Los Angeles and crashed into the San Francisco Bay nose first 300 feet shy of its destination Bay Farm Island airport after veering to avoid another plane. All occupants were thrown from the aircraft and made it to land safely. The sponsor, Gibson was furious.

The members of Els Catarres are √àric Verg√©s and Jan Riera Prats from Aiguafreda and Roser Cruells from Centelles. The band is famous for the song Jenifer who came a hit in the summer of 2011 in Catalan Countries. The band formed towards the end of 2010, starting with small gigs in bars and at la Fira d'Artesania d'Aiguafreda. Their first E.P was later released, though only available online. Thanks to their most famous song \\"Jenifer\\", a song about a prohibited love between a patriotic Catalan man and a \\"xoni\\" from Castefa, they rose to fame in 2011. The word xoni is a slang term which in this context refers to young people in Catalunya who are culturally Castilian; it could be said that a xoni is the exact opposite of a patriotic Catalan. By June 2011 the music video for \\"Jenifer\\" had received 200,000 views and by mid-September it reached 800,000. By the beginning of October it had reached over a million views and many covers were created of the song. By the summer of 2011, they had over 100 concerts planned around Catalunya. The band only released their music on CD, under the condition that it continued to be available online for free. On 29 November 2011 their first album was released for general sale, Can√ßons 2011, consisting of 13 songs, four of which completely unedited. Under the company Discmedi Blau, the album was released in shops, though also available for free online. The first unedited song to be released was \\"Me'n vaig al camp\\", a parody of a \\"modernet\\" from Barcelona that decides to go and live in the countryside. The disc sold over 5,000 copies. In March 2012 Els Catarres were awarded the \\"Enderrock 2012\\" prize for best lyrics, for the song \\"Jenifer\\".

The source of the quote was traced by the computer scientist Brendan McKay to an October 11, 1947 article in the Egyptian newspaper Akhbar al-Yom, titled \\"A War of Extermination\\", which included the quote, with the added words \\"Personally, I hope the Jews do not force us into this war, because it would be a war of extermination and momentous massacre ...\\". The historian Efraim Karsh considers this quote a \\"genocidal threat\\". The Israeli historian Tom Segev has disputed Karsh's interpretation, saying that \\"Azzam used to talk a lot\\" and pointing to another statement from May 21, 1948, in which Azzam Pasha declared his desire for \\"equal citizenship for Jews in Arab Palestine\\".  The quotation in historical context  The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine was set up in May 1947 to develop proposals for the partition of Palestine. Recommendations to this effect were made in September of that year. The majority plan proposed a distinct two- state solution, the minority plan foresaw a federal state. Though the Jews had accepted the majority plan, the Arab countries were unanimous in their negative reactions to both plans, and openly spoke of taking up arms were either of these proposals enacted.Ronald J. Berger,The Holocaust, Religion, and the Politics of Collective Memory: Beyond Sociology, Transaction Publishers, 2012 p. 176.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, Fayard, Paris 2002, vol.2 p.593. For Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary, the majority plan would only lead to an outbreak of generalised violence, as clearly unjust to the Arabs, whilst the minority plan was inapplicable since it assumed a prior accord between Jews and Arabs.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, p.594 On September 15,Howard Morley Sachar,Europe leaves the Middle East, 1936‚Äì1954, Knopf, 1972 p.494, gives October the 14th. This date however is not that given by Abba Eban himself. See A. S. Eban, 'Note of Conversation with Abdel Rahman Azzam Pasha,' London, Sept. 15, 1947,' in Neil Caplan, Futile Diplomacy, Frank Cass, 1986, Vol. 2, pp. 274‚Äì76; Laurens, Question de Palestine, vol. 2 p. 680 n. 103 for additional bibliography. Azzam Pasha, who was held in high esteem by David Ben-Gurion, met a Zionist delegation in London, consisting of Abba Eban, David Horowitz, both liaison officers with the Jewish Agency who were accompanied by the journalist Jon Kimche. The emissaries stated that there was no doubt that a Jewish state would be established and requested that the Arab states accept the consequences and cooperate. They were willing to give cast-iron guarantees against any form of Jewish expansionism.Howard Morley Sachar, A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time, Knopf, May 15, 2007 pp. 285, 333. Azzam Pasha, in his capacity as Secretary General of the Arab League, suggested that the Zionist project be abandoned, and that the Jews could integrate themselves into Arab society on the basis of autonomous entities. He argued that it was pointless to appeal to political realism when the whole Zionist project demonstrated the efficacy of will-power. There was no option but war. The Zionists, he argued, would be thrown out in the future, just as the Crusaders had been. His Zionist interlocutors read this statement as a fascist declaration, unable, according to Henry Laurens, to see that, as with the Jews of Europe, emancipation from enslavement for the Arabs was seen as requiring recourse to force.Laurens, La Question, p. 593. In Horowitz's account, Azzam declared, > \\"We shall try to defeat you. I am not sure we'll succeed, but we'll try. We > were able to drive out the Crusaders, but on the other hand we lost Spain > and Persia. It may be that we shall lose Palestine. But it's too late to > talk of peaceful solutions.\\" On being informed of the content of Azzam's declaration, Ben-Gurion, who considered Azzam the \\"most honest and humane among Arab leaders\\", and who had earlier, on June 18, 1947, ordered the Haganah to prepare for a war he himself thought inevitable, synthesized Azzam's position in the following words: > \\"As we fought against the Crusaders, we will fight against you, and we will > erase you from the earth.\\"Joseph Heller, The Birth of Israel, 1945‚Äì1949: > Ben-Gurion and His Critics, University Press of Florida, 2000 p.79 At the pan-Arab summit of 19 September 1947, which convened at Saoufar in Lebanon, the League decided to employ all available means to ensure the independence of Palestine as an Arab state. On October 11, the editor of Akhbar al-Yom, Mustafa Amin, ran an interview he had obtained from Azzam Pasha to report on the outcome of the summit. The article was entitled, \\"A War of Extermination,\\" (Arabic transliteration required), and in one passage contained the following words. In early December 1947 Azzam told a rally of students in Cairo that \\"The Arabs conquered the Tartars and the Crusaders and they are now ready to defeat the new enemy,\\" echoing sentiments he had expressed to a journalist the previous day.  Jewish Agency Memorandum  A Jewish Agency memorandum, submitted on February 2, 1948, to the U.N. Palestine Commission, tasked with the implementation of the partition resolution, and yet again to the U.N. secretary-general on March 29, 1948, referred to the Azzam Pasha quotation, citing the October 11, 1947 article in Akhbar al-Yom.  The uses to which the quotation was put  At the time of the utterance, according to Segev, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict was raging also in the media of the day, as either side sought to show the other side was agitating for war. Azzam had, he concludes, 'supplied the Zionists with a sound bite that serves Israeli propaganda to this very day,' and some 395 books, and roughly 13,000 websites cite this excerpt to this day. Azzam's quoted first sentence, without its initial caveat, appeared in English in a Jewish Agency memorandum to the United Nations Palestine Commission in February 1948.Jewish Agency for Palestine, Memorandum on acts of Arab aggression to alter by force the settlement on the future government of Palestine approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations, Submitted to the United Nations Palestine Commission. Lake Success, New York. February 2, 1948. A copy appears in UN document S/710. During the next few years, the same partial sentence appeared in its correct 1947 setting in several books.; However, by 1952, many publications, including one published by the Israeli government, had moved its date to 1948, specifically to May 15, 1948, shortly after the outbreak of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. As the war got underway, The Jerusalem Post quoted a further declaration from him: > \\"Whatever the outcome, the Arabs will stick to their offer of equal > citizenship for Jews in Arab Palestine and let them be as Jewish as they > like.\\"  Quotation source and authenticity debate  Until 2010, the source of the quotation has been commonly claimed to be a press conference in Cairo on May 15, 1948, one day after the Israeli declaration of independence, which some versions say was broadcast by the BBC.; ; . An Egyptian writer in 1961 maintained that the quotation was \\"completely out of context\\". He wrote that \\"Azzam actually said that he feared that if the people of Palestine were to be forcibly and against all right dispossessed, a tragedy comparable to the Mongol invasions and the Crusades might not be avoidable. ... The reference to the Crusaders and the Mongols aptly describes the view of the foreign Zionist invaders shared by most Arabs.\\" In 2010, doubt over the provenance of the quotation was voiced by Joffe and Romirowsky and by Morris. In 2010, the source of the quote was traced by the computer scientist Brendan McKay to an October 11, 1947 article in the Egyptian newspaper Akhbar al-Yom, titled \\"A War of Extermination\\", which included the quote with the added words, \\"Personally, I hope the Jews do not force us into this war, because it would be a war of extermination and momentous massacre ...\\". McKay shared his discovery with Jewish-American pro-Israel researcher David Barnett, who then published a paper on his discovery together with Karsh. Karsh nonetheless accused McKay of failing to share it 'with the general public' on Wikipedia, 'so as to keep Arab genocidal designs on the nascent Jewish state under wraps', which McKay called 'quite a distortion'.  Interpretation debate  Karsh, together with his co-author, the researcher David Barnett, consider the Azzam Pasha quotation a \\"Genocidal threat\\". Tom Segev, also an historian, disputes this interpretation, saying that \\"Azzam used to talk a lot\\" and pointing to another statement from May 21, 1948, in which Azzam Pasha declared his desire for \\"equal citizenship for Jews in Arab Palestine\\". In response to Segev, Karsh wrote that while it is true that Azzam was prepared to allow survivors of the destroyed Jewish state to live as Dhimmis, in his view \\"this can hardly be considered an indication of moderation\\".Efraim Karsh, 'Haaretz: The Paper for Thinking People?,' at New English Review, December 16, 2011.  Akhbar el-Yom interview  In the interview to Akhbar el-Yom, Azzam predicted Palestine would be entered by large numbers of Muslim volunteers from many countries. He said that the fight would have three dimensions: faith, looting, and unstoppability, and argued that the Arabs knew how to carry on after a defeat, whereas, according to the interview, the Jews did not. He concluded, > \\"I foresee the consequences of this bloody war. I see before me its horrible > battles. I can picture its dead, injured, and victims ... But my conscience > is clear ... For we are not attacking but defending ourselves, and we are > not aggressors but defenders against an aggression!\\"  References  Category:1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:Political quotes Category:Quotations from military Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 1940s ","title":"Azzam Pasha quotation"},{"id":"33624254","text":"Raklitza is a river of Saxony, Germany.

In philosophy she is mostly interested in Possible-world theories.Mark Montebello, Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f‚ÄôMalta (A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, pp. 78-79. Life Gatt Ciancio was born at Msida, Malta, in 1946. She studied at the University of Malta, from who acquired a Bachelor of Arts in Maltese Language, English Language, and Mediterranean Studies (1973). She also studied at the Pacific Western University in Los Angeles, California, United States. From here she acquired a Master‚Äôs degree in Science with a major in Neuroscience. She also conducted studies in Social Democracy and Political Economy. In 1967 Gatt Ciancio began teaching in Malta at a primary level, and in 1969 proceeded to teach on a secondary level (till 1975). Later she taught at the sixth level of education (1976). Somewhat active in party politics with the Labour Party in Malta, in 1989 she edited the pages reserved for the political affairs of women in weekly paper of the General Workers Union, It-Torca (under the pseudonym ‚ÄòAnna‚Äô). Between 1991 and 1993 she was Co-ordinator of the Adult Education programme of the Guz√® Ellul Mercer Foundation. Works Though the published works of Gatt Ciancio are few, together with philosophical argumentation they might be considered as explorations into what might be possible and even beyond. Her main interests in her works are of a social and political nature, very often connecting to the concept of an undivided world with no frontiers. Her main publications are the following: * 1977 - Power to the Man in the Street.Ibid., Vol. II, pp. 112-113. A 62-page book published in Malta, which, in its speculative projection, is quite ambitious, for not only does it uphold a political theory but furthermore proposes an interesting political programme. Essentially, Gatt Ciancio puts forward the possibility of future world unity based on the emancipation of so-called 'superdwarf' humans. This will create a peaceful, fraternal and laborious people. This type of human being will be motivated to improve humankind's cultural levels for pure intellectual pleasure. The 'superdwarf' people will prolong life, perhaps even through a form of 'materialistic immortality'. * 1992 - Tomorrow We Shall Be Here.Ibid., Vol. II, pp. 222-223. A 94-page book published in Malta which is basically a novel. In it Gatt Ciancio imagines a future world in which, though advanced socially and technologically, is still plagued with party revelry, corruption and political religion. Through difficult situations, hope is found in education, especially through communication.

Its most current definition can be found in the European Standard EN50170.  History  The FIP standard is based on a French initiative in 1982 to create a requirements analysis for a future field bus standard. The study led to the European Eureka initiative for a field bus standard in June 1986 that included 13 partners. The development group (r√©seaux locaux industriels) created the first proposal to be standardized in France. The name of the FIP field bus was originally given as an abbreviation of the French \\"Flux d'Information vers le Processus\\" while later referring to FIP with the English name \\"Factory Instrumentation Protocol\\" (some references also use the hybrid \\"Flux Information Protocol\\"). Based on the requirements study other manufacturers created similar protocol definitions - starting in 1990 a number of partners from Japan and America merged with FIP to the WorldFIP standardization group (that later merged into the Fieldbus Foundation group). Along with the competing German Profibus the field buses were submitted for European standardization by CENELEC in 1996. Along with other field bus standards these CENELEC standards were included to the international IEC 61158 and IEC 61784 standards by 1999 where FIP is listed as the Communication Profile Family 5. Eventually FIP has lost ground to Profibus which came to prevail the market in Europe in the following decade - the WorldFIP homepage has seen no press release since 2002 (with the US based Fieldbus Foundation to haven taken the lead in ongoing development which however promotes H1 fieldbus for process automation).

Although not the best of his generation in France (he was inferior to both Sardanapale and La Farina) he proved too good for the leading British colts in the 1914 Epsom Derby, which he won by three lengths. His pedigree was controversial, with the British authorities not recognising him as a Thoroughbred. His racing career was ended by the outbreak of the First World War. Background Durbar, a bay horse standing 15.3 hands high with a white blaze and three white socks, was bred in France by his owner Herman B. Duryea. Duryea had been a prominent owner and breeder of racehorses in New York State, until 1908. In that year, gambling was made illegal in the state by the Hart‚ÄìAgnew Law, forcing most racetracks to close, and like several of his compatriots Duryea transferred his racing and breeding operations to Europe. Shortly afterwards and possibly in response to the influx of American horses, the Jockey Club created a new regulation which became known as the Jersey Act, banning horses without proven \\"pure\\" descent from foundation mares from being registered in the General Stud Book. Such horses, including many from the most successful American families, were allowed to race but could not be considered Thoroughbreds. Durbar fell foul of the new rule as his dam Armenia descended from an unknown mare. Racing career =1913: two-year-old season= Durbar ran four times in 1913 without success, but showed some promise, twice finishing fourth and running third in the Prix Prestige on his final start. =1914: three-year-old season= Herman B Duryea, Durbar's owner and breeder Durbar was extremely active in the spring of 1914, running six times in France before being sent to Epsom. Running over 2000m he won his first two races before he was stepped up in class to run second to Sardanapale in the Prix Lagrange. He won the Prix Biennale on his next start and was then moved up to 2400m to record his most important French victory in the Prix Noailles. He was brought back in trip for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600m at Longchamp but was unable to recover from a poor start and finished unplaced. At Epsom he started at 20/1 against thirty opponents, one of the largest fields ever assembled for the race. A possible explanation for the size of the field was that an unusually large numbers of \\"forlorn hopes\\" were starting in the race in order to collect money on sweepstakes tickets. A year after the \\"suffragette Derby\\" of 1913 the race was marked by another incident in which a campaigner for women's suffrage, named as Ada Rice was arrested after firing a starting pistol at a policeman. The start of the race was delayed for more than twenty minutes as the starter struggled to control the runners leading the favourite, Kennymore, the winner of the 2000 Guineas to become increasingly fractious, lashing out with his hooves and attempting to attack other horses. Once the field was underway Durbar, ridden by the French-based American Matt McGee, was always prominent, led soon after halfway, and won easily by three lengths. He was followed home by two other outsiders, Hapsburg and Peter the Hermit in a result which left the huge crowd stunned into silence. Although the colt had been bred and trained in France his owner's nationality meant that his win was greeted as an American victory in the United States. Following his Epsom win, Durbar was returned to France for his next two races which confirmed the impression that he was a good colt, but some way behind the very best French horses. He finished fourth behind Sardanapale in the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly and third behind the same colt and La Farina in the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp. On the same day that the Grand Prix was run the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria began the sequence of events which led to the outbreak of the First World War. Horse racing in France was suspended and Durbar never ran again. His safe evacuation from the Paris area to Normandy was in part due to the actions of his African American groom, who reportedly wrapped the horse in an American flag with a notice reading, Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Durbar an \\"average\\" Derby winner, but one who was some way behind both Sardanapale and La Farina.Randall, J and Morris, T. Portway Press, 1999, p. 205 Stud career Durbar first stood as a stallion at his owner's Haras du Gazon at Neuvy-au- Houlme in Normandy, France. In 1924 he was sent to America to stand at the Claiborne Farm stud at Paris, Kentucky. In 1931 he was moved again, this time to the Prospect Hill Stud at Bel Air, Maryland, but died before the start of the breeding season. His best European runners included Rebia (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Durban (Prix Vermeille) and Scaramouche (Prix de la For√™t). He was less successful after his move to the United States.

Life and career  She was born Tillie Goldenberg, to J. M. and Sarah Goldenberg in 1922. J. M. was a Saskatoon lawyer. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Saskatchewan in 1941. Later, after having married and after her two children were born, she returned to studies and obtained her LLB in 1956. She was the only woman in her class. She met her husband George Taylor while both were volunteering in the Youth Congress movement in the 1930s; her parents initially disapproved because George and his family were communists. They married in 1941. George completed his law degree while Tillie supported him working as a secretary. He went on to become a well-respected labour lawyer, and for part of his career worked in Tillie's father's firm. George and Tillie continued to be involved in politics, supporting the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (later, the New Democratic Party). After law school, she worked in the Saskatoon Land Titles Office, as deputy registrar. In 1959, she became the first woman to be appointed as a provincial magistrate in Saskatchewan.Pernelle Jakobsen, Bench-Breakers? Women Judges in Prairie Canada 1916-1980, p. 172. Doctoral dissertation in History, University of Calgary, 2014. Retrieved 2016-11-30. She might also have been the first Jew to be named magistrate, but that is less clear. Presiding over misdemeanours, she became more aware of the association between crime and poverty, and began to push for reforms, through such organizations as the John Howard Society, the Medical Care Insurance Commission of Saskatchewan, and the Provincial Commission of Inquiry into Legal Aid. Collaborating with Roger Carter, the law school dean at the University of Saskatchewan, she helped to build opportunities for Aboriginal people to enter the field of law. When the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission was created in 1972, she was named its first chair. There was criticism that she had named abortion as a human right, but neither she nor the commission as a whole gave in to the pressure to remove it. In 1976 she was elected as a director on the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women. From 1977 to 1987, she served on the board of governors of the Canadian Council on Social Development. Taylor suffered a severe stroke in 1995, but recovered much of her lost speech and mobility, despite a poor prognosis initially. She died at the age of 88, on October 23, 2011.

With the help of her father and brothers, she appeared before the Diet of Speyer (1570). She was allowed to prostrate in front of Emperor Maximilian II at her father's Heidelberg Castle.

History The oldest parts of the building date from the late 16th or 17th century, although it was razed to the ground in the 1640s when the Parliamentary army was advancing towards the city during the Civil War. Only traces of timber framing have survived. It shares many identical features with a former vicarage in Church Lane, Little Abington, near Cambridge, which itself dates from the Queen Anne period. This style of architecture, known as English Baroque, was popular during the reign of Queen Anne (1702 -1714) and it is likely that Boughton Lodge as it now exists was constructed around this time. The building has subsequently been converted into four flats, and two cottages. Architecture The lodge has a long, irregular plan, and its exterior is rendered. It is roofed in grey slate, and is in two storeys. On the entrance front the doorway has a pointed arch in the style of the 13th century. On the sides are projecting wings with gables, and the cottage extends to the left of the left wing. Some of the windows are sashes, and others are casements under pointed arches.

Early life Clifton was the eldest son of Sir Gervase Clifton, 4th Baronet, and his wife Anne Bagnall, daughter of Dudley Bagnall of Newry, Ireland. He was imprisoned briefly with his father during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. He married on 27 June 1723, Frances Coote, daughter of Nanfan Coote, 2nd Earl of Bellomont. On 27 May 1725, he was made a Knight of the Bath. Career At the 1727 British general election Clifton planned to stand for both East Retford and Nottinghamshire with combined Whig and Tory support, but reached a compromise by which he was assured of support at East Retford where he was returned as Member of Parliament. He supported the Government, serving on the gaols committee of the House of Commons. In 1731, he succeeded his father to the baronetcy. He was returned unopposed at the 1734 British general election. He carried on supporting the Government until 1737 when he voted for an increase in the Prince of Wales's allowance. After that he acted with the Opposition. His first wife Frances had died in 1733 and he married on 16 October 1739, Hannah Lombe daughter of Sir Thomas Lombe, Alderman and Sheriff of London and his wife Elizabeth Turner. In a contest for East Retford at the 1741 British general election, he came bottom of the poll, despite large bribes paid by his mother-in-law, Lady Lombe, to potential voters. According to Lord Egmont, Clifton separated from his wife and took up with his mother-in-law, both of them behaving so extravagantly that in 1746 he was imprisoned for debt. His second wife Hannah died in 1748. He expressed interest in standing for parliament again, but found little support in his attempts to stand at East Retford in 1747 and Nottingham in 1758. In 1756, he married as his third wife Judith Thwaites, daughter of Captain Thwaites. Death and legacy Clifton died on 7 December 1762. By his first wife Frances he had a daughter Frances Clifton, who married in 1747 George Carpenter, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell. By his second wife had a son Gervase who succeeded to the baronetcy.
