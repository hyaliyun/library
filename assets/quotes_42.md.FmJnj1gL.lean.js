She was also a travel and non-fiction writer. Life The eldest of three children, Marie was born in 1900 in Ashton upon Mersey in what was then Cheshire, England, to progressive-minded parents. Her younger brothers were David John Byles and Baldur Unwin Byles (1904‚Äì1975). Her parents were Unitarian Universalists, Fabian socialists and pacifists. Her mother Ida Margaret, n√©e Unwin, was a suffragette and had studied at The Slade School of Fine Art, until \\"her artistic talents were lost to the drudgery of housekeeping\\", and who impressed upon her daughter the necessity of being financially independent of men. Her father, Cyril Beuzeville Byles was a railway signal engineer. In England he involved his children in campaigns against fences that prevented public access for recreational walks. The family moved to Australia in 1911 because Cyril Byles was appointed Chief Signals Engineer with the New South Wales Government Railways, to design the signal system for electrifying the railway system. They found a block of land in Beecroft and in 1913 built a house there which they named 'Chilworth'. The family spent summers by the sea, and in 1913 they also built a small cottage at Palm Beach, on Sunrise Hill facing the lighthouse. Marie was educated at Beecroft Primary School, and at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney at Croydon from 1914 to 1915, and in 1916 and 1917 at the new second campus of the school at Pymble (now known as Pymble Ladies' College). She excelled, and became a prefect and dux of the school in 1916, and Head Prefect and dux the following year. At matriculation, she won an Exhibition to the University of Sydney. Marie Byles never married, had no children, and considered it a waste of potential when her friend Dot Butler chose to have children rather than continue with full-time mountaineering. In 1932 she joined The Women's Club, which was created in Sydney in 1901 to provide a place where women \\"interested in public, professional, scientific and artistic work\\" could meet. Byles was raised as a strict vegetarian by her mother and in 1957 commented that she had never eaten meat.Croucher, Paul. (1989). Buddhism in Australia, 1848-1988. New South Wales University Press. p. 34  First female solicitor  Marie was one of a small number of women to attend the University of Sydney. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1921 and in 1924 she completed a Bachelor of Laws degree and became the first woman to be admitted as a solicitor in New South Wales. Although Ada Evans had graduated in law in 1902, it had been illegal for a woman to practise law in Australia until 1918. After clerking for four years, in 1929 Marie set up a legal practice, the first woman to do so in New South Wales. Marie operated two law practices ‚Äì one in Eastwood and the other in the central Sydney. She gave young women opportunities to participate in the profession. 'The business in Eastwood built up because she had the reputation of getting things done so quickly and that was almost unknown in a legal office, she was notorious.' (Employee, Ruth Milton).As cited in Peterson (2005) She worked mainly on conveyancing and probate, and also to ensure just divorce settlements for female clients. She retired and handed over the legal practice to a partner in 1970. Journalist and speaker As a student, Marie wrote and published articles on legal, political, and environmental subjects. From 1927‚Äì1936 she had the position of legal correspondent for the Australian Women‚Äôs Mirror. She wrote articles against women changing their name on marriage, so as to protect their financial assets. As legal correspondent she brought attention to laws and court practices that discriminated against women. She gave lectures for the Australian League of Nations Union and wrote pamphlets for The United Associations of Women.  Conservationist and bushwalker  The Marie Byles lookout As a teenager at her family's holiday retreat at Palm Beach, Marie would look through her telescope across Broken Bay to the bushland beyond on the Central Coast. The area was marked on maps as Bouddi, an aboriginal name meaning nose. It was a coal reserve visited only by fishermen. In 1920 Marie and some of her university friends set out to walk through the bush of Bouddi to Maitland Bay, then known as 'Boat Harbour', where they camped. It became a favourite spot for them. The only bushwalking club at the time was The Mountain Trails Club led by Myles Dunphy, which did not admit women. By 1929, there was an increasing focus on organised recreation for the city and suburban population and Marie joined the two-year- old Sydney Bush Walkers Club. In 1930, a new name for Boat Harbour was proposed by the club; bushwalker Dorothy Lawry suggested \\"Maitland Bay\\" after the steamer that was wrecked at the northern end of the beach in 1889. Over the next five years, with the support of the Federation of Sydney Bushwalkers Clubs, Marie successfully campaigned in the press for the area to be placed under public ownership. The creation of Bouddi Natural Park in 1935 was a landmark achievement for the early conservationists. The Lands Department set aside an even larger area than Marie had proposed. Marie Byles was elected a trustee of the board that managed the park, and for many years organized volunteers to clear and maintain its walking tracks. A lookout over Bouddi has been named after her; it is accessible by car, on The Scenic Road in Killcare Heights just south of the Bouddi National Park Visitor Centre. In 1939, Marie was the co-founder, with her close friend Paddy Pallin, of The Bush Club. This was a bushwalking club with an emphasis on day-walks, which did not impose rigorous entry tests on prospective members and attracted many pre-war European refugees as members.  Explorer  In 1927‚Äì28, Marie had saved enough money from working for four years as a law clerk to take a year off to travel. She set off on a Norwegian cargo boat, and it is from this journey that she wrote her popular book By Cargo Boat and Mountain, published in 1931. Later she was periodically able to leave her law practice in the hands of partners, to climb mountains in Britain, Norway and Canada. In 1935 she climbed Mt Cook in New Zealand. After finding that an expedition to Alaska would be too expensive, in 1938 she led a large expedition to Mt Sansato, in Western China near the Tibetan border. At times her party in China traveled with a military escort to protect them from bandits. Due to poor weather, the expedition failed to reach the summit, and Marie was bitterly disappointed.  Meditation  She became interested in the Quaker denomination of Christianity, but was refused membership. During her travels through Burma, China and Vietnam in 1938, Marie often chose to stay in temples, which brought her into direct contact with non-European cultures and religions. On her return, Marie renewed her interest in the teachings of Gandhi, and began exploring Buddhism. A collapsed foot arch meant that she was no longer able to walk long distances or climb, and she studied spirituality and meditation to find ways of dealing with her pain. Over the following years she spent a year in India, including the Himalayas, and made three trips to Burma and two trips to Japan. In 1960 she formed a meditation group, inviting interested people from any religion or none to meet on Saturday afternoons to study meditation techniques. In later life she became particularly drawn to Mahayana Buddhism and the conscious practice of kindness and compassion. From these experiences she completed four books on Buddhism.  Byles' home  'Ahimsa', the house that Marie Byles built on the edge of Cheltenham, as it looked in 2015 By 1938 Marie left her family home in Beecroft and built her own house on bushland that she had bought in 1935 at the edge of nearby Cheltenham, adjacent to crown land. She named it 'Ahimsa' after the term used by Gandhi meaning \\"harmlessness\\". The four-room simple cottage is built of fibro and sandstone, and the large north-facing verandah is primarily where Marie slept and lived in preference to the interior rooms. In addition to the house, Marie wanted to have a place on her land for groups to meet for discussions and meditation. By 1949, the 'Hut of Happy Omen' was complete, designed as an open sleepout with bunks and a large sandstone fireplace. She had another small house built next to 'Ahimsa' in 1975, called 'Sentosa' (a Malay language word meaning peace and tranquility). In 1970 Marie bequeathed her property to The National Trust of Australia (NSW), which she had helped in 1946 when she was the consulting solicitor who drafted the organisation's constitution. Death and legacy Marie died at 'Ahimsa' in 1979. In 1985 a dramatised documentary, A Singular Woman, was made by Gillian Coote using text from an unpublished autobiography written by Byles, along with reenactments and commentary by friends. Her papers (1923-1982) are held in the State Library of New South Wales. Byles Place, in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm, is named in her honour, as is the Marie Byles Lookout in Killcare Heights, N.S.W.

History Rita's (informally known as \\"Rita's Water Ice\\") was founded in May 1984 by former Philadelphia firefighter Bob Tumolo with a recipe that he purchased from an elderly neighbor that he then adjusted to enhance the flavors and include real fruit. Rita's originally advertised its product as \\"water ice\\", using the colloquial term for what is sometimes called \\"Italian ice\\" in other areas of the country. By 1987 a second store was opened, and in 1989 the family decided to franchise their business. Today, there are over 600 locations in 30 states and the District of Columbia that serve 45000 people daily. In May 2005, the company was sold to McKnight Capital Partners, a private equity group with extensive franchise experience.Philadelphia Business Journal, May 4, 2005Pittsburgh Business Times, May 4, 2005 McKnight Capital Partners recognized the organization's growth potential and set into place plans to expand the company. In April 2007, Rita's moved its Bensalem headquarters to the Trevose section of Bensalem Township. In 2011, Falconhead Capital purchased a controlling interest in the company from an investment group led by Jim Rudolph.

The flats were designed by F. Gordon Wilson, chief architect at the Department of Housing Construction. Context The New Zealand government had first become involved in the provision of housing when the Workers‚Äô Dwelling Act, which allowed the state to build and lease houses to workers, was passed in 1905.Jeremy Salmond, Old New Zealand Houses, 1800-1940\\\\. (Auckland: Reed Methuen, 1986), p. 227. However, only after the election of the First Labour Government in 1935 was there large-scale state involvement in the New Zealand housing market. One of many measures that was undertaken by the First Labour Government was the launch of a state housing scheme to provide every New Zealander with a home that, in Walter Nash‚Äôs words, would be ‚Äúfit for a cabinet minister‚Äù.Michael King, The Penguin History of New Zealand. (Auckland: Penguin, 2003), p. 356. The Department of Housing Construction, with its own architects, was established, and by 1940 almost 10,000 new single-unit dwellings had been constructed.Salmond, op. cit., p. 228. In March 1938, the government announced the construction of the first block of multi-unit flats, at Berhampore. Although single-unit dwellings had been preferred, the government felt that the housing problem was of such magnitude that every approach should be encouraged, and that advances in multi-unit complexes were such that they had become more socially acceptable. The location of the flats, a short tram ride from Courtenay Place, was intended to give convenient access to the tenants‚Äô workplaces, and reduce urban sprawl. Architecture The scheme consisted of 48 one-, two- or three-bedroom units, and 11 garages, planned to maximize open spaces. Particular attention was paid to maximizing sunlight, with the buildings on the northern side being limited to one storey, living rooms built to the sun, windows as large as practicable and balconies included in all units above ground level. Other features were an emphasis on built-in services and consideration of sound insulation between the units. The complex included a community centre in the central garden area. Engineering Reinforced- concrete construction mitigated earthquake and fire risks, and reduced maintenance and construction costs. Construction and alterations The Berhampore Flats were completed in 1938‚Äì39. Major renovations and alterations were carried out by the New Zealand Housing Corporation in 1987, but the original character of the scheme is still evident. The complex was given \\"Category I\\" historic place status by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) in 1998.

Vocalist/guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach spent six weeks at his mother's farm in Nova Scotia, Canada, where he worked on new material. In early 2002, the group recorded their next album with J. Robbins. The band went on a pre-release US tour in June and July, leading up to the release of Perfecting Loneliness on October 15 through independent label Jade Tree. The group had planned to promote it with a tour, however, due to an illness, the tour was delayed until mid-2003. By this point, a music video had been filmed for \\"Cat Heaven\\" and drummer Chris Daly was replaced by Matt Torrey. Background and production After being delayed twice, Four Cornered Night saw release in September 2000 through independent label Jade Tree. It was supported with two US tours; during the latter of these, in early 2001, the group premiered new material, including the tracks \\"William Tell Override\\" and \\"Loose Candy\\". Vocalist/guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach spent six weeks at his mother's farm in Nova Scotia, Canada; his family planned to go on vacation and left him alone at the house. Due to the farm's remote nature, he spent plenty of time writing new material. Following the September 11 attacks, it took the group several months to become creative again. In March 2002, the band announced they had planned to record their next album in the coming weeks for release in the middle of the year. It was produced by J. Robbins. Composition Musically, the sound of Perfecting Loneliness has been described as folk-pop and indie rock, incorporating piano melody lines and infrequent use of cello. Schwarzenbach's vocals on the album have been referred to as a mix of Joey Ramone, Cracker frontman David Lowery and Teenage Fanclub frontman Norman Blake. Lyrically, it tackles the themes of despair and loneliness, against piano, softly-played guitars and scare drum patterns; though it occasionally enters into rock territory with distorted guitar lines, loud drums and heavy bass parts. The group said the record was about the search for love, God, while lacking in attempting to find these aspects. Schwarzenbach explained the search: \\"I think it is always worth trying to find out whether you can find what you are looking for or not ... at the end of the trip there is a new album in my case, so the search was by no means in vain.\\" Schwarzenbach initially composed some of the tracks as folk songs, but later evolved after showing them to the band. The opening guitar riff of \\"The Frequency\\" recalled Hum, before shifting into a mix of power pop and a Built to Spill-esque instrumental. It sees Schwarzenbach's detail his hometown New York City with a bitter nature, lamenting hipsters and prolonged career paths. \\"You're the One I Want\\" was reminiscent of Howard Jones. \\"Cat Heaven\\" was written for Schwarzenbach's cat Chinatown, who became ill and had died. The title-track, which lasts for over five minutes in length, combined the lyrical nature of the group's debut Orange Rhyming Dictionary (1998) with the layered sound of Four Cornered Night. The final minute features radio transmissions from the Apollo 11 moon landing; this aided in the lyrics discussing alienation and isolation.Holmes 2002, p. 41 The song, along with the final two tracks \\"Disgrace\\" and \\"Rocket Boy\\", was written after the September 11 attacks. \\"Psalm\\" was compared to James Taylor. The energy of \\"Autumn Walker\\" and \\"William Tell Override\\" recalled the likes of H√ºsker D√º and Sugar. \\"Further North\\" begins with a folk-tinged acoustic guitar part, gentle percussion and a bass part, as Schwarzenbach details his mother's farm and the topic of isolation. Schwarzenbach uses \\"Disgrace\\" as social commentary on having nothing to watch despite a multitude of television channels. The closing track \\"Rocket Boy\\" is a ballad that lasts for over nine minutes in length. It discusses loneliness, alongside humanity and the urge to fix life's problems. Release In June and July 2002, the group went on a US tour, dubbed Fill in the Gaps Tour '02. They were supported by Pilot to Gunner. On July 1, Perfecting Loneliness was announced for release in October; its track listing was revealed. Perfecting Loneliness was released on October 15 through Jade Tree. The artwork features a castle under a twilight moon; guitarist Brian Maryansky saw the image in a children's book that they found in the street. The band had intended to promote it with a US headlining tour in October and November, however, on the day of the first show, the whole tour was cancelled due to an illness in the band. The group self-directed a music video for the track \\"Cat Heaven\\".Hart 202, p. 54 On January 9, 2003, Schwarzenbach revealed he had spent the preceding six weeks recuperating in Canada. In the same announcement, he said drummer Chris Daly had left the group. In April, Matt Torrey, formerly of MK Ultra, was announced as their new drummer. Between May and July, the band toured across the US on the Throwdown 2003 tour, with support from John Vanderslice. Additional shows were added into late July, with dates in Canada. Reception Perfecting Loneliness received a mainly positive reception from music critics. Ox-Fanzine Joachim Hiller said the record \\"fully met my expectations.\\" It \\"lives up to its title\\", bordering on \\"pathos and kitsch.\\" Chart Attack writer Elizabeth Chorney-Booth said Schwarzenbach's transition from \\"emo-punk hero to dreamy- eyed pop wuss is complete‚Ä¶ and the results are lovely.\\" The album is filled with \\"swoony lyrics, bulging keyboards, unabashed melody and earnest little rock-outs.\\" AllMusic reviewer Charles Spano noted the \\"deeper instrumentation, undone piano melodies, and larger-than-life orchestration\\", which the group used to \\"turn intimate observations into moments of transcendent grandeur.\\" Sputnikmusic staff member Tyler Fisher said that despite the group toing the \\"line of bland here and there\\", the music is, at times, \\"perfectly beautiful.\\" The album's strength relied on its \\"softer, slower tracks rather than the more intense\\" ones, though \\"there is a good variety of both.\\" Louis Miller of CMJ New Music Report said the \\"lushly arranged\\" collection saw the group crafting \\"stellar, yet humble songs ... that quite often develop into six and seven- minute epics.\\" PopMatters writer Adam Dlugacz said album \\"immediately addresses some of the problems that were prevalent\\" on Four Cornered Night, however, by the midway point, things became \\"absolutely inexplicable to me. Just when you think they've turned the corner, they turn into Chicago, complete with cheesy progressions that are supposed let you know how much they care.\\" While noting the album's long length, Ultimate Guitar found the release less personal than Four Cornered Night with more obscurity in the lyrics. Despite the lack of \\"immediate emotional impact\\", it had \\"moments of greatness.\\" Punknews.org staff member Scott Heisel criticized the album for \\"lacking in the lyrical department\\", \\"recycling themes\\" from Orange Rhyming Dictionary and the length of the songs. In a negative review for Pitchfork, Eric Carr wrote that it was a \\"sad example of a few decent arrangements being recycled and regurgitated until, by the end of the album\\", with nothing \\"left but pre-chewed, partially digested gunk.\\" Stylus Magazine Todd Burns highlighted Schwarzenbach's lyrics as being the sole highlight on the record, though with no \\"audible signs of innovation or progression.\\" He found the music \\"so entirely lacking\\"; he release failing to deliver \\"the one two punch of lyric and music.\\" Track listing # \\"The Frequency\\" ‚Äì 6:15 # \\"You're the One I Want\\" ‚Äì 4:26 # \\"Cat Heaven\\" ‚Äì 5:06 # \\"Perfecting Loneliness\\" ‚Äì 5:47 # \\"Lucky Charm\\" ‚Äì 5:59 # \\"Wish List\\" ‚Äì 4:19 # \\"Psalm\\" ‚Äì 5:16 # \\"Autumn Walker\\" ‚Äì 5:33 # \\"Further North\\" ‚Äì 5:14 # \\"William Tell Override\\" ‚Äì 3:58 # \\"Disgrace\\" ‚Äì 6:34 # \\"Rocket Boy\\" ‚Äì 9:33 References Citations Sources  External links *Perfecting Loneliness at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:2002 albums Category:Jets to Brazil albums Category:Jade Tree (record label) albums Category:Albums produced by J.

The town of Jerramungup was established in 1953 to support a war service land settlement project that was initiated in 1949. The townsite was gazetted in 1957. The town hall and the school were both built in 1958 along with two houses. Construction of the Cooperative Bulk Handling wheat bin was completed in 1961. The first powerhouse was completed in 1963. Jerramungup (Yarra-mo-up) is an Aboriginal word said to mean \\"place of the tall yate trees\\". The yate tree (Eucalyptus cornuta) is an evergreen tree that grows to a height of 20 m with a diameter of one metre. It has orange bud caps and greenish yellow flowers, and is common in the southwest of WA. The name was first recorded by Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in 1847, when carrying out exploration of the area, noting that natives referred to the river and its numerous branches as \\"Jeer-A-Mung-Up\\". Roe later named the same river near its mouth the Gairdner River, not realising they were the same, and this is the name now used for the river. The town hall was opened in April 1958 and is known colloquially as the \\"Root Pickers Hall\\" as it was paid for by volunteers picking mallee roots. 200 tonnes of Laguna Verde or Laguna Green monzonite from Jerramungup were used to make the Australian War Memorial in London, which was opened in Hyde Park in 2003. The quarry is situated 21 km south of the town, at Wirrup Hill.

For nearly five decades he has been at the forefront of Irish traditional music and Celtic music, performing and recording with the groups The Bothy Band, Patrick Street, and the Celtic Fiddle Festival. He is a 2002 recipient of a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In addition to his solo albums, Burke has had successful project collaborations with Christy Moore, Andy Irvine & Paul Brady, M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill, Jackie Daly, Ged Foley and Cal Scott. Early life Kevin Burke was born in 1950 in London, England to parents from County Sligo in Ireland. Inheriting a love of Irish music from his parents, he took up the fiddle at the age of eight, studied under Jessie Christopherson, and eventually developed an advanced technique in the Sligo fiddling style. He travelled frequently to Ireland to visit relatives and immersed himself in the local Sligo music.\\"Kevin Burke: Sweeney‚Äôs Dream<\\". Irish Music Review, by Geoff Wallis, originally published in Songlines Magazine. By the age of thirteen, he was playing with Irish musical groups. Career Burke joined a c√©il√≠ band, the Glenside, and played weekends at various Irish dance halls around London. In 1966, the Glenside performed at the c√©il√≠ band competition at the All-Ireland Fleadh in Boyle in County Roscommon and won the competition. In 1972, Burke met American singer-songwriter Arlo Guthrie in a pub in Milltown Malbay in County Clare. Impressed with Burke's fiddling, Guthrie invited him to Los Angeles to play on his album Last of the Brooklyn Cowboys (1973). Burke's exposure to the musicians he met in the United States‚Äîincluding accordionist Joe Burke and fiddler Andy McGann‚Äîinspired him to make a career of playing music. In 1974, Burke moved to Dublin, where he teamed up with singer-songwriter Christy Moore, a former member of the Irish band Planxty. Together with Jimmy Faulkner and Declan McNelis, they played throughout Ireland for the next few years. Kevin Burke at the Dublin Irish Festival, 2008 In 1976, Burke became a member of the Irish traditional music group The Bothy Band; the band, active for three years in the late 1970s, was well-known for its enthusiastic and highly skilled performances. Burke replaced Tommy Peoples on fiddle, and soon became an integral member of the group, appearing on three of their albums: Old Hag You Have Killed Me (1976), Out of the Wind ‚Äì Into the Sun (1977), and After Hours (Live in Paris) (1979). Burke developed a friendship with the band's guitarist and vocalist, M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill, and soon the two began appearing together as a duo. When the Bothy Band disbanded in 1979, they toured the United Kingdom and Europe together, and recorded the album Promenade (1979). In 1980, Burke and √ì Domhnaill moved to the United States and toured throughout the country before settling in Portland, Oregon, where they recorded a second album, Portland (1982). In 1985, Burke joined the Legends of Irish Music tour, where he played with Irish musicians Andy Irvine (vocals, bouzouki, mandolin and harmonica) and Jackie Daly (accordion).Street Cred, by Colin Irwin in Folk Roots No.66, December 1988.Andy's History ‚Äì Chapter 8. Autobiography at Andy Irvine's website. Retrieved 20 January 2016 Together they formed the group Patrick Street. During the next two decades, the group released nine albums (excluding two compilations): Patrick Street (1987), No. 2 Patrick Street (1988), Irish Times (1990), All in Good Time (1993), Cornerboys (1996), Made in Cork (1997), Live from Patrick Street (1999), Street Life (2002), and On the Fly (2007). In 1992, Burke recorded the solo album Open House with Mark Graham (harmonica, clarinet, vocals), Paul Kotapish (guitar, mandolin, cittern, bass), and Sandy Silva (percussion). These three comprised the core of his band and together, as the group Open House, they recorded two other albums, Second Story (1994) and Hoof and Mouth (1997). In the early 1990s, Burke started touring and recording with Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham and Breton fiddler Christian Lema√Ætre as the Celtic Fiddle Festival.\\"Fiddle Festival looks back to its deep Celtic roots\\".

In 2002, Burke was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honour given in the United States for folk and traditional arts. In recent years, Burke partnered with Ged Foley to record In Tandem (2006), and collaborated with documentary film composer Cal Scott on the album Across the Black River (2007) and follow-up album Suite (2010). In 2007, Burke started an independent record company, Loftus Music, to release his own recordings.

Newtown Bee, By Andrew Carey, December 02, 2016  Playing style  Nicholls, Australia, 2014 Burke's fiddle playing style was heavily influenced by the Sligo style playing of Michael Coleman, Paddy Killoran, and James Morrison. Burke described the style as being \\"the best of both worlds\\"‚Äîcombining the driving rhythm of Donegal style and the smooth lyricism of Clare style. While acknowledging that his playing is \\"based on\\" the Sligo style, he also acknowledges being influenced by many different musical styles outside of Irish traditional music. For example, one of the distinctive features of his playing is the \\"strong backbeat he applies to many reels, with emphasis on every third quaver\\", presenting the emphasised beat with an up bow, versus the traditional approach of playing that pattern with an emphasised downbow. Burke also emphasises the strong beat by playing \\"an adjacent open string as the bow digs in\\".  Instruments and equipment  Burke currently plays a fiddle made by Michiel De Hoog, a Dutch violin maker working in Dublin. In 2000, his old Tony Martin fiddle had become unstable, despite several repair attempts. Looking for a more stable instrument to play on the road, he turned to his friend De Hoog, who had just finished an instrument. After playing it in the shop, Burke purchased it and has been playing it almost exclusively since. Occasionally, he will play his old Tony Martin fiddle or a fiddle made by Jeff Manthos of Oregon. Burke uses Obligato strings made by Pirastro and rosin made by Gustave Bernadel. The bow he uses exclusively was given to him by his brother Noel Burke, a bow maker, in 2000 for his fiftieth birthday. He carries his fiddle and gear in a Maurizio Riboni case from Cremona, Italy. To amplify his instrument, Burke uses an MBC-603 condenser microphone on a stand. Sometimes he uses a Swiss-made Kurmann Soundpost pick-up designed by Ronnie Arber Audiotechnik along with the microphone.

Assets in a bare trust are held in the name of a trustee, but the beneficiary has the right to all of the capital and income of the trust at any time if they‚Äôre 18 or over (in England and Wales), or 16 or over (in Scotland). Bare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is old enough. In Australia Recent amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act), allow superannuation funds to invest in any kind of asset and to borrow, charging those assets so long as there is no recourse for the borrowing against the superannuation fund. New section 67A & 67B provides that a fund can borrow money if: 1\\\\. the borrowed monies are used to acquire an asset which the fund is not otherwise prohibited from acquiring 2\\\\. the asset acquired (or a replacement asset) is held on trust (the holding trust) so the fund receives a beneficial interest in the asset 3\\\\. the SMSF has the right to acquire legal ownership of the asset (or, if applicable, the replacement asset) by making one or more payments after acquiring the beneficial interest 4\\\\. any recourse the lender has under the arrangement against the SMSF trustee is limited to rights relating to the asset acquired (or, if applicable, the replacement asset). For example, the lender can have the right to recover outstanding amounts where there is a default on the borrowing by repossessing or disposing of the asset being acquired under the arrangement, but cannot have the right to recover such amounts through recourse to the fund's other assets. The Bare Trust Deed Trust Deed is a key document. Care is required to ensure there are no adverse GST, taxation or stamp duty consequences. The legal and beneficial interests in the property must be separated, so that an entity separate from the Superannuation Fund Trustee holds the legal title, while the Superannuation Fund Trustee holds the beneficial interest. A case that deals with the limited powers of a bare trustee to deal with trust assets is Caterpillar Financial Australia Ltd v Ovens Nominees Pty Ltd [2011] FCA 677 which considered the law relating to the duties, powers and rights of a bare trustee in a winding up. This case is an important reminder to practitioners of some of the difficulties that can arise where an insolvent company owns property as a corporate trustee. Care should be taken to carefully review the trust deed on appointment to ensure the trustee retains its powers to sell trust assets.

These trees were introduced by Nievergelt and Reingold in the 1970s as trees of bounded balance, or BB[Œ±] trees. Their more common name is due to Knuth. Like other self-balancing trees, WBTs store bookkeeping information pertaining to balance in their nodes and perform rotations to restore balance when it is disturbed by insertion or deletion operations. Specifically, each node stores the size of the subtree rooted at the node, and the sizes of left and right subtrees are kept within some factor of each other. Unlike the balance information in AVL trees (which store the height of subtrees) and red-black trees (which store a fictional \\"color\\" bit), the bookkeeping information in a WBT is an actually useful property for applications: the number of elements in a tree is equal to the size of its root, and the size information is exactly the information needed to implement the operations of an order statistic tree, viz., getting the 'th largest element in a set or determining an element's index in sorted order. Weight- balanced trees are popular in the functional programming community and are used to implement sets and maps in MIT Scheme, SLIB and implementations of Haskell. Description A weight-balanced tree is a binary search tree that stores the sizes of subtrees in the nodes. That is, a node has fields * key, of any ordered type * value (optional, only for mappings) * left, right, pointer to node * size, of type integer. By definition, the size of a leaf (typically represented by a pointer) is zero. The size of an internal node is the sum of sizes of its two children, plus one (). Based on the size, one defines the weight as . Binary tree rotations. Operations that modify the tree must make sure that the weight of the left and right subtrees of every node remain within some factor of each other, using the same rebalancing operations used in AVL trees: rotations and double rotations. Formally, node balance is defined as follows: :A node is -weight-balanced if and . Here, is a numerical parameter to be determined when implementing weight balanced trees. Larger values of produce \\"more balanced\\" trees, but not all values of are appropriate; Nievergelt and Reingold proved that :\\\\alpha < 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\approx 0.29289 is a necessary condition for the balancing algorithm to work. Later work showed a lower bound of for , although it can be made arbitrarily small if a custom (and more complicated) rebalancing algorithm is used. Applying balancing correctly guarantees a tree of elements will have height :h \\\\le \\\\log_{\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\alpha}} n = \\\\frac{\\\\log_2 n}{\\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\alpha} \\\\right)} = O(\\\\log n) The number of balancing operations required in a sequence of insertions and deletions is linear in , i.e., balancing takes a constant amount of overhead in an amortized sense. While maintaining tree with the minimum search cost requires four kinds of double rotations (LL, LR, RL, RR as in AVL tree) in insert/delete operations, if we desire only logarithmic performance, LR and RL are the only rotations required in a single top-down pass. Set operations and bulk operations Several set operations have been defined on weight-balanced trees: union, intersection and set difference. Then fast bulk operations on insertions or deletions can be implemented based on these set functions. These set operations rely on two helper operations, Split and Join. With the new operations, the implementation of weight-balanced trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable... *Join: The function Join is on two weight- balanced trees and and a key and will return a tree containing all elements in , as well as . It requires to be greater than all keys in and smaller than all keys in . If the two trees have the balanced weight, Join simply create a new node with left subtree , root and right subtree . Suppose that has heavier weight than (the other case is symmetric). Join follows the right spine of until a node which is balanced with . At this point a new node with left child , root and right child is created to replace c. The new node may invalidate the weight-balanced invariant. This can be fixed with a single or a double rotation assuming \\\\alpha < 1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} *Split: To split a weight- balanced tree into two smaller trees, those smaller than key x, and those larger than key x, first draw a path from the root by inserting x into the tree. After this insertion, all values less than x will be found on the left of the path, and all values greater than x will be found on the right. By applying Join, all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree, and the right part is symmetric. For some applications, Split also returns a boolean value denoting if x appears in the tree. The cost of Split is O(\\\\log n), order of the height of the tree. This algorithm actually has nothing to do with any special properties of a weight-balanced tree, and thus is generic to other balancing schemes such as AVL trees. The join algorithm is as follows: function joinRightWB(TL, k, TR) (l,k',c)=expose(TL) if balance(TL, TL) return Node(TL,k,TR else T'=joinRightWB(c,k,TR) (l1,k1,r1)=expose(T') if (balance(l,T')) return Node(l,k'T') else if (balance(l,l1) and balance(l+l1,r1)) return rotateLeft(Node(l,k',T')) else return rotateLeft(Node(l,k',rotateRight(T')) function joinLeftWB(TL, k, TR) /* symmetric to joinRightWB */ function join(TL, k, TR) if (heavy(TL,TR)) return joinRightWB(TL, k, TR) if (heavy(TR,TL)) return joinLeftWB(TL, k, TR) Node(TL,k,TR) Here balance(x,y) means two weights x and y are balanced. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node v's left child l, the key of the node k and the right child r. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child l, key k and right child r. The split algorithm is as follows: function split(T,k) if (T=nil) return (nil,false,nil) (L,(m,c),R)=expose(T) if (k=m) return (L,true,R) if (km) (L',b,R')=split(R,k) return (join(L,m,L'),b,R)) The union of two weight- balanced trees and representing sets and , is a weight-balanced tree that represents . The following recursive function computes this union: function union(t1, t2): if t1 = nil: return t2 if t2 = nil: return t1 t<, t> ‚Üê split t2 on t1.root return join(union(left(t1), t<), t1.root, union(right(t1), t>)) Here, Split is presumed to return two trees: one holding the keys less its input key, one holding the greater keys. (The algorithm is non-destructive, but an in-place destructive version exists as well.) The algorithm for intersection or difference is similar, but requires the Join2 helper routine that is the same as Join but without the middle key. Based on the new functions for union, intersection or difference, either one key or multiple keys can be inserted to or deleted from the weight-balanced tree. Since Split and Union call Join but do not deal with the balancing criteria of weight- balanced trees directly, such an implementation is usually called the join- based algorithms. The complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is O\\\\left(m \\\\log \\\\left({n\\\\over m}+1\\\\right)\\\\right) for two weight-balanced trees of sizes m and n(\\\\ge m). This complexity is optimal in terms of the number of comparisons. More importantly, since the recursive calls to union, intersection or difference are independent of each other, they can be executed in parallel with a parallel depth O(\\\\log m\\\\log n). When m=1, the join-based implementation has the same computational directed acyclic graph (DAG) as single-element insertion and deletion if the root of the larger tree is used to split the smaller tree.

Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court, in which it ruled that a state trespassing statute could not be used to prevent the distribution of religious materials on a town's sidewalk, even though the sidewalk was part of a privately owned company town. The Court based its ruling on the provisions of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment. Background The town of Chickasaw, Alabama, was predominantly a company town near Mobile, Alabama, that was owned and operated by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation (\\"Gulf\\"). The town exhibited the general characteristics of a more traditional settlement. The town's policeman was a deputy from the Mobile County Sheriff's Department who was paid by Gulf. The town was surrounded by a number of adjacent neighborhoods which were not located on Gulf property. The Court noted that the residents of these non-Gulf neighborhoods were freely allowed to use the company-owned streets and sidewalks to access the town's businesses and facilities. The appellant, Grace Marsh, a Jehovah's Witness, stood near the post office one day, where she began distributing religious literature. Marsh was warned that she needed a permit to do so, and that none would be issued to her. When she was asked to leave, she refused on the grounds that the company rules against distribution of such materials could not be constitutionally applied to her. The deputy sheriff arrested her and she was charged with the Alabama criminal code's trespassing equivalent. During her trial, Marsh contended that the statute could not be constitutionally applied to her, as it would necessarily violate her rights under the First and Fourteenth amendments. This contention was rejected and Marsh was convicted. The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that the statute as applied was constitutional because the title to the sidewalk was in the corporation's name. It held that the public use of the sidewalk had not been such as to give rise to a presumption under Alabama law of its irrevocable dedication to the public. After the Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari, and Marsh appealed her case to the United States Supreme Court. Decision In a 5‚Äì3 decision, the court ruled in favor of Marsh. The opinion, joined by three justices, was authored by Justice Hugo Black, with Justice Felix Frankfurter writing a concurrence, and Justice Stanley Forman Reed writing a dissent. The Court initially noted that it would be an easy case if the town were a more traditional, publicly administered, municipality. Then, there would be a clear violation of the right to free speech for the government to bar the sidewalk distribution of such material. The question became, therefore, whether or not constitutional freedom of speech protections could be denied simply because a single company held title to the town. The State attempted to analogize the town's rights to the rights of homeowners to regulate the conduct of guests in their home. The Court rejected that contention, noting that ownership \\"does not always mean absolute dominion.\\" The court pointed out that the more an owner opens his property up to the public in general, the more his rights are circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who are invited in. In its conclusion, the Court stated that it was essentially weighing the rights of property owners against the rights of citizens to enjoy freedom of press and religion. The Court noted that the rights of citizens under the Bill of Rights occupy a preferred position. Accordingly, the Court held that the property rights of a private entity are not sufficient to justify the restriction of a community of citizens' fundamental rights and liberties. =Frankfurter's concurring opinion= Justice Frankfurter concurred in the Court's opinion with one exception. The majority opinion briefly mentioned the Commerce Clause as possibly being analogous to the case's circumstances. In his concurrence, Justice Frankfurter expressed his opinion that it was unnecessary to look to the Commerce Clause for guidance on a First Amendment issue. =Reed's dissenting opinion= Justice Reed introduced his dissent by noting that the Constitutional protections for religion, speech, and press are not absolute or unlimited in respect to the manner or place of their exercise. Furthermore, Reed asserted that property rights, which are also protected by the Constitution, \\"are not outweighed by the interests of the trespasser, even though he trespasses in behalf of religion or free speech.\\" Subsequent history While the Marsh holding at first appears somewhat narrow and inapplicable to the present day due to the disappearance of company towns from the United States, it was raised in the somewhat high-profile 1996 cyberlaw case, Cyber Promotions v. America Online, 948 F. Supp. 436, 442 (E.D. Pa. 1996).Link to Cyber Promotions opinion (.pdf download) Cyber Promotions wished to send out \\"mass email advertisements\\" to AOL customers. AOL installed software to block those emails. Cyber Promotions sued on free speech grounds and cited the Marsh case as authority for the proposition that even though AOL's servers were private property, AOL had opened them to the public to a degree sufficient that constitutional free speech protections could be applied. The federal district court disagreed, thereby paving the way for spam filters at the Internet service provider level. In Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, the Supreme Court distinguished a private shopping mall from the company town in Marsh v. Alabama and held that the mall had not been sufficiently dedicated to public use for First Amendment free speech rights to apply within it. Recently the case has been highlighted as a potential precedent to treat online communication media like Facebook as a public space to prevent it from censoring speech. However, in Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck the Supreme Court found that private companies only count as state actors for first amendment purposes if they exercise ‚Äúpowers traditionally exclusive to the state.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases involving the First Amendment *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 326 References External links * * Category:1946 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Stone Court Category:United States free exercise of religion case law Category:Jehovah's Witnesses litigation in the United States Category:1946 in Alabama Category:Legal history of Alabama Category:Mobile County, Alabama Category:Company towns in Alabama Category:1946 in religion Category:Christianity and law in the 20th century ","title":"Marsh v.

A second-generation leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he belonged to a group of relatively young \\"technocratic\\" leaders who lacked a reasonably strong grassroot political base, although he was fairly popular in his home state. At the time of his death, he was in a power struggle for the leadership of the BJP, given the imminent retirement of its aging top brass. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha and a General Secretary of his party. He contested only two Lok Sabha elections from Mumbai ‚Äì North East constituency. He won in 1996 but lost in 1998. As Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's telecommunications minister between 2001 and 2003, he played a major role in India's cellular revolution. He was widely seen as a successful Parliamentary Affairs minister due to his good relations with members of political parties across the ideological spectrum. On 22 April 2006, he was shot by his brother Pravin Mahajan over a family dispute. He succumbed to his injury 13 days later. Pravin was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment by the court in 2007. Early life Pramod Mahajan was born to Venkatesh Devidas Mahajan and Prabhavati Venkatesh Mahajan in Mahbubnagar, Telangana, India in a Deshastha Brahmin family. The Mahajan family had migrated from their home in Mahajan gully in Osmanabad to Ambajogai and were staying in a rented house in Mangalwar Peth. Mahajan spent his childhood in Ambejogai. He was the second child of his parents, with two brothers Prakash and Pravin, and two sisters Pratibha and Pradnya. His father died when he was 21. He attended Yogeshwari Vidyalaya and Mahavidyalaya in Beed district of Maharashtra and studied at the Ranade Institute for Journalism, Pune. He obtained bachelor's degrees in Physics and Journalism and a post graduate degree in Political Science. He with Gopinath Munde studied in Swami Ramanand Teerth College, Ambajogai, Maharashtra. He passed Maharashtra Certified Typewriting from former Mahajan Typewriting Institute, Ambajogai. His love for theatre brought him close to Rekha Hamine, whom he courted and married on 11 March 1972. They have two children, daughter Poonam and son Rahul Mahajan. Both his children are trained pilots. His daughter is married to Anand Rao Vajendla, an industrialist from Hyderabad. He worked as an English teacher at the Kholeshwar college in Ambejogai between 1971 and 1974 before joining active politics during the emergency. Political career Mahajan was a member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) since childhood, but he actively got involved when he worked as a sub-editor of its Marathi Newspaper, Tarun Bharat in 1970 and 1971. He quit his job as a school teacher and became a full-time RSS pracharak in 1974. He took part in the agitation against the state of emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and was incarcerated in the Nashik central jail until it was lifted. He was one of the select batch of RSS workers co-opted into the BJP and was the general secretary of the party's state unit till 1985. Between 1983 and 1985, he was also the All India Secretary of his party. After unsuccessfully contesting the 1984 Lok Sabha elections, he became the president of the All India Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in 1986, a position he held again between 1990 and 1992. By virtue of his organizational skills and hard work, he rose to a prominent position, first in the Maharashtra state BJP and then at the national level. Mahajan's aspirations were always national, but he also did a significant amount of work in building up his party's fortunes in his home state of Maharashtra. In this, he was partnered with his childhood friend-turned brother-in-law Gopinath Munde (who is married to his sister Pradnya). Mahajan was responsible for his party's alliance with the Shiv Sena. The alliance went on to win the state assembly elections in 1995 and ruled till 1999. Munde was the deputy chief minister in that government. Mahajan came to play a vital role during the coalition era of the late 1980s. He rose to national prominence when he helped organize BJP President Lal Krishna Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990. Despite being credited with responsibility for his party's numerous election victories, Mahajan rarely contested or won popular elections himself. He had been elected to Parliament many times, but mostly through the Rajya Sabha, the indirectly elected upper house. He served in the Rajya Sabha in 1986‚Äì92, 1992‚Äì96, 1998‚Äì2004 and for the last time in 2004. He was elected to the Lok Sabha once in 1996 from Mumbai North East. Government The Lok Sabha elections of 1996 brought the BJP to power and Mahajan was appointed Defence Minister in Vajpayee's 13-day ministry. When the BJP returned to power in 1998, he was first appointed as advisor to the Prime Minister. He resigned from that post and stood for Rajya Sabha elections in July 1998. He won and in December 1998, he was appointed the Minister for Information and Broadcasting, and Food Processing. A year later, in October 1999, he was moved to Parliamentary Affairs and Water Resources. He relinquished Water Resources a month later in November and took charge of Information Technology (in addition to Parliamentary Affairs). In 2001, he was appointed to the Communications ministry under controversial circumstances. The earlier telecom policy of the government, formulated in 1994, had allowed private participation in cellular telephony after open bidding, on payment of a license fee determined through the bidding. However, after winning the contracts the telecom companies found themselves unable to pay the fixed license fees, supposedly because the victors fell victim to the Winner's curse. The then Minister for Communications, Jagmohan attempted tough action against the defaulting companies, but was sacked. After this, Prime Minister Vajpayee himself took over the cabinet portfolio (with Ram Vilas Paswan as minister of state) and oversaw the formulation of the New Telecom Policy of 1999. The policy replaced fixed license fees with a revenue sharing agreement, a move that was widely criticized for changing rules midway and causing loss of revenue to the government. Mahajan, who succeeded to the post in August 2001, after a cabinet reshuffle (that also merged the department of Information technology with the Telecommunications portfolio) had the task of implementing this policy. During his tenure, the number of new telephone connections enjoyed unprecedented growth and rentals fell by a large amount. However, he was also accused of favouring Reliance Infocomm by allowing it to offer full nationwide mobility through WLL without payment of the required license fees. url = http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127004603000.htm  title = Seeking accountability  publisher = Frontline on the net  accessdate = 26 April 2006}} He was also involved in a dispute with the then Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie over the privatization of VSNL. These controversies may have been the reason why he was dropped from the cabinet in the reshuffle of 2003. There was also speculation that he was a casualty of the silent intra-party battle between Vajpayee and Advani . Shourie succeeded him to the Communications portfolio. Mahajan was appointed the General Secretary of the BJP . He contested media speculation that this was a demotion, saying that there were no differences between him and the party and that he had just changed positions from chariot rider to charioteer. = Alleged irregularities as minister of telecom = Mahajan was seen as being close to various lobbyists and corporate houses and there were numerous allegations of financial irregularities during his tenure in the Ministry of Telecom. One of the foremost allegations is his blatant favoring of the Reliance Group in exchange for alleged underhand financial dealings. A relative of Sudhanshu Mittal, a close associate of Pramod Mahajan and his own son-in-law were found to have been one of the beneficiaries benami shares of Reliance Industries being transferred into shell companies. Further, In 2006, Reliance Infocomm offered one crore shares to three companies ‚Äì Prerna Auto, Fairever Traders and Softnet ‚Äì at the rate of Re 1 a share. These three companies are owned by Ashish Deora, the business partner of Rahul Mahajan, Pramod Mahajan's son. The gifting of these shares and allegations of quid pro quo gained prominence in the light of the favouritism shown towards Reliance by Pramod Mahajan when he was the minister for Telecommunications.  Allegations for role in Shivani Bhatnagar's death  Mahajan was accused of orchestrating the murder of former Indian Express journalist Shivani Bhatnagar by Madhu Sharma, the wife of IPS officer Ravi Kant Sharma who was an accused in the murder and in police custody. Bhatnagar was murdered on 23 January 1999. The investigation had gone on for three years and was out of the media spotlight till Sharma's arrest. His motive for the murder, according to the Delhi Police, was that he had fathered Bhatnagar's child and was under pressure from her to marry him. Madhu made statements in the press claiming that it was, in fact, Mahajan who had the affair and was the actual father. She challenged him to a DNA test. Mahajan agreed to take the test but eventually did not as the Delhi Police dismissed Sharma's claim as an emotional outburst as she was unable to provide any concrete evidence in support of her charges. 2003 and 2004 elections Assembly elections were held in four Indian states in December 2003 ‚Äì Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Mahajan was put in charge of Rajasthan. The BJP consciously chose to play down the Hindutva platform. Nonetheless, the elections turned out to be a resounding victory for the BJP, which won in three of the four states. Emboldened by this success, Vajpayee called early elections in 2004 and Mahajan was given charge of the campaign. However, the BJP performed unexpectedly poorly in them, losing power to the Indian National Congress. Mahajan personally accepted responsibility for this defeat. Assassination On the morning of 22 April 2006, Mahajan's estranged younger brother, Pravin shot him with his licensed .32 Browning pistol inside the former's apartment in Mumbai following a dispute. Four bullets were fired. Mahajan was taken to the Hinduja Hospital where he was operated upon. Liver specialist Mohamed flew in from London to treat him.The specialist who will treat Mahajan ‚Äì Rediff News 23 April 2006 After struggling for his life for 13 days, Mahajan suffered from a cardiac arrest and died on 3 May 2006 at 4:10 pm IST. He was given a state funeral at the Shivaji Park crematorium in Dadar, Mumbai on 4 May 2006.State funeral given to Pramod Mahajan Pravin surrendered at the Worli Police Station in Mumbai after the shooting. The police claimed that it was a premeditated attack born out of resentment built up over a long time. Pravin accused his brother of \\"ignoring and humiliating him, and not giving him his due\\". He also felt neglected and suffered from an inferiority complex because he was the poorer younger brother of a much famous elder brother. Pravin was charged with murder under Sec. 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Chargesheet changed from Attempt to Murder to Murder However, Pravin told the court that he had not fired the bullets at his brother. On 18 December 2007, Pravin was sentenced to life imprisonment. Pravin died on 3 March 2010 due to brain haemorrhage.

Because of this structure, it is also known as a hamburger essay, one three one, or a three-tier essay.  Overview  The five-paragraph essay is a form of essay having five paragraphs: * one introductory paragraph, * three body paragraphs with support and development, and * one concluding paragraph. The introduction serves to inform the reader of the basic premises, and then to state the author's thesis, or central idea. A thesis can also be used to point out the subject of each body paragraph. When a thesis essay is applied to this format, the first paragraph typically consists of a narrative hook, followed by a sentence that introduces the general theme, then another sentence narrowing the focus of the one previous. (If the author is using this format for a text-based thesis, then a sentence quoting the text, supporting the essay-writer's claim, would typically go here, along with the name of the text and the name of the author. Example: \\"In the book Night, Elie Wiesel says...\\"). After this, the author narrows the discussion of the topic by stating or identifying a problem. Often, an organizational sentence is used here to describe the layout of the paper. Finally, the last sentence of the first paragraph of such an essay would state the thesis the author is trying to prove. The thesis is often linked to a \\"road map\\" for the essay, which is basically an embedded outline stating precisely what the three body paragraphs will address and giving the items in the order of the presentation. Not to be confused with an organizational sentence, a thesis merely states \\"The book Night follows Elie Wiesel's journey from innocence to experience,\\" while an organizational sentence directly states the structure and order of the essay. Basically, the thesis statement should be proven throughout the essay. In each of the three body paragraphs one or more identified (evidence/fact/etc.) that supports the thesis statement is discussed. And in the conclusion everything is analyzed and summed up. For example, conclusion part in essay about sports: \\"Sports can bring a bunch of benefits for youth, including general health, together with blood circulation and overall physical stamina improvement. Sport develops and improves people‚Äôs physical, social, and organizational skills, which are beneficial in personal and professional life and must always be obtained.\\"  Critique  According to Thomas E. Nunnally and Kimberly Wesley, most teachers and professors consider the five-paragraph form ultimately restricting for fully developing an idea. Wesley argues that the form is never appropriate. Nunnally states that the form can be good for developing analytical skills that should then be expanded. Similarly, American educator David F. Labaree claims that \\"The Rule of Five\\" is \\"dysfunctional... off-putting, infantilising and intellectually arid\\" because demands for the essay's form often obscure its meaning and, therefore, largely automatize creating and reading five-paragraph essays.

Its range is bounded by the eastern coastal foothills, the western foothills of the northern Sierra Nevada and Cascades ranges and from Lake Berryessa in the south to Lake Shasta in the north. Description =Foliage= Taw manroot shares with all marah species non-twining stems and tendrils. Unlike other manroot species, however, Marah watsonii vines are nearly hairless with a glaucous, grey-green color. Vines appear in late winter or early spring in response to increased rainfall, and can climb or scramble to a length of . Unlike the leaves of other manroot species, taw manroot leaves are highly dissected and multi-lobed - reminiscent of jigsaw puzzle pieces. Vines emerge from a large, hard tuberous root which can reach several meters in length and weigh in excess of . Newly exposed tubers can be seen along road-cuts or eroded slopes and have a scaly, tan- colored surface. Injured or decaying tubers take on a golden or orange color. =Flower= Flowers are white. Flowers appear soon after the vine emerges. The flowers are monoecious, that is, individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant. Male flowers appear in open spikes while females flowers, distinguished by a swollen base, usually appear individually and hang down from the axis of the male flower-spike. The plant is self-fertile, i.e. pollen from the male flowers can fertilize the female flowers on the same plant; pollination is by insects. =Fruit= The fruit is spherical to oblong, in diameter, and suspended from a long, wrinkled stem. Taw manroot fruit have fewer and more robust, hornlike spikes than other manroot species with the spikes tapering to smooth ridges at the bottom of the fruit. Some plants have smooth fruit with dark green veins running from top to bottom. Unripe fruit are light green, sometimes with faint dark green stripes, ripening to yellow. Fruit begin to form in spring and ripen as the vine dies from the heat and drought of late spring/early summer. The fruit swells as it ripens until finally rupturing and expelling the large seeds. In more moist areas, the vine may stay green until after fruit have ruptured. =Seeds and germination= Marah watsonii seeds are more spherical than other manroot species. Fruits usually hold four or more of these large seeds. Seeds have an unusual germination process. The initial shoot emerges from the seed and grows downward into the earth. This shoot then splits, one part beginning to swell and form the tuber, while the second part grows back to the surface and becomes the vine. Habitat Taw manroot grows most vigorously by streams or in washes but can also be successful in dryer areas, at elevations up to . It will tolerate a variety of soil types and acidities, but it requires at least seasonally moist soil. Vines can grow in full-sun to heavily shaded conditions. Vines die back in summer and emerge in late winter. Uses All parts of the plant have a bitter taste (this is the meaning of the genus name Marah, which comes from Hebrew). Despite this, the leaves have been used as a vegetable. The large tuber of the manroot can be processed for a soap-like extract.

The genus is named in honor of orchid collector and grower M. Houllet, French orchid collector in Brazil, later the director of the Botanic Jardin des Plantes in Paris, 19th century  Environment  They are found growing epiphytically and terrestrially on embankments in cool, humid, wet areas, 1,000-2,200 m elevation.  Classification and description  Gerlach (1999) places the genus Houlletia within the \\"Acineta-Verwandtschaftsgruppe,\\" allied with Acineta, Lueddemannia and Vasqueziella within the larger Stanhopeinae Alliance. Whitten, Williams, and Chase distinguish the Houlletia clade among the Stanhopeinae, comprising Horichia, Houlletia, Paphinia, Schlimmia, and Trevoria. They write: \\"As presently defined, Houlletia consists of two morphologically distinct groups. The group containing H. brockelhurstiana (the type species), H. tigrina, H. odoratissima (Linden ex Lindl.), and H. juruenensis (Hoehne) have open, resupinate flowers that are heavily spotted in red-brown. The epichile is triangular and the hypochile bears a pair of curved, acute projections; the lip shares many features of the lip of Paphinia. The viscidium is narrow, approximately the same width of the long stipe, and the pollinaria are deposited on the bee's scutellum. In contrast, the group containing H. sanderi, H. wallisii, H. clarae (Schltr.), and H. lowiana (Rchb.f). has globose, nonresupinate flowers that are white to yellow, mostly unspotted, and borne on an erect inflorescence. The epichile is rectangular or ovate (not triangular), and the lateral projections on the hypochile are broad instead of acute. The pollinarium has a broad, concave viscidium.\\" The plants have ovoid, ridged pseudobulbs, each bearing 2-4 large, pleated leaves. The inflorescences begin from the base of the pseudobulbs and are always pendant, with fleshy, showy flowers hanging downward (\\"nodding\\") on a simple raceme. The dorsal sepal is free and the lateral sepals form a short mentum with the column foot. The petals are similar to the dorsal sepal but smaller. The lip is deeply 3-lobed, the lateral lobes are upcurved and the mid-lobe is spreading. The anther is imperfectly two-celled and there are two waxy pollinia, cleft, with viscidium and a prominent stipe. Note that in 1999, E. Luckel & H. Fessel published the new genus Jennyella \\"to accommodate the globose, white flowered taxa.\\" They segregate four species previously attributed to Houlletia into the new genus Jennyella: H. clarae (Schlechter 1924); H. kalbreyeriana (Kraenzlin 1920); H. lowiana (Rchb. f.); and H. sanderi (Rolfe 1910).

This distinctive sound was created by singer and producer Guille Milkyway, who also writes the band's songs. La Casa Azul release their records on the indie-pop label Elefant.

The high school originally shared buildings with Bradford Avenue Elementary School until 1964, when Bradford Elementary closed and Valencia High School became the sole occupant of the campus property. Until 1967, when El Dorado High School was built, Valencia was Placentia's only high school. Valencia High School is located at 500 North Bradford Avenue; coordinates 33.87622,-117.86929. Many of Valencia's buildings, including the auditorium and cafeteria, were built during the Depression by the WPA. Today the school serves a student body of approximately 2,501 students. It is one of four high schools in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District (PYLUSD). Beginning in the summer of 2010, Valencia underwent a series of renovations and construction projects, including a new 17-classroom building, modernized school breezeway and administration building, and new bleachers at Bradford Stadium. A modernized \\"quad\\" was also among the list of projects, serving as a center of campus life and a common location of school activities. Funding for these improvements was provided by Measure A, which was approved by local voters in 2008. Valencia is the International Baccalaureate (IB) magnet school in PYLUSD. The school's website claims it is one of the best IB programs in Orange County, CA. The school also hosts an advanced technology program called Val Tech, in which students must complete an internship during the summer between their junior and senior years. The school's mascot is the Tiger, and its team colors are blue and gold. Kraemer Middle School is almost part of the campus, with only a long skinny parking lot separating the two.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 10, 2011 stream in Lake, Colusa and Yolo counties, California. Course Cache Creek starts at the outlet of Clear Lake. It has two main tributaries: North Fork (starting in the Mendocino National Forest north of Clear Lake, and dammed by the Indian Valley Reservoir); and Bear Creek (starting in Bear Valley). The Capay Diversion Dam, west of Capay, diverts water for distribution throughout Yolo County using a network of canals. At the end of the Capay Valley, near Esparto, Cache Creek runs east into Sacramento Valley, ending in a settling basin east of Woodland, the overflow of which runs into the Sacramento River through a flood control canal. In addition to the recreational use of Clear Lake and Indian Valley Reservoir there are numerous trail-heads, parks and campgrounds, including the Bear Valley wildflower hotspot. Bear Creek and Cache Creek run in a scenic canyon along State Route 16 in Colusa and Yolo county, including the Cache Creek Regional Park. Cache Creek provides white- water rafting, both in the spring when it is flooded, and through the summer using the agricultural water flow. The entire area south of Route 20 and west of Route 16 is a wildlife preserve, hosting two herds of Tule Elk. History The name of the water body comes from Hudson's Bay Company trappers who cached their furs along the Sacramento River and smaller tributaries, one of which became known to them as Cache Creek. One of their camps, recognized by early settlers as French Camp, was situated in a grove of oaks on the north bank of Cache Creek one mile (1.6 km) east of the present town of Yolo, California. Cache Creek was originally known to the Hudson's Bay Company trappers as Rivi√®re la Cache.http://www.pa-roots.com/~yolo/maps/locations1.html#C pa- roots.com Cache Creek was temporarily blocked north of Rumsey by a landslide caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake : Our Rumsey correspondent mentions the fall of Cache Creek as a result of an earthquake shock Tuesday night. The water has continued to fall some since that date and in some places it is dry. Upon investigation by the officials of the Water Company it was found that a landslide had dammed the Creek near the Leonard ranch in Lake county....http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~meltzner/1906/1906-OFR.pdf The creek subsequently broke through, causing severe flooding in Rumsey.http://www.yolocountyhistory.com/items/show/2554 Damage caused at the Rumsey Depot Caused by 1906 earthquake and resulting flood. The earthquake created a rock slide which blocked cache creek. The resulting floodwaters washed out the Rumsey Depot. Several damaged buildings are visible in the picture.http://www.yolocountyhistory.com/items/show/2555 .. Trees have been toppled over and are being pushed downstream by the floodwaters. From 1800s to the mid 1900s, mercury was mined free of environmental regulation causing an influx of the element within Cache Creek. In 2001, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board and the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed that Cache Creek was a contributor to the increase of mercury levels within the Sacramento River. Since then, various regulations have been enacted to monitor the mercury levels in Cache Creek, and multiple studies have been conducted to find the site of contamination. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment released an advisory regarding eating fish caught from this creek based on the mercury level. Geography Cache Creek has two main tributaries: North Fork, and Bear Creek. Cache Creek begins at the south-east end of Clear Lake (for which it is the outlet), flowing east to the dam which now controls the level of Clear Lake. The North Fork begins in Lake County in the Mendocino National Forest north of Upper Lake. It flows east, where it is joined by Bartlett Creek, and is then dammed by the Indian Valley Reservoir. It then flows south along New Long Valley Road, and turns east along State Route 20, which it crosses at the Cache Creek Recreation Area. Cache Creek runs north-east from the dam, behind Perkins Creek Ridge and over The Jams Waterfall before joining the North Fork about 2 miles east of the bridge over Route 20. Bear Creek starts in Bear Valley and runs south through a canyon (joining Sulphur Creek near Wilbur Springs) until it meets Route 20. It then runs east in parallel with Route 20 for a few miles, and turns south, again cutting through a canyon following State Route 16 in Colusa and Yolo Counties. Meanwhile, Cache Creek cuts south-east between Cache Creek Ridge (on its north bank) and Little Blue Ridge (south bank), joining Bear Creek at Route 16 near the junction of Lake, Colusa and Yolo counties. The combined Cache Creek continues in the canyon until it emerges north of Rumsey in Capay Valley. The Capay Diversion Dam, west of Capay, diverts water for distribution throughout Yolo County using a 175-mile (280 km) network of canals. At the end of the Capay Valley near Esparto Cache Creek runs east into Sacramento Valley, ending in a settling basin east of Woodland. If the Sacramento river is not in flood then any overflow runs into the Tule Canal, continues as Prospect Slough and finally enters the Sacramento River at Cache Slough. If the Sacramento is in flood, then the overflow from the settling basin is swept into the Yolo Bypass and Sacramento Bypass flood control system, emerging directly at Cache Slough. Hydrology Cache Creek, in a canyon with native chaparral and woodlands habitat vegetation, in Lake County, northern California Water rights and flooding protection have been in dispute between Yolo and Lake Counties since the late 19th century. The Yolo County Flood Control & Water Conservation District (\\"Yolo\\") has \\"an 1855 priority right to divert the natural flow of Cache Creek, and 1912 priority right to store waters in Clear Lake to elevation 7.56 feet Rumsey Gauge for later release and beneficial use.\\" Various decrees attempt to ensure a balance between the needs of the two counties, although high-water conditions can cause temporary disagreements. Under the Solano Decree Yolo currently holds appropriative rights for up to per year from Clear Lake, and all the water from the Indian Valley dam. The Cache Creek Dam on the South Fork of Cache Creek, five miles (8 km) downstream from Clear Lake, was built to increase Clear Lake's capacity and to regulate outflow for downstream users of Cache Creek water. The dam was later modified to include a 3 MW hydroelectric plant. The stream has a relatively small capacity, less than a quarter of the amount the dam is able to release. There is a rock ledge a mile and a half downstream of Clear Lake, called the Grigsby Riffle, near the bridge on State Route 53. This ledge restricts the amount of water that can flow through at that point. The limited capacity of the stream means that it takes a very long time to drain excess flow from Clear Lake, increasing the chance of flooding around the lake. The bottleneck is seen as a backup to prevent flooding downstream and Yolo County is prohibited from increasing the capacity of the channel by the Gopcevic and Bemmerly Decrees. The Indian Valley dam on the North Fork of Cache Creek forms Indian Valley Reservoir. The dam's primary purpose is water storage for irrigation, but a 3.3 MW hydroelectric plant was built to take advantage of the falling water. The Capay Diversion Dam, west of Capay, diverts water for distribution throughout Yolo County using a 175-mile (280 km) network of canals. For example, water is pumped into the Winters Canal, which runs south and ends in a reservoir near Winters. This feeds into Willows Canal, which runs east for miles alongside Putah Creek‚Äîthe water of which is used primarily by Solano County. The 474 foot long, 15 foot high concrete dam was constructed in 1914. In 1994 its apron was raised with a 5-foot high inflatable bladder (the \\"longest in the world\\"), which can be raised or lowered in 30 minutes. It underwent substantial repairs starting in 2009.  Mercury levels at Cache Creek  From the early 1800s to much of the 1900s, mining for elemental mercury, also known as Quicksilver, was widely popular in Cache Creek's upper watershed, given its gold recovering properties. At the peak of mercury production, over 6 million pounds (2.7 million kg) of mercury were mined, creating large mining caverns across the entirety of California. Throughout this period, little to no environmental regulations had been established causing mercury, in the form of mining waste from retorting, to infiltrate water systems and make its way into Cache Creek . Through a process known as bio-accumulation, the integration of mercury into the creek caused increased levels of the element in organisms within the creek. If consumed, accumulation of high mercury levels within organisms, particularity fish, may induce harm to the nervous systems of unborn babies and young children. Water quality studies conducted by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board and the U.S. Geological Survey from 1994-2001 confirmed Cache Creek as a major source contributing to mercury level spikes in the Sacramento River. Since then, multiple studies have been conducted to pinpoint the mines that are still releasing quicksilver, and the course the element has traveled to measure the extent of the issue.Slotton, D. (2017).\\"Lower Cache Creek Off- Channel Pits Mercury Monitoring Protocols\\" University of California, Davis.\\"Cache Creek, Bear Creek, and Harley Gulch TMDL for Mercury\\" 2004. California Environmental Protection Agency In 2004, the California Environmental Protection Agency published a staff report that acknowledged the continued increase of mercury in Cache Creek, and determined that 12 percent of the source were old mercury mines located near major tributaries such as: North Fork Cache Creek, Clear Lake outflow, Bear Creek, Harley Gulch, and Davis Creek. Reports like this led to protocols set in place to monitor the mercury levels within Cache Creek and warn the public of possible health concerns from fish consumption. In 2017, The Department of Environmental Science and Policy from UC Davis, in consultation with The Yolo County Cache Creek Technical Advisory Committee, proposed revisions to the existing protocols. The revision proposal called for yearly monitoring of off channel wet pits for five years, given they may explain additional sources of mercury within the creek. As well as a monitoring of these pits every other year for 10 years once the reclamation process is completed Wildlife and recreation A large part of the creek within Lake County is designated a Wildlife Area by the state of California and the federal Bureau of Land Management, on which vehicles are prohibited but hiking, primitive camping, and hunting are allowed. The North Fork and Bear Creek each host a growing population of the rare tule elk, plus winter populations of bald eagles. The ruggedness of the area tends to ensure its isolation from human activity. In 2006 the United States Congress designated 27,245 acres (110 km2) of the area as the federally protected Cache Creek Wilderness. Cache Creek Conservancy has restored a 130-acre Cache Creek Nature Preserve area downstream in the watershed. Whitewater boating on Cache Creek includes kayaking, rafting, canoeing and innertubing which are popular in the summer using the water released from the dams for downstream agriculture. Nominally a tributary of the Sacramento River, Cache Creek now only reaches it during extremely wet years due to damming and diversion of the stream's water. Degradation of the channel caused by invasive plants, such as Arundo donax and Tamarix spp., as well as gravel mining has left no suitable habitat for Chinook salmon and steelhead to spawn, even if there is enough water. Consequently, there are no longer any anadromous fish species in Cache Creek. State Wild and Scenic River Cache Creek was added to California's Wild and Scenic Rivers System in October 2005 which protects of the river from construction of new dams or diversions. Assembly member Lois Wolk introduced AB 1328 in 2005 which received support as well as opposition. New dam construction on Cache Creek was being considered in 2002 by the Yolo County Water District, the agency that had built the Indian Valley Dam and the present dam on Cache Creek.

Completed in 1989, it is now occupied by the City of Greater Geelong The Pyramid Building Society, the Geelong Building Society and the Countrywide Building Society together made up the Farrow Group of building societies, based in Geelong, Australia. The group collapsed in 1990 with debts in excess of $2 billion. The cost of the collapse to Victoria taxpayers was estimated at over $900 million. A fuel levy of 3c-per-litre was introduced by the Victorian Government to recompense depositors. Origins Pyramid was established in Geelong in 1959 by Vautin Andrews and Bob Farrow. Andrews was later mayor of Geelong, and Farrow was an accountant whose firm managed the society. When legislation changed in the mid-1960s to allow building societies to take deposits from the public, Pyramid grew rapidly. Bob Farrow's health suffered in the late 1970s and his son Bill Farrow took over much of the operation, and Andrews' son Bruce Andrews also worked for the society. Pyramid took over its competitor, the Geelong Building Society, in 1971. That society had origins going back to 1867 and had been operated very conservatively. In 1983, the rules for the Pyramid and Geelong building societies were changed to allow shares, representing ownership of the societies, to be issued. The Farrow Group, controlled by the Farrow family, asserted that, as managers, they should receive most of them. After the collapse of the Farrow Group, the basis for this assertion was disputed, but Farrow ended up as owner of a substantial business for a very modest outlay of money. In 1984, the Farrow Group also took over the small Third Extended Starr-Bowkett Building Society and renamed it the Countrywide Building Society. At the time of the group's collapse, it was headed by Bill Farrow and former Geelong Football Club player David Clarke.  Collapse  Flyer advertising interest rates available to customers in November 1986 In early 1990, a run on Pyramid began. The reason for that was never established, though it was suspected some rumours might have been started by rival institutions. On 13 February 1990, the state treasurer Rob Jolly and attorney general Andrew McCutcheon held a press conference and assured the public that Pyramid was sound. In fact, Pyramid wasn't sound, but its rapid expansion had taken Pyramid well beyond the regulatory capabilities of the Registrar of Building Societies in Victoria. After the run, Pyramid mounted an advertising campaign to attract more deposits, offering markedly higher interest rates than competitors. Behind the scenes it was borrowing money, selling assets, and trying to find a merger partner. The group's value was in the branch network and strong customer loyalty, but the question was how many bad loans it was carrying. A second run of withdrawals began in May 1990. The Cain Government tried unsuccessfully to negotiate the sale of the Pyramid Group to one of the Big Four banks, believed to have been Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. In June, withdrawals were suspended for a week and an administrator appointed. On 1 July 1990, the administrator reported that the societies had to be wound up. On the morning of 3 July, the premier affirmed that here was no government guarantee, but it was later announced that ordinary depositors would be recompensed by way of a three-cents-a-litre government levy on the sale of petrol, which remained in force for five years.  Regulation  Building societies in Victoria were regulated by the Registrar of Building Societies, a position held at that time by David Lafranchi, who had formerly headed the Cooperatives and Societies Division of the Corporate Affairs Department. However, his office lacked both legislative powers (under the Building Societies Act 1986) and sufficient staff to supervise 250 deposit-taking institutions. If the registrar discovered that a society was in difficulty, the only real power available was to order a merger with another society. Yet by the time Pyramid was in trouble, the conversion of the RESI Statewide Building Society to the Bank of Melbourne had left the Farrow Group with about 55% of the Victorian building society market, meaning there was no other society big enough to make a merger possible. This situation in Victoria was a little unusual. When runs of withdrawals had threatened building societies in the 1970s, they got together to form an Australia-wide National Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect depositors, with standby credit and minimum prudential ratios for member societies to observe. The Victorian government of the time had chosen not to participate in that scheme, believing the government could regulate and supervise societies.  Bad loans  The vast majority of the losses suffered by the Farrow Group had been from ventures into commercial property, frequently lending aggressively to speculative projects. Doubtful loans were hidden in the books by various techniques, such as capitalising fees and interest into the loan balance, changing the loan conditions, or even selling the property into a subsidiary company for a price that covered the debt. Staff were paid a commission on new lending business, which is proper enough, but also for improving bad loans, which gave them an incentive to rearrange the affairs of borrowers who were in default. The Farrow Group also operated on much smaller net interest margin (the difference between interest received from borrowers and paid to depositors or wholesale lenders) than other finance groups. That was a deliberate strategy, set out by Bill Farrow in the group's 1986 annual report. He expected deregulation to force down what had traditionally been quite wide margins, to be replaced by an emphasis on fees for services. That analysis was correct, but in accepting small spreads the group was particularly vulnerable if bad loans reduced its effective interest income.  Non-withdrawable shareholders  Pyramid had offered to customers a class of \\"non-withdrawable investing shares\\" which paid interest like a time deposit, but at a higher interest rate. Many customers who took them up were apparently unaware of the distinction between shares and deposits, and staff were paid commissions for selling the shares so were presumably not particularly motivated to make the difference clear. Those shares ranked behind depositors in a wind-up, so after the collapse those shareholders stood to receive nothing at all. Their plight dragged on for a very long time. In 1992 they had a setback when the Victorian Supreme Court confirmed that they ranked behind depositors. One of the holders, Phillip Lauren, then sued the government and ministers on the basis he had been misled by their advice to keep his money in, and a group of the shareholders marched on state parliament in September 1992. When the government changed the new treasurer Alan Stockdale was also not inclined to rank the non-withdrawable shareholders with depositors. In fact he was even less sympathetic than Cain's government had been, believing Cain shouldn't even have guaranteed the ordinary deposits. Depositors returns Depositors with funds in the building society retrieved 51 cents in the dollar - $614 million returned for $1.21 billion invested. The final cheques were sent in March 2005. Subsequent Events In 2003, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade awarded a grant of $90,000 to Geelong-based company, World Wide Entertainment, headed by former Farrow Group head, Bill Farrow. On 23 March 2008, Warren Meyer, a former bankrupt who owed $2.3M to the Pyramid Building Society, went missing on a bushwalk, although it was believed that he might have been killed by deer hunters. Another business venture headed by Bill Farrow, a media company named Switch, collapsed in February 2015, owing over $0.5M, due to \\"poor financial control including a lack of records and trading losses\\".

The approach was to take established techniques, as found in methods such as the Object-modeling technique and Booch method, and reposition and refine them. In recognition that graphical notations were much favoured by the market but lacked rigour, Syntropy adopted ideas from formal specification languages, specifically Z notation, to provide tools for both precise definition of the graphical notations and for the construction of richer models than are possible with pictures alone. Although development on the Syntropy method stopped some years ago, many of its ideas were subsequently incorporated in the Unified Modeling Language, in the Catalysis software design method, and in other development processes. In particular, Syntropy is a direct ancestor of the Object Constraint Language that forms an integral part of the UML.

Affine spaces differ from linear spaces (that is, vector spaces) in that they do not have a distinguished choice of origin. So, in the words of Marcel Berger, \\"An affine space is nothing more than a vector space whose origin we try to forget about, by adding translations to the linear maps.\\"* Accordingly, a complex affine space, that is an affine space over the complex numbers, is like a complex vector space, but without a distinguished point to serve as the origin. Affine geometry is one of the two main branches of classical algebraic geometry, the other being projective geometry. A complex affine space can be obtained from a complex projective space by fixing a hyperplane, which can be thought of as a hyperplane of ideal points \\"at infinity\\" of the affine space. To illustrate the difference (over the real numbers), a parabola in the affine plane intersects the line at infinity, whereas an ellipse does not. However, any two conic sections are projectively equivalent. So a parabola and ellipse are the same when thought of projectively, but different when regarded as affine objects. Somewhat less intuitively, over the complex numbers, an ellipse intersects the line at infinity in a pair of points while a parabola intersects the line at infinity in a single point. So, for a slightly different reason, an ellipse and parabola are inequivalent over the complex affine plane but remain equivalent over the (complex) projective plane. Any complex vector space is an affine space: all one needs to do is forget the origin (and possibly any additional structure such as an inner product). For example, the complex n-space \\\\mathbb C^n can be regarded as a complex affine space, when one is interested only in its affine properties (as opposed to its linear or metrical properties, for example). Since any two affine spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic, in some situations it is appropriate to identify them with \\\\mathbb C^n, with the understanding that only affinely- invariant notions are ultimately meaningful. This usage is very common in modern algebraic geometry. Affine structure There are several equivalent ways to specify the affine structure of an n-dimensional complex affine space A. The simplest involves an auxiliary space V, called the difference space, which is a vector space over the complex numbers. Then an affine space is a set A together with a simple and transitive action of V on A. (That is, A is a V-torsor.) Another way is to define a notion of affine combination, satisfying certain axioms. An affine combination of points is expressed as a sum of the form :a_1\\\\mathbf p_1+\\\\cdots+a_k\\\\mathbf p_k where the scalars are complex numbers that sum to unity. The difference space can be identified with the set of \\"formal differences\\" , modulo the relation that formal differences respect affine combinations in an obvious way. =Affine functions= A function is called affine if it preserves affine combinations. So :f(a_1\\\\mathbf p_1+\\\\cdots+a_k\\\\mathbf p_k)=a_1f(\\\\mathbf p_1)+\\\\cdots+a_kf(\\\\mathbf p_k) for any affine combination :a_1\\\\mathbf p_1+\\\\cdots+a_k\\\\mathbf p_k in A. The space of affine functions is a linear space. The dual vector space of is naturally isomorphic to an (n+1)-dimensional vector space which is the free vector space on A modulo the relation that affine combination in A agrees with affine combination in . Via this construction, the affine structure of the affine space A can be recovered completely from the space of affine functions. The algebra of polynomials in the affine functions on A defines a ring of functions, called the affine coordinate ring in algebraic geometry. This ring carries a filtration, by degree in the affine functions. Conversely, it is possible to recover the points of the affine space as the set of algebra homomorphisms from the affine coordinate ring into the complex numbers. This is called the maximal spectrum of the ring, because it coincides with its set of maximal ideals. There is a unique affine structure on this maximal spectrum that is compatible with the filtration on the affine coordinate ring.  Low- dimensional examples  =One dimension= A one-dimensional complex affine space, or complex affine line, is a torsor for a one-dimensional linear space over \\\\mathbb C. The simplest example is the Argand plane of complex numbers \\\\mathbb C itself. This has a canonical linear structure, and so \\"forgetting\\" the origin gives it a canonical affine structure. For another example, suppose that X is a two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers. Let \\\\alpha:\\\\mathbf X\\\\to\\\\mathbb C be a linear functional. It is well known that the set of solutions of , the kernel of , is a one-dimensional linear subspace (that is, a complex line through the origin of X). But if c is some non-zero complex number, then the set A of solutions of is an affine line in X, but it is not a linear subspace because it is not closed under arbitrary linear combination. The difference space V is the kernel of , because the difference of two solutions of the inhomogeneous equation lies in the kernel. An analogous construction applies to the solution of first order linear ordinary differential equations. The solutions of the homogeneous differential equation :y'(x) + \\\\mu(x)y(x) = 0 is a one-dimensional linear space, whereas the set of solutions of the inhomogeneous problem :y'(x) + \\\\mu(x)y(x) = f(x) is a one- dimensional affine space A. The general solution is equal to a particular solution of the equation, plus a solution of the homogeneous equation. The space of solutions of the homogeneous equation is the difference space V. Consider once more the general the case of a two-dimensional vector space X equipped with a linear form . An affine space A(c) is given by the solution . Observe that, for two difference non-zero values of c, say and , the affine spaces and are naturally isomorphic: scaling by maps to . So there is really only one affine space worth considering in this situation, call it A, whose points are the lines through the origin of X that do not lie on the kernel of . Algebraically, the complex affine space A just described is the space of splittings of the exact sequence :0\\\\to\\\\ker\\\\alpha\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\subseteq}X\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\alpha}\\\\mathbb C\\\\to 0. =Two dimensions= A complex affine plane is a two-dimensional affine space over the complex numbers. An example is the two-dimensional complex coordinate space \\\\mathbb C^2. This has a natural linear structure, and so inherits an affine structure under the forgetful functor. Another example is the set of solutions of a second-order inhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equation (over the complex numbers). Finally, in analogy with the one- dimensional case, the space of splittings of an exact sequence :0\\\\to\\\\mathbb C^2\\\\to\\\\mathbb C^3\\\\to\\\\mathbb C\\\\to 0 is an affine space of dimension two. =Four dimensions= The conformal spin group of the Lorentz group is SU(2,2), which acts on a four dimensional complex vector space T (called twistor space). The conformal Poincare group, as a subgroup of SU(2,2), stabilizes an exact sequence of the form :0\\\\to\\\\Pi\\\\to\\\\mathbf T\\\\to \\\\Omega\\\\to 0 where Œ† is a maximal isotropic subspace of T. The space of splittings of this sequence is a four-dimensional affine space: (complexified) Minkowski space. Affine coordinates Let A be an n-dimensional affine space. A collection of n affinely independent affine functions z_1,z_2,\\\\dots,z_n:\\\\mathbf A\\\\to \\\\mathbb C is an affine coordinate system on A. An affine coordinate system on A sets up a bijection of A with the complex coordinate space \\\\mathbb C^n, whose elements are n-tuples of complex numbers. Conversely, \\\\mathbb C^n is sometimes referred to as complex affine n-space, where it is understood that it is its structure as an affine space (as opposed, for instance, to its status as a linear space or as a coordinate space) that is of interest. Such a usage is typical in algebraic geometry.  Associated projective space  A complex affine space A has a canonical projective completion P(A), defined as follows. Form the vector space F(A) which is the free vector space on A modulo the relation that affine combination in F(A) agrees with affine combination in A. Then , where n is the dimension of A. The projective completion of A is the projective space of one-dimensional complex linear subspaces of F(A).  Structure group and automorphisms  The group acts on P(A). The stabilizer of the hyperplane at infinity is a parabolic subgroup, which is the automorphism group of A. It is isomorphic (but not naturally isomorphic) to a semidirect product of the group and V. The subgroup is the stabilizer of some fixed reference point o (an \\"origin\\") in A, acting as the linear automorphism group of the space of vector emanating from o, and V acts by translation. The automorphism group of the projective space as an algebraic variety is none other than the group of collineations . In contrast, the automorphism group of the affine space A as an algebraic variety is much larger. For example, consider the self-map of the affine plane defined in terms of a pair of affine coordinates by :(z_1,z_2)\\\\mapsto (z_1,z_2+f(z_1)) where f is a polynomial in a single variable. This is an automorphism of the algebraic variety, but not an automorphism of the affine structure. The Jacobian determinant of such an algebraic automorphism is necessarily a non-zero constant. It is believed that if the Jacobian of a self-map of a complex affine space is non-zero constant, then the map is an (algebraic) automorphism. This is known as the Jacobian conjecture.  Complex structure  A function on complex affine space is holomorphic if its complex conjugate is Lie derived along the difference space V. This gives any complex affine space the structure of a complex manifold. Every affine function from A to the complex numbers is holomorphic. Hence, so is every polynomial in affine functions.  Topologies  There are two topologies on a complex affine space that are commonly used. The analytic topology is the initial topology for the family of affine functions into the complex numbers, where the complex numbers carry their usual Euclidean topology induced by the complex absolute value as norm. This is also the initial topology for the family of holomorphic functions. The analytic topology has a base consisting of polydiscs. Associated to any n independent affine functions z_1,\\\\dots,z_n:\\\\mathbf A\\\\to \\\\mathbb C on A, the unit polydisc is defined by : B ( z_1 , \\\\dots , z_n ) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{z} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\, : \\\\,  z_1 ( \\\\mathbf z )  < 1 , \\\\dots,  z_n ( \\\\mathbf z )  < 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Any open set in the analytic topology is the union of a countable collection of unit polydiscs. The Zariski topology is the initial topology for the affine complex-valued functions, but giving the complex line the finite-complement topology instead. So in the Zariski topology, a subset of A is closed if and only if it is the zero set of some collection of complex-valued polynomial functions on A. A subbase of the Zariski topology is the collection of complements of irreducible algebraic sets. The analytic topology is finer than the Zariski topology, meaning that every set that is open in the Zariski topology is also open in the analytic topology. The converse is not true. A polydisc, for example, is open in the analytic topology but not the Zariski topology. A metric can be defined on a complex affine space, making it a Euclidean space, by selecting an inner product on V. The distance between two points p and q of A is then given in terms of the associated norm on V by :d(\\\\mathbf p , \\\\mathbf q) = \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf p - \\\\mathbf q \\\\right\\\\ . The open balls associated to the metric form a basis for a topology, which is the same as the analytic topology.  Sheaf of analytic functions  The family of holomorphic functions on a complex affine space A forms a sheaf of rings on it. By definition, such a sheaf associates to each (analytic) open subset U of A the ring \\\\mathcal{O}(U) of all complex-valued holomorphic functions on U. The uniqueness of analytic continuation says that given two holomorphic functions on a connected open subset U of Cn, if they coincide on a nonempty open subset of U, they agree on U. In terms of sheaf theory, the uniqueness implies that \\\\mathcal{O}, when viewed as √©tal√© space, is a Hausdorff topological space. Oka's coherence theorem states that the structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O} of a complex affine space is coherent. This is the fundamental result in the function theory of several complex variables; for instance it immediately implies that the structure sheaf of a complex-analytic space (e.g., a complex manifold) is coherent. Every complex affine space is a domain of holomorphy. In particular, it is a Stein manifold.

History =Membership= Singer Doug Levy and guitarist Matt Friedlander met while the latter was a student at New York University. The two had similar tastes in music and favorite bands. Groups such as Oasis, The Verve, Doves and The Stone Roses were shared favorites, and inspired much of The GoStation's music. The two began writing songs together and joined with original drummer Joel Frost (whom Friedlander knew from a band they were previously in together, The Stamps). Bassist Nick Picozzi followed shortly after, along with original rhythm guitar player Alex Koch (who went on to front his own band, The Walkup). When Koch left, the band briefly continued as a quartet. Frost left the band in late 2005, and the group brought in new drummer Justin Aaronson (formerly of Surefire) and Erik Nyquist on rhythm guitar. This is the lineup that recorded the band's debut album, Passion Before Function, released on Edge Delay records. In 2007, Justin Aaronson left the band being replaced by Vin Russoniello. The members at the time of the band's breakup were: Doug Levy (vocals), Matt Friedlander (guitars, vocals), Nick Picozzi (bass guitar), Erik Nyquist (guitars, vocals) and Vin Russoniello (drums). =Performances and recordings= The GoStation began playing concerts in and around NYC in the summer of 2003. Their first show was at one of New York's most prestigious rock clubs at the time, The Knitting Factory. Their first release, Quiet Zone, was a 5-song EP released on July 2, 2005 on Edge Delay Records. The band's debut album, Passion Before Function was released on September 25, 2007 in the U.S. through Edge Delay Records. It was also released in Japan on July 18, 2007, through Fabtone Records. The final official release from the GoStation was a non-album single, \\"Berlin Rose,\\" recorded with legendary producer Jack Douglas. The B-side was a studio version of the band's cover of \\"True Faith\\" by New Order, which also featured as a bonus track on the Japanese release of Passion Before Function.

Formed in 1872, the railway company was managed by the Government of Tasmania, and existed until absorption into the Australian National Railways Commission in 1978. History The early railways of Tasmania were initially constructed by a number of private companies, each using a differing gauge. In 1871, the Launceston and Western Railway (L&WR;) opened the first railway line in Tasmania, with a line from Launceston to Deloraine. The Tasmanian Main Line Railway Company (TMLR) later opened their Hobart to Evandale line in 1876, to a . Because of the break-of- gauge, the TMLR laid a third rail upon the L&WR; line, and operated dual gauge for the final to Launceston. The Tasmanian Government Railways had already been established in 1872 after progressively taking over failed railway companies across the state, and as financial issues toiled the larger railway companies, the TGR took over the L&WR; in 1888 and the TMLR in 1890, thus creating an official public railway service in Tasmania. As a result of this takeover, all Tasmanian railways were relaid or newly constructed in gauge. In 1938, the railway administration was absorbed into the newly created Transport Commission and became its Railway Branch. The Commission was empowered to co- ordinate and improve land transport within the State, and one of its policies was to encourage the use of the railway wherever possible. The TGR published an occasional newsletter, T'Rails during the early 1970s. In 1978 the Tasmanian government took up an offer by the Whitlam Federal Government to take over the state-owned railways, which resulted in the TGR being absorbed into the new Australian National Railways Commission, operating as Tasrail. =Centenary= From February 7 to February 14, 1971, the TGR celebrated its centenary of operations, with special trains scheduled during this time for trips between Launceston and Deloraine with intermediate stops. Special fares were arranged for these trips, with return tickets between the two termini priced at $1.00 (approximately $9.74 in 2012). Trains were arranged with either single, double or triple-headed steam locomotives, depending on the type of stock and number of passengers carried. On February 10, the official ceremony was held at Launceston Railway Station, with addresses from the Transport Commissioner Mr. G.T Webb and Minister for Transport the Hon. L.H Bessell MHA, as well as the unveiling of a commemorative plaque by the then- Premier of Tasmania William Angus Bethune. Richard Green, the Mayor of Launceston, also presented the Guard of the centenary train with \\"Scrolls of Greetings\\", which were presented to the Wardens of the Municipalities of Evandale, Longford, Westbury and Deloraine. The Centenary Train also conveyed special mail from the Launceston Post Office, as well as politicians and invited guests. After the Centenary train, further special trains were run through to St Marys on the Fingal Line, south down to Ross on the Main Line, and as far up as Railton on the Western line. Several trains were also timetabled to pick up passengers flown from Melbourne to Western Junction. The centenary celebrations were overall viewed as an astounding success, with most seats booked on each special train. Aside from the use of one Y Class diesel locomotive on a train for \\"special guests\\", every train scheduled as part of the centenary used well-maintained steam locomotives that were still in use on Tasmanian main lines.  Operations  With around 16 lines across the state, the TGR operated a combination of approximately 275 stations, halts and junctions (as of 1949). Large stations were located at Hobart, Derwent Park, New Norfolk, Parattah, Launceston, Zeehan, Burnie and Devonport. Typical designs of TGR railway tickets. These examples were used exclusively on special trains for the Royal Hobart Show and some include admission stubs. On Hobart's suburban branch spurs, the TGR operated workers trains and freight for the Electrolytic Zinc Company and its zinc works in Lutana, as well as the Cadbury's Chocolate Factory in nearby Claremont. Special trains were also conveyed on Hobart's suburban network, with trains operating to Elwick Racecourse for the Hobart Cup, and to the Royal Hobart Showgrounds for the Royal Hobart Show. The special show trains to the Showgrounds ended in 1978, and were the last TGR passenger trains to be run in Tasmania. In the 1970s, with the increase in car ownership, funding for highways and the loss of goods consignments, the TGR's operations suffered, and passenger services were eventually ceased across the network. Hobart suburban services ended in 1974, with passenger services ending entirely in 1978. TGR introduced in 1954 some containers for bulk goods such as cement, sand, gravel and superphosphate. = Network = * Main Line ‚Äì Running north/south between Hobart and Launceston. * Western Line ‚Äì Running from Launceston to Wiltshire Junction. * Derwent Valley Line ‚Äì Running from Bridgewater Junction to logging areas in Florentine. * Fingal Line ‚Äì Branching from Conara Junction, south of Launceston, to St Marys on the East Coast. * Irishtown-Trowutta Line ‚Äì A short line from Irishtown Junction (outside Smithton) to rural areas southwards. * Bell Bay Line ‚Äì Opened in the early 1970s, this line connected Launceston to its northern port at Bell Bay. * Apsley Line ‚Äì Branching from Brighton Junction north into rural farmlands.

Closed in 1926. = Hobart Railway Station = The largest terminus in the state was built in Hobart in 1871 by the Tasmanian Main Line Company, and was further expanded in the 20th century, with the station reconstructed and modernised in 1950. After the completion of construction works, the station had four platforms and a large concourse, as well as shopping stalls and food vendors. In the 1960s and early 1970s the railway station saw more than 70 trains a day come and go. With the gradual cessation of passenger services in the latter half of the 1970s and the takeover by Australian National Railways in 1978, the railway station was sold and redeveloped in the 1980s. Sections of track that went into the station were demolished for the extension of the Tasman Highway onto Davey Street and Macquarie Street, and today, the redeveloped site houses the studios of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith Centre of Learning, with the only remaining part of the rail terminal the original sandstone TMLR station building from 1871. =Tasman Limited= The Tasman Limited was the only named train operated by TGR (The West Coaster was operated by the private Emu Bay Railway). Inaugurated in April 1954, the train originally began as an express railcar service; however, later became a first- class luxury passenger service, operated with special articulated coaching stock, buffet service and modern X class diesel locomotives. Seating was reserved, and the service ran from Hobart to Wynyard with connections to Launceston, every day of the week except Sundays. The Tasman, as it was colloquially known, outlasted all other TGR passenger services, and was officially the last regular scheduled government passenger train to operate on the Tasmanian rail network, departing Hobart at 9.20am on Friday July 28th, 1978. =Tasmanian Railway Institute= In the 1930s, the TGR formed the Railway Institute as a social and recreational branch for employees of the TGR and their families. Staffed by railway personnel, the TGR provided facilities to the Institute; with recreation halls and branches founded in Hobart, Launceston, Conara, Devonport and Wynyard. These halls contained offices, libraries, billiards rooms, a kitchen and other sporting and social facilities. The Launceston branch was unique, in that it also held a Commonwealth-recognised indoor small-bore rifle range, and boxing stadium. The Institute was tasked with training and certifying employees who were to be in charge of railway station accounts. The Institute also formed an intrastate sporting events calendar, with teams from each branch participating. More central branches (e.g. Hobart), because of the higher number of members, often fielded two or more teams. As well as providing hall facilities, the Institute purchased several holiday homes located across Tasmania, as a way of providing members and their families with affordable holidays. A two-bedroom home at Scamander and a three-bedroom former station master's house at Claremont were initially acquired. The TGR also provided a six-bedroom house in both Stanley and Devonport, and later a house in Wynyard and South Burnie were also requisitioned. In 1978 when passenger services and the TGR ceased, employee numbers fell and subsequently the houses in Stanley, Wynyard and South Burnie were abandoned. Railway Institute facilities were also sold off, and the halls in Devonport and Wynyard were the last to be sold; with Devonport selling just prior to the sale of AN Tasrail to the private consortium ATN TasRail. Today, the Railway Institute still remains, but is now known as the AN (Railway) Institute of Tasmania Inc.. Several holiday homes also still exist and are in use, with the house in Devonport having been retained from TGR days. Two units in St Helens and two units in Claremont are also available, as well as a three-bedroom house in Launceston which was attained from AN Tasrail after they vacated offices there. These are owned outright by the Institute, after in the 1980s during the time of the Australian National Railways Commission's ownership, a Master of Operating lease was created to prevent future railway administrations from taking away Institute facilities. Due to legal threats from the state government, however; the Institute was made to purchase the outstanding equity in the holiday homes of the TGR, to become completely separate to the railway administration. The Tasmanian membership paid $100,000 and the national administration of the ANR Railway Institute borrowed some more to buy the railway's equity in St Helens, Launceston, Devonport and Hobart. In 1997, the Institute in Tasmania became almost autonomous and became administered by volunteers. The Institute in Tasmania is assisted in administration by the board of AN Institute Inc. and its staff in Port Augusta, South Australia. Rollingstock TGR DP class railmotor as used for suburban and rural passenger services, preserved in TGR livery at the Tasmanian Transport Museum. The Tasmanian Government Railways had a vast range of motive power and rollingstock, including many steam and latterly diesel locomotives and railmotors. Throughout the history of the TGR, the company set a number of milestones in railways, including being the first operator of mainline diesel locomotives in Australia, and being the first in the world to operate a Garratt locomotive. The passenger rolling stock of the TGR included the 1955‚Äì58 series ACS class 'articulated country saloons', 76-seat first class with air suspended reclining seats, tray tables, state-of-the-art lighting and heating, and buffet service with hostesses. To the end in 1978, the TGR still used AAL class first class saloons with leather seats and maple panelling, as well as SP class brake and 2nd class passenger carriages, converted from Sentinel steam railcars. When TGR was abolished in 1978, most rollingstock was transferred onto the register of Australian National Railways (with the exception of all passenger stock other than that kept for departmental use). =Locomotives= The TGR had a large and varying fleet of both steam (and diesel in 1950) locomotives, and many served a multi-purpose position in the system; hauling freight, passenger, and mixed trains. The company also had a fleet of railcars used for inter-suburban commuter services.

The Tasmanian Transport Museum, Don River Railway and Derwent Valley Railway all hold extensive collections of TGR-related ephemera, infrastructure and rollingstock; either operational or non-operational/unrestored. The Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, which is housed in the former TGR locomotive workshops in Inveresk, Tasmania, hold examples of the TGR's industrial operations, as well as a Y class locomotive, wagons, and locomotive nameplates and builder's plates. The Bellarine Railway in Queenscliff, Victoria, also has a number of ex-TGR carriages and locomotives. During the 1980s, the Hotham Valley Tourist Railway (HVR) south of Perth, Western Australia, purchased two V-class diesel- mechanical shunting locomotives and several ex-Tasman Limited SS/SSD passenger carriages. A couple of steam locomotives have been plinthed over the years and used in public parks since their withdrawal, with MA3 placed at the markets in Margate, and H6 placed at a park in Perth. Internationally, a handful of TGR locomotives still remain, with the first Garratt, K1, surviving at the Welsh Highland Railway in Wales; and M2, an M class Pacific steam locomotive, which was moved from a park in Stanley in 1984, now remains at the Tanfield Railway in County Durham, England; however, this locomotive remains derelict and unrestored, and its future is uncertain.

His advice call-in show, \\"What's Your Problem?,\\" aired from 1967 until the mid-1990s on stations WCAU-AM and WPEN-AM in Philadelphia, WOR-AM and WEVD-AM in New York and in national syndication on NBC Talknet. A city planner by training, with a civil engineering degree from City College of New York and a master's degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Meltzer moved from a career as a Philadelphia expert in urban problems to a radio host on WCAU. In 1973 his show moved to WOR in New York. Meltzer's show provided counsel on a wide range of quandaries, ranging from financial to personal: callers were as likely to ask about family crises, parenting issues and romantic problems as they were to ask about plumbing, home improvement or investment problems. Segments were often bracketed by Meltzer delivering aphorisms or reciting moralizing poetry (\\"What shall we do with grandma, now that she's old and gray?\\") in his distinctive smooth, soothing, quiet voice. His show at one time held the highest ratings among adults in his time slot. Thanks to a doctoral degree earned by correspondence from an unaccredited university, listeners usually referred to him as \\"Doctor Meltzer.\\" Meltzer learned he had Parkinson's disease around 1985, continuing on WOR until a brief final stint on WEVD in the 1990s. Among his many sayings were: \\"Courts are made for judges and lawyers\\" and, as he often sought to provide comfort, \\"The good people in this world far outnumber the bad.\\" Meltzer, a Jewish man, chose to work Sunday, to give his Christian colleagues time off for worship. Talk radio legend Bruce Williams said Meltzer was his inspiration to get into talk radio, after listening to him for years sitting in the car while his daughters attended Sunday School.http://www.brucewilliams.com/archive/130329.mp3 Bibliography * Burke, Christine. \\"Radio Pioneer 'Uncle Bernie' Meltzer is dead.\\" The New York Post, March 27, 1998.

These claims have led to investigations by the United States government, including hearings and reports by the United States House of Representatives, Senate, Department of Justice, and the CIA's Office of the Inspector General which ultimately concluded the allegations were unsupported. The subject remains controversial. A 1986 investigation by a sub-committee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (the Kerry Committee), found that \\"the Contra drug links included\\", among other connections, \\"[...] payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies.\\" The charges of CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking were revived in 1996, when a newspaper series by reporter Gary Webb in the San Jose Mercury News claimed that the trafficking had played an important role in the creation of the crack cocaine drug problem in the United States. Webb's series led to three federal investigations, all of which concluded there was no evidence of conspiracy by the CIA or its employees to bring drugs into the United States. Early reports of Contra cocaine trafficking In 1984, U.S. officials began receiving reports of Contra cocaine trafficking. Three officials told journalists that they considered these reports \\"reliable.\\" Former Panamanian deputy health minister Dr. Hugo Spadafora, who had fought with the Contra army, outlined charges of cocaine trafficking to a prominent Panamanian official. Spadafora was later found murdered. The charges linked the Contra trafficking to Sebasti√°n Gonz√°lez Mendiola, who was charged with cocaine trafficking on November 26, 1984, in Costa Rica. In 1985, another Contra leader \\"told U.S. authorities that his group was being paid $50,000 by Colombian traffickers for help with a 100-kilo cocaine shipment and that the money would go 'for the cause' of fighting the Nicaraguan government.\\" A 1985 National Intelligence Estimate revealed cocaine trafficking links to a top commander working under Contra leader Ed√©n Pastora.Brian Barger and Robert Parry, \\"Reports Link Nicaraguan Rebels to Cocaine Trafficking\\", Associated Press (December 20, 1985). Pastora had complained about such charges as early as March 1985, claiming that \\"two 'political figures' in Washington told him last week that State Department and CIA personnel were spreading the rumor that he is linked to drug trafficking in order to isolate his movement.\\"John E. Newhagen, \\"Commander Zero blasts CIA, State Department\\", United Press International (March 25, 1985). On December 20, 1985, these and other additional charges were laid out in an Associated Press article after an extensive investigation, which included interviews with \\"officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Customs Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Costa Rica's Public Security Ministry, as well as rebels and Americans who work with them\\". Five American Contra supporters who worked with the rebels confirmed the charges, noting that \\"two Cuban-Americans used armed rebel troops to guard cocaine at clandestine airfields in northern Costa Rica. They identified the Cuban-Americans as members of Brigade 2506, an anti-Castro group that participated in the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. Several also said they supplied information about the smuggling to U.S. investigators.\\" One of the Americans said \\"that in one ongoing operation, the cocaine is unloaded from planes at rebel airstrips and taken to an Atlantic coast port where it is concealed on shrimp boats that are later unloaded in the Miami area.\\" On March 16, 1986, the San Francisco Examiner published a report on the \\"1983 seizure of 430 pounds of cocaine from a Colombian freighter\\" in San Francisco; it said that a \\"cocaine ring in the San Francisco Bay area helped finance Nicaragua's Contra rebels.\\" Carlos Cabezas, convicted of conspiracy to traffic cocaine, said that the profits from his crimes \\"belonged to ... the Contra revolution.\\" He told the Examiner, \\"I just wanted to get the Communists out of my country.\\" Julio Zavala, also convicted on trafficking charges, said \\"that he supplied $500,000 to two Costa Rican-based Contra groups and that the majority of it came from cocaine trafficking in the San Francisco Bay area, Miami and New Orleans.\\"\\"Report: Cocaine Ring Finances Contras\\", Associated Press (March 16, 1986). FBI probe In April 1986, Associated Press reported on an FBI probe into Contra cocaine trafficking. According to the report, \\"Twelve American, Nicaraguan and Cuban-American rebel backers interviewed by The Associated Press said they had been questioned over the past several months [about contra cocaine trafficking] by the FBI. In the interviews, some covering several days and being conducted in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Colorado and California, several of the Contra backers told AP of firsthand knowledge of cocaine trafficking.\\"Brian Bargar and Robert Parry, \\"FBI Reportedly Probes Contras on Drugs, Guns\\", Associated Press (April 10, 1986). On April 17, 1986, the Reagan administration released a three-page report stating that there were some Contra-cocaine connections in 1984 and 1985, and that these connections occurred at a time when the rebels were \\"particularly hard pressed for financial support\\" because aid from the United States had been cut off. The report said: \\"We have evidence of a limited number of incidents in which known drug traffickers have tried to establish connections with Nicaraguan resistance groups\\" and that the drug activity took place \\"without the authorization of resistance leaders.\\" Kerry Committee investigation The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations, chaired at the time by Senator John Kerry, held a series of hearings from 1987 to 1988 on drug cartels and drug money laundering in South and Central America and the Caribbean. The Subcommittee's final report, issued in 1989, said that Contra drug links included: * Involvement in narcotics trafficking by individuals associated with the Contra movement. * Participation of narcotics traffickers in Contra supply operations through business relationships with Contra organizations. * Provision of assistance to the Contras by narcotics traffickers, including cash, weapons, planes, pilots, air supply services and other materials, on a voluntary basis by the traffickers. * Payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies. According to the report, the U.S. State Department paid over $806,000 to \\"four companies owned and operated by narcotics traffickers\\" to carry humanitarian assistance to the Contras. Dark Alliance series From August 18‚Äì20, 1996, the San Jose Mercury News published the Dark Alliance series by Gary Webb,Many follow-ups to the original series published over the next three months are in the series archive at which claimed: > For the better part of a decade, a San Francisco Bay Area drug ring sold > tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles and > funneled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerrilla army run by > the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. [This drug ring] opened the first > pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of > Los Angeles [and, as a result,] the cocaine that flooded in helped spark a > crack explosion in urban America. To support these claims, the series focused on three men: Ricky Ross, Oscar Danilo Bland√≥n, and Norwin Meneses. According to the series, Ross was a major drug dealer in Los Angeles, and Bland√≥n and Meneses were Nicaraguans who smuggled drugs into the U.S. and supplied dealers like Ross. The series alleged that the three had relationships with the Contras and the CIA, and that law enforcement agencies failed to successfully prosecute them largely due to their Contra and CIA connections. =Response= African Americans, especially in South Central Los Angeles where the dealers discussed in the series had been active, responded with outrage to the series' charges. California senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein also took note and wrote to CIA director John Deutch and Attorney General Janet Reno, asking for investigations into the articles. Maxine Waters, the Representative for California's 35th district, which includes South-Central Los Angeles, was also outraged by the articles and became one of Webb's strongest supporters. Waters urged the CIA, the Department of Justice, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate. By the end of September, three federal investigations had been announced: an investigation into the CIA allegations conducted by CIA Inspector-General Frederick Hitz, an investigation into the law enforcement allegations by Justice Department Inspector-General Michael Bromwich, and a second investigation into the CIA by the House Intelligence Committee. On October 3, 1996, LA County Sheriff Sherman Block ordered a fourth investigation into Webb's claims that a 1986 raid on Bland√≥n's drug organization by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department had produced evidence of CIA ties to drug smuggling and that this was later suppressed. =Coverage in other papers= In early October, 1996, a front- page article in The Washington Post by reporters Roberto Suro and Walter Pincus, argued that \\"available information\\" did not support the series's claims, and that \\"the rise of crack\\" was \\"a broad-based phenomenon\\" driven in numerous places by diverse players. The article also discussed Webb's contacts with Ross's attorney and prosecution complaints of how Ross's defense had used Webb's series.This is discussed briefly in . The New York Times published two articles on the series in mid-October, both written by reporter Tim Golden. One described the series' evidence as \\"thin\\"; the second, citing interviews with current and former intelligence and law-enforcement officials, questioned the importance of the drug dealers discussed in the series, both in the crack cocaine trade and in supporting the Nicaraguan Contras' fight against the Sandinista government. The Los Angeles Times devoted the most space to the story, developing its own three-part series called The Cocaine Trail. The series ran from October 20‚Äì22, 1996, and was researched by a team of 17 reporters. The three articles in the series were written by four reporters: Jesse Katz, Doyle McManus, John Mitchell, and Sam Fulwood. The first article, by Katz, developed a different picture of the origins of the crack trade than \\"Dark Alliance\\" had described, with more gangs and smugglers participating. The second article, by McManus, was the longest of the series, and dealt with the role of the Contras in the drug trade and CIA knowledge of drug activities by the Contras. McManus found Bland√≥n and Meneses's financial contributions to Contra organizations to be significantly less than the \\"millions\\" claimed in Webb's series, and no evidence that the CIA had tried to protect them. The third article, by Mitchell and Fulwood, covered the effects of crack on African Americans and how it affected their reaction to some of the rumors that arose after the Dark Alliance series. =Mercury News response= Surprised by The Washington Post article, Mercury News executive editor Jerome Ceppos wrote to the Post defending the series. The Post ultimately refused to print his letter. Ceppos also asked reporter Pete Carey to write a critique of the series for publication in The Mercury News, and had the controversial website artwork changed. Carey's critique appeared in mid-October and went through several of the Post criticisms of the series, including the importance of Bland√≥n's drug ring in spreading crack, questions about Bland√≥n's testimony in court, and how specific series allegations about CIA involvement had been, giving Webb's responses. When the Los Angeles Times series appeared, Ceppos again wrote to defend the original series. He also defended the series in interviews with all three papers. The extent of the criticism, however, convinced Ceppos that The Mercury News had to acknowledge to its readers that the series hadn't been subjected to strong criticism. He did this in a column that appeared on November 3, defending the series, but also committing the paper to a review of major criticisms. Ceppos' column drew editorial responses from both The New York Times and The Washington Post. An editorial in the Times, while criticizing the series for making \\"unsubstantiated charges,\\" conceded that it did find \\"drug-smuggling and dealing by Nicaraguans with at least tentative connections to the Contras\\" and called for further investigation. The Post response came from the paper's ombudsman, Geneva Overholser. Overholser was harshly critical of the series, \\"reported by a seemingly hotheaded fellow willing to have people leap to conclusions his reporting couldn't back up.\\" But while calling the flaws in the series \\"unforgivably careless journalism,\\" Overholser also criticized the Post's refusal to print Ceppos' letter defending the series and sharply criticized the Post's coverage of the story. Calling the Post's overall focus \\"misplaced\\", Overholser expressed regret that the paper had not taken the opportunity to re-examine whether the CIA had overlooked Contra involvement in drug smuggling, \\"a subject The Post and the public had given short shrift.\\" In contrast, the series received support from Steve Weinberg, a former executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors. In a long review of the series' claims in The Baltimore Sun, Weinberg said: \\"I think the critics have been far too harsh. Despite some hyped phrasing, 'Dark Alliance' appears to be praiseworthy investigative reporting.\\" After the series' publication, the Northern California branch of the national Society of Professional Journalists had voted Webb \\"Journalist of the Year\\" for 1996. Despite the controversy that soon overtook the series, and the request of one board member to reconsider, the branch's board went ahead with the award in November. =End of the series= After Ceppos' column, The Mercury News spent the next several months conducting an internal review of the story. The review was conducted primarily by editor Jonathan Krim and reporter Pete Carey, who had written the paper's first published analysis of the series. Carey ultimately decided that there were problems with several parts of the story and wrote a draft article incorporating his findings. The paper also gave Webb permission to visit Central America again to get more evidence supporting the story.Schou 2006, 152. By January, Webb filed drafts of four more articles based on his trip, but his editors concluded that the new articles would not help shore up the original series claims. The editors met with Webb several times in February to discuss the results of the paper's internal review and eventually decided to print neither Carey's draft article nor the articles Webb had filed. Webb was allowed to keep working on the story and made one more trip to Nicaragua in March. At the end of March, however, Ceppos told Webb that he was going to present the internal review findings in a column. After discussions with Webb, the column was published on May 11, 1997. In the column Ceppos continued to defend parts of the article, writing that the series had \\"solidly documented\\" that the drug ring described in the series did have connections with the Contras and did sell large quantities of cocaine in inner-city Los Angeles. But, Ceppos wrote, the series \\"did not meet our standards\\" in four areas. 1) It presented only one interpretation of conflicting evidence and in one case \\"did not include information that contradicted a central assertion of the series.\\" 2) The series' estimates of the money involved was presented as fact instead of an estimate. 3) The series oversimplified how the crack epidemic grew. 4) The series \\"created impressions that were open to misinterpretation\\" through \\"imprecise language and graphics.\\" Ceppos noted that Webb did not agree with these conclusions. He concluded: \\"How did these shortcomings occur? ... I believe that we fell short at every step of our process: in the writing, editing and production of our work. Several people here share that burden ... But ultimately, the responsibility was, and is, mine.\\" Investigation after Dark Alliance =Justice Department report= The Department of Justice Inspector-General's report was released on July 23, 1998. According to the report's \\"Epilogue\\", the report was completed in December 1997 but was not released because the DEA was still attempting to use Danilo Bland√≥n in an investigation of international drug dealers and was concerned that the report would affect the viability of the investigation. When Attorney General Janet Reno determined that a delay was no longer necessary, the report was released unchanged. The report covered actions by Department of Justice employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DEA, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and U.S. Attorneys' Offices. It found that \\"the allegations contained in the original Mercury News articles were exaggerations of the actual facts.\\" After examining the investigations and prosecutions of the main figures in the series, Bland√≥n, Meneses and Ross, it concluded: \\"Although the investigations suffered from various problems of communication and coordination, their successes and failures were determined by the normal dynamics that affect the success of scores of investigations of high-level drug traffickers ... These factors, rather than anything as spectacular as a systematic effort by the CIA or any other intelligence agency to protect the drug trafficking activities of Contra supporters, determined what occurred in the cases we examined.\\" It also concluded that \\"the claims that Bland√≥n and Meneses were responsible for introducing crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles and spreading the crack epidemic throughout the country were unsupported.\\" Although it did find that both men were major drug dealers, \\"guilty of enriching themselves at the expense of countless drug users\\", and that they had contributed money to the Contra cause, \\"we did not find that their activities were responsible for the crack cocaine epidemic in South Central Los Angeles, much less the rise of crack throughout the nation, or that they were a significant source of support for the Contras.\\" The report called several of its findings \\"troubling.\\" It found that Bland√≥n received permanent resident status \\"in a wholly improper manner\\" and that for some time the Department \\"was not certain whether to prosecute Meneses, or use him as a cooperating witness.\\" Regarding issues raised in the series' shorter sidebar stories, it found that some in the government were \\"not eager\\" to have DEA agent Celerino Castillo \\"openly probe\\" activities at Ilopango Airport in El Salvador, where covert operations in support of the Contras were undertaken, and that the CIA had indeed intervened in a case involving smuggler Julio Zavala. It concluded, however, that these problems were \\"a far cry from the type of broad manipulation and corruption of the federal criminal justice system suggested by the original allegations.\\" =CIA report= The CIA Inspector-General's report was issued in two volumes. The first one, \\"The California Story\\", was issued in a classified version on December 17, 1997, and in an unclassified version on January 29, 1998. The second volume, \\"The Contra Story,\\" was issued in a classified version on April 27, 1998, and in an unclassified version on October 8, 1998. According to the report, the Inspector-General's office (OIG) examined all information the agency had \\"relating to CIA knowledge of drug trafficking allegations in regard to any person directly or indirectly involved in Contra activities.\\" It also examined \\"how CIA handled and responded to information regarding allegations of drug trafficking\\" by people involved in Contra activities or support.Hitz, \\"Scope of investigation.\\" The first volume of the report found no evidence that \\"any past or present employee of CIA, or anyone acting on behalf of CIA, had any direct or indirect dealing\\" with Ross, Bland√≥n, or Meneses or that any of the other figures mentioned in \\"Dark Alliance\\" were ever employed by or associated with or contacted by the agency.Hitz, Vol. 1, \\"Conclusions.\\" It found nothing to support the claim that \\"the drug trafficking activities of Bland√≥n and Meneses were motivated by any commitment to support the Contra cause or Contra activities undertaken by CIA.\\" It noted that Bland√≥n and Meneses claimed to have donated money to Contra sympathizers in Los Angeles, but found no information to confirm that it was true or that the agency had heard of it. It found no information to support the claim that the agency interfered with law enforcement actions against Ross, Bland√≥n or Meneses. In the 623rd paragraph, the report described a cable from the CIA's Directorate of Operations dated October 22, 1982, describing a prospective meeting between Contra leaders in Costa Rica for \\"an exchange in [the United States] of narcotics for arms, which then are shipped to Nicaragua.\\" The two main Contra groups, US arms dealers, and a lieutenant of a drug ring which imported drugs from Latin America to the US west coast were set to attend the Costa Rica meeting. The lieutenant trafficker was also a Contra, and the CIA knew that there was an arms-for-drugs shuttle and did nothing to stop it. The report stated that the CIA had requested the Justice Department return $36,800 to a member of the Meneses drug ring, which had been seized by DEA agents in the Frogman raid in San Francisco. The CIA's Inspector General said the Agency wanted the money returned \\"to protect an operational equity, i.e., a Contra support group in which it [CIA] had an operational interest.\\" The report also stated that former DEA agent Celerino Castillo III alleged that during the 1980s, Ilopango Airport in El Salvador was used by Contras for drug smuggling flights, and \\"his attempts to investigate Contra drug smuggling were stymied by DEA management, the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, and the CIA\\". =Testimony of the CIA Inspector General= Six weeks after the declassified and heavily censored first volume of the CIA report was made public, Inspector General Frederick Hitz testified before a House congressional committee. Hitz stated that: Also revealed was a letter between the Attorney General William French Smith and the CIA that omitted narcotics violations among the list of crimes agency officers were required to report. In a follow up letter later Smith stated \\"I have been advised that a question arose regarding the need to add all narcotics violations to the list of \\"non-employee\\" crimes...\\". Citing existing federal policy on narcotics enforcement, Smith wrote: \\"In light of these provisions and in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA, no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures.\\"\\"Cocaine, Conspiracy Theories & the C.I.A. in Central America\\", Frontline, Craig Delaval, Retrieved October 21, 2019. This agreement, which had not previously been revealed, came at a time when there were allegations that the CIA was using drug dealers in its controversial covert operation to bring down the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. In 1986, the agreement was modified to require the CIA to stop paying agents who it believed were involved in the drug trade. =House committee report= The House Intelligence Committee issued its report in February 2000. According to the report, it used Webb's reporting and writing as \\"key resources in focusing and refining the investigation.\\" Like the CIA and Justice Department reports, it also found that neither Bland√≥n, Meneses, nor Ross were associated with the CIA.\\"Report on Alleged Involvement: Findings\\" 43. Examining the support that Meneses and Bland√≥n gave to the local Contra organization in San Francisco, the report concluded that it was \\"not sufficient to finance the organization\\" and did not consist of 'millions', contrary to the claims of the \\"Dark Alliance\\" series. This support \\"was not directed by anyone within the Contra movement who had an association with the CIA,\\" and the Committee found \\"no evidence that the CIA or the Intelligence Community was aware of these individuals' support.\\" It also found no evidence to support Webb's suggestion that several other drug smugglers mentioned in the series were associated with the CIA, or that anyone associated with the CIA or other intelligence agencies was involved in supplying or selling drugs in Los Angeles.

It was a basal somphospondylan, about 15 m long, and is known from the remains of two or three individuals. Femur Description It is based on TV4-1 to TV4-36, consisting of a partial pelvis, several back vertebrae and a tail vertebra, ribs, and an upper arm bone (humerus). Another skeleton includes 38 tail vertebrae, a neck vertebra, and most of a hind limb. The type species, Tangvayosaurus hoffeti, was described by a group of a dozen scientists led by Ronan Allain in 1999. Allain et al. also referred the old species \\"Titanosaurus\\" falloti, from the same formation and based on partial thigh bones and tail vertebrae, to their genus as T. sp. The most recent review tentatively retains the genus because it is different from the only other established sauropod from the same approximate time but found next door in Thailand (Phuwiangosaurus), but disagrees with adding T. falloti to it. Classification Although consistently recovered within the Somphospondyli, the exact placement of Tangvayosaurus is debated. It was initially assigned by Allain et al. (1999) to the Titanosauria, who noted strong affinities to Phuwiangosaurus, which they also considered a titanosaur. A more recent review by Suteethorn et al. (2010) resolved both Tangvayosaurus and Phuwiangosaurus as more basal titanosauriforms. The cladogram below follows this analysis. D'Emic (2012) found that Tangvayosaurus was the sister taxon of Phuwiangosaurus within the Euhelopodidae.

Among his varied scientific interests is the taxonomy of tropical plants, especially trees of the families Labiatae, Meliaceae and Rutaceae. He is perhaps best known for his plant dictionary The plant-book. A portable dictionary of the vascular plants. The third edition was published in 2008 as Mabberley's Plant-book, for which he was awarded the Engler Medal in Silver in 2009. As of June 2017 Mabberley's Plant-book is in its fourth edition. Biography Born in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, England, Mabberley won a scholarship to Rendcomb College, Cirencester, then an open scholarship to St Catherine's College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1970 and M.A. in 1974. Although he intended to work for a doctorate under the cytologist C. D. Darlington he was inspired to move to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, under the supervision of E. J. H. Corner, leading to a PhD in 1973 and D.Phil. (Oxon) in 1975.Having a doctorate from both Cambridge and Oxford makes Mabberley what Ghil'ad Zuckermann calls an \\"Oxbridge Paradox\\": Mabberley belongs to the rare group of people who hold a \\"pair o' docs\\" (sounding like \\"paradox\\" but meaning \\"two doctorates\\"), a D.Phil. (Oxon.) and a PhD (Cantab.), from both Oxford and Cambridge universities (commonly abbreviated as Oxbridge) - see -->Biography. In 1973 Mabberley was elected the first Claridge Druce junior research fellow at St John's College, Oxford, before being appointed in 1976 to a tutorial fellowship at Wadham College, Oxford (linked to a university lecturership in the Department of Botany, later Plant Sciences, where he set up the \\"Mablab\\" with graduate students and post- doctoral research workers from around the world). He served as Dean of Wadham College for many years and was senior proctor at Oxford 1988‚Äì1989, later becoming Curator of the Oxford University Herbaria. He has also served in various capacities at numerous universities around the world, including University of Paris (France), University of Leiden (the Netherlands), University of Peradeniya (Sri Lanka), University of Kuwait, Western Sydney University and Macquarie University (both in New South Wales, Australia). From 1995 he held a chair at the University of Leiden, where he is now Emeritus Professor.http://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/david-mabberley Mabberley moved to Australia late in 1996 and ran his own consultancy business there, one contract being as CEO of Greening Australia (NSW). In 2004 he was appointed to the Orin and Althea Soest Chair in Horticultural Science at the University of Washington, Seattle, US, where he was also Professor of Economic Botany in the College of Forest Resources.Etaerio - A Plant News Weblog: Dr. David Mabberley Joins Faculty at Univ. of Washington at www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org During his tenure there, he oversaw the union of the Washington Park Arboretum, Center for Urban Horticulture, Union Bay Natural Area, Elisabeth C. Miller Library and Otis Douglas Hyde Herbarium as the University of Washington Botanic Gardens, of which he was the founding director. In March 2008 he took up the newly created position of Keeper of the Herbarium, Library, Art and Archives at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.New Keeper for Kew's Historic Herbarium at www.bgci.org Mabberley is known as a world traveller, having performed fieldwork in many countries over several decades: Kenya (1969, 1970‚Äì71), Uganda (1970‚Äì71), Tanzania (1971‚Äì72), Madagascar (1971), Malaysia, Singapore & Indonesia (1974, 1981), Papua New Guinea (1974, 1989), Seychelles (1978), Panam√° (1978‚Äì79), Portugal (1984‚Äì96), New Caledonia (1984), New Zealand (1990), Sri Lanka (1991), Hawai‚Äôi (1998), Cape York, Australia (Royal Geographical Society of Queensland expedition, 2002), Malaysia (2003, 2007), Vietnam (2005), China (2006, 2008), India (2019), Japan (2019). During research for his PhD dissertation, he travelled widely and collected plants throughout eastern Africa and Madagascar (1970‚Äì2), making particularly significant pioneering collections in the Ukaguru Mountains, Tanzania, where he collected at least 14 species of plants (and one new snail species) new to science and restricted to that range. These include a species of coffee, a giant lobelia (Lobelia sancta (Campanulaceae)), a (hairy) balsam (Impatiens ukagurensis (Balsaminaceae)), besides Keetia davidii (Rubiaceae) and Senecio mabberleyi (Compositae), both named after him. He is also commemorated in Aglaia mabberleyana (Meliaceae) from Borneo, Begonia mabberleyana (Begoniaceae) from Sulawesi and Cinnamomum mabberleyi (Lauraceae) from Vietnam and Laos, besides Homalomena davidiana (Araceae) and Harpullia mabberleyana (Sapindaceae), both from New Guinea and Grewia mabberleyanaTiliaceae Grewia mabberleyana, Phillipson , Wahlert & Lowry, Candollea 70(2): 202.2015 (Tiliaceae) from Madagascar.

The Kordopulov House in winter. The Kordopulov (or Kordopulov's) House (Bulgarian: –ö–æ—Ä–¥–æ–ø—É–ª–æ–≤–∞ –∫—ä—â–∞, Kordopulova kashta) is a large Bulgarian National Revival house in the southwestern Bulgarian town of Melnik. It was built in 1754 specifically for wine production and was bought by the rich and known Greek merchant Manolis Kordopulos. The house, possibly the largest of its kind and period, is located in the town's eastern part and consists of a ground floor that includes a wine cellar, a semi-basement for economic needs and a bay floor intended to be inhabited. Overview While the lower row of 12 windows is typically Bulgarian in style, the higher one is a mix of Venetian and Ottoman architecture and is made of Venetian glass, making the house unique in Bulgaria. The characteristic Melnik wine cellar is dug into the rock to form a tunnel. The cellar can take 300 tons of wine, with the largest cask being able to take 12.5 tons alone. The corridors are relatively narrow and low at places and the cellar disposes of a ventilation system and special canals. Two of the Kordopulov House's four floors are made of stone. Seven inner staircases connect the floors and garrets and the two wooden floors are covered with motley rugs. Bulgarian revolutionary Yane Sandanski would use the house for shelter before World War I. The last of the Kordopulov family was killed in 1916 and the house passed to Agnesa, either a maid or a sister of a Kordopulov. She married Georgi Tsinstara and, although they had no children, they adopted their nephew Gavrail. He is in turn the father of Nikola Paspalev, the current owner. The Kordopulov House was renovated in 1974-1980 and is currently a private museum that is visited by 30,000 tourists a year.

The reserve is situated in the northern edge of Sydney and lies between the suburb of to the south, and the Hawkesbury River to the north. Features The vegetation is mainly dry sclerophyll forest and shrubs on rocky areas, as well as mangroves along the river. The reserve is closed to the public for most of the year, and opens for six weekends each year in spring, when there are prolific displays of wildflowers. At other times of the year it is available to groups such as the scouts or to schools for education or special events. During the weekends that the reserve is open to the public, volunteers provide guided walks around some of the most interesting trails. Access to the Muogamarra Nature Reserve is via the Pacific Highway (not the M1 Pacific Motorway), approximately north of Cowan, near the Pie in the Sky cafe. A small gravel road with a gate is located on the left of the northbound dual carriageway with a long narrow gravel road that is accessible to most motor vehicles that leads into the reserve. The reserve facilities include an unsealed carpark, toilets, a small open grassy area and the main information centre. An entry fee applies. =Aboriginal sites= There are many Aboriginal sites in the Muogamarra Nature Reserve, especially rock art engravings and grinding grooves. History In 1836 George Peat was granted on the Hawkesbury River at what is now Peats Bight. He built huts and a wharf there, and farmed his land. A dairy farm was then built nearby at Peats Crater. Founded by John Duncan Tipper in 1934 when he leased to protect the flora, fauna and aboriginal sites, due to his concern at the loss of Hawkesbury sandstone forest. He named the site 'Muogamarra', which he believed was an aboriginal Awabakal word meaning \\"preserve for the future.\\" This area was at the northern end of what is now the nature reserve. Over time Tipper expanded his lease to . In 1954 the land was given up by Tipper and gazetted as Muogamarra Sanctuary. The Sir Edward Hallstrom Faunal Reserve was dedicated in 1961 in what is now the southern part of the nature reserve. This was the work of Allen Strom and Sir Edward Hallstrom. In March 1969 the two areas were amalgamated into what is now Muogamarra Nature Reserve, under the control of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. Walks The Muogamarra Nature Reserve has several good short day walks, beginning at the main information centre: *Point LoopA short, flat loop walk from the carpark, with excellent wildflowers. Goes to an excellent viewpoint over Peats Crater and the Hawkesbury River. *J. D. Tipper LoopA short mostly flat walk to the lookout named for the founder of Muogamarra Nature Reserve views overlooking . *Lloyd TrigA slightly longer mostly flat walk on an old road built by convict labour to Lloyd Trig Point, with excellent views of the Hawkesbury River area. *Peats CraterA fairly long walk with a descent and matching ascent which follows a convict road to the site of George Peat's farm at Peats Crater, which is also an interesting geological feature. *Deerubbin LookoverA medium length walk with a descent and a similar ascent along the old Peats Ferry convict road to a rock shelter which provides stunning views over the Hawkesbury River some below. *Bird Gully SwampA trail which skirts the edge of a 'hanging swamp' containing a unique plant habitat.

Discovery and naming Restored skull cast In 1995 Western Paleontological Laboratories, Inc. uncovered the partial skeleton of a small theropod at the Bone Cabin Quarry West locality, Albany County, Wyoming, from the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation, dating to the Oxfordian- Tithonian. At first the find was considered to be a specimen of CoelurusMiles, C.A., Carpenter K. and Cloward, K.C., 1998, \\"A new skeleton of Coelurus fragilis from the Morrison Formation of Wyoming\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18(3): 64A but subsequent study indicated it represented a species new to science, that in 2001 was announced to be named Tanycolagreus topwilsoni. It was actually named and described by Kenneth Carpenter, Clifford Miles and Karen Cloward in 2005. The etymology of the generic name Tanycolagreus, suggested by Ben Creisler, is based upon the greater length of its forelimbs and hindlimbs compared to Coelurus. It is derived from the Greek prefix œÑŒ±ŒΩœÖ~, tany~: 'long, stretched out', Œ∫·ø∂ŒªŒøŒΩ, kolon: 'limb' and ·ºÄŒ≥œÅŒµœçœÇ, agreus: 'hunter'. The specific name honours George Eugene \\"Top\\" Wilson, the father of a benefactor financially supporting the scientific research.Carpenter, K., Miles, C., and Cloward, K. (2005). \\"New small theropod from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Wyoming.\\" in Carpenter, K. 2005. The Carnivorous Dinosaurs, Indiana University Press: 23-48 Restored skeleton The fossil, holotype TPII 2000-09-29, was donated to science by an anonymous benefactor. It is part of the collection of Thanksgiving Point Institute, Inc. and displayed in the North American Museum of Ancient Life at Lehi, Utah. It includes an incomplete skull and mandible (lower jaws) and much of the postcranial skeleton, i.e. the parts behind the head. The skull of Tanycolagreus is less well known than its postcranial anatomy, and only the following elements have been found: left nasal, left lacrimal, left premaxilla and one premaxillary tooth, left postorbital, left quadratojugal, incomplete left squamosal, right quadrate, right splenial, left articular, and two cheek teeth. A paratype has been assigned to the species: specimen AMNH 587 consisting of an incomplete hand also collected from Bone Cabin Quarry and originally in 1903 by Henry Fairfield Osborn referred to Ornitholestes hermanni.Osborn, Henry Fairfield, 1903, \\"Ornitholestes hermanni, a new compsognathoid dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic\\", Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 19(12): 459‚Äì464 Two other fossils have been referred to Tanycolagreus: UUVP 2999, a premaxilla, originally in 1974 referred to Stokesosaurus clevelandi,Madsen, J., 1974, \\"A new theropod dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic of Utah\\", Journal of Paleontology, 48: 27-31 from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry of Utah; and USNM 5737, a pair of distal pubes from Colorado earlier in 1920 by Charles Whitney Gilmore referred to Coelurus.Gilmore, C.W., 1920, \\"Osteology of the carnivorous Dinosauria in the United States National Museum, with special reference to the genera Antrodemus (Allosaurus) and Ceratosaurus\\", Bulletin of the United States National Museum, 110: 1-154 These specimens are from the later Brushy Basin Member. Tanycolagreus is present in stratigraphic zone 2 of the Morrison. Remains possibly referrable to Stokesosaurus have been recovered from stratigraphic zone 5 of the Morrison Formation.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329 A life restoration of Tanycolagreus is also on display at the North American Museum of Ancient Life, where it is portrayed as preying upon a small ornithischian dinosaur, Othnielia rex. Description Tanycolagreus life restoration Carpenter et al. (2005, pp. 43‚Äì44) determined that the holotype of Tanycolagreus represents a subadult individual which measured approximately long in life. However, one of the referred fossils, the premaxilla from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry, would have belonged to a larger individual, measuring long. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the weight of a four-meter-long animal at .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 124 It cannot be determined whether or not the Cleveland-Lloyd specimen represents a fully mature adult, so the upper size limit for the taxon remains unknown. The head of Tanycolagreus is large, elongated and rectangular in profile due to a blunt snout. The leg is rather long and lightly built. Estimated size of Tanycolagreus, based on Carpenter Carpenter et al. (2005; pp. 27 & 29) diagnosed Tanycolagreus topwilsoni as follows: \\"Medium-sized tetanuran having short, deep-bodied premaxilla pierced by narial foramen at base of nasal process, orbital process on postorbital, T-shaped quadratojugal, centrodiapophyseal lamina on dorsals. Differs from Coelurus in the absence of pleurocoel on anterior dorsals; posterior caudal prezygapophyses elongated to one-third centrum length, rather than short; straight, rather than sigmoidal, humeral shaft; bowed, rather than straight, radius; flat-bottomed rather than arced pubic foot; straight rather than sigmoidal femoral shaft; metatarsal length subequal to humeral length, rather than 1.75 times humeral length. Differs from Ornitholestes in straight anterior margin of premaxilla, rather than rounded; T-shaped rather than L-shaped quadratojugal; elongate neural spine; posterior caudal prezygapophyses only one-third centrum length, rather than one-half centrum length; bowed, slender radius, rather than straight, robust radius\\". The single premaxillary tooth preserved with the holotype is badly damaged, but does exhibit the asymmetrical cross-section typical in theropod teeth; the cheek teeth are too poorly preserved to show any detail. In the foot the second toe is slightly hyperextendable but does not carry an enlarged claw. Classification Carpenter e.a. originally assigned Tanycolagreus to the Coeluridae. Carpenter et alii (2005, p. 44) state that, of the other known Morrison theropods, this genus most closely resembles Coelurus, though it retains more \\"primitive\\" features. A detailed phylogenetic analysis in 2007 by Philip Senter including Tanycolagreus showed it had a basal position in the Tyrannosauroidea.Senter, P. (2007). \\"A new look at the phylogeny of Coelurosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda)\\", Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 5(4): 429-463 Later analyses indicated a basal position in the Coelurosauria.O.W.M.

It was signed into law on September 26, 1996 and requires plans that offer maternity coverage to pay for at least a 48-hour hospital stay following childbirth (96-hour stay in the case of a caesarean section).  Provisions of the Act  This law was effective for group health plans for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1998. On October 27, 1998, the Department of Labor, in conjunction with the Departments of the US Treasury and Health and Human Services, published interim regulations clarifying issues arising under the Newborns‚Äô Act. The changes made by the regulations are effective for group health plans for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1999. The Act and its regulations provide that health plans and insurance issuers may not restrict a mother‚Äôs or newborn‚Äôs benefits for a hospital length of stay that is connected to childbirth to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery or 96 hours following a delivery by caesarean section. However, the attending medical provider (who may be a physician or nurse midwife) may decide, after consulting with the mother, to discharge the mother or newborn child earlier. The Act, and its regulations, prohibit incentives (either positive or negative) that could encourage less than the minimum protections under the Act as described above. A mother cannot be encouraged to accept less than the minimum protections available to her under the Act and an attending provider cannot be induced to discharge a mother or newborn earlier than 48 or 96 hours after delivery. The type of coverage provided by the plan (insured or self-insured) and state law will determine whether the Act applies to a mother‚Äôs or newborn‚Äôs coverage. The Act provisions always apply to coverage that is self-insured. All group health plans that provide maternity or newborn infant coverage must include a statement in their summary plan description (SPD) advising individuals of the Act's requirements.

The officers were killed during a traffic stop where Tafero, his wife Sunny Jacobs, and their children were passengers. After Tafero's execution, the driver, Walter Rhodes, confessed to shooting the officers.  The crime, trial, and execution  On the morning of February 20, 1976, Black and Irwin approached a car parked at a rest stop for a routine check. Tafero, his wife Sonia \\"Sunny\\" Jacobs, their two children (ages 9 years and 10 months), and Walter Rhodes were found asleep inside. Tafero had previously been in prison and was on probation. Black saw a gun lying on the floor inside the car. He woke the occupants and had first Rhodes then Tafero come out of the car. According to Rhodes, Tafero then shot both Black and Irwin with the gun, (which was legally registered to Jacobs who bought guns on behalf of Tafero - he couldn't legally apply for a license because of his record) and led the others into the police car and fled the scene. According to Tafero, Rhodes shot the officers and handed the gun to him so that Rhodes could drive. They later disposed of the police car and kidnapped a man and stole his car. All three were arrested after being caught in a roadblock. When they were arrested, the gun was found in Tafero's waistband. This account, however, was later contradicted by Rhodes, and there was subsequently enough evidence to support reasonable doubt regarding Tafero's conviction. Gunpowder tests found residue on Rhodes consistent with \\"having discharged a weapon\\", residue on Tafero consistent with \\"handling an unclean or recently discharged weapon, or possibly discharging a weapon\\", and residue on Jacobs and her son consistent with \\"having handled an unclean or recently discharged weapon\\". Prior to his conviction for murder, Tafero had been convicted of attempted robbery and \\"crimes against nature\\" when he was 20 years old.Jesse J. Tafero (Florida) Case ChartTafero v. State, 223 So.2d at 567,568 Rhodes entered into a plea agreement for a reduced sentence of second degree murder in exchange for his testimony against Tafero and Jacobs. At their trial, he testified that Jacobs fired first from the back seat, then Tafero took the gun from her and shot the two officers. Rhodes later recanted his testimony on three occasions, in 1977, 1979, and 1982, stating that he shot the policemen, but ultimately reverted to his original testimony. Tafero and Jacobs were convicted of capital murder and were sentenced to death while Rhodes was sentenced to three life sentences. He was released in 1994 following parole for good behavior. The children were placed in the care of Sunny Jacobs' parents until their deaths in a 1982 plane crash. The children were then separated and Sunny's younger child, Christina, was placed into foster care with a friend of Jacobs. Sunny's older child, Eric, who was in his mid-teens, first resided with Sonia's brother Alan, then lived on his own, struggling to survive by working at a pizza restaurant and various odd jobs. Tafero and Jacobs continued their relationship through letters while serving time in the prison. Because there was no death row for women in Florida, Jacobs was put into solitary confinement for the first five years of her imprisonment and let out only once or twice a week for exercise. She learned yoga to pass the time, and after being moved to the general prison population, began teaching yoga to other prisoners. Although the jury had recommended a life sentence for Jacobs, Judge Daniel Futch, known as \\"Maximum Dan\\" for his reputation for tough sentences, imposed the death sentence. In 1981, the Florida Supreme Court commuted Jacobs' sentence to life in prison, holding that Futch lacked sufficient basis to override the jury's sentencing recommendation. Tafero was to be executed by electrocution. The machine, dubbed \\"Old Sparky\\", malfunctioned, causing six-inch flames to shoot out of Tafero's head. A member of the execution team had used a synthetic sponge rather than a sea sponge, which is necessary to provide greater conductivity and a quick death. In all, three jolts of electricity were required to execute Tafero, a process that took seven minutes. Prison inmates later claimed that Old Sparky was \\"fixed\\" and tampered with to make Tafero's execution more like torture. One close inmate friend of Tafero later said he could smell the burning flesh of his friend for days after. It has been rumored that Tafero's death served as inspiration for author Stephen King when he wrote the execution of Eduard Delacroix in his novel The Green Mile. Aftermath The case became a cause c√©l√®bre among death penalty opponents, who cited the brutal circumstances of his execution as reasons it should be abolished. Rhodes did not receive further jail time. Filmmaker Micki Dickoff made a crime drama on the case entitled In the Blink of an Eye, which aired as an ABC Movie of the Week in 1996. Sunny Jacobs, even though she had not been exonerated, is featured in The Exonerated, a made-for-cable television film, first aired on the former CourtTV cable television network on January 27, 2005. When her death sentence was overturned in 1981, she was sentenced to life with a 25-year minimum mandatory sentence. In 1992, when her case was reversed on appeal, she took an Alford plea for second-degree murder and was released on time served.952 F.2d 1282: Sonia Jacobs A/k/a Sonia Linder In 2011, Jacobs married Peter Pringle, who had been exonerated after being convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in the Republic of Ireland. (Pringle's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, the death penalty having been abolished in practice in Ireland since 1954, abolished for ordinary murder in 1964, and permanently abolished for all crimes in 1990.)

It is currently operational in 22 states (Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh) and two Union Territories (Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu). The 108 Emergency Response Service is a free emergency service providing integrated medical, police and fire emergency services. This system was introduced nationwide by former Union Health Minister, Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss. The Indian Express (May 21, 2009) In Madhya Pradesh, the 108 GVK Ambulance facility was implemented in July 2009 by Honorable Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan. It was inaugurated by Health Minister Mr. Narottam Mishra. The service is a public-private partnership between state governments and private EMS providers. This 108 service was rolled out initially by Ramalinga Raju and his family. Dr.Y.S Rajashekar Reddy, who was the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, was the first Chief Minister to sign an agreement with EMRI to roll out the services in the state of Andhra Pradesh. With the life-saving service becoming so popular in the rural parts of combined Andhra Pradesh, the (108) system was later introduced by the Central government of India in other parts of India. The system was originally designed by Satyam Infotech. , this service had handled over 540,000 emergency cases in India. On an iOS device, \\"Hey Siri, 108\\" command to Siri will place an emergency call.

Ranga Rao, and implemented by the late Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Dr. Y.S.Rajasekhara Reddy. Scope The Dial-108 service is available in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, and two union territories; Puducherry, Daman and Diu, and Chandigarh. How it works When an emergency is reported, the call taker at the Emergency Response Centre (ERC) gathers the needed information, including location, and dispatches appropriate emergency services; be that an ambulance, police assistance, or a fire engine. Emergency help dispatched through this process is expected to reach the location of the emergency in an average of 18 minutes. Pre-hospital care will be given to patients during transit to hospital. Patients are transported in ambulances well equipped to handle emergency situations. Road and water ambulances are the two types of ambulances commonly used in India to transport patients. Road ambulances are used across all its states. However, only a few states, namely Odisha, Assam, and Gujarat, along with two Union Territories, have been using boat ambulances. Odisha was the first state to launch the boat ambulance by Ziqitza Healthcare Limited (ZHL) for remote areas. At present, there are only three providers: GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK EMRI), Ziqitza Healthcare Limited (ZHL), and Bharat Vikas Group India-UK Specialist Ambulance Services (BVG-UKSAS) who operate Dial-108 in Emergency in public private partnership with state governments. The service is normally free to patients. In Maharashtra, Jammu, Kashmir, Dial-108, and in JK in addition to Dial-108, Dial-102 ambulance services are being run by BVG India Ltd.

Prior to MHPA and similar legislation, insurers were not required to cover mental health care and so access to treatment was limited, underscoring the importance of the act. The MHPA was largely superseded by the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), which the 110th United States Congress passed as rider legislation on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), signed into law by President George W. Bush in October 2008. Notably, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act extended the reach of MHPAEA provisions to many health insurance plans outside its previous scope. Scope The MHPA applies to group health plans for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1998. The original sunset provision provided that the parity requirements would not apply to benefits for services furnished on or after September 30, 2001. It was extended six times, with the final extension running through December 31, 2007. Insurers promptly were able to \\"circumvent\\" the consumer protections arguably intended in the legislation by imposing maximum numbers of provider visits and/or caps on the number of days an insurer would cover for inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. In essence, the law had little or no effect on mental health coverage by group insurance plans. The rider on TARP prohibits all group health plans that offer mental health coverage from imposing any greater limit on co-pays, co- insurance, numbers of visits, and/or number of days covered for hospital stays due to mental health conditions. The rider legislation was the culmination of a long campaign fought by Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-MN) and his successors to enact mental health parity at the federal level. The new law's requirements will be phased in over several years. Still unsure is whether non-\\"biologically-based\\" mental illnesses such as PTSD and eating disorders are mandated to be covered by the new law. Requirements Generally the act required parity of mental health benefits with medical and surgical benefits with respect to the application of aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits under a group health plan. It provided that employers retain discretion regarding the extent and scope of mental health benefits offered to workers and their families, including cost sharing, limits on numbers of visits or days of coverage, and requirements relating to medical necessity. The law also contained three exemptions: ; No mental health coverage : Business that chose not to provide mental health coverage. ; Small employers : Businesses with fewer than 50 employees. ; Increased cost : Businesses that documented at least one percent increase in premiums due to implementation of parity requirements. Issues with the MHPA Immediately after MHPA was enacted, insurers and employers began finding ways to circumvent the legislation. Larger emphasis on cost sharing, primarily implemented through higher copayments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums, was one strategy used by insurers. In addition, limits and caps on the number of visits with a care provider or number of days in a hospital visit were imposed. MHPA also did not provide benefits for substance abuse and dependency issues. Lastly, MHPA contained a sunset provision that meant that the law would go out of effect after a certain date. The original sunset date was extended six times, through 2007. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) was enacted in October 2008 and took effect on 1 January 2009https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-122/pdf/STATUTE-122-Pg3765.pdf#page=1. The main purpose of MHPAEA was to fill the loopholes left by the MHPA. The act requires health insurers as well as group health plans to guarantee that financial requirements on benefits, including co-pays, deductibles, and out- of-pocket maximums, and limitations on treatment benefits such as caps on visits with a provider or days in a hospital visit, for mental health or substance use disorders are not more restrictive than the insurer's requirements and restrictions for medical and surgical benefits. MHPAEA only applies to insurance plans for public and private sector employers with over 50 employees and health insurance issuers who sell coverage to employers with more than 50 employees. Similar to MHPA, MHPAEA requires parity in terms of total annual dollar limits, as well as aggregate lifetime benefits. It is important to note however, that MHPAEA does not explicitly require that any insurance plan offer benefits for mental health and substance abuse disorders. Instead, it enacts parity rules for plans that choose to offer both medical and surgical benefits as well as mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits. This includes out-of-network benefits. If plans choose to offer both types of benefits, MHPAEA mandates that insurers define and make available specific criteria for medical necessity when it comes to mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits. In addition, MHPAEA also requires that insurers provide specific information and reasons in the event that reimbursement or payment for treatment is denied. =Implementation challenges= One main challenge to the implementation of MHPAEA is what is known as \\"carve-out\\" health benefits. This refers to mental health benefits that are purchased by employers separately from medical benefits. The \\"carve- out\\" vendor may be separate from any number of other vendors providing medical benefits. The law would require the \\"carve-out\\" vendor to ensure parity with medical benefits provided by a separate vendor or vendors. In addition, the legislation itself did not create a mechanism to regularly monitor or evaluate the enforcement or implementation of the act. The Federal Parity Law and the follow-up regulatory/sub-regulatory guidance is complex and sometimes ambiguous. Solutions are needed to help implement and enforce the Federal Parity Law and applicable state laws. This includes opportunities to help automate and document NQTL comparability analyses in writing and in operation to further validate that the plan is treating MH/SUD coverage requirements/payments in the same manner as medical/surgical care. Several tools exist that can help promote parity compliance including the U.S. DOL Self-Compliance Tool, the CMS Parity Compliance Toolkit for Medicaid/CHIP, the Six Step Parity Compliance Guide, and ClearHealth Quality Institute‚Äôs Online Parity Tool.

This law, which is administered by the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services, states that group health plans, insurance companies, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) must provide coverage for reconstructive surgery after mastectomy for breast cancer and prohibited \\"drive-through\\" mastectomies, where breast cancer patient's hospital stays were limited by their carriers. The required coverage includes all stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy was performed, surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance, prostheses, and treatment of physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema. The history of the law is an interesting one. Prior to 1998, although several states had laws requiring health insurance carriers to cover reconstructive surgery, there was no federal legislation and many states did not offer such protection. In addition, self- funded insurance plans, such as that often offered by unions, which fall under federal ERISA guidelines, also did not have such protection. A 32-year-old Long Island woman, Janet Franquet, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer in late 1997. She required a mastectomy, after chemotherapy to try to shrink her tumor, and desired reconstructive surgery to restore the breast. Upon contacting her insurance carrier, her reconstructive surgeon, Dr. Todd Wider, learned that her insurance plan, a self-funded plan, refused to cover the reconstructive surgery, and considered it cosmetic. The carrier recommended using a skin graft. Dr. Wider went ahead and performed the surgery for free, but he was outraged by the carrier's decision. Wider decided to begin a crusade to change the law. He contacted a number of politicians, and Senator Alphonse D'Amato became an outspoken supporter of legislation to change this. D'Amato led a nationwide bipartisan lobbying effort that culminated in legislation that he sponsored with Senator Dianne Feinstein, and 21 other senators. Speaking on the floor of the Congress, Senator D'Amato said when he had heard that the insurance carrier had denied Ms Franquet coverage for her surgery: \\"Mr. President, I decided that I would give Mrs. Franquet's insurance company a call. When I spoke with the Medical Director, he told me that 'replacement of a breast is not medically necessary. This is not a bodily function and therefore cannot and should not be replaced'...Luckily for her, Dr. Todd Wider agreed to forgo payment of this surgery... I ask you, Mr. President, how many other Janet Franquets are out there? Will they be lucky enough to have a Dr. Wider to take care of them?... Too many women have been denied reconstructive surgery because insurers have deemed the procedure cosmetic and not medically necessary. It is absolutely wrong\\". Numerous breast cancer patients and groups were supportive, including Long Island breast cancer advocacy groups and ACOG, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Mary Armao McCarthy, executive director of ACOG NYS and a breast cancer survivor whose coverage had been denied, was particularly active, as was Geri Barish, president of the Long Island breast cancer advocacy group, \\"1 in 9\\". On October 21, 1998, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) was signed into federal law and officially named ‚ÄúJanet‚Äôs Law.‚Äù Since the passage of this law, many thousands of women have had reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. While the 1998 Act was hugely significant, there is a proposed amendment to this act circulating in the State of California, calling for greater control over treatment implementation by women, coverage by board-certified surgeons who are breast specialists rather than medical generalists, and surgery at hospitals with appropriate length of stay rather than at a surgery center.

The name is probably Aboriginal of unknown meaning, or possibly is a Gaelic word meaning \\"cairn of the cattle\\" or \\"cattle rocks\\". The Midland Railway line was constructed through the area in 1894, and a siding was built close to the Macpherson's homestead. This in turn led to further settlement of the area. The Carnamah Progress Association was formed in 1912, and the Carnamah State School was established, and in 1913 the townsite was declared.

Since her father then married a young girl, Ay≈üe Afet decided to become a teacher to earn her own living.ƒ∞pek √áalƒ±≈ülar, Latife Hanƒ±m, ISBN Doƒüan Kitap, 2006, , p. 384. When they lived in Biga, her younger sister Nezihe was born to her father Ismail Hakki and his second wife. In 1920, she finished her six years of primary education. In 1921, they settled to Alanya. In 1922, she got a teaching qualification in Elmalƒ± and was assigned as headteacher to Elmalƒ± Girls' School. She graduated from the Bursa Teachers College for Girls in 1925, and started to work as a primary school teacher in Izmir. She met Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in October of the same year during his visit to Izmir. Sabiha (G√∂k√ßen), Afet (ƒ∞nan), and Zehra (Aylin), adopted daughters of M. K. Atat√ºrk. Afet was sent in 1925 by Atat√ºrk to Lausanne, Switzerland, to learn French. After returning to Turkey in 1927, she attended the French Lyc√©e Notre Dame de Sion Istanbul. On finishing there she was appointed as a secondary school teacher for history. In 1935, Afet ƒ∞nan went to Switzerland again and was a student of Eug√®ne Pittard at the University of Geneva between 1936 and 1938. In 1939, after graduating, she obtained a PhD in sociology. In 1950, she became a professor at the University of Ankara. She was the co-founder and a leading member of the Turkish Historical Society. ƒ∞nan died on June 8, 1985, in Ankara, leaving behind her daughter Arƒ± and her son Demir.

It is the second largest suburb in the city by population (behind Halswell), with a population of 13,137 at the 2018 Census. The suburb falls within the Christchurch Central electorate and is represented by Duncan Webb, who has been the MP since the general election of 2017. St Albans is one of the most diverse residential neighbourhoods in Christchurch, with a wide range of densities, architectural styles and housing ages throughout the suburb. It has everything from run-down high-density council-owned flats, to modern luxurious high-density flats and apartments; old mid-density workers cottages through to large low-density estates of various ages. History Originally a working- class settlement, St Albans was a separate borough from 1881 until 1903 when it became part of Christchurch City. St Albans was named after George Dickinson's farm, which lay to the south of the St Albans Creek. He had called his farm St Albans in memory of his cousin Harriet Mellon, an actress, who had become the Duchess of St Albans. Boundaries The suburb of St Albans is bordered by: * Merivale to the west (West of Papanui Road ‚Äì South of Innes Road) * Strowan to the north-west (West of Papanui Road ‚Äì North of Innes Road) * Papanui to the north (North of Tomes Road) * Mairehau to the north-east (East of Jamieson Avenue, Severn Street and Forfar Street ‚Äì North of Warrington Street) * Edgeware to the east (East of Forfar Street ‚Äì South of Warrington Street and East of Madras Street ‚Äì North of Bealey Avenue) * Christchurch Central City to the south (South of Bealey Avenue). Community facilities The hub of St Albans is Edgeware Village on Edgeware Road which contains a small number of well-supported shops. The suburb contains two primary schools, St Albans Primary School and St Albans Catholic School. The three main parks in the suburb are St Albans Park, Abberley Park, and Malvern Park. Sports facilities include Canterbury United Football Club's stadium, English Park, and Rugby Park, the home of the Crusaders professional rugby union team. St Albans News St Albans is known for its sense of cohesiveness and community spirit. This has manifested itself in the local monthly paper, the St Albans Neighbourhood News, which was first published by a group of local residents in 1993 and is still going to this day under the name of St Albans News. Distributed to 5,000 homes and businesses, the paper has recently been expanded to fill 16 pages. Over the years it has been central in numerous community-related issues including local planning, Packe Street Park, the Edgeware Road Tragedy, and the closure of Edgeware swimming pool (to which it was editorially opposed). After the community regained control of the pool site, it was announced that the pool would be rebuilt with a generous donation from a local resident. Earthquake damage The suburb escaped severe damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Many chimneys came down but only a few complete houses were affected. In the 22 February 2011 earthquake, however, the suburb was hit hard. Many houses, supermarkets, and shops were significantly damaged with a lot ending up totally demolished. In July 2011, the demolition of the former library, which houses the community centre, was ordered by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. By 2014 the extent of the damage to drainage systems and lowered ground levels had become apparent, with the regular flooding of a series of streets known as the Flockton Basin. Inconsistencies The borders of St Albans are often disputed, particularly by real estate agents who often list upper-class properties that lie within western St Albans as belonging to Merivale instead. The original borough of St Albans stretched to include most of modern-day Edgeware, Mairehau and Merivale as well as the current St Albans suburb. There is a sign off of Bealey Avenue which points to St Albans down Barbadoes Street which is actually in the middle of the suburb of Edgeware instead of St Albans.

San Giorgio Castle. Details of Pisanello's frescoes in the \\"Hall of Pisanello\\". The Palazzo Ducale di Mantova (\\"Ducal Palace\\") is a group of buildings in Mantua, Lombardy, northern Italy, built between the 14th and the 17th century mainly by the noble family of Gonzaga as their royal residence in the capital of their Duchy. The buildings are connected by corridors and galleries and are enriched by inner courts and wide gardens. The complex includes some 500 rooms and occupies an area of c. 34,000 m¬≤. Although most famous for Mantegna's frescos in the Camera degli Sposi (Wedding Room), they have many other very significant architectural and painted elements. The Gonzaga family lived in the palace from 1328 to 1707, when the dynasty died out. Subsequently, the buildings saw a sharp decline, which was halted in the 20th century with a continuing process of restoration and the designation of the area as museum. In 1998, a hidden room was discovered by Palace scholars, led by musicologist Paula Bezzutti. The room is thought to have been used for performances of Monteverdi's music in the late 16th century.Howard Goodall, Big Bangs, 2000 Corte Vecchia The entrance of the palace is from Piazza Sordello, onto which the most ancient buildings, the Palazzo del Capitano and the Magna Domus, open. They formed the original nucleus of the so-called Corte Vecchia. The Palazzo del Capitano (\\"Captain's Palace\\") was built in the late 13th century by the Captain of the People Guido Buonacolsi (whose family ruled Mantua from 1271 to 1328). Initially built on two floors and separated from the Magna Domus (Latin: \\"Big House\\") by an alley, in the early 14th century it received a further floor and was united to the Magna Domus by a large fa√ßade with a portico. The additional floor consists of a huge hall (67x15 m), known as \\"Hall of the Weapon Room\\" of \\"Hall of Diet\\", as it housed the Diet of Mantua in 1459. The monumental Scalone delle Duchesse (\\"Duchesses' Staircase\\"), built in the 17th century and renovated in 1779 by Paolo Pozzo, leads to the Room of the Morone, named after the 1494 canvas of the Veronese painter Domenico Morone, portraying the Expulsion of the Bonacolsi in 1328. In the noble floor of the Captain's Palace is the First Room of Guastalla, with a fresco frieze with portraits of the Gonzaga family, which once extended to the successive room, the \\"Room of Pisanello\\", from the artist who, from 1433, painted a series of frescoes depicting a Tournament and other scenes, which were left unfinished. His commissioner, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, is portrayed in the paintings. The frescoes were rediscovered and restored in the 1960s and 1970s. =Apartment of Isabella d'Este= In 1519 Isabella d'Este moved her residence from the Castle of St. George to this older sector of the Gonzaga palace, in the so-called \\"Widow Apartment\\". Isabella's apartment included two wings now divided by the entrance to the Cortile d'Onore (\\"Honour Court\\"). The \\"Grotto Wing\\" housed the wooden furnitures and the paintings from her famous studiolo, commissioned from 1496 to 1505 to Mantegna (Parnassus and Triumph of the Virtues), Lorenzo Costa the Elder (Isabella d'Este in the Realm of Harmony and the Realm of Komos) and Perugino (Combat of Love and Chastity), as well as new ones by Correggio (Allegory of Vice and Allegory of Virtue). Another hall in the same wing is the Camera Granda or Scalcheria, frescoed in 1522 by the Mantuan artist Lorenzo Leonbruno. The apartment included further halls in the so-called \\"Wing of Santa Croce\\", from the name of a church of the time of Matilda of Canossa, over whose remains were built rooms such as the Sala delle Imprese Isabelliane (\\"Wing of Isabella's Deeds\\"), the Sala Imperiale (\\"Imperial Hall\\"), Sala delle Calendule (\\"Hall of the Calendulae\\"), Sala delle Targhe and Sala delle Imprese. Later Guglielmo X Gonzaga, in the 16th century, transformed the rooms of the Corte Vecchia creating the Refectory, facing the Hanging Garden, and the Sala dello Specchio (\\"Hall of the Mirror\\"), used for music. =Apartment of the Tapestries= During the Habsburg rule in Mantua, the Refectory was refurbished, with the creation of the Sala dei Fiumi (\\"Hall of the Rivers\\") with paintings on the walls on which the rivers in the Mantuan territory are portrayed as giants. At the same time was created the Appartamento degli Arazzi (\\"Apartment of the Tapestries\\"), comprising four halls. Three of the latter have tapestries, executed in Flanders from the Raphael Cartoons (now Victoria & Albert Museum) by Raphael, designed for the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican Palace. They were bought at Brussels by Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga in the early 16th century to decorate what at the time was called the Green Apartment. After decorating the Palatine church of St. Barbara and a period in the Ducal Palace's stores, the Flemish tapestries were restored in 1799 and placed in the current location.\\"I cartoni di Raffaello e le altre serie di arazzi\\", Ducal Palace, Mantua, website A further restoration was carried on during the Napoleonic Wars in the Sala dello Zodiaco (\\"Hall of the Zodiac\\"), also known as \\"Napoleon I's Hall\\", after the French emperor slept there. Castle of St. George The Castle of St. George (Castello di San Giorgio) was built from 1395 and finished in 1406 under commission by Francesco I Gonzaga, designed by Bartolino da Novara, one of the most renowned military architects of the time. It has a square plan with four corner towers, surrounded by a ditch with three entrances, each one with a drawbridge. In 1459 architect Luca Fancelli, commissioned by marquis Ludovico III Gonzaga, who assigned several rooms of the Corte Vecchia for the Council of Mantua called by Pope Pius II, restored the castle, which definitely lost its military and defensive function. Camera degli Sposi, view of the north and west walls =Camera degli Sposi= The Camera Picta (Latin: \\"Painted Chamber\\") or Camera degli Sposi (Italian: \\"Bridal Chamber\\") is the most famous room of the palace, known for its frescoes executed by Andrea Mantegna, from 1465 to 1475, as attested by slab celebrating the end of the works. The painter's decoration creates an illusionistic space, as if the chamber was a loggia with three openings facing country landscapes among arcades and curtains. The painted scenes portrays members of the Gonzaga family. Domus Nova Map of Rome in the Ducal Palace of Mantua The Domus Nova (Latin: \\"New House\\") was originally designed by Luca Fancelli in 1480-84\\\\. During the reign of Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga (1562-1612) the edifice was renovated, creating the current Appartamento Ducale (\\"Ducal Apartment\\") designed in 1595 by Cremonese artist and architect Antonio Maria Viani. The Galleria Nuova (\\"New Corridor\\") was constructed in 1778 by Giuseppe Piermarini to connect the Guastalla apartment to the Ducal apartment. It houses several altarpieces from the early 16th century to the late 18th century by Francesco Borgani, Carlo Bononi, Spagnoletto and others. The gallery leads to the huge Sala degli Arcieri (\\"Room of the Archers\\"), the site of Duke Vincenzo's original apartment. Here can be found a celebrated altarpiece by Peter Paul Rubens (1605), formerly part of a triptych for the church of Santissima Trinit√† in Mantua, portraying the Gonzaga Family in Adoration of the Holy Trinity, as well as other paintings from now-suppressed churches and monasteries. This room opens to the Galleria degli Specchi (\\"Hall of Mirrors\\"), built as an open loggia under Vincenzo I, with frescoes by two pupils of Guido Reni and neoclassicist decoration dating from 1773-79\\\\. Scala Santa. Under his apartment in the Domus Nova, Vincenzo Gonzaga's son, Cardinal (later Duke) Ferdinand (1587‚Äì1626) had Viani design a series of ever-smaller rooms, long known as the Appartamento dei nani (\\"Dwarves' Apartments\\") and believed to have been built to house the celebrated court dwarves of Mantua. In 1979, however, Italian art historian Renato Berzaghi convincingly demonstrated that these tiny rooms are instead an exact reproduction of an ancient Roman original: the Scala Santa (\\"Holy Stairway\\") of St. John Lateran in Rome, and were intended for devotional purposes. Corte Nuova The main feature of the Corte Nuova (\\"New Court\\") is the Sala di Manto, once the entrance to the \\"Apartment of Troy\\", which takes its name from the frescoes (1538‚Äì1539) by collaborators of Giulio Romano, commissioned by Federico II Gonzaga to restore several rooms in the Palace. The current appearance of the Sala del Manto dates to the intervention of Guglielmo X, who ordered the creation of the Appartamento Grande di Castello (\\"Large Apartment of the Castle\\"). The frescoes in the hall depict the story of Troy, preceded by the arrival in Italy of Manto, a legendary daughter of Tiresias. Fa√ßade of Santa Barbara. Palatine church of Santa Barbara Bell tower of church of Santa Barbara. The church of Santa Barbara, which had the role of Palace chapel (\\"Basilica Palatina\\") for the Gonzagas, was built in 1562-1572 by Giovanni Battista Bertani, commissioned by Duke Guglielmo.Palatine Basilica of Santa Barbara Website (italian) As a basilica, it was allowed religious ceremonies with some degree of independence in the liturgy used.Dixon, Graham. ‚ÄúMonteverdi's Vespers of 1610: 'Della Beata Vergine'?‚Äù.

The church has a central plan, with a square tiburium in the middle, followed by a raised semicircular presbytery covered by another tiburium, similar to the other one, and ending into a scenographic apse decorated with coffers. Under the presbytery is the crypt with an oval memorial. The bell tower has a square plan, and is topped by a small temple. Recently the remains of four dukes and other members of the Gonzaga family, including those of Guglielmo, were discovered in the church. The interior contains two lateral altars, surmounted by large canvas altarpieces by Lorenzo Costa the younger, depicting The Baptism of Emperor Costantine and the Martyrdom of Sant‚ÄôAdrian. The presbytery has a painting of Martyrdom of St Barbara (1564), by Domenico Brusasorci; and an Annunciation by Fermo Ghisoni beside the organ. Ghisoni also painted around 1566, the St Barbara and San Peter on the other side. =Organ= In 1565 the church was provided with an organ in 1565 by Graziadio Antegnati, a member of a distinguished family of organ builders. The organ was restored in 1995.The Santa Barbara Organ Gardens and courtyards Giardino pensile *Cortile della Cavallerizza, designed by Giovanni Battista Bertani, who in 1556 adapted the style of the buildings surrounding this courtyard to the Mannerist style of Giulio Romano characterizing the pre-existing palace, called \\"La Rustica\\", which also faced it.

It was discovered by Eugene Herman in 1972. The IV administration of dexrazoxane is in acidic condition with HCl adjusting the pH. Uses Dexrazoxane has been used to protect the heart against the cardiotoxic side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines, such as daunorubicin or doxorubicin or other chemotherapeutic agents. However, in July 2011 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released a statement restricting use only in adult patients with cancer who have received > 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin or > 540 mg/m2 epirubicin and general approval for use for cardioprotection. That showed a possibly higher rate of secondary malignancies and acute myelogenous leukemia in pediatric patients treated for different cancers with both dexrazoxane and other chemotherapeutic agents that are associated with secondary malignancies. On July 19, 2017, based on evaluation of the currently available data the European Commission issued an EU-wide legally binding decision to implement the recommendations of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on dexrazoxane and lifted its 2011-contraindication for primary prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity with dexrazoxane in children and adolescents where high doses (‚â• 300 mg/m3) of anthracyclines are anticipated. Dexrazoxane was designated by the US FDA as an orphan drug for \\"prevention of cardiomyopathy for children and adults 0 through 16 years of age treated with anthracyclines\\". This decision allows virtually all children to receive dexrazoxane starting with the first dose of anthracycline at the discretion of the treating provider. The label change by the agency announcing dexrazoxane as an approved cardio- oncology protectant has been followed by a review by the agency. Currently, the only FDA and EMA approved cardioprotective treatment for anthracycline cardioprotection is dexrazoxane, which provides effective primary cardioprotection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity without reducing anthracycline activity and without enhancing secondary malignancies. The United States Food and Drug Administration has also approved a dexrazoxane for use as a treatment of extravasation resulting from IV anthracycline chemotherapy.Totect label on FDA's website Extravasation is an adverse event in which chemotherapies containing anthracylines leak out of the blood vessel and necrotize the surrounding tissue. Mechanism As a derivative of EDTA, dexrazoxane chelates iron and thus reduces the number of metal ions complexed with anthracycline and, consequently, decrease the formation of superoxide radicals. The exact chelation mechanism is unknown, but it has been postulated that dexrazoxane can be converted into ring-opened form intracellularly and interfere with iron-mediated free radical generation that is in part thought to be responsible for anthryacycline induced cardiomyopathy. It was speculated that dexrazoxane could be used for further investigation to synthesize new antimalarial drugs.

The commission is composed of Sport Australia and the Australian Institute of Sport, taking the branding and identity of the former. History Although it is commonly believed that the Australian Government's initial involvement in sports was prompted by the country's poor performance at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games in which Australia failed to win a gold medal, the Government actually began initial investigations into its potential role in sports in 1973. It was at this time that the Government commissioned professor John Bloomfield to prepare a sports plan for the country. His report, \\"The Role, Scope and Development of Recreation in Australia\\", was based on studies of sports institutes in Europe and their success in developing elite athletes. Bloomfield suggested to the Government that it should establish a national institute of sport similar to those operating in European countries. Following receipt of the report, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, Frank Stewart, appointed a study group (chaired by Dr Allan Coles) to report on the feasibility of establishing a sports institute in Australia. The Coles Report was released in 1975 and recommended the establishment of the institute. Although the recommendation to establish the institute was made in 1975, it was not until 1981 that the institute was established. The delay in establishing the institute is commonly considered to be a combination of poor support for Australian sport following the 1976 Montreal Olympics and the uneasiness between the Australian Olympic Federation (now the Australian Olympic Committee) and the Government. This uneasiness was caused over the Federation ignoring the Government's request to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games because of Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. The Bloomfield and Coles reports, however, were not lost on Bob Ellicott, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Buoyed by the concept of a national sports institute during a trip to China and keen to bridge the gap between government and sport, in 1980 Ellicott and his staff offered the Coles Report as a model plan for Australia. The plan would allow athletes to train and develop in Australia rather than be forced overseas. Ellicott's vision was well received and on Australia Day, 26 January 1981, the AIS was officially opened by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Renowned swim coach, Don Talbot was appointed as the Institute's first Director. With the Institute established, the Commonwealth Government had begun its significant involvement in Australian sport. The Australian Labor Party in its 1983 election sport policy recommended the establishment of a sports commission to provide a more co- ordinated approach to sport. In 1984, an Interim Committee report recommended its establishment. The Australian Sports Commission was formally established by the Australian Sports Commission Act 1985. In August 1987, the Australian Government formalised their decision to rationalise federal assistance to Australian sport and the Australian Institute of Sport merged with the Australian Sports Commission, which was to be the agency responsible for general sports participation as well as high performance sport. Since its establishment, the ASC has implemented several major Australian Government sports policies: * 1989 ‚Äì Australian Sports Kit * 1992 ‚Äì Maintain the Momentum * 1994 ‚Äì Olympic Athlete Program * 2001 ‚Äì Backing Australia's Sporting Ability * 2010 ‚Äì Australian Sport : the Pathway to Success * 2012 ‚Äì Australia's Winning Edge * 2018 ‚Äì Sport 2030 - National Sport Plan Administration ASC is located at the AIS site in Canberra. Sports Visitor Centre on the left, AIS arena at the back right The ASC is a statutory authority of the Australian Government, that is governed by a board of Commissioners appointed by the Minister for Sport. The ASC's roles and responsibilities are prescribed in the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989. The ASC attempts to promote an effective national sports system that offers improved participation in quality sports by all Australians. In addition, the ASC helps those who are talented and motivated to reach their potential excellence in sports performance. The ASC achieves these objectives by administering and funding national sporting programs on behalf of the Government and providing leadership, co-ordination and support for the sport sector. The ASC works closely with a range of national sporting organisations, state and local governments, schools and community organisations to ensure sport is well run and accessible so that everyone can participate and enjoy the benefits. The ASC supports participation in sport, from grass roots participation to participation at the elite level.

The structure has generally represented the areas of high performance sport, sports participation, sport management and corporate/commercial services. The AIS has been an elite sport flagship program of the ASC since its merger in 1989. =Australian Institute of Sport= The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) is the best known division of the ASC. In 2011, Minister for Sport Mark Arbib announced the AIS would take responsibility for the strategic direction of high performance sport in Australia. In November 2012, the ASC released \\"Australia's Winning Edge 2012‚Äì2022\\", a high performance sport plan, which highlighted a new role for the AIS particularly in terms of developing coaches and talent identification but not directly managing national sports organisations elite athlete programs as it had done since 1981.

It is approximately 10 km long and is estimated to be in depth. The lake is named after the American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth. The surface of the lake itself is located over below sea level. Exploration Lake Ellsworth was discovered in 1996 by British scientist Professor Martin Siegert of the University of Bristol;Evidence of Lake Ellsworth (1996) it is one of 387 known subglacial Antarctic lakes and it is a target site for exploration due to the speculation that new forms of microbial life could have evolved in the unique habitats of Antarctica‚Äôs sub- glacial lakes after half a million years of isolation.Siegert, Martin J. and the Lake Ellsworth Consortium, \\"Exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth\\", Poster, University of Bristol, September 2004 Life in subglacial lakes would have to adapt to total darkness, low nutrient levels, high water pressure, and isolation from the atmosphere. Subglacial lakes thus represent unique biological habitats. The lake remains liquid deep below the Antarctic surface because the pressure exerted by thousands of meters of ice drives down the freezing point of water.Antarctica Researchers Seek Life in Lake 2 Miles Under Ice . By Alex Morales. September 7, 2012 On 2 March 2009 the UK's Natural Environment Research Council authorized a team of British scientists to drill through the overlaying ice to the surface of the lake in December 2012. The drilling was to be overseen by The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research from the International Council for Science (ICSU).SALE plan for subglacial lake exploration The British team spent sixteen years developing the technology to explore the lake using methods that would not lead to chemical or biological contamination.Search for Life in Antarctica's Ice-Covered Lake Takes Off. By Trevor Stokes, September 7, 2012 Scientists hoped to use a hot water jet to drill a borehole 36 centimeters (14 inches) wide down through the ice to the lake, to enable a probe to retrieve sediment and water to be analyzed for microorganisms. This would be a test to determine if water correlates with life under extreme pressure, cold and nutrient deficiencies. If the group could not find life, it would inform a limit where there is water and no life. Radar surveys indicated that the lake floor sediments are suitable for coring, which could contain a record of ice sheet history. Scientists think that the sediment and water samples could also hold key information about climate change. In January 2012 the drilling was scheduled to start between November 2012 and January 2013. Depending on the weather, the team expected to drill continuously for 100 hours to reach the lake. On 12 December 2012 the British research team of twelve scientists and engineers began to bore the ice-sheet to obtain water samples. Using a high-pressure hose and sterilised water at near-boiling point, they hoped to bore a passage through more than two miles of ice. The drilling process was expected to last five days and would be followed by a rapid sampling operation. Professor Siegert said that the search for life in such an extreme environment could open up possibilities for life on other worlds such as Jupiter's moon Europa. \\"Drilling begins at lake hidden beneath Antarctic\\" by David Shukman at bbc.co.uk On 25 December 2012 it was announced that the project had been called off, after attempts to link two 300m-deep boreholes failed. From the principal investigator, Professor Martin Siegert: > Drilling stopped after the team was unable to form the water-filled cavity > 300 metres beneath the ice. This cavity was to link the main borehole with a > secondary borehole used to recirculate drilling water back to the surface. > On Christmas Eve we took the decision to cease our efforts to directly > measure and sample Subglacial Lake Ellsworth. Although circumstances have > not worked out as we would have wished, I am confident that through the huge > efforts of the field team, and our colleagues in the UK, we have done as > much as we possibly could have done, and I sincerely thank them all. I am > also hugely grateful to the UK Natural Environment Research Council for > making it possible for us to attempt the direct exploration of subglacial > Antarctica. Sixteen years ago, we hypothesised that deep-water subglacial > lakes are viable habitats for life, and contain important records of ice and > climate history. For now, these hypotheses remain untested. Once back in the > UK I will gather our consortium to seek ways in which our research efforts > may continue. I remain confident that we will unlock the secrets of Lake > Ellsworth in coming seasons. > The first borehole was drilled to a depth of 300m and then left at that > depth for 12 hours to create the cavity. The second, main borehole (located > 2m away from the first) was then drilled to 300m depth and should have > immediately connected with this cavity. This main borehole would then > continue through the cavity and down to the lake while the first borehole > would be used to recirculate water back to the surface using a submersible > pump. In this way, the ice cavity can be used to balance the level of water > in the boreholes and hence balance the pressure from the lake upon > breakthrough. > For reasons that are yet to be determined the team could not establish a > link between the two boreholes at 300m depth, despite trying for over 20 > hours. During this process, hot water seeped into the porous surface layers > of ice and was lost. The team attempted to replenish this water loss by > digging and melting more snow, but their efforts could not compensate. The > additional time taken to attempt to establish the cavity link significantly > depleted the fuel stocks to such a level as to render the remaining > operation unviable.

Disaster The accident occurred outside Ibadan, on a stretch of motorway connecting Ibadan and Ife in Osun State to the East, about 250 km north of Lagos. Nigeria suffers heavy traffic circulation problems, and this day was no exception, with a large traffic jam covering all lanes of the road and numerous pedestrians weaving in between them. A large petrol tanker, bringing fuel to Ifan, was travelling on the same road at high speed, when it suddenly encountered the traffic jam and attempted to come to a halt. At this point, the poorly maintained vehicle suffered a total brake failure, and ploughed straight into the queue of cars ahead. The numbers killed in the initial collision were probably high, but they will never be known, because the tanker, which had finally come to rest on its side had begun to leak its highly flammable load onto the roadway. Within seconds, this trail was alight, and the tanker disappeared in an enormous fireball, which rose above the city and devastated a wide area around the accident scene. Those still in their cars, trapped in the crash wreckage, or standing too close were immolated instantly, while those further away were burnt to death or hit by flying shrapnel from the blast. Burning wreckage caused several small fires in nearby suburbs. Casualties Estimates of casualties in the disaster remain imprecise. The police and other rescue services did not offer any assistance until some time after the blast, and so numerous bodies were removed by relatives or volunteer rescuers and privately buried, whilst others were cremated in the fire. Most sources simply give a vague \\"over 100 dead\\" despite the official count of 96 recovered bodies, and offer statements that \\"the final death toll could be much higher\\". What is certain is that local hospitals were totally swamped with hundreds of badly injured burn victims, creating a major crisis in the country's health service, which simply could not cope with so many badly injured patients in this area. The Nigerian police reported that they had recovered 115 destroyed vehicles from the roadway in the aftermath of the accident, implying a substantially higher death toll than initially quoted. Later sources however are restricted to using high round figures rather than accurate data, with Namibian sources reporting 150 killed, whilst Indian newspapers suggesting 200 died. Clearly the real figure is not known and never will be known, because of the failure of the authorities to deal effectively with the crisis. Their failure to do so stirred a serious and violent controversy in Nigeria. Controversy The crash was surrounded by major controversy because in the previous four months over 150 people had been killed in high profile crashes involving petrol tankers and buses. These crashes had led to such incidents as the Abuja bus crash riots, in which four more people had been killed, as well as growing resentment of the police and civil authorities who failed to take any responsibility for the country's appalling road safety record. The reason that the police were not present at the scene is a complicated one. The police force with jurisdiction in this region was the Osun State Police, who have been the subjects of numerous corruption complaints. According to local sources, the reason that so many cars were lined up on the motorway before the crash was that the State Police were exacting a toll from motorists from an impromptu roadblock they had set up. This protection racket is what local people said led to the disaster because it caused a jam at an unusual place, causing the tanker driver to brake suddenly, fail, and crash. The State Police emphatically deny this charge, instead insisting that the jam was due to roadworks, and that there was not one single police officer in the district at the time of the crash. What is certain, is that when a police car did arrive at the still blazing accident site shortly after the crash, and was attacked by a furious mob, set alight and destroyed, the four occupants escaping only after receiving a beating. A police statement said that: \\"It is not true that our men were collecting bribes on the road. In fact, there was no policeman on duty at the time of the accident. The accident was caused by the narrowness of the road and the impatience of motorists. They destroyed our van to protest our alleged cause of the accident. It is unfortunate.\\" See also * List of explosions External links *BBC News Report *\\"The Hindu\\" News Snippet *\\"The Namibian\\" News Report Category:Explosions in 2000 Category:Fires in Nigeria Category:Road incidents in Nigeria Category:2000 road incidents Category:2000 in Nigeria Category:2000 fires Category:Tank trucks Category:November 2000 events in Africa ","title":"Ibadan road tanker explosion"},{"id":"4850602","text":"Malanda Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition (2005). Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a rural town and locality in the Tablelands Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , Malanda had a population of 1,985 people. The economy is based upon agriculture (particularly dairy) and tourism.  Geography  Malanda is on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, from Cairns and above sea level. The town is located downstream of the Malanda Falls on the North Johnstone River. The northern entrance to the town passes the Malanda Falls. In comparison to the gorges of the escarpment the falls were created by the last flow of lava from the Malanda Shield Volcano with a cascade of roughly 4 metres. The town's unofficial swimming pool lies at the bottom of the falls, as there is an established pool located near the primary school. The name 'Malanda', according to some sources, was the local Aboriginal word meaning 'waterfalls'. Malanda Milk The name Malanda is synonymous throughout North Queensland with milk and cheese. Local promoters, noting that Malanda milk is sold in the Northern Territory and as far north as Weipa, declared Malanda to be 'the headquarters for one of the largest and longest milk runs in the world'. The milk is also exported to Indonesia and Malaysia. Malanda Milk is now a part of Dairy Farmers, but with a shorter milk run, only as far south as Mackay and as far north as Darwin. History Malanda formed part of Ngajanji territory. The name Malanda comes from Malanda Creek, and is believed to be an Aboriginal name for the Upper Johnstone River, with the suggested meaning little stream with big stones or running rivers. Malanda first developed in the 1900s after the discovery of tin and copper at Herberton saw a steady stream of miners and engineers moving over the mountains from the coast. In 1886 a decision was made to build a railway coming into the area but the problems of construction outweighed its use. Over of railway was installed into the region in the next six years. By 1890 the Tablelands railway line had reached Kuranda. It pushed on to Mareeba in 1893 and Atherton in 1903 and did not reach Malanda until 1911. The line closed in 1964. In 1908, James English (later the publican of the Malanda Hotel and father of Charles English) and James Emerson both moved into the area. Both saw the district's dairy potential. English brought cattle from Kiama and the Richmond River areas in New South Wales and Emerson had a herd of 1,026 cattle overlanded from Lismore. They took 16 months to reach Malanda and only 560 survived the journey. Despite this arduous start the industry grew and by 1919 Malanda had its own butter factory. In 1973 this amalgamated with the factory in Millaa Millaa to form the Atherton Tablelands Co-operative Dairy Association. In 1910, in response to a developing local industry, John Prince established a sawmill in Malanda. It was from this mill that the boards for the Malanda Hotel (built in 1911) were sawn. Malanda Post Office opened by January 1912 (a receiving office had been open from 1911). Malanda State School opened on 4 August 1913. From 1949 until 1961, it also offered secondary education, until Malanda State High School opened on 23 January 1961. The Malanda Library and Customer Service Centre building opened in 1990. At the Malanda had a population of 1,009 people. At the Malanda had a population of 2,052 people.

He progressed explanations as to why people make certain consistent mistakes in logical reasoning. He designed problems and tests to demonstrate these processes, for example the Wason selection task, the THOG problem and the 2-4-6 problem. He also coined the term \\"confirmation bias\\" to describe the tendency for people to immediately favor information that validates their preconceptions, hypotheses and personal beliefs regardless of whether they are true or not. Personal life Wason was born in Bath Somerset on 22 April 1924, and died at seventy-nine in Wallingford, Oxfordshire on 17 April 2003. Peter Wason was the grandson to Eugene Wason, and the son to Eugene Monier and Kathleen (Woodhouse) Wason. Wason married Marjorie Vera Salberg in 1951, and the couple had two children, Armorer and Sarah. Peter Wason endured his schooling, which was marked by consistent failure. With the beginning of World War II, Wason completed officer training in Sandhurst, and continued on to serve as a liaison officer for England's Eight Independent Armoured Brigade. In the Year 1945 Wason returned home, having been released from his duties of being an officer due to extreme injuries. Wason then pursued more academic ventures by studying English at Oxford in 1948, and continued on to become a lecturer at the Aberdeen college. After the realization that he did not really prefer English, and actually found it quite boring, Wason attended Oxford University to obtain a master's degree in psychology in 1953, and then a doctorate in 1956 from University College London. He remained teaching at University College London until his retirement in the early 1980s. Early studies Much of Peter Wason‚Äôs first areas of experimentation was not in the field of psychology of reasoning, but instead, language and psycholinguistics. Wason and Jones performed an experiment in which subjects were asked to evaluate numerical statements, such as ‚Äú7 is even‚Äù and ‚Äú9 is not odd‚Äù, and state whether the statement is true or false. The results revealed that affirmative assertions were evaluated faster as true than as false, but evaluation of negative assertions occurred faster as false than true. From these results, Wason came to the conclusion that negatives are used in daily lives and discourse to correct common misconceptions. An example of this usage would be ‚ÄúThe chair is not here‚Äù. Wason continued to explore and experiment in the field of psycholinguistics. Alongside Susan Carey at the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, Wason found that context affects comprehension of an utterance, measured in time taken to respond. Participants were likely to respond more quickly to the statement ‚ÄúCircle number 4 is not blue‚Äù in a context in which all of the other circles were red. Wason came to the conclusion context affects comprehension. The Beginning of the Psychology of Reasoning Before the creation of psychology of reasoning, it was a commonly held belief that humans reasoned by logical analysis. Wason argued against this logicism, saying that humans are unable to reason, and quite frequently fall prey to biases. Wason thought many of the things in his life were inconsistent and therefore unreasonable. When he designed his experiments, Wason's goal was to examine the illogical nature of humans. Wason also wanted to look further into the confirmation bias, the tendency to strive toward proving one‚Äôs hypothesis instead of disproving it. =Wason and the 2-4-6 Task= In 1960 Wason developed the first of many tasks he would devise to reveal the failures of human reasoning. The ‚Äú2-4-6‚Äù task was the first experiment that showed people to be illogical and irrational. In this study, subjects were told that the experimenter had a rule in mind that only applied to sets of threes. The ‚Äú2-4-6‚Äù rule the experimenter had in mind was ‚Äúany ascending sequence‚Äù. In most cases, subjects not only formed hypotheses that were more specific than necessary, but they also only tested positive examples of their hypothesis. Wason was surprised by the large number of subjects who failed to get the task correct. The subjects failed to test instances inconsistent with their own hypothesis, which further supported Wason‚Äôs hypothesis of confirmation bias. =The Four-Card Task= Wason created the Selection Task, also known as the 4-card task, in 1966. In this task, participants were exposed to four cards on a table, and given a rule by the experimenter. The participants were then told to choose just cards to determine if the rule given to them by the experimenter was true or false. As Wason expected, a majority of participants failed to answer the question correctly. Only ten percent of participants solved this task correctly. The confirmation bias played a large part in this result, as participants usually chose cards to confirm their hypothesis, instead of eliminating it. =THOG Task= Wason devised yet another task, called the THOG task, to further his studies in psychology of reasoning. In this task, participants were shown cards with a white diamond, a black diamond, a white circle, and a black circle. They were then given a rule, and instructed to choose which of the cards would be a THOG, which were not, and which could not be classified. The THOG task required subjects to carry out a combinational analysis, a feat an adult should be able to accomplish, using reason and logic. That being said, half of the participants answered the problem incorrectly. Approach to experimentation Peter Wason took a rather unconventional approach to his studies. When running experiments, he took a more active approach. Although he had some lab aides, he insisted on being present when experiments were run, so he could actively watch the subjects‚Äô behavior throughout the process. It is also said that Wason infused a clinical psychology atmosphere into his study by asking his subjects how they felt about the experiment itself, as well as the results delivered. These evaluations were recorded and placed in his papers, giving them a more personal and unique feel than many other academic papers of the time. Wason‚Äôs goal was to discover new psychological phenomena and new aspects of human behavior, and not only to test his own hypotheses. Publications Wason wrote the following books: * Thinking and Reasoning, (co-edited with P N Johnson-Laird, 1968) * Psychology of Reasoning: Structure and Content, (with P N Johnson-Laird, 1972) * Thinking: Readings in Cognitive Science, (co-edited with P N Johnson-Laird, 1977) * The Psychology of Chess, (with William Hartston, 1983).

It is the highest point in the Babusar Valley that can be easily accessed by cars. The Babusar Pass connects Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Gilgit Baltistan. It is one of the most dangerous routes in Gilgit-Baltistan. Every year many deaths happen here due to the mountainous slopes, which are among the most dangerous in the world. The most common reason for death is the brake failure of cars due to inexperience. Babusar Top was originally known as Babur Top, originating from the fact that the Mughal emperor Babur used to pass through this area in the early 16th century. Nowadays however, it is commonly referred to as Babusar Top. The Kaghan Valley is at its best during summer (from May to September). In May, the maximum temperature is 11¬∞C (52¬∞F) and the minimum temperature is 3¬∞C (37¬∞F). From the middle of July up to the end of September the road beyond Naran is open right up to the Babusar Pass. However, movement is restricted during the monsoon and winter seasons. The Kaghan area can be accessed by road via the cities of Islamabad or Peshawar. The mountain ranges which enter the Mansehra District from Kashmir are the offshoots of the great Himalayan system. In the Kaghan Valley, the mountain system is the highest of the area including the Babusar Top. This range flanks the right bank of the Kunhar River, and contains a peak called Malika Parbat, which is over 17,000 feet (19) and is the highest in the district. On the mountains the grasslands are also found where Gujjars and other nomads migrate during the summer for grazing by their sheep, goats and other animals. On the north side there are mountains which are the extension of the same mountain system as that of the Kaghan mountains. This range diverges from the eastern side at Musa-ka-Musalla a peak (13,378 feet) (20), which skirt the north end of the Bhogarmang and Konsh valleys, and sends down a spur to divide the two. Here also, like Kaghan, thick forests are naturally present, especially on the higher slopes. However, due to extensive exploitation, the thick forests are now usually found in the unapproachable areas.

His role helping underground Jews survive in hiding in Berlin and his execution are documented in The Forger, the memoirs of Cioma Sch√∂nhaus. Kaufmann was born to Jewish parents on 5 January 1886 and baptized a Protestant. He served in the first World War in the 10th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment receiving, among other medals, the Iron Cross. After being wounded he was discharged from the army in 1918 as a reserve lieutenant. He obtained a doctorate in law and political science and in 1922 was appointed to a specialist post in government finances in the Prussian ministry of the interior. He later became chief secretary of the Reich Public Accounts Office, in the finance ministry. In 1936, because of his Jewish origins, he was dismissed from his post as chief secretary. When World War II broke out in 1939, he volunteered for the Red Cross but was refused, again due to his Jewish origins. He continued to enjoy privileged status due his then so-called racially mixed marriage to an Aryan- classified woman and because he brought up his daughter as a Christian. Kaufmann joined a bible study group with The Confessing Church at Berlin- Dahlem in 1940, and‚Äîwith other members of the church‚Äîbegan to supply post- office identity cards to on-the-run Jews. Ultimately he headed an underground group that created and supplied all manner of fake documents to underground Jews, including certificates of Aryan descent, driving licenses, and food ration cards. These documents were essential to the survival of many Berlin Jews. He was arrested in August 1943. No charges were laid against him, since as a Jew under the Third Reich he was subject not to German law but to police power. On 17 February 1944 he was taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp and shot.

Overview The forest covers around , and consists mainly of pine and spruce trees. It takes its name from the Afon Hafren () which rises in a deep peat bog approximately outside western boundary of the forest, high on the slopes of Pumlumon, the highest mountain in Mid Wales. History The forest, planted in 1937, is continually changing with felling and planting of trees. The forest is also home to Bronze Age copper and lead mines, most notably \\"Nant yr Eira\\" and possibly \\"Nant yr Rickett\\". The creation of the forest in 1937 involved the purchase of twelve upland sheep farms, including \\"Rhyd y Benwch\\" which is now the location of a car park and picnic area. Although the farms were not left derelict, they could not provide enough accommodation for forest workers in this sparsely-populated area. At first, with the initial small size of the forest, enough workers could be found locally. Later, workers were transported from Llanidloes. This was unsustainable, and in 1948, the Forestry Commission decided to build a village near Staylittle, to house forestry workers. They employed an eminent architect, T. Alwyn Lloyd of Cardiff, to produce plans for a village that would eventually comprise eighty houses, a village shop, school and hall. As a first development, twenty houses were built on the site, with eight more a few miles away: these provided accommodation for half the workers. Construction began in 1949, with the first houses being occupied in 1951. The water supplies for the village, known as Llwyn-y-gog (or Llwynygog), were provided by damming of a nearby stream. The source of the River Severn, near Hafren Forest Present day use Although the forest still produces timber for Natural Resources Wales, it has also developed as a wildlife habitat and as a tourist attraction. The red kite is seen in the area, along with many other birds, plants and animals. There are numerous footpaths, and many bridleways that are popular for mountain biking and horse riding. Published walks include \\"The Source of The Severn\\", \\"Severn Breaks its Neck\\" and \\"The Blaenhafren Falls\\". The Wye Valley Walk finishes at Rhyd y Benwch in the forest. A quarry in the forest is used \\"explosion studies\\" by Aberystwyth University's Combustion Physics Group. This quarry had previously been used by British Aerospace. =Motor sport= The forest is a popular location for many motocross and 4x4 championships and rally events.

In geometry, a centre (or center) (from Greek Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ) of an object is a point in some sense in the middle of the object. According to the specific definition of center taken into consideration, an object might have no center. If geometry is regarded as the study of isometry groups then a center is a fixed point of all the isometries which move the object onto itself. Circles, spheres, and segments The center of a circle is the point equidistant from the points on the edge. Similarly the center of a sphere is the point equidistant from the points on the surface, and the center of a line segment is the midpoint of the two ends. Symmetric objects For objects with several symmetries, the center of symmetry is the point left unchanged by the symmetric actions. So the center of a square, rectangle, rhombus or parallelogram is where the diagonals intersect, this being (amongst other properties) the fixed point of rotational symmetries. Similarly the center of an ellipse or a hyperbola is where the axes intersect. Triangles Several special points of a triangle are often described as triangle centers: *the circumcenter, which is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices; *the centroid or center of mass, the point on which the triangle would balance if it had uniform density; *the incenter, the center of the circle that is internally tangent to all three sides of the triangle; *the orthocenter, the intersection of the triangle's three altitudes; and *the nine-point center, the center of the circle that passes through nine key points of the triangle. For an equilateral triangle, these are the same point, which lies at the intersection of the three axes of symmetry of the triangle, one third of the distance from its base to its apex. A strict definition of a triangle center is a point whose trilinear coordinates are f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b) where f is a function of the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, a, b, c such that: # f is homogeneous in a, b, c; i.e., f(ta,tb,tc)=thf(a,b,c) for some real power h; thus the position of a center is independent of scale. # f is symmetric in its last two arguments; i.e., f(a,b,c)= f(a,c,b); thus position of a center in a mirror-image triangle is the mirror-image of its position in the original triangle.Algebraic Highways in Triangle Geometry This strict definition excludes pairs of bicentric points such as the Brocard points (which are interchanged by a mirror-image reflection). The Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers lists over 9,000 different triangle centers. Tangential polygons and cyclic polygons A tangential polygon has each of its sides tangent to a particular circle, called the incircle or inscribed circle. The center of the incircle, called the incenter, can be considered a center of the polygon. A cyclic polygon has each of its vertices on a particular circle, called the circumcircle or circumscribed circle. The center of the circumcircle, called the circumcenter, can be considered a center of the polygon. If a polygon is both tangential and cyclic, it is called bicentric. (All triangles are bicentric, for example.) The incenter and circumcenter of a bicentric polygon are not in general the same point. General polygons The center of a general polygon can be defined in several different ways. The \\"vertex centroid\\" comes from considering the polygon as being empty but having equal masses at its vertices. The \\"side centroid\\" comes from considering the sides to have constant mass per unit length. The usual center, called just the centroid (center of area) comes from considering the surface of the polygon as having constant density. These three points are in general not all the same point.

The project provides drinking water and water for irrigation. A secondary benefit is flood control. Casitas Dam was constructed on Coyote Creek, two miles (3 km) before it joins the Ventura River. Santa Ana Creek and North Fork Coyote Creek also flow into the lake. The system was designed for water from the Ventura River to be diverted into a canal under specific conditions since the impounded watershed is not sufficient to fill the lake. The dam is creating a lake capacity of . The dam was built as part of the Ventura River Project. In the center of Lake Casitas is 2 km Main Island, whose peak rises more than from the lake surface. History The lake filled and overflowed for the first time around the 1970s. During the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Lake Casitas hosted the canoeing and rowing events.1984 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 108‚Äì12. The Thomas Fire at the end of 2017 had a significant impact on operations since the wildfire burned a large area within the watershed of the Ventura River. Rainstorms brought a lot of ash, sandy silt, gravel, and debris into the Robles diversion facility that had collected over several years since the fire resulting in some temporary shutdowns of water from the Ventura River. Operations The Casitas Municipal Water District provides drinking water to the Ojai Valley, parts of Ventura, and the Rincon coast north of Ventura. They took over management of the Ojai water system by purchase of the franchise from Golden State Water Company in April 2017 after an overwhelming vote in favor. The Robles Diversion Dam was constructed on the Ventura River in 1958 to divert up to per year through a four-and-a-half mile canal () to the reservoir. About 40% of the total water in Lake Casitas is supplied from high winter flows in the Ventura River. =Regulations= Human contact with the water is prohibited by the Board of Directors at the Casitas Municipal Water District. The board states that since the Lake is used for drinking water, body contact with water is not allowed, but fishing, boating, rowing and camping are permitted. The \\"no body contact with water\\" lake policy was established by The Casitas Municipal Water District in the 1950s and 1960s because the lake did not have a filtration system in place. In the 1990s a multimillion-dollar filtration system upgrade was made to the Lake Casitas facility. The US Department of the Interior conducted a 10-year study on the lake where allowing body contact with water was explored. The study reported, \\"The capabilities of the current water filtration system to handle the additional burden of body contact were called into question. The system was shown to exceed current regulatory standards, and would ‚Äúprobably‚Äù be sufficient to mitigate body contact pollution as well.\\"Bureau of Reclamation (February 2010) \\"Lake Casitas Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement\\" United States Department of the Interior The Casitas Municipal Water District has not significantly changed the \\"no body contact with water\\" regulations in response to the facilities upgrade.

In the summer of 1755, she and her two young sons were among several captives taken by Shawnee after the Draper's Meadow Massacre during the French and Indian War. They were taken to Lower Shawneetown at the Ohio and Scioto rivers. Ingles escaped with another woman after two and a half months and trekked 500 to 600 miles, crossing numerous rivers, creeks, and the Appalachian Mountains to return home. Two somewhat different accounts of Mary Draper Ingles' capture and escape, one written by her son John Ingles, and the other by Letitia Preston Floyd, an acquaintance, are the two primary sources from which the story is known. The story became well-known following the 1855 publication of William Henry Foote's account in Sketches of Virginia: Historical and Biographical, William Henry Foote, Sketches of Virginia: Historical and Biographical, Vol. 2; William S. Martien, 1855; p. 149. based on Mary's son's manuscript. It was further publicized in 1886 with the publication of an embellished version in John P. Hale's Trans-Allegheny pioneers: historical sketches of the first white settlements west of the Alleghenies.John P. Hale, Trans-Allegheny pioneers: historical sketches of the first white settlements west of the Alleghenies, Cincinnati: The Graphic Press, 1886. Biography =Early life= Log cabin next to the New River, near present-day Radford, Virginia, where Mary Draper Ingles and her husband William lived out their lives. Photo c.1890 Mary Draper Ingles was born in 1732 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to George and Elenor (Hardin) Draper, who had immigrated to America from Donegal, Ireland in 1729. Between 1740 and 1744, the Draper family moved to the western frontier of Virginia, settling in Pattonsburg on the James River. Around 1744, George Draper went on an exploratory trip into what is now West Virginia, and never returned. In 1748 or 1750 his family established Draper's Meadow, a pioneer settlement on the banks of Stroubles Creek near modern-day Blacksburg, Virginia. In 1750, Mary married fellow settler William Ingles (1729-1782). They had two sons together: Thomas, born in 1751, and George, in 1753. =Draper's Meadow massacre= On July 30 (or July 8, according to John P. Hale and Letitia Preston Floyd), 1755, during the French and Indian War, a band of Shawnee warriors (then allies of the French) raided Draper's Meadow and killed six settlers, including Mary's mother and her infant niece. Paper presented at Northern Kentucky History Day, 2009. They took five captives, including Mary and her two sons, her sister-in-law Bettie Robertson Draper, and her neighbor Henry Lenard (or Leonard). Mary's husband was nearly killed but fled into the forest. =Captivity= A captive runs the gauntlet between Shawnee warriors. The Indians took their captives, along with several horses loaded with items taken from the settlers' homes, northwest along the New River, then along the Ohio River. They traveled for a month to Lower Shawneetown, located at the confluence of the Scioto and Ohio rivers. Upon arrival at the town, the prisoners were made to undergo the ritual of running the gauntlet although, according to her son, Mary was not required to do this. Mary was separated from her sons, who were adopted by Shawnee families. According to John P. Hale, Mary's oldest son Thomas was taken to Detroit, her sister-in-law Bettie was taken to what is now Chillicothe, Ohio, and her youngest son George was taken to an unknown location and died soon afterward. One source states that another captive, Mary's neighbor Henry Leonard, later escaped, although no details are given.Lyman Chalkley, Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish Settlement in Virginia: Extracted from the Original Court Records of Augusta County, 1745-1800, Volume 2. Augusta County (Va.): The Commonwealth Printing Company, 2010; p. 510. Letitia Preston Floyd and other sources state that, soon after being taken prisoner, Mary gave birth to a daughter although there is evidence to the contrary. As a prisoner, Mary sewed shirts using cloth traded to the Indians by French traders and was paid in goods for her work. In October 1755, about three weeks after reaching Lower Shawneetown, she was taken to the Big Bone salt lick to make salt for the Indians by boiling brine. A contemporary newspaper account states that Mary was also assigned \\"to attend [the Indians] as Servant, to dress their Victuals, and stretch the Skins they might procure.\\" =Escape and journey home= While working at Big Bone Lick, in late October 1755, Mary persuaded another captive woman, referred to as the \\"old Dutch woman\\" but who may have been German, to escape with her. The next day (probably 19 October) they asked permission of the Indians to go into the forest to gather wild grapes, and set off, retracing the route the Indians had followed after Mary was taken captive in July. They wore moccasins and carried only a tomahawk and a knife (both of which were eventually lost), and two blankets. As they were leaving the camp, they met three French traders from Detroit who were harvesting walnuts. Mary traded her old dull tomahawk for a new one. The women went north, following the Ohio River as it curves to the east (see map). Expecting pursuit, they tried to hurry at first. As it turned out, the Shawnee made only a brief search, assuming the two women had been carried off by wild animals. The Shawnee told this account to Mary's son Thomas Ingles, when he met some of them many years later after the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774. After four or five days the women reached the junction of the Ohio and Scioto rivers, where they could see Lower Shawneetown in the distance, on the opposite riverbank. There they found an abandoned cabin, which contained a supply of corn, and an old horse in the back yard. They took the horse to carry the corn, but he was lost in the river when they tried to take him across what was probably Dutchman's Ripple. They followed the Ohio, Kanawha, and New rivers, crossing the Licking, Big Sandy, and Little Sandy rivers, Twelvepole Creek, the Guyandotte and Coal rivers, Paint Creek, and the Bluestone River. During their journey, they crossed at least 145 creeks and rivers‚Äîremarkable as neither woman could swim. On at least one occasion they \\"tied logs together with a grape-vine [and] made a raft\\" to cross a major river. They may have traveled as much as 500 to 600 miles, averaging between eleven and twenty-one miles a day. Once the corn ran out, they subsisted on black walnuts, wild grapes, pawpaws, sassafras leaves, blackberries, roots and frogs but, as the weather grew cold, they were forced to eat dead animals they found along the way. On several occasions they saw Indians hunting and each time managed to avoid being seen. By now the temperature had dropped, it was starting to snow, and the two women were weak from starvation. At some point, the old Dutch woman became \\"very disheartened and discouraged\\", and tried to kill Mary. (Letitia Preston Floyd's account reports the two women drew lots to decide \\"which of them was to be eaten by the other.\\") Mary managed to \\"keep her in a good humor\\" by promising \\"a sum of money\\" to be paid to her by Mary's father-in-law upon their safe return to Draper's Meadow. Soon after they reached the mouth of the New River, the old Dutch woman made a second attempt on Mary's life, probably about 26 November, but Mary \\"got loose...and outran her.\\" She hid in the forest and waited until dark, then continued along the riverbank. Finding a canoe, Mary crossed the New River at its junction with the East River near what is now Glen Lyn, Virginia. Mary continued southeast along the riverbank, passing through the present-day location of Pembroke. Four or five days after leaving the old Dutch woman, she reached the home of her friend Adam Harman on or about 1 December 1755, 42 days after leaving Big Bone Lick. Shortly afterward, a search party went back and found the old Dutch woman. Harman took her to the fort at Dunkard Creek, where she joined a wagon party traveling to Pennsylvania. =Aftermath= A postcard of Ingles Ferry, ca. 1908After recovering from her journey and reuniting with her husband, Mary and her husband resumed farming at Dunkert Bottom until the following spring. Concerned about continued Shawnee raids on neighboring settlements, they moved to Fort Vause, where a small garrison safeguarded the residents. Mary remained uneasy, however, and persuaded her husband to move again, this time to Bedford County, Virginia. On June 25, 1756 Fort Vause was attacked by Shawnee Indians and all its inhabitants killed, including Mary's two brothers-in-law.Lewis Preston Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 1746-1786, Washington County, 1777-1870, J.L. Hill Print. Company, 1903. The Ingles had four more children: Mary, Susan, Rhoda (b.1762), and John (1766-1836). In 1762, William and Mary established the Ingles Ferry across the New River, and the associated Ingles Ferry Hill Tavern and blacksmith shop. She died there in 1815, aged 83. The site of her former log cabin, with a stable and a family cemetery, is protected as part of the Ingles Bottom Archeological Sites. A reconstruction of Mary Draper Ingles' home at Ingles Ferry, built on the foundations of her original home. Mary's son George died in Indian captivity, but Thomas, who was 4 when taken captive, was ransomed and returned to Virginia in 1768 at the age of 17; after 13 years with the Shawnee, he had become fully acculturated and spoke only Shawnee. He underwent several years of \\"rehabilitation\\" and education under Dr. Thomas Walker at Castle Hill, Virginia. Thomas Ingles later served as a lieutenant under Colonel William Christian in Lord Dunmore's War (1773-1774) against the Shawnee. He married Eleanore Grills in 1775 and settled in Burke's Garden, Virginia. In 1782, his wife and three children were kidnapped by Indians. Thomas came to rescue them and in the ensuing altercation, the two older children were killed. Eleanore was tomahawked but survived. Thomas rescued her and their youngest daughter. Manuscript held at the Boone County Public Library. In 1761, Mary Ingles' brother John Draper attended a gathering of Cherokee chiefs at which a treaty to end the Anglo- Cherokee War was prepared. He found a man who knew of his wife, Bettie Robertson Draper, who had been taken captive in 1755. At that time, she was living with the family of a widowed Cherokee chief. Publication No 2. She was ransomed, and John took her to New River Valley. Historical accounts of Mary Draper Ingles' journey The two primary sources of information are: :1) The 1824 written account by John Ingles (1766-1836, son of Mary and William Ingles, born after Mary's return); :2) Parts of an 1843 letter by Letitia Preston Floyd (1779-1852, wife of Virginia Governor John Floyd and daughter of Colonel William Preston, a survivor of the Draper's Meadow massacre). Boone County Library statue of Mary Draper InglesDifferences between the two narratives suggest that the Ingles and Preston families had developed distinct oral traditions. They differ on the date of the massacre (July 30 vs July 8, according to Ingles and Floyd, respectively), the number of casualties, the ages of Mary Ingles' children, and several other aspects. John Peter Hale, one of Mary Ingles' great-grandsons, claimed to have interviewed Letitia Floyd and others who knew Mary Ingles personally. His 1886 narrative contains numerous details not cited in any previous account. There were some references to Mary Ingles' escape in contemporary reports and letters, which were gathered in later efforts to document people who had been taken captive by Indians. In popular culture The story of Ingles' ordeal has inspired a number of books and films, including: * A novel. *Follow the River (1995). A television movie adaptation of the novel produced by ABC, starring Sheryl Lee. *The Captives (2004), a film based on these events. *The Long Way Home, an outdoor historical drama produced each summer from 1971 to 1999, at the Ingles homestead, relating the history of Mary Draper Ingles and her family. The General Assembly identified it as the \\"official\\" outdoor drama. While it attracted thousands to the city, the production was finally closed. (Since 2010, other efforts have been made to develop aspects of tourism heritage related to the Ingles history.)

His pupils included graphic artist M. C. Escher (1898‚Äì1972). A Sephardic Jew, in his old age he was sent to Auschwitz by the Nazis, where he was gassed along with his wife. After the war, de Mesquita was largely forgotten.  Early life and education  Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita was born on 6 June 1868 into a Jewish family living in Amsterdam. Though a member of a tightly knit Sephardic community, a minority among Dutch Jews, de Mesquita, like most of his contemporaries, was not religiously observant. His father, a secondary school teacher of Hebrew and German, died when Sam or Sampie, as he was called, was five. At the age of fourteen, the young de Mesquita applied to the Rijksakademie in pursuit of his artistic interests, only to be rejected. Deeply disappointed, he apprenticed himself to an acting city architect, for whom he worked for two years before entering a technical school with the intention of becoming an architect himself. He soon turned, however, to the pedagogy and, in 1889, received a teacher's certificate, which would later enable him to support his family.  Career  Heron in a cage (1915) by Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita Over the next years, de Mesquita principally devoted himself to art, experimenting with various techniques and mediums. Though known primarily for his wood engravings, he also produced etchings, lithographs, watercolors and drawings; his applied art consisted mostly of material designs. There are birds, exotic animals, plants and flowers, and fantastical representations, both humorous and grim. Among de Mesquita's most beautiful works are his portraits, particularly his self-portraits. With Nazi Germany's invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, de Mesquita, already in poor health, was forced to lead a secluded life, limiting his work largely to sketches.

Transported to Auschwitz, Samuel Jessurun and Elisabeth were sent to the gas chambers within days of their arrival on 11 February; Jaap perished in the concentration camp at Theresienstadt on 20 March.

He also appeared in 41 career NBA playoff games, averaging 5.9 points, 4.2 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game. College Workman attended Winston-Salem State University for one year (1984/85) before transferring to Oral Roberts University for three seasons (1986/87-1988/89; missing the 1985/86 season as s transfer student). Oral Roberts went 27‚Äì52 during Workman's tenure, where he posted career averages of 17.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.9 steals. Workman's most memorable college performance came in December 1988 when he scored a career high 42 points (18 from 3-pointers and 15 from FTs) against the sixth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners featuring Mookie Blaylock and Stacey King; Oklahoma won 152‚Äì122. In his junior year, Workman was named Honorable Mention All-American. Workman remains 8th on the school's all-time points scored list, 5th in total free-throws made, and 10th in total assists. He also has the records for most steals in a game, in a season, and in a career at Oral Roberts. He is a member of the Oral Roberts Hall of Fame. Professional career Workman was selected 22nd in the second round (49th overall) in the 1989 NBA Draft. Unfortunately for Workman, the Hawks cut him six games into the season, opting for the services of Sedric Toney in backing up Doc Rivers and Spud Webb at the point. Workman would go on to play for the Topeka Sizzlers of the CBA, where he was named to the 1989‚Äì90 CBA All-Rookie Team after averaging 17.1 ppg, 4.6 apg and 4.3 apg in 46 games. He then went back to the Hawks for a 10-day contract, and then to the Illinois Express of the World Basketball League (WBL). In August 1990, the Bullets invited Workman to rookie camp. However, he was pulled from the court after a day and a half. As the Express were preparing for the WBL playoffs, which extended into August, Workman went AWOL to try out with the Bullets. WBL president Steve Erhardt insisted that Workman had to retire from the WBL to participate in camp and was threatening to sue. Eventually Workman paid a fine and never returned to the WBL. Workman made the full Bullets training camp at Bowie State and fought with Tony Harris and Larry Robinson for a spot on the team, while Darrell Walker, Steve Colter and second-round draft pick A. J. English were already in the fold at the guard position. With the absence of Eackles, Colter, the backup point in the previous season, was asked to play more shooting guard. Darrell Walker was also experiencing tendinitis in his Achilles tendon. Ultimately, Harris was cut and Colter, who was at odds with Washington head coach coach Wes Unseld, was shipped to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Byron Irvin, who was more adept at playing two guard. Both Workman and Robinson would start the first two games of the season at the guard positions. When Walker, who actually played 58 total minutes between games 1 and 2, was inserted back into the starting lineup for game 3, Workman went to the bench and Robinson continued to start for the next seven games. However, Workman had impressed enough, so when Ledell Eackles finally signed and returned to the court in November, Robinson was released. Fresh off a five-game losing streak in mid-November, Unseld went with the starting lineup of Darrell Walker and Haywoode Workman, and it paid off. Workman scored 14 points and hit a game winner with 3.1 seconds left to beat Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers at the Capital Centre, putting a temporary halt to mounting losses. In the end, Haywoode Workman appeared in 73 games for the Bullets, starting 56 of them (he missed nine games in February because of a pulled groin). For the season, he averaged 8.0 points, 4.8 assists (2nd on the team), 3.3 rebounds, and 1.2 steals per game (tied for 1st on the team). In his starts, he averaged 9.2 points and 5.4 assists. Before the following 1991‚Äì92 season, Workman signed a two-year, $400K+ per contract with Italian League champion Scavolini Pesaro, which came with the perks of a BMW and a house on the Adriatic Coast. The Bullets gave Workman a qualifying offer of the $120,000 minimum, which could have been a non-guaranteed $250,000 if he made the team. But the writing was on the wall as the Bullets traded for Michael Adams and drafted LaBradford Smith that summer.Haywoode Workman: Mr. Blue Collar Workman averaged 15.0 ppg, 4.6 rpg and 1.8 apg in 58 career games in the Italian League. After two years in Italy, he returned to the NBA in 1993 by signing with the Indiana Pacers. He started 52 games for the Indiana Pacers in the 1993‚Äì94 season, averaging almost eight points and 6.2 assists during the Pacers' first trip to the Eastern Conference finals that year. He notched a playoffs career-high 11 assists, and a Pacers' playoff record seven steals, against the Orlando Magic in Game 1 of the 1994 Eastern Conference first round. Despite the Pacers trading in the summer of 1994 for a more experienced point guard in Mark Jackson, Workman, along with players such as Antonio Davis, Sam Mitchell, and Dale Davis became invaluable to the Pacers' depth and was integral to the team's consistent post-season success in the mid to late nineties. However, on November 9, 1996 in a game against Washington Bullets he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, due to which he missed the remainder of the 1996/97 season (he underwent surgery on November 22) and the entire 1997/98 season. This injury derailed the remainder of his playing career. Workman finished off his career by playing his final two seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors. He had his best game as a Raptor when he posted team-highs of 19 points (4‚Äì8 FG, 10‚Äì12 FT), 8 assists and 7 rebounds in a 94‚Äì85 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on 3 March 1999. He also spent time playing for Hapoel Jerusalem in Israel, before calling an end to his basketball playing career. Officiating While working out in Florida in the summer of 2001, he ran into NBA referee Bob Delaney, who asked him about trying to become a referee. There, he started refereeing local games and became involved with the Tampa Bay Pro-Am league. He started in California in 2002, working the pro-am leagues at Venice Beach and West Los Angeles out of his own pocket. Encouraged, he responded quickly by sending his resume when he heard the CBA was looking for new officials. He worked 15 games that CBA season and later worked the pre-draft camp in Chicago. In July 2003, he worked the NBA summer league in Boston.Ex-guard making comeback as ref He moved up to refereeing NBDL games in 2004. Workman was on the NBA referee roster in 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08 as a preseason ref, while working both of those seasons as an NBA Development League official. He was one of three NBA referees hired for the 2008‚Äì2009 season. He is the third ex-NBA player to become an NBA referee, the first two being Bernie Fryer and Leon Wood. Workman is working with the NBA league office to recruit other former NBA players and former college players to become referees. Personal life Workman lives in Tampa.Former player Workman hired as NBA ref His daughter Chasity played basketball for Oklahoma City University. Son Bryce Workman currently plays for Sickles High School in Tampa.

While emigrating to the United States in 1903 Tuschinski decided to remain in Rotterdam during his stopover there. He found success as a cinema owner, opening his first four cinemas in 1911: the Thalia, Cinema Royal, Scala and Olympia. His most luxurious cinema in Rotterdam, the Grand Theater, opened in 1928. His crowning achievement, the Tuschinski Theater, opened its doors in Amsterdam on 28 October 1921. The theater had an audience capacity of 1620, which made it the largest Dutch cinema at the time. The unique design of this building was a mix of three modern styles: Amsterdamse School, Art Deco and Jugendstil.

After ordination Leonard contracted a bleeding ulcer and was sent to his hometown where there was a monastery of the Franciscan Observants (1704). After four years he was restored to health, and began to preach in Porto Maurizio and the vicinity. St. Leonard was a preacher. Mission work When Cosimo III de' Medici handed over the monastery del Monte (on San Miniato near Florence, also called Monte alle Croci) to the members of the Riformella, St Leonard was sent hither under the auspices and by desire of Cosimo III, and began shortly to hold missions among the people of Tuscany. His colleagues and he practiced austerities and penances during these missions. In 1710 he founded the monastery of Icontro, on a peak in the mountains about four and a quarter miles from Florence, whither he and his assistants could retire from time to time after missions, and devote themselves to spiritual renewal. Alphonsus Liguori called Leonard \\"the great missionary of the 18th century\\". He attracted large crowds and was invited to visit and preach in many places. Leonard spent over forty years preaching retreats, Lenten sermons and parish missions throughout Italy. His missions lasted 15 to 18 days, and he often stayed an additional week to hear confessions.Foley, Leonard. \\"St. Leonard of Port Maurice\\" , from Saint of the Day (revised by Pat McCloskey). Retrieved 27 March 2014. In 1720 he crossed the borders of Tuscany and held his celebrated missions in Central and Southern Italy. Everywhere the saint made conversions, and was very often obliged both in cities and country districts to preach in the open, as the churches could not contain the thousands who came to listen. Pope Clement XII and Pope Benedict XIV called him to Rome; the latter especially held him in high esteem both as a preacher and as a propagandist, and exacted a promise that he would come to Rome to die. Pope Benedict XIV appointed him to several complex diplomatic assignments. In Genoa and Corsica, in Lucca and Spoleto the citizens expected a bejeweled cardinal to represent the intentions of the pope. Instead, they were confronted by a humble, shoeless, muddy friar to confound their hostility and pride. For a time, St. Leonard was the spiritual director of Maria Clementina Sobieska of Poland, the wife of James Stuart, the Old Pretender. St Leonard founded many pious societies and confraternities, and exerted himself to spread devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and the perpetual adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament. He also began to insist that the concept of the Immaculate Conception of Mary be defined as a dogma of the faith.\\"Feast of St. Leonard of Port Maurice\\" , Passionist Daily Reflections, 26 November 2012.

Though many saints were devoted to the Stations of the Cross, few if any did more to promote them than St. Leonard. As a Franciscan priest, he preached the Way of the Cross at missions for forty- three years and reportedly set up stations in 571 locations throughout Italy, including the Colosseum in Rome.\\"St. Leonard's Way of the Cross\\", OSV Publishing.

In November, 1751, when he was preaching to the Bolognese, Benedict XIV called him to Rome, as already there were indications of his rapidly approaching end. The strain of his missionary labours and his mortifications had completely exhausted his body. He arrived on the evening of 26 November 1751, at his beloved monastery of St. Bonaventura on the Palatine, and expired on the same night at eleven o'clock at the age of seventy-four. Veneration Pope Pius VI pronounced his beatification on 19 June 1796, and Pope Pius IX his canonization on 29 June 1867.

Works  The numerous writings of the saint consist of sermons, letters, ascetic treatises, and books of devotion for the use of the faithful and of priests, especially missionaries. The Diary (Diario) of his missions is written by Fra Diego da Firenze. A treasure for asceticism and homiletics, many of his writings have been translated into the most diverse languages and often republished: for example his Via Sacra spianata ed illuminata (the Way of the Cross simplified and explained), Il Tesoro Nascosto (on the Holy Mass); his celebrated Proponimenti, or resolutions for the attainment of higher Christian perfection.

Saemangeum is an estuarine tidal flat on the coast of the Yellow Sea in South Korea. It was dammed by the government of South Korea's Saemangeum Seawall Project, completed on April 27, 2010, after a long fight between the government and environmental activists, and is scheduled to be converted into either agricultural or industrial land. Prior to 2010, it had played an important role as a habitat for migratory birds. The completion of this seawall is likely to be a major contributor to the decline of many species. Around 400,000 shorebirds depended on the Saemangeum estuarine as an important feeding ground on the 24,000 km migration between Asia and Alaska and Russia,http://www.birdskorea.org/Habitats/Wetlands/Saemangeum/BK-HA- Saemangeum-Mainpage.shtml accessed 2008-01-28 including the two endangered waders Nordmann's greenshank and spoon-billed sandpiper (each species with fewer than a thousand surviving birds). A conservation organisation has accused authorities of having failed to monitor the project's impact on local wildlife in a transparent way, and carried out an independent monitoring program in 2006. The Saemangeum lay at the mouths of the Dongjin and Mangyeong Rivers, on the coast of Jeollabuk-do. It is just south of the estuary of the Geum River. Neighboring districts include Gunsan City, Buan County, and Gimje City. The project of filling in the estuary began in 1991, but was slowed by a series of court actions by environmentalists. The completed seawall is some 33 kilometers long, and replaces a coastline that was once more than 100 kilometers long. After the estuary has been completely filled, an area of about 400 km2 (roughly two-thirds the size of Seoul) will have been added to the Korean peninsula, making it one of the biggest land reclamation projects in history.http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200604/200604210003.html accessed 2007-04-21 The estuary was originally called \\"Mangeum\\" (Ëê¨Èáë).

Hanna Lake () is a lake in Urak Valley near Quetta city in Balochistan Province, in southwestern Pakistan. It is surrounded by mountains. Geography Hanna Lake is in the hills close to where the Urak Valley begins, east from Quetta city. The reservoir was constructed in 1894 during the British Colonial era on the land of local tribesmen, and is one of the main attractions in the city. It forms a great historical bridge wall between two mountains, the depths like battlements of a fort, for the storing of water. Features Hanna Lake is one of the most visited and accessible lakes in Balochistan. There is a lakeside restaurant with picnic tables shaded by pine trees at the end of the river, where families can enjoy the food and weather. On the eastern side of the lake stands the Hayat Durrani Water Sports Academy (HDWSA), the first and only rowing, canoeing, kayaking and sailing training and championships organising centre in Balochistan Province, with provision of rough swimming facility. History In 1894 , the small action dam Surrpull (Red Bridge) was constructed on the main Urak road to control flooding, and divert water, coming catastrophically from snow melt and rain down the Zarghoon Ghar and Murddar Mountains Koh-i-Murdaar streams, into Hanna Lake through its main canal. Over a century old in 1908, this lake was spread over an area of 818 acres with a holding capacity of over 220 million gallons of water and a depth of .In 1973http://www.mowr.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Annual-Flood- Report-2010.pdf Ministry of Water and Power a heavy flood destroyed the Murdar Mountains recharge linked canal on the way to Surrpull, near Spin Kaarrez road, which has not been (Restored) reconstructed till date. Presently, in May 2016 a heavy flood filled this small action dam Surrpull with mud and stones. Accordingly, all the streams and flood waters are going waste and there is no chance to regulate water conservancy to Hanna Lake without the restoration, desilting of surrpull and both main canals. On the other hand, the water level in Hanna Lake is falling critically low, hence endangering the natural ecosystem, the local wild life, the environment of the surroundings, and native peoples, along with hundreds of migrated birds and thousands of fish. The future of athletic activities such as rowing and canoeing is also in danger. It is possible that the Hanna Lake might be fully dried, like in 1999 to January 2005, and in 2010. The environmental scientists, Speleologists and the Conservationists are looking at the future of the lake in its most dangerous condition. The current harmful environmental situation will badly affect the natural eco system, environment, and underground water level of the surroundings. However, the small action dam surpull was locally restored / desilted in February 2019, with the assistance of Hashim Khan Ghalzai, secretary P&D;, and Hayatullah Khan Durrani C.E, HDWSA. Since then the flood rain from the Zarghoon mountains has been continuously coming to Hanna Lake, and the water level has risen by up to 50%.

Most of the victims were on holiday. Another boat was used to rescue the victims. Present day This channel nowadays needs repairs and is wasting water and recently the Hanna Lake has been fully dried since August 2016 causing killing of thousands of fish and the future of the canoe Kayak and rowing National and International level is turning in to dark now. There is also a water channel which was constructed at the same time by the British to convert the snow and rain water near Spin Kaarez, coming from Murdar Mount, as surplus for filling the water in this lake. The channel was destroyed by a heavy flood in 1976 and has still not been re-constructed. The loss of the snow and rain water was wasted causing Hanna Lake to fully dry up between 1999 and January 2005. The government of Balochistan did nothing for the restoration of water level at Hanna lake but the Hanna Lake Development Authority (HLDA) the custodians of Hanna Lake and HDWSA officials had full efforts for the restoration of arrival of water through the surplus canal to Hanna Lake. =Dry lake= From years 2000‚Äì2010 Hanna Lake dried up and the natives along with hundreds of migrated birds were in trouble. =Full lake= However, in 2011 the lake re-filled and once again gave rise to flora and fauna in its environment. The turquoise waters of the lake provide a rich contrast to the sandy brown of the hills in the background. One can promenade on the terraces or hire a boat and paddle on the lake and round the island in the middle.

The lake was created by the building of Salinas Dam on the southern end of the Salinas River, very close to the river's origin in the Santa Lucia Range. The dam was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1941 to provide water for Camp San Luis Obispo. It now provides the city of San Luis Obispo with a portion of its drinking water. The city also uses water from Lake Nacimiento and water from Whale Rock Reservoir in Cayucos. The lake is relatively small, with a capacity of . Since it is a municipal water source, human contact is prohibited. Boating, fishing and rowing are popular activities on the lake and there are camping sites on the shore. The lake is home to the San Luis Obispo Rowing Club. The lake is home to largemouth bass, catfish, carp, black crappie and various sunfish. There are dirt roads that provide access to almost the entire perimeter of the lake. There is a 15-mile per hour (24 km/h) speed limit, as the roads are bumpy and vehicles kick up a lot of dust, even at slow speeds. In addition, many visitors park on the side of the road to fish. The default speed limit on the lake itself is 5 miles per hour (8 km/h), but boats can travel up to 30 miles (48 km/h) per hour in certain areas, depending on conditions. There is a proposal to raise the dam by 19 feet (8 m) with the addition of a spillway gate, which was part of the original design. The loss of trees from the additional capacity has been a major concern. In the area to be flooded there are 1,639 coast live oaks, 633 blue oaks, 198 valley oaks and 469 gray pines. The loss of oak trees is of ecological concern, since oak trees in the area are already contending with sudden oak death.

He is the first Jewish resident of Maryland who can be identified by documentary evidence. Biography Born in Portugal, Lumbrozo moved to Holland, and ultimately established himself in Maryland on January 24, 1656. His arrival formed, directly or indirectly, an important event in the life of the province. He early exercised his profession, and apparently enjoyed a lucrative practise. On September 10, 1663, letters of denization were issued to him, together with certain privileges, enabling him to take up land under the liberal terms established by the proprietary‚Äîa privilege of which he promptly availed himself. A \\"Mistress Lumbrozo\\" was living in September 1663, having arrived in Maryland in the preceding year. She was probably not of Jewish descent. Lumbrozo appeared as a witness in a lawsuit in 1657, and served as a juror in 1663. In 1665, he was granted a commission to trade with Native Americans. He seems to have been in active business with London merchants and to have corresponded with a sister in Holland. He amassed considerable wealth both in real and in personal property. Although Jews were resident in Maryland probably from its settlement, Lumbrozo is the first Jew‚Äîindeed the only one of that time‚Äîof whose faith there is documentary evidence. He was one of the earliest medical practitioners in the colony, and for nearly a decade continued to be an important figure in its economic activity. His career is of widest interest in its relation to the history and nature of religious toleration in Maryland. After living for at least two years in undisturbed quiet as a recognized Jew, and probably as a professed one, he was, in 1658, through the activity of zealots and in consequence of his own indiscretion, arrested, under the provisions of the so-called Toleration Act of 1649, for \\"blasphemy\\"; that is, for denial of the doctrine of the Trinity, thus becoming liable to punishment by death and forfeiture of lands and goods. At a meeting of the provincial court held at St. Mary's during the winter of 1658, Lumbrozo was charged with uttering words of blasphemy against \\"Our Blessed Saviour, Jesus Christ.\\" The prosecution called two witnesses, one of which, John Fossett, testified that Lumbrozo told him that Christ performed \\"necromancy, or sorcery.\\" Lumbrozo testified in his own behalf that he had not intended to say anything blasphemous, but he was merely expressing his opinion as a Jew.Semmes 166 The general amnesty proclaimed in the province ten days later, upon the accession of Richard Cromwell to the English protectorate, gave him his freedom.Semmes 167 Lumbrozo also instigated his own charges in 1658. He reported to the proprietary authorities that a minister, John Legatt, had married two couples without complying with the provision of the law of marriages. At that time Maryland required nearly two pounds sterling for banns and licensing to be recorded before a couple could be married. Lumbrozo was unable to offer any evidence to support his charge again Legatt and the case was dismissed.Semmes 200 Records show that Lumbrozo was embroiled in another controversy at the end of 1669 when he testified in a defamation suit in Charles County. John and Margery Gould brought suit again Giles and Elizabeth Glover attesting that Elizabeth Glover had called Margery Gould a \\"whore and in saying could prove her a whore.\\" Lumbrozo, a \\"trusty and well-beloved friend\\" of the Goulds, represented them in the defamation case. A decision was never reached, but for his representation, according to later testimony, Lumbrozo requested intercourse from Margery Gould. When the Goulds filed suit for his actions, Lumbrozo counter-sued for defamation. It was later discovered during trial that Lumbrozo was more than a \\"friend\\", he was actually the Goulds' employer and they intended to file for release from their service because of Lumbrozo's attempted rape. Lumbrozo withdrew from his action of defamation thereby admitting his own guilt.Semmes 224-5  See also  * Lombroso * List of people from Maryland * Jewish history in Colonial America  Notes   Bibliography of Jewish Encyclopedia  * Jacob Harry Hollander, Some Unpublished Material Relating to Dr. Jacob Lumbrozo of Maryland, in Publ.

Tooth is best known for being prosecuted in 1876 under the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 for using proscribed liturgical practices. He was also briefly imprisoned as a result of the prosecution in 1877. Early life and career Tooth was born on 17 June 1839 at Swifts Park near Cranbrook, Kent. He was educated at Tonbridge School and, in 1858, became a student at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in science in 1862. After he graduated from Cambridge University, Tooth travelled around the world twice (he became an accomplished horseman and crack shot) and he discovered a vocation to the priesthood ‚Äì although no satisfactory explanation seems to have been found for what sparked off his interest in ritualism. He was ordained deacon in 1863 to a title at St Mary-the-Less, Lambeth, but he spent only a year there because his churchmanship clashed with that of his vicar. He was ordained priest in 1864 and served a second curacy at St Mary's Folkestone. From 1865 to 1868 he was minister of St Mary Magdalene's mission church in the parish of St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick. In 1868 he became vicar of St James's Hatcham, a working class parish in south-east London. Tooth's efforts to renew the life of St James's Hatcham started to attract large congregations. His approach combined capable preaching, the introduction of ritualist practices and the establishment of parish organisations designed to help the more needy residents of the area. He also established the Guild of All Souls at St James's in 1873. Prosecution \\"The Christian Martyr\\" Tooth as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, February 1877 When the Public Worship Regulation Act was passed in 1874, those who disapproved of his ritualist liturgical practices set a prosecution in motion. He was charged with (among other things) the use of incense, vestments, and altar candles. The case came before Lord Penzance at Lambeth Palace on 13 July 1876. Tooth did not attend as he refused to recognise the authority of the court. He ignored both the judicial warnings that resulted from his non-attendance and the legal attempts to restrain him from exercising his ministry, although he was now facing disruptions when he presided at worship caused largely by people hired for the purpose by his opponents. Eventually, on 22 January 1877, as a result of repeatedly ignoring the decisions of the Court of Arches, he was taken into custody for contempt of court and imprisoned at London's Horsemonger Lane Gaol. This action immediately transformed him in the eyes of Anglo-Catholics from a rebel into a Christian martyr, and his story became national headline news. The agitations that resulted from his arrest and imprisonment played a central role in bringing the Public Worship Regulation Act into disrepute. His conviction was quashed on a technicality. =1880 protest poster= A copy of this poster was also fixed to a wall close to Lambeth Palace, which greatly annoyed Archbishop Archibald Campbell Tait.R.

He lived for a further 52 years, but was never again given charge of a parish. Furthermore, he had no desire for fame or notoriety. In 1878, he had acquired a property in Woodside, Croydon, where he established a chapel, convent and orphanage school.London Borough of Croydon He spent the rest of his life involved in the running of the orphanage and providing assistance to the convent. The site is now Ashburton Park. He also produced the text for an illustrated book entitled The Pagan Man (1914?) published by the convent at Woodside with illustrations by Thomas Derrick. In 1927, Tooth moved to Otford Court near Sevenoaks with his school of 27 boys plus three religious sisters. The school became St Michael's Preparatory School, which still exists and was a boarding school until 1991. It started a pre-prep school in 1983 with just three children but is now co- educational with over 400 pupils. Death Arthur Tooth died at Otford on 5 March 1931, and was buried in Crystal Palace District Cemetery. There is a memorial in the Anglican chapel at Walsingham.

It is on the top of the beautiful Astore Valley that has a light covering of oak trees and other greenery. There is not much greenery (as of 2013) due to illegal logging of the forest by locals and \\"timber mafia\\". The region has low average rainfall and low vegetation cover hence the loss of forest cover is of a very serious concern.  Location  On the way to Rama Lake, from Astore Valley, there are three small lakes called Sarot in the local Shina language. Before 2005, Astore was a Tehsil of District Diamir, the 5th District of Gilgit- Baltistan. Now Astore has been upgraded to a District. There are more than 50 small beautiful villages in Astore. Some of which are Chilm, Bubin, Gorikot, Eid Ghah, Fena, Bulen, Choungrah, and Pari Shing.  Rama valley  Rama Valley is thickly forested with huge pine, cedar, fir and juniper trees. The valley is about 3300 meters (10800 feet) above sea level and thus is snow covered for 7‚Äì8 months of the year. In summer, it becomes lush green; conditions favored by local shepherds. From here one can trek to east side of the Nanga Parbat (also known as the Killer Mountain), the world's 9th highest mountain.  Access  Lake Rama is near Astore village. On KKH after passing the exit for Fairy Meadows keep driving for about another 20 minutes. When you come across the sign for Astore turn right there, keep going for another 2‚Äì3 hours. You will arrive at the village of Astore. The valley is popular for camping in the summers.

Sneller. The screenplay is credited to Richard Robinson and Alan Caillou, from an original story by Sneller and Stephen Lodge. The film was released by Dimension Pictures (not to be confused with the distributor Dimension Films). It stars William Shatner, Tiffany Bolling, Woody Strode, Lieux Dressler and Altovise Davis. The film is one of the better-remembered entries in the \\"nature on the rampage\\" subgenre of science fiction/horror films in the 1970s, due in part to its memorable scenes of people and animals being attacked by tarantulas, its availability on home video and airing on cable television, particularly on the USA Network, but primarily because of Shatner's starring role. Plot Dr. Robert \\"Rack\\" Hansen, a veterinarian in rural Verde Valley, Arizona, receives an urgent call from a local farmer, Walter Colby. Colby is upset because his prize calf is sick for no apparent reason. The animal is brought in to Hansen's laboratory. Hansen examines the calf, which dies shortly afterward. Hansen tells Colby he cannot explain what made the animal so ill so quickly, but takes samples of the calf's blood to a university lab in Flagstaff. Diane Ashley, an arachnologist, arrives looking for Hansen, Ashley tells Hansen that the calf was killed by a massive dose of spider venom, which Hansen greets with skepticism and disbelief. Undaunted, Ashley tells him the problem is serious and that she wishes to examine the animal's carcass and the area where it became sick. Hansen escorts Ashley to Colby's farm. Moments after they arrive, Colby's wife, Birch, discovers their dog is dead, Ashley tests the dog's carcass and concludes that it also died from a massive injection of spider venom, Hansen is incredulous, until Colby states that he recently found a massive \\"spider hill\\" on a back section of his farmland. He takes Hansen and Ashley to the hill, which is covered with tarantulas. Ashley theorizes that the tarantulas are converging due to the heavy use of pesticides, which are eradicating their natural food supply. In order to survive, the spiders, normally cannibalistic to each other, are combining to attack and eat larger animals. Hansen and Ashley return to the Colby farm to burn the spider hill. As the scientists and the Colbys walk past a barn, a bull stampedes out, also being attacked by tarantulas. Ashley notes that the spiders likely will not be afraid to attack people. Colby douses the spider hill with gasoline and lights it on fire, but many of the spiders escape using a distant tunnel. Colby is attacked by a group of tarantulas while driving his truck the next day, sending the truck over the side of a hill and killing him. Hansen happens upon the accident scene and helps the sheriff, Gene Smith, examine the wreckage. Colby's body is found encased in spider webs. Ashley is notified by her colleagues that a sample of venom from one of the spiders is five times more toxic than normal. Hansen is told by the sheriff that several more spider hills have been located on Colby's property. Hansen, Ashley and the sheriff examine the hills along with the mayor of Camp Verde, who orders the sheriff to spray the hills and the surrounding countryside with a pesticide. Ashley protests, arguing that pesticide caused the problem to begin with and that the town would be better off using birds and rats (tarantulas' enemies in nature) to eradicate them. The mayor dismisses the idea, fearing that having a large number of spiders and rats would scare away patrons of the county fair. A crop duster is enlisted to spray the pesticide; but once airborne, the pilot is attacked by tarantulas, causing him to crash the plane and perish before he can disperse the spray. The spiders begin assaulting local residents, killing Birch and Hansen's sister-in-law, Terri. Hansen arrives at their home and rescues Terri's daughter, Linda. Hansen, Ashley and Linda take refuge in the Washburn Lodge. They consult with the sheriff, who tells them the spiders are everywhere and Camp Verde is cut off. Officer Smith drives into town, while Hansen and the other survivors at the lodge plan to load up an RV and escape. However, the spiders have them trapped in the lodge and they barricade themselves inside. Smith arrives at Camp Verde and finds the town under siege by the spiders. Smith is killed when another car crashes into a support post under the town's water tower, causing it to fall on his vehicle. At the lodge, the power goes out, and Hansen is forced to venture into the lodge's basement to change a blown fuse, he succeeds, but is besieged by spiders who break through one of the basement windows. He makes it upstairs just in time to be saved by Ashley. The next day, the survivors rig up a radio receiver and listen for news of the attacks. To their surprise, the radio broadcast does not mention the attack; the outside world is oblivious to what happened. Hansen pries off the boards from one of the lodge's windows, and discovers the building along with the entire town of Camp Verde encased in spider silk cocoons.

The live tarantulas were procured by offering Mexican spider wranglers US$10 for each live tarantula they could find; this meant that $50,000 of the film's $500,000 budget went towards the purchase of spiders. The large number of tarantulas kept on-hand led to some unusual production difficulties. Not only did each spider have to be kept warm, but because of the creatures' cannibalistic tendencies, all 5,000 spiders had to be kept in separate containers. Additionally, tarantulas are usually shy around people, so fans and air tubes often had to be used to get the spiders to move toward their \\"victims.\\" Indeed, in a number of the scenes where the tarantulas are \\"attacking\\" people, it is obvious to the viewer that the spiders are merely moving around, usually away from their intended victims. Contrary to popular belief, the venom of most tarantulas is not dangerous to humans, causing no more harm than a bee sting (unless the person is allergic to the venom). The worst injury most of the actors suffered was troublesome itching caused by the spiders shedding their bristles (Tarantula urticating bristles has been used to make itching powder sold in joke and novelty stores).  Sequel  Advert for the American Film Market Rumors have occasionally surfaced that a sequel to Kingdom of the Spiders was in production; however, no such film has yet been made. Shatner told Fangoria in 1998 that he was working with Cannon Films in the late 1980s to produce a sequel, titled simply Kingdom of the Spiders 2. The actor claimed that he supplied the film's premise, which would have featured a man being tortured by his enemies, preying upon his intense fear of spiders, to get him to reveal a secret. Cannon went so far as to take out a full-page ad in Variety magazine announcing that Shatner would direct and star in the film; however the studio went bankrupt before production could begin. In 2003, the website for Port Hollywood, a film production company run by Kantor and Howard James Reekie, posted a brief synopsis of the plot of another proposed sequel, to be titled Kingdom of the Spiders II, suggesting that the villainous spiders would this time be driven to attack humans due to secret government experiments involving extremely low frequency (or ELF). The synopsis also details Native American imagery that would factor into the plot.PortHollywood: Kingdom of the Spiders II . porthollywood.com  Legacy  Kantor hinted in his Fangoria interview that Arachnophobia, which Spielberg produced, bears several similarities to Kingdom of the Spiders. \\"I thought it was a copy\\", Kantor stated, \\"but you don't go and sue Spielberg!\\"Kingdom of the Spiders/Fun Facts.

He worked with John Ewart as a master carpenter on a number of construction projects, including the new parliament buildings at York. He moved to London, Ontario in 1832. He invested in property and built a gristmill on the Thames River there in 1833. He was also involved in projects to establish a railway link to the city and improve navigation on the Thames below London. In 1834, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Middlesex; he was reelected in 1836. In 1838, with other Reformers unhappy with the political environment of the time, he was involved in a project to plan the development of a settlement in Iowa; this project did not advance much further than initial planning. In 1839, he was a co-founder of the Canada Inquirer, later the London Inquirer, a reform-oriented newspaper. He was appointed justice of the peace in the London District in 1840. He supported the union of Upper and Lower Canada and, in 1841, was elected to the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada. In the same year, he was appointed surveyor general, serving until 1845, when the office was abolished. He then was named customs collector at Port Colborne; he was named to the same post at Port Dalhousie (St Catharines) in 1860. He died in St. Catharines in 1864.

The fundamental principle of Managing Stage Boundaries (SB) is to ensure that, at the end of each stage, the project stays focused on delivering business benefit. Description Managing Stage Boundaries (SB) is one of seven processes outlined by PRINCE2. It is a decision point in the continuity of the project, from which the project will be either continued as planned, adjusted or stopped. The process involves reviewing the current stage (is the business case still valid, should we proceed to the next stageManaging Project Boundaries: Stages, Phases, Milestones), preparing for the next one, and selecting information which can be of use later in the project. The process is managed by the Project Manager, who informs the Project Board of the likelihood of success in attaining the project's business objective, project plan, together with associated risks and issues. If the Project Board is satisfied with the current stage end and the next stage plan, the project is permitted to continue. Managing Stage Boundaries is therefore a vital process in the management of the project. The objectives of the process are: *To prove to the Project Board that all the products in the current stage are included and defined *To provide the information required by the Project Board to assess if the project is still viable *To obtain authorisation, and margins of tolerance, for the next stage *To record any information or lessons which might be useful in later stages in or other projects The products of the process (outputs) are: * Current Plan actuals, used for showing the improvements from the original Stage Plan. The Stage Plan represents the basis of the Project Manager's day-to-day control and identifies in detail key deliverables, resource requirements and the total cost. * Next Stage Plan, which represents the actual information stage with added facts and information, and forms part of the Project Board's assessment criteria for continuation of the project. * Revised Project Plan. The Project Plan gives an overview of the total project, identifies key deliverables, resource requirements, the total cost, and major control points within the project, such as stage boundaries. It is used by the Project Board to measure the progress made and is revised and updated to reflect the latest understanding of the project. * Updated Risk Log, provides identification, estimation, impact evaluation and countermeasures for all risks of the project. It is created during the start-up and developed during the life of the project and is used by the Project Board to check the viability of the project. * Revised Business case. The Business Case is a part of the project mandate and is produced before the project is initiated. It includes the reasons for the project, expected business benefits, expected costs and expected risks. The ongoing viability of the project is monitored by the Project Board against this Business Case, which is updated with any new changes. * Lessons Learned Report, describing lessons learned from any events occurring in each stage. * Revised Project Management Team List This team comprises the entire management structure of Project Board, project manager, plus any Team Managers and project assurance roles. The team is checked and changes are updated if there are any. * End Stage Report, given by the Project Manager to the Project Board and containing the results achieved during the stage.

The Cross patt√©e of the Scottish Knights Templar from the Scottish Commandery of St Clair, Grand Priory of the Knights Templar in Scotland. The Cross of The Grand Priory of the Scots There are Masonic degrees named after the Knights Templar but not all Knights Templar Orders are Masonic. There is no direct connection with the 13th-century presence of Knights Templar in Scotland. However, since the 1980s such a connection has been a popular topic in fiction and in pseudohistorical speculation. Early modern history In the seventeenth century, interest in Templarism became political after the execution of Charles I, with the idea that Stuart partisans invented a Templar degree, as the king's death was to be avenged, as was the violent death in 1314 of Jacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Templars. The story told by Dom Calmet was that Viscount Dundee was supposed to have been an early Templar Grand Master and to have fallen at Killiecrankie wearing the Grand Cross of the Order. The Duke of Mar is then said to have held office, after which time the Templar Order was apparently inactive until its revival by Charles Edward Stuart in 1745. An original letter of the 3rd Duke of Perth to Earl of Airlie Lord Ogilvy shortly after the Jacobite victory at Prestonpans, described a secret ceremony at Holyrood in which the prince was elected Grand Master of the ancient chivalry of the Temple of Jerusalem on Tuesday 24 September 1745.The Stuart Court in Rome: A Legacy of Exile (Visual Arts Research Institute Edinburgh S.)

The Duke of Mar also held office, after which time the Templar Order apparently fell into abeyance until its revival by Charles Edward in 1745. An extract from the 3rd Duke of Perth's original letter to Lord Ogilvy shortly after the Jacobite victory at Prestonpans, describes , in vivid detail, a secret ceremony at Holyrood in which the prince was elected Grand Master of the ancient chivalry of the Temple of Jerusalem on Tuesday 24 September 1745...\\"page 104Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture By Marsha Keith Schuchard, p 767 \\"According to the early eighteenth-century writers, Jacob de Lennep, Abbe de Buisson, and Dom Calvet, Dundee was wearing a Templar Cross, emblematic of his role as Grand Master of the Scottish Order of the Temple.\\"New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry 1921 by Arthur Edward Waite \\"Viscount Dundee.- It remains to be said that there is one captivating story which, if we can take it as given, will carry back evidence of an ORDER OF THE TEMPLE to the year 1689 and to Scotland. It has been said that the well-known French Historian and theologian Dom Calmet has lent the authority of his name to three important statements: (1) That John Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, was Grand Master of the ORDER OF TEMPLARS in Scotland; (2) that when he fell at Killiecrankie on July 27, 1689 he wore the Grand Cross of the Order; {3) that this Cross was given to Calmet by his brother. If this story be true we are brought at one into the presence of a Templar survival or restoration which owes nothing to the dream of realities of the Chevalier Ramsay, nothing to the passion for the High Grades of Masonry, and nothing ‚Äì so far as can be told ‚Äì to Masonry itself, whether Operative or Speculative. We know that evidence is wanting at every point for the alleged perpetuation of the old Templar Order in connection with Masonry and that the legends of such perpetuation bear all the traces of manufacture. They are of course long posterior to the tragedy of Killiecrankie, and it has been a common practice of masonic writers in the past to say that the hypothesis of survival was invented by Ramsay, who also manufactured Templar Grades. Both statement are untrue as I have shewn elsewhere. It is very curious that such a legend should have arisen in connection with Masonry, and if it originated circa 1740 or later, there is no question that it was prompted by Ramsay's Oration, though the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR were not named therein. But if a Grand Cross of the Temple was actually and provably found on the body of Viscount Dundee, it is certain that the ORDER OF THE TEMPLE had survived or revived in 1689.\\" p 223 \\"Among legendary or mythical Grand Masters are ‚Äì in Scotland Viscount Dundee, the Earls of Mar and Atholl, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, John Olivant of Bachilton and Alexander Deuchar.\\" p 227 \\"The Grade of Templar Priesthood ...claimed the year 1686 as that of its revival, thus antedating the Calmet story concerning Viscount Dundee.\\" p 452 Templarism experienced a revival of interest in the eighteenth century through Freemasonry with a Scottish influence. The first record of this is in Ramsay's Oration in Paris in 1737. Andrew Michael Ramsay was tutor to the Young Pretender, Prince Charles Edward Stuart. He claimed that Freemasonry had begun among crusader knights and that they had formed themselves into Lodges of St John. The next development was with Karl Gotthelf, Baron Von Hund, and Alten- Grotkau, who had apparently been introduced to the concept by the Jacobite Lord Kilmarnock, and received into a Templar Chapter by a mysterious \\"Knight of the Red Feather\\".Network North: Scottish Kin, Commercial and Covert Associations in Northern Europe 1603‚Äì1746 By Steve Murdoch p.337 Baron von Hund established a new Masonic rite called the \\"Strict Templar Observance\\". The \\"Knight of the Red Feather\\" has been identified subsequently as Alexander Seton better known as Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton, a prominent Freemason in the Jacobite movement. Since the mid nineteenth century myths, legends and anecdotes connecting the Templars to the Battle of Bannockburn have been created. Degrees in Freemasonry, such as the Royal Order of Scotland, allude to the story of Rosslyn and the Scottish Knights Templar.http://www.templarhistory.com/scotland.html The Legend of Bruce and the Legend of D'Aumont This theme was repeated in the pseudohistory book The Temple and The Lodge by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, first published in 1989. On the subject of a possible Bruce connection, Masonic Historian D Murray Lyon wrote \\"The fraternity of Kilwinning never at any period practiced or acknowledged other than the Craft degrees; neither does there exist any tradition worthy of the name, local or national, nor has any authentic document yet been discovered that can in the remotest degree be held to identify Robert Bruce with the holding of Masonic Courts, or the institution of a secret society at Kilwinning.\\"Encyclopedia of Freemasonry Part 1 and Its Kindred Sciences Comprising the Whole Range of Arts byy Albert Gallatin Mackey p 447 Masonic order The modern revival of Templarism in Scotland starts with Alexander Deuchar. The records of one of Scottish Freemasonry's most prestigious lodges, the St Mary's Chapel Lodge of Edinburgh, describe the visit of a \\"...deputation from the Grand Assembly of the High Knights Templar in Edinburgh‚Ä¶ headed by their most worshipful Grand Master, Alexander Deuchar...the first time for some hundred years that any Lodge of Freemasonry had been visited by an assembly of Knights Templar, headed by their Grand Master.\\" This implies that there was an Order in existence 100 years earlier. In 1811 with a Charter from the Templar Grand Master in England, the Duke of Kent, Alexander Deuchar established the Grand Conclave of Knights of the Holy Temple and Sepulchre, and of St. John of Jerusalem. Controversially in 1836 \\"...it was proposed that non-Masons be admitted to the Order, at the same time the ritual was adapted in order to allow this to happen.,,A brief history of the Knights of the Temple and of the Preceptory and Priory of St. George Aboyne 1794‚Äì1994 An original Paper by E.

He is said to have assumed the Office of Grand Master for life, notwithstanding the displeasure of his associates. The Conclave appears to have been moribund in 1830. In 1836 it was remodelled, vacating its Masonic position and admitting non-Masons to membership, including the Bishop of Aberdeen and the Duke of Leeds.\\" .The Royal Masonic Cyclopedia 1877 by Kenneth R H MacKenzie Page 156 :\\"DEUCHAR CHARTERS.-So called from Alexander Deuchar, an engraver, who was the principal mover in the establishment of the Grand Conclave of Knight Templar in Scotland, and its first Grand Master in the early part of this century. Deuchar seems to have become acquainted with Knights Templarism, in consequence of communications he had with Fratres serving in the Shropshire Militia, who had been dubbed under a warrant emanating from Dublin. This corps was quartered in Edinburgh in 1798 ; and from the Fratres of this corps it is most probable that the first Grand Assembly of Knights Templar was opened in Edinburgh ; this, however gave place to the Grand Assembly of High Knights Templar, working Under a charter No 31 from the Early Grand Encampment of Ireland, of which Deuchar was Grand Master. But these Deuchar Charters were clearly extra-Masonic, as they authorised Encampments to install Knights Templar and Knights of St John of Jerusalem, on the one condition that that such Encampments should not hold any communion or intercourse with any Chapter or Encampment, or body assuming that name, holding meetings of Knights Templar, under a Master Mason's Charter This body, however, lost its authority, in consequence of having nothing over which to exercise it, about 1837.\\" Previously only Royal Arch Masons in Good Standing were allowed to join. Only the Royal Grand Conclave was allowed to admit non-Masons and these men were never members of any Encampments, only of Grand Conclave.\\" The modern non-Masonic Order Militi Templi Scotia claims descent from Alexander Deuchar who was a Freemason.

Role in pseudohistory and popular culture The legend that Knight Templars escaped their persecution in Europe and headed for sanctuary in Scotland has pervaded through hundreds of modern pseudohistory publications. Connections between Templarism and Freemasonry have been around for as long but publishers saw a synergy from the 1980s onwards in trying to connect Templarism, Freemasonry, Rosslyn Chapel, Esoteric belief systems and Scotland altogether. A number of key publications that try to tie Templarism, Freemasonry and Scotland together include: The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover John J. Robinson, Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover (1989), Michael Baigent The Temple and the Lodge (1991), Coppens, Philip. The Stone Puzzle of Rosslyn Chapel. Frontier Publishing/Adventures Unlimited Press (2002). It is discussed in the pseudohistory book The Temple and The Lodge by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, first published in 1989. On the subject of a possible Bruce connection, Masonic Historian D Murray Lyon wrote \\"The fraternity of Kilwinning never at any period practiced or acknowledged other than the Craft degrees; neither does there exist any tradition worthy of the name, local or national, nor has any authentic document yet been discovered that can in the remotest degree be held to identify Robert Bruce with the holding of Masonic Courts, or the institution of a secret society at Kilwinning.\\" St Clair ‚Äì Sinclair speculation According to tradition, William St Clair, (William Sinclair) 3rd Earl of Orkney, Baron of Roslin and 1st Earl of Caithness built Rosslyn Chapel. A later William Sinclair of Roslin became the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland.Arcane Schools, John Yarker, p. 434 The St Clair, later Sinclair, Earls of Rosslyn or Roslin have also been connected to Templarism in Scotland, but Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson in their recent book, 'Rosslyn and the Grail',Rosslyn and the Grail, Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson note that the St Clair of Rosslyn testified against the Templars at their trial in Edinburgh in 1309. Dr. Louise Yeoman points out that the Rosslyn/Knights Templar connection is false, having been invented by 18th century fiction-writers, and that Rosslyn Chapel was built by William Sinclair so that Mass could be said for the souls of his family.Scotsman.com News In Michael T.R.B Turnbull's book Rosslyn Chapel Revealed he states that \\"Eighteen years after the suppression of the Order, Sir William Sainteclaire, in the role of a Crusader(not Templar), made a brave and honourable bid to fulfil the wishes of his late monarch, King Robert The Bruce\\".Rosslyn Chapel Revealed, Michael T.R.B Turnbull, page 152 He then explains that he and his wife Lady Margaret Ramsay of Dalhousie produced a son (also Sir William)to succeed him as the 8th Baron of Rosslyn. Turnbull States that \\"His father could never have been a Knight Templar, as his wealth and marriage would have broken two of the three Templar vows ‚Äì Poverty and chastity\\". In 18th century fiction, a connection was made between the Templars and Rosslyn Chapel, built by (William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness. According to Freemason John Yarker, a later William Sinclair of Roslin became the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The St Clair, later Sinclair, Earls of Rosslyn or Roslin have also been connected to Templarism in Scotland.

He is father to film directors Bernardo and Giuseppe Bertolucci. Biography Bertolucci was born at San Lazzaro (province of Parma), to a family of agricultural bourgeoisie of northern Italy. He began to write poems very early. In 1928 he collaborated to the Gazzetta di Parma, where his friend Cesare Zavattini was editor-in-chief. The following year Bertolucci published his first poetical collection, Sirio. In 1931 he started his studies of law in the University of Parma, which however he left soon in favour of artistical and literary studies. In the following year his work Fuochi di Novembre gained him the praise of Italian poets like Eugenio Montale. In 1951 he moved to Rome. His marriage with Ninetta Giovanardi had given him two sons, Bernardo (1940-2018) and Giuseppe (1947-2012), both future film directors. In 1951 he also published La capanna indiana and won the Viareggio Prize for literature. In this period he cemented a friendship with Pier Paolo Pasolini. Viaggio d'inverno (\\"Winter Voyage\\") of 1971 is one of Bertolucci's finest works. This work saw a noteworthy change of style in Bertolucci's poetry: while the first works were, according to Franco Fortini, characterized by \\"the choice of a humble language for pastoral situations\\", his works were more complex and marked by unsureness feelings. From 1975, together with Enzo Siciliano and Alberto Moravia, he directed the literary review Nuovi Argomenti. He won another Viareggio Prize for the narrative poem Camera da letto (1984‚Äì1988). His last work was La lucertola di Casarola (1997), a collection of works from his youth and other unpublished poems. Bertolucci died in Rome in 2000. Selections of his poetry has been translated into English by Charles Tomlinson and Allen Prowle.

Diaz was selected to receive the Futch‚ÄìCondon Award for the 1999 Trainer of the Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America, and was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame on November 15, 2008. Diaz began boxing when he was eight years old, and experienced twenty-seven amateur outings, but had a very short career as a professional boxer, having only one fight and then retired from boxing as a fighter. Diaz moved to Los Angeles, California, where he established the Miguel Diaz boxing gym. One of his first world champions was Pedro Decima. He also trained Erik Morales who knocked Daniel Zaragoza out in eleven rounds at El Paso, Texas for the WBC world Bantamweight championship. Diaz then began traveling between Los Angeles and Tijuana to help train Morales. Miguel Diaz also worked as a cutman/co-trainer for Diego 'Chico' Corrales and Floyd 'Money' Mayweather. This created a conflict when they fought. Rather than stay with Mayweather, whom he had a longer relationship with he decided to work Corrales' corner. Mayweather was professional but let Diaz know he wouldn't work with Diaz again if he made this decision. Diaz was confident in Corrales' victory, had a bigger role with Corrales, and was getting a larger percentage of the fighters purse for working in this capacity. Mayweather dominated the fight and won. Since then Miguel Diaz no longer worked with Corrales nor Mayweather. This resulted in millions of dollars of lost income as Mayweather went on to be one of the highest-grossing fighters in boxing history. He went on to help train Fernando Vargas for a number of fights and established a second Miguel Diaz boxing gym, located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Diaz is currently residing part-time in Puerto Rico, where he helps train brothers Miguel Angel and Jos√© Miguel Cotto as well as Daniel Jimenez, among others. Miguel Cotto has reached world championship status, winning the WBO Junior Welterweight crown. He currently coaches Marcos Maidana.

He served as State-Secretary in the Socialist/Communist regime of Kurt Eisner that overthrew the Bavarian Wittelsbach Monarchy. After its overthrow, he worked as a newspaper editor during the Weimar period. After the Nazi seizure of power, he was arrested and later executed. He was born in Mergentheim, the son of a lower-middle-class family . He took vocational education in W√ºrzburg until 1910. Later, he worked in a shoe store. In 1911 he secured work in Frankfurt but was later fired for union-activity and because of a strike he led. From 1912 until 1914 he was a party secretary of the SPD in Munich, he served in World War I was wounded, became a pacifist, later becoming state secretary (1918‚Äì1919). During World War I he was a pacifist and served as Private Secretary for Kurt Eisner, the prime minister of Bavaria, shortly after the war. Felix Fechenbach was the son of Noe Fechenbach and Rosalie Fenchenbach. He grew up in poverty. He had four brothers called Max, Siegbert, Mortiz, Abraham, and Jackob Fechenbach. His first job was delivering bread with his older brother Abraham in the town of W√ºrzburg. His first best friend was called Stoffele, the girl next door. Unfortunately, she died at age 7; every time her name was mentioned, he would burst into tears. He started his very first apprenticeship at age 13 at a shoe store. Felix Fechenbach later married Martha Fechenbach on April 27, 1894, and to Irma Epstein on October 16, 1895 and he had a total of three children. After being killed by an approaching SA commando, on his way to the Dachau concentration camp, his late wife Irma Epstein was able to escape with their children. He was jailed in 1922 for publishing secret diplomatic telegrams while Staats Secretary under Eisner, before the Bavarian Soviet Republic. The decision was a scandal because the court at that time had no standing under the Weimar Constitution. He was pardoned in 1924. He thereafter travelled to Berlin and worked for Kinderfreunde (Friends of Children) and criticised the SPD in his children's stories while still a member of the party. In 1929, he became the editor in chief of the SPD newspaper Volksblatt in Detmold. On 11 March 1933 he was jailed by the new Nazi government for his anti-fascist activities, and was shot on 7 August by members of the SS and SA in a forest between Detmold and Warburg while being transported to the Dachau concentration camp. There are two schools named after Fechenbach: the Felix- Fechenbach Gesamtschule in Leopoldshoehe and the Felix-Fechenbach Berufskolleg in Detmold.Felix-Fechenbach-Gesamtschule Leopoldsh√∂he A street in Detmold and in Oerlinghausen was also named after him.

The group was formed specifically for the purpose of evaluating the suitability of the broadcast flag for preventing unauthorized redistribution (including unauthorized redistribution over the Internet of unencrypted digital terrestrial broadcast television (DTV)) and to determine whether there was substantial support for the broadcast flag. The group completed its mission with the release of the BPDG Report. The BPDG has reached a consensus on the use of a technical broadcast flag standard for digital broadcast copy protection. The broadcast flag is an electronic marker embedded in over-the- air digital broadcast signals that would block or limit the ability of consumer electronics devices to make copies of the programs. The broadcast flag would also prevent the redistribution of such programs over the Internet. Despite reaching a consensus on this standard, the BPDG did not reach any agreement concerning how to implement the use of the flag or enforce it.  Digital TV programs protection using broadcast flags  The group proposed that digital TV programs be embedded with a \\"broadcast flag.\\" All digital devices would be required to recognize the flag, which would prevent the protected content from being distributed on the Internet. The report states, \\"The proposed technical solution does not interfere with the ability of consumers to both make copies of DTV content, and to exchange such content among devices connected within a digital home network.\\" BPDG publications After several meetings, the BPDG has published some reports in order to enforce the idea of the broadcast flag. Those publications are: *BPDG Final Reportl *Summary of EFF Report on BPDG *Full EFF Report on BPDG *Table A What is EFF? The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a nonprofit group of passionate people-‚Äîlawyers, technologists, volunteers, and visionaries-‚Äîworking to protect digital rights. Blending the expertise of lawyers, policy analysts, activists, and technologists, EFF achieves significant victories on behalf of consumers and the general public. EFF fights for freedom primarily in the courts, bringing and defending lawsuits even when that means taking on the US government or large corporations. By mobilizing more than 50,000 concerned citizens through our Action Center, EFF beats back bad legislation. In addition to advising policymakers, EFF educates the press and public. Sometimes just defending technologies is not enough, so EFF also supports the development of freedom-enhancing inventions. Policy group is not a CPTWG sub-group? Several CPTWG (Copy Protection Technical Working Group) participants indicated at CPTWG's June 5 meeting that the \\"parallel group\\" or \\"policy group\\" is \\"not a sub-group of CPTWG or \\"not part of CPTWG\\". Broadcast flag is not a watermark Some recent press coverage of BPDG refers to the BPDG proposal as recommending a watermark in digital TV broadcasts. This is a misperception of the nature of the broadcast flag. (There is a distinct proposal called the broadcast watermark which was not discussed extensively within BPDG and is not part of the BPDG's published recommendations.) A watermark is commingled directly with the signal it marks, and thereby alters the signal (ideally, in an imperceptible way). By contrast, the broadcast flag exists side-by-side with video content it marks. Terms to describe the broadcast flag, rather than watermark, might include \\"bit\\", \\"indicator\\", \\"flag\\", \\"descriptor\\", \\"tag\\", \\"header field\\", or \\"notice\\". But use of \\"watermark\\" is sure to generate confusion, especially because watermark proposals distinct from BPDG do exist. Watermarking is likely to be a big issue soon in a public forum‚Äîbut not as a part of BPDG's proposal. Misconceptions about BPDG An article by John Dvorak seems to contain a misconception: that the result of BPDG's work will be the obsolescence of current digital TV receivers. As Dvorak writes: :\\"it appears that the new copy-protection schemes being dreamed up by Hollywood will make every single HDTV set sold to date obsolete. And buyers of new sets are not being told about this situation in a dubious attempt to dump very expensive inventory.\\" :What happened was that the Hollywood folks, who are just freaked over the possibility that we'll be copying HDTV movies, have promoted copy protection that requires the decode circuit to be built into the display, not into the set-top box. This requires the set-top box to send a signal to a connector that new HDTV sets will have. If you're thinking of buying an HDTV, don't, unless it has this connector and circuit-whenever they are finalized.\\" One view is that Dvorak has got the situation backwards. Old equipment will continue to work. This is because BPDG is not planning to encrypt broadcasts at all‚Äîmerely to cause them to include a \\"broadcast flag\\", and to obtain legislation forcing all manufacturers to comply with its rules. The result of this would be that old equipment would be better and more useful than new equipment. Not only would it work properly, but it wouldn't have been crippled by having to comply with the Compliance and Robustness Rules. This is to say that old equipment would be more functional, not less functional, than new equipment. Alphabet soup \\"BPDG wants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to mandate Digital Rights Management (DRM) for ATSC DTB receivers In the body of this article, there are expansions for about 80 of the most common acronyms used in discussions about this issue. (The acronyms expanded include every acronym which appears in the BPDG's Draft Compliance and Robustness Rules, among others.) Of course, this it not enough to appreciate the context behind these acronyms.

This appendix, called Table A, enumerates the kinds of digital outputs which are allowed on devices which can receive digital television signals. The idea is that a device which receives a TV program with the broadcast flag set is not allowed to output the content of that program in digital form, except via a technology specifically mentioned on Table A. This raises three questions: first, why should this be so? (What's wrong with letting device manufacturers choose for themselves what kinds of outputs their devices will have? If consumers want a particular kind of output, why shouldn't they have it? Why should legislation determine the capabilities of future digital televisions?) Second, what technologies will be permitted? Third, how is that decision going to be made? The first question goes to the heart of the BPDG proposal and is addressed elsewhere (at least, by skeptics of BPDG; there has not been much in the way of a public defense of this mandate, which is being represented as a fait accompli in most circles). The second and third questions are empirical matters. An earlier draft of the BPDG Compliance and Robustness Rules divided Table A into Authorized Digital Outputs and Authorized Digital Removable Media Recording Methods. The two Authorized Outputs mentioned were Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) and High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP); the two Recording Methods mentioned were Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM) and D-VHS. DTCP is a copy-control scheme for digital video devised by five companies (called the \\"5C consortium\\"). HDCP is a similar copy-control scheme devices by only four companies (the \\"4C consortium\\"). Both of these schemes restrict what a consumer can do with digital video; both require a license if a device manufacturer is going to be able to implement them; both constrain the functionality of products in which they are incorporated. Both cost money to implement‚Äîthe licenses are not free. DTCP encrypts video transmitted over a digital bus called IEEE 1394 (or \\"FireWire\\"). HDCP encrypts video transmitted over a different‚Äîand video-specific‚Äîbus called Digital Visual Interface (\\"DVI\\"). The encryption, in both cases, is meant to \\"protect\\" the content against the consumer, and to restrict playback of the content to \\"authorized\\", licensed devices. Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM) is an encryption scheme for recordable media which is also meant to prevent media from being played back in devices other than those licensed by the 4C consortium. D-VHS is a new digital videotape spec which‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîalso prevents media from being played back, except in licensed devices. So here the suggestion was that four particular copy-control technologies, all closed standards and all of which have \\"compliance and robustness rules\\" of their own, were to be permitted as outputs from digital television receivers; all other video standards, and all other recording media, were to be banned by default. Since the BPDG was formed by companies from the 5C and 4C consortia, it is difficult to imagine that it would recommend that their technologies not be permitted. Subsequently, the specific technology list was removed from Table A; the current discussion draft from BPDG does not contain any specific technologies at all, though it still bans \\"unauthorized\\" technologies by default. But now Table A has been left blank, and a discussion has begun about a proper procedure for choosing technologies to be added. (This shift took place as a result of a discussion at the last BPDG in-person meeting in Los Angeles.) All current proposals for filling in Table A seem to involve agreement by some number of major movie studios‚Äîthat is, members of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) -- and, perhaps, agreement by some number of major electronics companies or other corporations. No agreement has been reached within BPDG, but various \\"vehicles\\" or \\"methods\\" for approving technologies have been suggested. These typically employ a formula such as \\"n% of Major Studios and m% of manufacturers\\". No studio proposal, has yet contemplated the possibility that technologies could be approved without any Hollywood sign-off. Thus, the discussion appears to be centered on choosing values for the percentages to be plugged into these formulas.

S. Ravikumar and produced by S. S. Chakravarthy. The film stars Ajith Kumar in a dual role, alongside Meena and Kiran. Sujatha, FEFSI Vijayan, Karunas and Ramesh Khanna appear in other significant roles, while Vidyasagar composed the score and soundtrack for the film. Villain was dubbed into Hindi as Jeet: The Mission of Success. Ajith's performance in the film won him his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor. It was remade in Telugu as the same name. Plot Shiva and Vishnu (both played by Ajith Kumar) are identical twins. Shiva, the elder one, is a bus conductor, while Vishnu, the younger one, has a mild intellectual disability. Shiva overhears his parents' plot to kill Vishnu. He runs away to another city with Vishnu and strives hard to look after him. A 'dada' Sundaramoorthy (FEFSI Vijayan), who runs a beggar trade, beats Vishnu brutally, and Vishnu becomes handicapped for life. Shiva leaves Vishnu in a home run by a social worker Lalitha (Sujatha). During the day, Shiva works as a bus conductor, and at the same time, poses as Vishnu: to play Robin Hood and steal from the rich and corrupt. A gang including Thangam (Meena), Mani(Ramesh Khanna), and others assist him in these operations. He is never suspected, and so, with the stolen money, he takes care of not only Vishnu, but also 800 people in other institutions for the physically handicapped. A college student Lavanya (Kiran Rathod) falls in love with Shiva, but he later comes to know she is Sundaramoorthy's sister-in-law. Matters worsen when Sundaramoorthy becomes the chairman of the institute for the physically disabled. How Shiva deals with the situation forms the rest of the story. Meanwhile, Thangam is in love with Shiva, though he does not know this. Later she gives up her love and lets Lavanya marry Shiva. At last, Shiva marries Lavanya and Thangam marries Vishnu.

The school offered programmes in acting and mime, as well as various shorter courses.

Irish emigrants from the Midlands, Wexford and many counties of Ireland arrived in Argentina mainly from 1830 to 1930, with the largest wave taking place in 1850‚Äì1870. The modern Irish-Argentine community is composed of some of their descendants, and the total number is estimated at 500,000‚Äì1,000,000. Argentina is the home of the fifth largest Irish community in the world, the largest in a non-English speaking nation and the greatest in Latin America.Viva Irlanda! Exploring the Irish in ArgentinaIrlandeses en la Argentina: una verde pasi√≥n (in Spanish) Reasons for emigration Admiral William Brown, commonly known as the \\"father of the Argentine Navy\\", is regarded as one of Argentina's national heroes.. Used mainly in Argentina but also in other countries like the United Kingdom, such as this BBC report. URL accessed on 15 October 2006. Most of those who left Ireland arrived in Buenos Aires attracted by the possibility of better living conditions, as the economic, social and political conditions in Ireland at the time were quite poor, but the emigrants came from counties and social segments in which the economic conditions were not the worst (Westmeath, Longford, Offaly, Wexford). Others, in turn, left after receiving favourable descriptions of the country from friends and family who had already arrived in Argentina. The real or perceived possibility to becoming landowners in the R√≠o de la Plata region (Argentina and Uruguay) and consequently joining the South American landed gentry, was the most important factor attracting thousands of young men to the area. Others had arrived earlier as merchants, artisans and mercenaries, such as William Brown, who fought for the cause of Argentine independence and the Argentine war against Brazil. For Irish immigrants, the new lands of the Southern Cone of South America brought further interest for immigration to purchase large land tracts for bargain prices, working first as labourers, then in \\"halves\\" or \\"thirds\\" in the sheep-farming business, and finally renting and purchasing land. Numbers of immigrants It is difficult to accurately calculate the exact number of immigrants. Many Irish newcomers declared themselves to be ingleses, as all of Ireland at the time was still part of the United Kingdom, and others were simply assumed to be British by the authorities. The immigration records in Buenos Aires lack any entries dating from before 1822 and the years 1823, 1824, 1836, 1840, 1841, 1842 and 1855. The records in between these years are also incomplete, due to conflicts of who was Irish, English and Scottish in South American demographics. Between 1822 and 1829, at least 7,160 Irish immigrants arrived, being 1889 the peak of this migration (on 15 February of this year 1,774 people arrived on the steamer SS Dresden). Based on incomplete passenger list records, as well as on census returns (Buenos Aires 1855, national 1869 and national 1895) transcribed by Eduardo A. Coghlan (1982, 1987), researchers made elaborate calculations of the total number of immigrants. Juan Carlos Korol and Hilda Sabato estimated that the total number of Irish immigrants in the nineteenth century was between 10,500 and 11,500 (C√≥mo fue la inmigraci√≥n irlandesa a la Argentina, 1981 p. 48). However, further research conducted by Patrick MacKenna shows that Coghlan, Korol and Sabato did not consider return migration and re-migration, which was significant after the 1880s, as well as the high mortality ratios for the Irish immigrants in certain periods before the 1869 census (e.g. during the 1868 cholera outbreak in the Buenos Aires province). Group of Irishmen in Argentina in the 19th century For the nineteenth century, one out of every two Irish emigrants to Argentina went back to Ireland or re-migrated to the United States, Canada, Australia and other destinations. MacKenna says that Korol and Sabato \\"greatly underestimated the number of Irish immigrants\\" and considers that the total number of Irish immigrants in Argentina in the nineteenth century should be estimated in between 45,000 and 50,000 (M.A. thesis at NUI Maynooth, 1992, p. 83). The neglect of Anglo-Irish, Scot-Irish and in general Protestant Irish immigration in Argentina should add further numbers, particularly in the last peak of immigration after the 1920s Anglo-Irish War of Independence. The southernmost tip of Chile and Argentina, in places like the city of Punta Arenas and also the Falkland Islands, were other destinations for Irish and Scottish immigrants which are frequently underestimated. Eduardo A. Coghlan reported 16,284 Irish Argentines in Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires Province at the turn of the twentieth century. Only 4,693 of these had actually been born in Ireland, just 28.8% of the population, while another 11,591 individuals had been born in Argentina. At present, roughly 500,000 Argentines are of Irish descent. Economic activities President Mauricio Macri and Irish Ambassador in Argentina, Jacqueline O‚ÄôHalloran. The Irish immigrants settled mainly in Buenos Aires, the homonymous province, and the littoral provinces. Those in urban areas worked as labourers, merchants, employees, artisans, teachers, professionals and, increasingly after the 1860s and especially for women, as domestic servants. The Irish in the countryside worked as rural labourers, cattle dealers, and shepherds. Those in the flourishing sheep-farming business of 1840‚Äì1890 were most likely to succeed working as shepherds and sharing a half or a third of the produce in wool and lambs. In this way, some of them managed to rent and later purchase land. In Curumalal, Buenos Aires, and Venado Tuerto, Santa Fe, Eduardo Casey helped populate the agriculturally barren provinces, inviting more Irish and other immigrants to Argentina to work for him. This recommendation system was very active, and, with almost limitless amounts of land available, many Irish immigrants went on to do very well economically. This industry expanded to other places, eventually flourishing in the rest of Santa Fe, Entre R√≠os and C√≥rdoba. The Dresden Affair The Dresden Affair marked the end of mass Irish emigration to Argentina. Less fortunate Irish immigrants were recruited in the 1870s and 1880s among poor segments in Dublin, Cork and other counties, and sent as colonists to Argentina. Irish-Argentine agents hired by the Buenos Aires provincial government actively worked in Ireland and were paid by the state and the shipping companies. In 1889, the Dresden Affair occurred when agents Buckley O'Meara and John Stephen Dillon sent 1,774 emigrants in the steamer City of Dresden. Many died due to the conditions of the journey or upon arrival in Buenos Aires. About seven hundred were carried to Bah√≠a Blanca to establish the Irish Colony of Napost√°, which in a few months was a failure. The vast majority of these immigrants did not stay in the country, and struggled to go back to Ireland or re-migrated to the United States and other places.Murray (Ireland and the Americas), page 273 Following the Dresden Affair, in 1889, Archbishop of Cashel, Thomas Croke wrote: \\"I most solemnly conjure my poorer countrymen, as they value their happiness hereafter, never to set foot on the Argentine Republic however tempted to do so they may be by offers of a passage or an assurance of comfortable homes.\\" Irish immigrants began arriving in Argentina in the 19th century, largely as gauchos and ranchers on the Pampas of Buenos Aires Province.Seamus J. King, \\"The Clash of the Ash on Foreign Fields,\\" page 129. Culture and sport Irish Pub in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. The earliest reference to hurling in Argentina dates from the late 1880s in the ranching town of Mercedes, Buenos Aires, a major center of the Irish-Argentine community. However, the game wasn't actively promoted until 1900 when it came to the attention of author and newspaperman William Bulfin. Under Bulfin's patronage, the Argentine Hurling Club was formed on 15 July 1900. On 17 August 1900, Bulfin printed the rules and a diagram of a hurling pitch in The Southern Cross, the official newspaper of the Argentina's Irish community. Enthusiasm spread rapidly and teams were quickly established in both the neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and the surrounding farming communities. The Passionist and Pallotine Orders took a major role in promoting the game. Games of hurling were played every weekend until 1914 and received frequent coverage even from Argentina's Spanish language newspapers like La Nacion. After the outbreak of World War I, however, it became very almost impossible to obtain hurleys from Ireland. An attempt was made to use native Argentine mountain ash, but it proved too heavy and lacking in pliability. Although the game was revived after the end of the war, the golden age of Argentine hurling had passed. World War II finally brought the era to its close. Ireland and Argentina playing during the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the aftermath of the Second World War, immigration from Ireland slowed to a trickle. In addition, native born Irish-Argentines assimilated far quickier than in other places, Hispanicising their names and frequently marrying outside the community, something unheard of in the past. Although the game continued to be occasionally played into the 1960s, it would never regain its former popularity. In 1980 the Aer Lingus Hurling Club conducted a three-week tour of the country and played matches at several locations, including the Christian Brothers school at Boulogne, Buenos Aires.Seamus J. King, \\"The Clash of the Ash on Foreign Fields,\\" Chapter 7, \\"Hurling in Argentina,\\" pages 129-137 In January 2002 for the first time The Hurling All-Stars Teams 2000 y 2001 came to the Hurling Club in Argentina making an outstanding exhibition. In February 2009 the GAA sent George O'Connor and Martin Lynch to give a Summer Camp, it was so successful that after it two more where conducted on the following years. The last summer camp was given by Damien Coleman on October 2012, who set up the foundation of the team that took part on the 2013 Gathering tournament held on Galway. As mentioned above, in 2013 the team travelled to Galway and played in an outstanding level reaching the final which they lost for one point against the Denver Gaels from the US. The Argentine Hurling Club counts now with a Hurling and a Gaelic Football team, this last one won the first World Games held in Abu Dhabi in the non-Irish division.

It is surrounded by many smaller islands and is home to two villages, both inland; Megalo Chorio (\\"Big Village\\"), and Mikro Chorio (\\"Small Village\\"). Between them is the small settlement of Agios Georgios (Saint George), which forms the island's only harbor and consists of a few hotels and restaurants. The island is also locally known as Gaidaro (\\"Donkey\\"), or by its ancient name Tragea. Front, left to right: Arkoi, Leipsoi, Leros. Back, left to right: Agathonisi, Farmakonisi and the Turkish coastline. The highest point on the island is above sea level. This peak is located close to Mikro Chorio. The island covers an area of . It is made almost entirely of subcrystalline stratified limestones, and is covered with thorny macchia. In the late 1920s the island had 80 inhabitants, active in agriculture and sheep rearing. A census of the island in 1981 showed that it was populated by 133 people. In 1991, another census showed that the population had dropped to 112. By the 2001 census it had again risen to 158 residents, and in 2011 its population was 185, 168 of whom lived in Megalo Chorio, and only 17 in Mikro Chorio.

From 2014 to 2016, Hughes and Norton stayed at SiriusXM as co-hosts of Opie with Jim Norton. In October 2016, Hughes became the host of his own show, The Opie Radio Show, which lasted until his firing from SiriusXM on July 7, 2017. On May 8, 2018, Hughes launched his new podcast, The Opie Radio Podcast, on the Westwood One network. The podcast was available until June 8, 2019.  Early life  Hughes was born on May 23, 1963, into an Irish-American family, and was raised in Centerport, New York, on Long Island, with a mother who he described as \\"pretty strict\\". He gained the nickname \\"Opie\\" because of his childhood resemblance to Opie Taylor, a fictional character from The Andy Griffith Show portrayed by Ron Howard. In 1981, Hughes graduated from Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York; his yearbook lists basketball, the New York Islanders hockey team, skiing, and films as his interests. He wished for a career in radio, and graduated from State University of New York at Geneseo with a degree in communications. During his time studying, Hughes worked air shifts at the university radio station. Career =Early career= After graduating from university, Hughes landed a job in the promotions department at WCMF in Rochester, New York, but soon moved to work on the station's morning show, then hosted by Brother Wease. Hughes credits Wease as a mentor in developing his air personality and furthering his career. Hughes left WCMF to work the midnight to 6:00 a.m. shift at WUFX in Buffalo, New York. As the station was unsupervised during his shift, Hughes was able to develop his style further by performing more outrageous bits, like broadcasting from the roof of the station's building and interviewing passers by on the street. Hughes's next job was at WBAB on Long Island as the host of The Nighttime Attitude, a rock music show from 8:00 p.m. to midnight. In August 1994, Hughes held an O.J. Simpson song parody contest for listeners surrounding the outcome of Simpson's murder case. One of the participants was from a local band named Rotgut that featured Anthony Cumia as lead singer with his brother Joe on guitar. The two performed \\"Gonna Electric Shock O.J.\\" sung to the tune of \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\" by Otis Redding. The song became a hit on Hughes's show, and the two made their first appearance in September 1994 to perform the song live. Cumia made several more appearances soon after; in early 1995, he and Hughes decided to become a radio team. =Opie and Anthony = After Hughes produced an air check and had sent it to several radio stations, he and Cumia accepted an offer from WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, to host afternoons. The show launched as Opie and Anthony on March 13, 1995. They remained in Boston until they were fired in April 1998 from WAAF for an April Fool's Day prank involving Mayor Thomas Menino. Opie and Anthony told their listeners that the mayor had been killed in a car accident while transporting a young male Haitian prostitute. In June 1998, Hughes and with Cumia were back on New York station WNEW-FM, where they became a top 10 afternoon drive show in New York by 2000. In 1999, Hughes considered leaving the show; however Anthony convinced him to stay, and bring Jim Norton on full-time, as a go-between for their off air troubles.February 17, 2015, Opie stated during Larry King interview Anthony attributed these issues to his divorce and off-air personal troubles.The Anthony Cumia Show, Episode 109, ~9:00 marker In 2001, Opie and Anthony signed a syndication deal with Infinity to syndicate their show on 22 stations nationwide, including WBCN in Boston, longtime rival of WAAF. On August 15, 2002, during \\"Sex for Sam 3\\", comedian Paul Mecurio encouraged Brian Florence and Loretta Harper, a Virginia couple visiting Manhattan, to have simulated sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Intense media scrutiny led to many demanding that Opie and Anthony be fired. Opie and Anthony broadcast the next day, but the show went into reruns the following week. On August 22, Infinity suspended Opie and Anthony for the duration of their contract, and canceled the show. Opie and Anthony returned to the air on October 4, 2004, exclusively for XM Satellite Radio. On April 24, 2006, Opie and Anthony announced that they had signed a deal with CBS Radio in which the first three hours of the show would be broadcast on nine of CBS's rock stations, the first official show airing April 26.\\"Opie & Anthony are in\\".

Hayden had claimed in his column to have become aware of the existence of a sex tape of Smigo and Bam Margera, a claim he later retracted. On March 16, 2010, the lawsuit was dismissed as the judge ruled that the original news story was newsworthy, noting that all parties had agreed that no sex tape actually existed.

He was shot by Germans in the Krak√≥w Ghetto, which was set up by Nazi Germany formally on 3 March 1941 in the new General Government district of occupied Poland, during the Holocaust.  Life  Mordechai Gebirtig was born in Krak√≥w under the Austrian Partition, and lived in its Jewish working-class quarter all his life. He served for five years in the Austro-Hungarian army. Gebirtig became a renowned folk artist in Yiddish literature and song while in Krak√≥w. He was self-taught in music, played the shepherd's pipe, and tapped out tunes on the piano with one finger. He earned his livelihood as a furniture worker; while music and theatre were his avocations. His life ended in the Nazi shooting action carried out in the Krak√≥w Ghetto on the infamous \\"Bloody Thursday\\" of June 4, 1942. = Gebirtig‚Äôs political opinions = Gebirtig belonged to the Jewish Social Democratic Party, a political party in Galicia which merged into the Jewish Labour Bund after World War I. The Bund was a Yiddishist proletarian socialist party, which called for Jewish cultural autonomy in a democratic Second Republic.  Music  From 1906 he was a member of the Jewish Amateur Troupe in Krak√≥w. He also wrote songs and theater reviews for Der sotsial-demokrat, the Yiddish organ of the Jewish Social- Democratic Party. It was in such an environment that Gebirtig developed, encouraged by such professional writers and Yiddishist cultural activists as Avrom Reyzen, who for a time lived and published a journal in Krakow. Gebirtig's talent was his own, but he took the language, themes, types, tone, and timbre of his pieces from his surroundings, in some measure continuing the musical tradition of the popular Galician cabaret entertainers known as the Broder singers, who in turn were beholden to the yet older and still vital tradition of the badchen's (wedding jester's) improvisatory art.  Style of folk songs  He published his first collection of songs in 1920, in the Second Polish Republic. It was titled Folkstimlekh ('of the folk'). His songs spread quickly even before they were published, and many people regarded them as folksongs whose author or authors were anonymous. Adopted by leading Yiddish players such as Molly Picon, Gebirtig's songs became staples of numerous regular as well as improvised theatrical productions wherever Yiddish theatre was performed. It is not an exaggeration to say that Gebirtig's songs were lovingly sung the world over. = S'brent = One of Gebirtig's best- known songs is \\"S'brent\\" (It is Burning), written in 1938 in response to the 1936 Przytyk pogrom in the shtetl (small town) of Przytyk. Gebirtig had hoped its message, ‚ÄúDon't stand there, brothers, douse the fire!‚Äù would be a call to action. Krak√≥w (Cracow) underground Jewish resistance adopted S'brent as its anthem in World War II. \\"Undzer shtetl brennt\\" was sung in the Nazi ghettos of German-occupied Europe. Since then the song, in the original Yiddish and in its Hebrew translation titled \\"Ha-Ayyarah Bo'eret\\" (◊î◊¢◊ô◊ô◊®◊î ◊ë◊ï◊¢◊®◊™), \\"Our Little Town is Burning!\\" - hence the occasional reference to a Yiddish title, \\"Undzer Shtetl Brent!\\", continues to be widely performed in the context of Holocaust commemoration. = Arbetsloze marsh = One of Gebirtig's political songs that is also still popular today is the Arbetloze marsh, or Song of the Unemployed:  Recognition  Gebirtig is best known for his song \\"It is Burning\\" (Undzer shtetl brent) which was written in 1938, and which was later adopted by the Jewish youth of Krak√≥w and others as a battle song against the Nazis. In his song \\"S'tut vey\\" ('It Hurts'), Gebirtig is shattered by the absence of solidarity of all Polish citizens against the Nazi invaders. Dated Krak√≥w, February 1940, it is a song directed against those bystanders who laughed when German soldiers humiliated Jews in the streets of Krak√≥w. Pianist Anthony Coleman recorded an album of Gebirtig's compositions Shmutsige Magnaten in Krak√≥w in 2005.  Publications and recordings  * Gehat hob ich a hejm.

The species grows in open, high forest at elevations of 1600 to 2100 m. It produces dainty, colourful pitchers reaching only a few centimetres in height. These traps are red speckled on a yellowish background, giving them a \\"hand painted\\" appearance.D'Amato, P. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley. The specific epithet glabrata is derived from the Latin word glaber, meaning \\"hairless\\", and refers to the mostly glabrous nature of this species. Botanical history As in the case of N. eymae and N. hamata, two formal descriptions of this species were published almost concurrently. The first, by Shigeo Kurata under the name N. rubromaculata, was published on February 6, 1984, in the Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society. The second, by John R. Turnbull and Anne T. Middleton as N. glabratus, was published four days later on February 10, in Reinwardtia.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1‚Äì157. Although Kurata's article was printed first, the name he used is a later homonym of a horticultural hybrid published in 1891 (N. √ó rubromaculata) and is thus a nomen illegitimum (illegitimate name).Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes glabrata . Carnivorous Plant Database. Nepenthes glabrata (emended with a feminine suffix)Schlauer, J. 1994. NEPENTHES comments for Flora Malesiana. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, September 9, 1994. is therefore the correct name for this species.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. The holotype of N. glabrata, J.R.Turnbull & A.T.Middleton 83113a, was collected on August 31, 1983, from the Tri Tunggal Eboni Corp. logging concession () in Central Sulawesi at an altitude of 1666 m. In their description of the species, Turnbull and Middleton wrote that the specimen was deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens, but Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek were unable to locate it in 1995 and 1996, and write that it \\"may never have been distributed\\". The holotype of N. rubromaculata Sh.Kurata, Kurata, Atsumi & Komatsu 149a, was collected on November 9, 1983, from the route from Malei to Kajoga in Central Sulawesi. The type repository is not indicated in the description, but is likely to be the herbarium of the Nippon Dental College (NDC). Soon after these descriptions were published, the authors introduced the species into cultivation.D'Amato, P. 2000. Re: N. glabrata . Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, February 24, 2000. Hobbyists distinguished two forms: \\"Palo Alto\\", which produces more compact pitchers and narrow leaves that turn purple under high light levels; and \\"Forestville\\", which has somewhat larger pitchers, particularly aerial ones. Description Nepenthes glabrata is a climbing plant growing to a height of 13 m.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The stem is terete to slightly two-ridged and up to 3 mm in diameter. Internodes are up to 3 cm long. A young rosette plant Leaves are chartaceous and sessile. The lamina (leaf blade) of young rosette plants is linear, while that of rosettes on mature plants may be greatly reduced to the point of being almost absent. On climbing stems, the lamina is narrowly oblong-ligulate to narrowly oblanceolate. It measures up to 12 cm in length by 3 cm in width. It has an acute apex with a slightly peltate tendril insertion. The lamina is shortly attenuate at the base, clasping the stem by approximately one-third to one-half of its circumference and may or may not become decurrent as a pair of very low ridges. One to three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are inconspicuous. Rosette and lower pitchers are small and globose. Upper pitchers are shortly cylindrical to slightly infundibular. They grow to 14 cm in height by 3 cm in width. The wings found in aerial pitchers are distinctive in that they are well developed (‚â§10 mm wide) but lack fringe elements. The pitcher mouth has an oblique insertion. The peristome is cylindrical and narrow, measuring only up to 2.5 mm in width. It bears very fine ribs (0.1 mm high) spaced 0.25‚Äì0.5 mm apart. Unusually, the inner margin of the peristome lacks teeth. The pitcher lid, or operculum, is suborbicular in shape and measures up to 2.8 cm in length by 3.1 cm in width. It has a rounded to truncate apex and a truncate base. The underside of the lid lacks appendages but bears scattered nectar glands up to 0.2 mm in diameter. It shows unusual palmate nervation, with the midrib branching and connecting to the lateral veins around 1 cm below the apex. An unbranched spur (‚â§5 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Nepenthes glabrata has a racemose inflorescence measuring up to 20 cm in length, of which the peduncle makes up 7 cm. It bears around 55 one-flowered partial peduncles lacking bracts. The reddish-green flowers have oblong tepals up to 3 mm long and are borne on pedicels measuring up to 8 mm. Most parts of the plant are glabrous. The exceptions to this are the spur and the inflorescence, which bear an indumentum of simple white hairs around 0.2 mm long. A climbing plant in high forest Ecology Nepenthes glabrata is endemic to Central Sulawesi, where it grows terrestrially in open, high forest. It has an altitudinal distribution of 1600 to 2100 m above sea level. At one location, N. glabrata has been found growing alongside N. maxima and Drosera burmannii at 1600 m.Evans, D.P. 2009. New Cultivars: Nepenthes maxima ‚ÄòLake Poso‚Äô. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 38(1): 18‚Äì22. A putative natural hybrid with the former has been recorded. Nepenthes glabrata is classified as Least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, based on an assessment carried out in 2015. Related species Nepenthes glabrata belongs to what has been called the \\"N. tentaculata group\\" or \\"Hamata group\\",Meimberg, H. & G. Heubl 2006. Introduction of a nuclear marker for phylogenetic analysis of Nepenthaceae. Plant Biology 8(6): 831‚Äì840. which also includes four other closely related species from Borneo and Sulawesi: N. hamata, N. muluensis, N. murudensis, and N. tentaculata. More recently, N. nigra has joined this group of related taxa.Nerz, J., A. Wistuba, C.C. Lee, G. Bourke, U. Zimmermann & S. McPherson 2011. Nepenthes nigra, a new pitcher plant from Central Sulawesi. In: McPherson, S.R. New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 468‚Äì491. In their 2001 monograph, Cheek and Jebb considered N. glabrata to be most closely allied to N. muluensis based on its atypical lid nervation as well as the size, shape, and pigmentation of its upper pitchers. Currently, it appears that N. glabrata is most closely related to N. pitopangii, a highland species also endemic to Sulawesi. While the stem, laminae, and lower pitchers of these species are very similar, the markedly different upper pitcher morphology means that they are unlikely to be confused. The aerial pitchers of N. pitopangii are far less elongated than those of N. glabrata and completely lack wings. Natural hybrids A young plant of a putative natural hybrid between N. glabrata and N. maxima Where their ranges overlap, N. glabrata is known to hybridise with N. hamata,Lee, C.C. 2006. Sulawesi Photographs . Carnivorous Plants in the tropics. N. maxima, N. nigra,McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sulawesi. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. and N. tentaculata. The hybrid plants are generally intermediate in appearance between their parent species. References Further reading * Bauer, U., C.J.

The term was coined by Humphries and Driver in 1970 for unpredictable behaviour exhibited by prey animals. It was used in the context of human courtship behaviour by Grammer et al. in 2000. The researchers named the ritual for the shape-shifting Greek god because of the ambiguity of the signals. The name also suggests a first impression, or something that precedes actual flirting. Because of the unconscious nature of proteans, they are not overt invitations to proceed, but more akin to \\"tells\\" in a poker game. One study found that women tend to exhibit interest in the first few minutes of their interactions with strangers regardless of their level of attraction, and only indicated their true level of interest after this time. These signals often indicate that the sender is trying to decide whether they are interested in the \\"receiver\\". However, some individuals, instead of playing along, will overestimate the sender's interest and do something more obvious, like asking for a phone number. This can be clumsy and confusing to both parties, and understanding the concept of protean signals is useful for avoiding such missteps.

Graph mining, sequential pattern mining and molecule mining are special cases of structured data mining. Description The growth of the use of semi-structured data has created new opportunities for data mining, which has traditionally been concerned with tabular data sets, reflecting the strong association between data mining and relational databases. Much of the world's interesting and mineable data does not easily fold into relational databases, though a generation of software engineers have been trained to believe this was the only way to handle data, and data mining algorithms have generally been developed only to cope with tabular data. XML, being the most frequent way of representing semi-structured data, is able to represent both tabular data and arbitrary trees. Any particular representation of data to be exchanged between two applications in XML is normally described by a schema often written in XSD. Practical examples of such schemata, for instance NewsML, are normally very sophisticated, containing multiple optional subtrees, used for representing special case data. Frequently around 90% of a schema is concerned with the definition of these optional data items and sub-trees. Messages and data, therefore, that are transmitted or encoded using XML and that conform to the same schema are liable to contain very different data depending on what is being transmitted. Such data presents large problems for conventional data mining. Two messages that conform to the same schema may have little data in common. Building a training set from such data means that if one were to try to format it as tabular data for conventional data mining, large sections of the tables would or could be empty. There is a tacit assumption made in the design of most data mining algorithms that the data presented will be complete. The other necessity is that the actual mining algorithms employed, whether supervised or unsupervised, must be able to handle sparse data. Namely, machine learning algorithms perform badly with incomplete data sets where only part of the information is supplied. For instance methods based on neural networks. or Ross Quinlan's ID3 algorithm. are highly accurate with good and representative samples of the problem, but perform badly with biased data. Most of times better model presentation with more careful and unbiased representation of input and output is enough. A particularly relevant area where finding the appropriate structure and model is the key issue is text mining. XPath is the standard mechanism used to refer to nodes and data items within XML. It has similarities to standard techniques for navigating directory hierarchies used in operating systems user interfaces. To data and structure mine XML data of any form, at least two extensions are required to conventional data mining. These are the ability to associate an XPath statement with any data pattern and sub statements with each data node in the data pattern, and the ability to mine the presence and count of any node or set of nodes within the document. As an example, if one were to represent a family tree in XML, using these extensions one could create a data set containing all the individuals node in the tree, data items such as name and age at death, and counts of related nodes, such as number of children. More sophisticated searches could extract data such as grandparents' lifespans etc. The addition of these data types related to the structure of a document or message facilitates structure mining.

Drying is a method of food preservation that works by removing water from the food, which inhibits the growth of microorganisms. Open air drying using sun and wind has been practiced since ancient times to preserve food.\\"Historical Origins of Food Preservation.\\". Accessed June 2011. Water is usually removed by evaporation (air drying, sun drying, smoking or wind drying) but, in the case of freeze-drying, food is first frozen and then the water is removed by sublimation. Bacteria, yeasts and molds need the water in the food to grow, and drying effectively prevents them from surviving in the food. Fish are preserved through such traditional methods as drying, smoking and salting.Grandidier (1899), p. 521 The oldest traditional way of preserving fish was to let the wind and sun dry it. Drying food is the world's oldest known preservation method, and dried fish has a storage life of several years. The method is cheap and effective in suitable climates; the work can be done by the fisherman and family, and the resulting product is easily transported to market. __TOC__ Types A fish flake, such as this one in Norway, is a rack used for drying cod Flattened fish drying in the sun in Madagascar Assorted dried fish in Imphal, Manipur, India =Stockfish= Stockfish is unsalted fish, especially cod, dried by cold air and wind on wooden racks on the foreshore. The drying racks are known as fish flakes. Cod is the most common fish used in stockfish production, though other whitefish, such as pollock, haddock, ling and tusk, are also used. =Clipfish= Over the centuries, several variants of dried fish have evolved. Stockfish, dried as fresh fish and not salted, is often confused with clipfish, where the fish is salted before drying. After 2‚Äì3 weeks in salt the fish has saltmatured, and is transformed from wet salted fish to Clipfish through a drying process. The salted fish was earlier dried on rocks (clips) on the foreshore. The production method of Clipfish (or Bacalhau in Portuguese) was developed by the Portuguese who first mined salt near the brackish water of Aveiro, and brought it to Newfoundland where cod was available in massive quantities. (q.v.). Salting was not economically feasible until the 17th century, when cheap salt from southern Europe became available to the maritime nations of northern Europe. Stockfish is cured in a process called fermentation where cold adapted bacteria matures the fish, similar to the maturing process of cheese. Clipfish is processed in a chemically curing process called saltmaturing, similar to the maturing processes of other saltmatured products like the Parma ham. =Other= Indonesian dish Acehnese dried fish Keumamah: A Traditional Fish Processing and Prospect for Development * Bacalhau is the Portuguese word for codfish and in a culinary context refers to dried and salted codfish. Fresh (unsalted) cod is referred to as bacalhau fresco (fresh cod). Bacalhau dishes are common in Portugal and Galicia, in the northwest of Spain, and to a lesser extent in former Portuguese colonies like Angola, Macau, and Brazil. There are said to be over 1000 recipes in Portugal alone and it can be considered the iconic ingredient of Portuguese cuisine (but curiously the only fish that is not consumed fresh in this fish-loving nation). It is often cooked on social occasions and is the Portuguese traditional Christmas dinner in some parts of Portugal. * Mackerel (Sukho Bangdo in Konkani language) is dried in Goa since ancient times. If preserved well they can stay for many years. Prawn and shark are also dried in Goa. * Baccal√† (in Venetian Language: bacal√†) is sun-dried stockfish, rather than salt cod. In other parts of Italy dishes made with salt cod are given the same name. Baccal√† dishes made with stockfish are soaked for several days to soften the fish. Salt cod, which is already soft, is also soaked to remove excess salt. * Balyk is the Russian term for the salted and dried soft parts of fish of large valuable species, such as sturgeon or salmon. Over time, the term has come to apply also to smoked fish of these species. * Boknafisk is a variant of stockfish and is unsalted fish partially dried by sun and wind on drying flakes or on a wall. The most common fish used for boknafisk is cod, but other types of fish can also be used. If herring is used, the dish is called boknasild. * Daing (also known as Bulad or Tuy√¥) refers to sun-dried fish in the Philippines. Almost any kind of fish is used, but the most popular variant uses rabbitfish (locally known as danggit). Cuttlefish and squid may also dried this way The amount of drying can vary. In the labtingaw variant, the drying period only lasts a few hours, allowing the fish to retain some moisture and texture. In the lamayo variant, the fish isn't dried at all, but simply marinated in vinegar, garlic and spices. * Dried squid * Fesikh is a traditional Egyptian fish dish consisting of fermented salted and dried gray mullet, of the mugil family, a saltwater fish that lives in both the Mediterranean and the Red Seas. Baheyeldin Dynasty site The traditional process of preparing it is to dry the fish in the sun before preserving it in salt. * Gwamegi is a Korean half-dried Pacific herring or Pacific saury made during winter. It is mostly eaten in the region of North Gyeongsang Province such as Pohang, Uljin, and Yeongdeok where a large amount of the fish are harvested. Guryongpo Harbor in Pohang is the most famous. Gwamegi at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture The True Flavor of Pohang, Gwamegi Gwamegi , Hankyung News, 2009-01-23. Fresh herring or saury is frozen at -10 degrees Celsius and is placed outdoors in December to repeat freezing at night and defreezing in the day. The process continues until the water content of the fish drops to approximately 40%. Gwamegi at Doosan Encyclopedia * H√°karl is an Icelandic food consisting of a sleeper shark that has been fermented and dried for four or five months. * Har√∞fiskur is the Icelandic term for dried fish (stockfish), a delicacy in Iceland (eaten as is or usually with butter). A type of wind-dried fish, called skrei√∞, also dried but including the head, no longer eaten domestically in modern times is sold mostly to Nigeria where it's used e.g. in soup. * Ikan asin is a dried and salted fish. It is an Indonesian dish and it is often served accompanied with steamed rice and sambal chili paste. * Jwipo is a kind of Korean fish jerky made by pressing, drying and seasoning filefish. * Katsuobushi is the Japanese name for dried, fermented, and smoked skipjack tuna, sometimes referred to as bonito). * A kipper is a whole herring, a small, oily fish, that has been split from tail to head, gutted, salted or pickled, and cold smoked. * Kusaya is a Japanese style salted, dried and fermented fish. It has a pungent smell, similar to the fermented Swedish herring called surstr√∂mming. * Maldive fish is cured tuna traditionally produced in the Maldives. It is a staple of the Maldivian cuisine, as well as Sri Lankan cuisine. * Mojama (Spain) consists of filleted salt-cured tuna. The word mojama comes from the Arabic musama (dry), but its origins are Phoenician, specifically from Gdr (Gadir, C√°diz today), the first Phoenician settlement in the Western Mediterranean Sea. The Phoenicians had learned to dry tuna in sea salt so they could trade it. Mojama is made by curing tuna in salt for two days. The salt is then removed, the tuna is washed and then laid out to dry in the sun and the breeze (according to the traditional method) for fifteen to twenty days. * Niboshi is the Japanese name for dried infant sardines that are both eaten as a snack and used to make soup stock. They are also eaten in Korea. * Obambo is dried tilapia, prepared by cutting the fish open and drying it in the sun for several days. It is popular among the Luo and Luhya tribes, who live along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya. Traditionally, fishing was strictly forbidden during the rainy seasons, and people relied on obambo caught earlier and preserved. * Karuvadu is dried fish, prepared by sun drying it for several days. This procedure is traditionally seen in coast of Tamil Nadu in India. Various species of fish are sundried and storage timeline of these dried fishes varies from several months to years based on species. * Tatami Iwashi is a Japanese processed food product made from baby sardines laid out and dried while entwined in a single layer to form a large mat-like sheet. Typically, this is done by drying them in the sun on a bamboo frame, a process that is evocative of the manufacture of traditional Japanese paper. Water activity Dried fish and octopus in Aceh, Indonesia The water activity, aw, in a fish is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure in the flesh of the fish to the vapour pressure of pure water at the same temperature and pressure. It ranges between 0 and 1, and is a parameter that measures how available the water is in the flesh of the fish. Available water is necessary for the microbial and enzymatic reactions involved in spoilage. There are a number of techniques that have been or are used to tie up the available water or remove it by reducing the aw. Traditionally, techniques such as drying, salting and smoking have been used, and have been used for thousands of years. These techniques can be very simple, for example, by using solar drying. In more recent times, freeze-drying, water binding humectants, and fully automated equipment with temperature and humidity control have been added. Often a combination of these techniques is used.FAO: Preservation techniques Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 14 March 2011. History Salt cod has been produced for at least 500 years, since the time of the European discoveries of the New World. Before refrigeration, there was a need to preserve the codfish; drying and salting are ancient techniques to preserve nutrients and the process makes the codfish tastier. The Portuguese tried to use this method of drying and salting on several varieties of fish from their waters, but the ideal fish came from much further north. With the \\"discovery\\" of Newfoundland in 1497, long after the Basque whalers arrived in Channel-Port aux Basques, they started fishing its cod-rich Grand Banks. Thus, ' became a staple of the Portuguese cuisine, nicknamed ' (faithful friend). From the 18th century, the town of Kristiansund in Norway became an important place of purchasing bacalhau or klippfisk (literally \\"cliff fish\\", since the fish was dried on stone cliffs by the sea to begin with.) Since the method was introduced by the Dutchman Jappe Ippes around 1690, the town had produced klippfisk and when the Spanish merchants arrived, it became a big industry. The bacalhau or bacalao dish is sometimes said to originate from Kristiansund, where it was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese fish buyers and became very popular. Bacalao was common food in northwest Norway to this day, as it was cheap to make. In more recent years, it has become less of an everyday staple and mostly eaten on special occasions. This dish was also popular in Portugal and other Roman Catholic countries, because of the many days (Fridays, Lent, and other festivals) on which the Church forbade the eating of meat. ' dishes were eaten instead.

Early life Waghalter was born into a poor but musically-accomplished Jewish family in Warsaw. His eldest brother, Henryk Waghalter (1869-1961), became a renowned cellist at the Warsaw Conservatory.Cello Tradition in Warsaw Wladyslaw (1885-1940), the youngest Waghalter brother, became a noted violinist.Kleines biographisches Lexicon der Violinisten, by Friedrich Frick,(2009) p. 553. Waghalter made his way to Berlin at 17. There, he first studied with Philipp Scharwenka and then came to the attention of Joseph Joachim, the great violinist and close friend of Johannes Brahms. With the support of Joachim, Waghalter was admitted into the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, where he studied composition and conducting under the direction of Friedrich Gernsheim. Career Waghalter's early chamber music revealed an intense melodic imagination that was to remain a distinctive characteristic of his compositional work. An early String Quartet in D Major, Opus 3, was highly praised by Joachim. Waghalter's Sonata for Violin and Pianoforte in F Minor, Opus 5, received the prestigious Mendelssohn-Preis in 1902, when the composer was only 21.Waghalter Aus dem Ghetto in die Freiheit (Marienbad, 1936) In 1907, Waghalter secured a post as conductor at the Komische Oper in Berlin, assisting Arthur Nikisch, where his reputation grew rapidly. That was followed by a brief tenure at the Grillo- Theater, the Stadttheater in Essen (1911‚Äì12). Waghalter's appointment as principal conductor at the new Deutsche Opernhaus in Berlin established his position as a major figure in German music. It was inaugurated, under Waghalter's direction, on 7 November 1912 with a performance of Fidelio. He championed the music of Giacomo Puccini, whose operas had previously failed to win public acceptance in Germany. The first performance of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West in Germany was conducted by Waghalter in March 1913 at the Deutsche Opernhaus. Its triumphant reception secured for Puccini's operas a permanent place in the repertoires of Germany's opera houses. Waghalter also conducted the German debut performances of Tosca and La Boh√®me and also of Ralph Vaughan Williams' second symphony in 1923.Musical Times, March 1, 1923. Three of Waghalter's own operas received their premier at the Deutsche Opernhaus: Mandragola, based on a Renaissance comedy by Machiavelli, in January 1914, which was booked for a European tour but was abandoned with the outbreak of the First World War;Signale, January, 1914. Jugend, based on the tragic realistic work by the German dramatist Max Halbe, in February 1917; and Sataniel, inspired by a Polish fantasy tale, in May 1923. The fervent melodicism of these works marked Waghalter as among the most lyrical of German operatic composers in the pre-1933 era. Waghalter left the Deutsche Opernhaus in 1923. Traveling to the United States, he succeeded Joseph Stransky as musical director of the New York State Symphony, which he held during the 1925 season.\\"Stransky Quits State Orchestra,\\" New York Times, December 31, 1924. Deeply attached to the cultural life of Berlin, Waghalter turned down an offer to remain at the State Symphony and returned to Germany. He assumed the position of Generalmusikmeister of UFA, the country's largest film production company in Germany. For UFA, Waghalter composed the original musical score for one of the most extraordinary German films of the Weimar era, Hanns Walter Kornblum's Wunder der Sch√∂pfung. The pathbreaking film, which premiered in Berlin in September 1925, attempted to present in a popular cinematic form the greatest discoveries of modern astronomy. His music was described by one critic as a \\"sensation.\\"Lichtb√ºhne, 18 Jarhrgang, Nummer 179, 15.9.1925. See also Waghalter composed several operettas, and he was active as a guest conductor. Waghalter was appointed musical director at the National Opera in Riga, Latvia, for the 1931-32 season. Shortly after his return to Berlin, the Nazis came to power. In 1934, he went into exile, moving first to Czechoslovakia and then to Austria, where he composed his last opera, Ahasaverus und Esther. Several weeks before the Anschluss, when Austria was annexed by Germany, he and his wife fled to the United States. Later life Shortly after arriving in New York City, Waghalter initiated a campaign to establish a classical orchestra of African-American musicians. He secured the interest and support of militant New York trade unions, the noted African- American musician Alfred Jack Thomas, and such prominent representatives of the Harlem Renaissance as James Weldon Johnson.\\"Alfred Jack Thomas: Performer, Composer, Educator,\\" by James Nathan Jones, Franklin F. Johnson, and Robert B. Cochran, in The Black Perspective in Music, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Spring, 1983), p. 67. The essay provides information on Waghalter's decisive role in the establishment of a \\"Sepia\\" Symphony orchestra in New York, and his longstanding fight, dating back to the early 1920s, for the recognition of African-American artists. According to Jones et al., Waghalter's \\"statement in Berlin's Tagblatt that the next musical genius would be a person of color caused an outcry in Germany, but his beliefs were intensified after hearing Roland Hayes in Berlin and Marian Anderson in Vienna.\\" However, the essay states incorrectly that Waghalter died in 1938, shortly after the founding of the orchestra. The orchestra performed publicly under Waghalter's direction in 1938. However, the project could not obtain sufficient funding to be sustained. Though Waghalter appeared occasionally as a guest conductor, his opportunities were extremely limited, and he died in relative obscurity in New York in 1949, at 68.\\"I. Waghalter, 68, Long a Conductor,\\" New York Times, April 8, 1949. This obituary provided an outline of the key events in Waghalter's career. Legacy Even though he was one of many Central European musicians whose lives and careers were shattered by the Nazi catastrophe, his subsequent and protracted obscurity, when contrasted to the scale of his pre-1933 prominence, is striking. His fate may be explained, to a large extent, by the radical shift in musical aesthetics in the aftermath of World War II. Waghalter did not experiment with atonality and serialism, and his commitment to melodicism placed him well outside the precincts of what was then considered the musical avant-garde. However, more recent critical questioning of atonalism and a corresponding revival of interest in composers who worked in a melodic idiom have encouraged a reconsideration of Waghalter. The Deutsche Oper, the successor of the Deutsche Opernhaus, staged a concert performance of Waghalter's Jugend in 1989, and a new recording of his early chamber music was released in March 2006 In March 2011 Waghalter's Rhapsody for Violin and Orchestra and Concerto for Violin and Orchestra were recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London, with conductor Alexander Walker and soloist Irmina Trynkos. The CD was released, under the Naxos label, in October 2012.http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.572809 In the liner notes accompanying the CD, Michael Haas - director of Research at the Jewish Music institute's ‚ÄòInternational Centre of Suppressed Music‚Äô at Royal Holloway, University of London, and a leading expert on Central European composers whose careers were effectively destroyed by the Nazi accession to power, describes Waghalter as \\"one of the most unjustly forgotten musicians of pre-1933 Europe,\\" whose remarkable work compels the listener to wonder \\"how was it possible that this music went missing for a century?\\" The December 2012 issue of Pizzicato Magazine awarded the Naxos release a coveted Supersonic designation. In his review, editor-in-chief Remy Franck wrote: \\"What a discovery: The Violin Concerto of composer Ignatz Waghalter was, with its romantic characteristics, somewhat 'out of fashion' at the time of its composition in 1911 ‚Äì but the wealth of ideas in this composition is fascinating. And that goes as well for the other works in this CD.\\"http://www.naxos.com/SharedFiles/Reviews/8.572809_Pizzicato_122012_gr.pdf The emotional authenticity and force of his lyricism, combined with the high technical quality of his compositions, may be best appreciated as a distinctive expression of a lost musical culture whose destruction was among the tragic consequences of the barbarism unleashed by fascism in Europe.\\"Waghalter, Ignatz\\" Grove Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.

It was established in 1923 as during the Japanese period. The soccer stadium was opened in 1989, it was reconstructed from the former site of Yuanshan Baseball Ground () under the guidance of then Chinese Taipei Football Association President Chiang Wei-kuo. Although it was built as a soccer-specific stadium, it was mostly used for live concerts or other activities due to lack of professional football league in Taiwan. The stadium was able to hold 20,000 people for football games and 40,000 for concerts. It was managed by the Hope Foundation led by former athlete Chi Cheng. Location Zhongshan Soccer Stadium was located across of Yumen Street () and Minzu West Road (). Nearby was the Yuanshan Station of Taipei Metro (Tamsui Line, Red Line) Events The stadium has hosted a number of concerts by internationally renowned music stars. The King of Pop Michael Jackson performed two sold out concerts at the stadium on October 18 and 22 1996, during his History World Tour (attendance : 98.000). Bon Jovi performed at the stadium on April 28, 1995 during These Days Tour. Australian pop star Kylie Minogue performed there on December 4, 2008 as part of her KylieX2008 world tour. Closure In March 2007, Taipei City Government announced that Yuanshan will be replacing Guandu Plain as the main venue of the 2010 International Garden and Horticulture Exhibition to be hosted in Taipei. In their plan, Chungshan Soccer Stadium, being one of the major parts of the Yuanshan area, would serve as the primary venue of the exhibition featuring indoor activities. As a result, the stadium was closed on July 1, 2008. However, the Chinese Taipei Football Association made a statement in its official site on June 29, 2007 opposing the proposal. They stated that Chungshan Soccer Stadium was the only FIFA-approved stadium in Taiwan at present. If it is closed, Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) would lose its home ground and would not be allowed to hold international football competitions. Though there were several ongoing construction projects for new stadiums, including the World Games Stadium for World Games 2009 in Kaohsiung and the new Taipei Municipal Stadium for 2009 Summer Deaflympics in Taipei. But both cannot be complete prior to the end of 2008. On September 30, 2007, Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-pin committed to delay the stadium's closing schedule to the end of 2008 for hosting 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification and 2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. The stadium was closed on November 28, 2008. Transportation The stadium was accessible within walking distance South East from Yuanshan Station of the Taipei Metro.

Typical approaches to calculate chemical similarities use chemical fingerprints, but this loses the underlying information about the molecule topology. Mining the molecular graphs directly avoids this problem. So does the inverse QSAR problem which is preferable for vectorial mappings.

The story is based on the novel The Adventures of Pinocchio (1881-1883) by Italian author Carlo Collodi. Plot Although the plot was slightly changed from that of the original story, the basis remained similar. Set in a small village in the Tuscany district in Italy, the story starts with a poor old carpenter named Geppetto, who lives alone. One day, Geppetto finds a mysterious wooden log, from which, he carves a marionette which comes to life and becomes the child he never had. Geppetto decides to call him \\"Pinocchio\\". Later on, Geppetto convinces Pinocchio to start going to the local school. Pinocchio sets out towards the school, but on his way, he meets the Fox (who is pretending to be limping) and the Cat (who is pretending to be blind) who manage to persuade him to join them in a walk to the theater to watch a puppet show. Pinocchio decides to join the puppet theater in order to save up money, which he would be able to give to the poor Geppetto. Pinocchio performs in the theater in different cities and, after he manages to save enough gold coins, he decides to escape from the theater and return home with the gold coins he earned. On the way home, Pinocchio meets the fox and the cat again, who have decided to trick Pinocchio. They tell him that if he plants the coins in the fields of wonder, they would rapidly grow into a large tree which would produce thousands of new golden coins. Pinocchio doesn't understand that they are trying to trick him, even though Pinocchio's companion, Bella the duckling, tries to warn him. Pinocchio, who believes their lies, follows the fox and the cat towards the fields of wonder. They stop at an inn, where the cat and fox eat a full meal on Pinocchio‚Äôs expense. During the night, the inn keeper wakens Pinocchio, notifying him that the fox and cat had to leave urgently, but they would meet Pinocchio at the fields of wonder. Pinocchio sets out immediately towards the fields of wonder. When he passes through the forest, the fox and cat, who are dressed up as robbers, surprise attack him and try to rob Pinocchio. Pinocchio manages to run away into the forest. While running into the forest, Pinocchio meets the fairy with turquoise hair. Later on, the cat and the fox (who are still in disguise) manage to seize Pinocchio, and they hang him on a tree in order to retrieve the golden coins. Pinocchio holds on to the golden coins and, eventually, the fox and the cat decide to leave him hanging on the tree. The fairy with turquoise hair appears later on and rescues Pinocchio. After Pinocchio continues his journey towards his home, along the way, he meets the Fox and the cat yet again (although he doesn't know that they were the robbers who tried to steal his golden coins). They remind Pinocchio about the fields of wonder, and he agrees to follow them once again in order to plant the golden coins. When they reach the fields of wonder, Pinocchio plants the golden coins in the soil, and while he goes to get water, the fox and the cat dig up the golden coins and quickly disappear. After Pinocchio discovers that he was a victim of fraud, he goes back to Geppetto. Later on, Pinocchio, The fox and the cat, and several children join a wanderer, who leads them towards the land of toys, which consists of amusement facilities and as much candy as they desire. The next morning Pinocchio and his friends wake up and discover that they have transformed into donkeys during the night- the real reason for which they were initially brought to the land of toys by the wanderer. The donkeys are later on taken to the market and sold by the wanderer to a circus. Only after Pinocchio understands that the curse would be removed only after he would change his ways and would start doing good deeds, does he decide to change his ways. After Pinocchio manages to save the circus from burning in a big fire, he transforms back to his former-self. Later on, Geppetto is tricked by the fox and the cat and, therefore, he sets out to search for Pinocchio in the ocean. After Pinocchio discovers that, he decides to search for Geppetto. While searching for Geppetto out in the ocean, Pinocchio gets swallowed by a whale. In the whale's stomach, he meets Geppetto (who had also been swallowed by the whale). Pinocchio manages to find the courage and wisdom needed to get himself and Geppetto out of the whale‚Äôs stomach safely. Eventually, as a token to Pinocchio's good deeds, the fairy with turquoise hair decides to transform Pinocchio into a real boy. Comparison with the original story * The roles of the fox and the blind cat were expanded and transformed into \\"the bad but entertaining\\" figures. In most of the series episodes, their mischief and often criminal behavior used Pinocchio's Naivety and kindness, and practically generated most of the events in the series. * The role of the Talking Cricket, which represents Pinocchio's conscience, was replaced with a little duckling and a woodpecker. * The role of the Fairy with Turquoise Hair was also expanded and she gets to rescue Pinocchio from harm several times while she transforms herself into different forms including a giant pigeon.

It is thought to be most closely related to N. fusca. Botanical history The first known collection of N. vogelii was made in 1961 on Mount Api in Gunung Mulu National Park by forest botanist J. A. R. Anderson. The material, labelled as N. fusca, was deposited at the Sarawak Forestry Department herbarium.Phillipps, A., A. Lamb & C.C. Lee 2008. Pitcher Plants of Borneo. Second Edition. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. In 1969, botanist Shigeo Kurata examined this specimen and noted that it did not fall within the known variation exhibited by N. fusca. Nepenthes vogelii was formally described in 2002 by Andre Schuiteman and Eduard Ferdinand de Vogel. The description was published in the botanical journal BlumeaSchuiteman, A. & E.F. de Vogel 2002. Nepenthes vogelii (Nepenthaceae): a new species from Sarawak. Blumea 47(3): 537‚Äì540. and is based on a single cultivated specimen, A.Vogel, A.Schuiteman & T.Roelfsema 981037 (SAR).Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes . Carnivorous Plant Database. This specimen was collected as a seedling in the Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak in 1997 and subsequently raised to maturity by Art Vogel, botanist and former conservatory manager of the Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Nepenthes vogelii is named in his honour. Some time prior to its description, N. vogelii entered cultivation through Ch'ien Lee's Malesiana Tropicals plant nursery under the name \\"Nepenthes spec. 4\\".Fleischmann, A. 2003. Drosera peruensis spec. nov. from Peru . Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, January 12, 2003. Few specimens of this species are deposited in herbaria, likely due to its epiphytic growth habit, which makes it hard to find without the aid of binoculars. Description Rosette and lower pitchers are cylindrical throughout and have a small horizontal mouth. Unusually, they lack ventral wings. The lid is broadly triangular and lacks appendages. Pitchers are yellowish with dark speckles and a striped peristome. Upper pitchers are generally infundibular, although their shape may vary from narrowly funnel- shaped to distinctly bulbous in the upper portion. This bulbous portion corresponds to the upper waxy zone of the inner surface. Upper pitchers of N. vogelii in the Kelabit Highlands Ecology Despite only being recorded from several scattered localities, N. vogelii appears to be more widespread in Borneo than previously thought.Lee, C.C. 2004. New records and a new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from Sarawak. Sandakania 15: 93‚Äì101. [ Initially believed to be endemic to northern Sarawak,Clarke, C.M. & Lee, C.C. 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. it is now known from southern Sabah and West Kalimantan. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1000 to 1500 m above sea level. Nepenthes vogelii typically occurs as an epiphyte in submontane or tall lower montane forest. The type specimen was found growing terrestrially among moss in wet kerangas forest. The plant was sympatric with N. stenophylla and N. veitchii. Despite this, no natural hybrids involving N. vogelii have been recorded.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. On Mount Mulu, N. vogelii occurs in a narrow altitudinal band (1200 to 1500 m) where its distribution does not overlap with those of the likewise epiphytic N. fusca and N. hurrelliana, which grow below 1200 m and above 1500 m, respectively. Related species N. vogelii produces much smaller and more colourful pitchers than the closely related N. fusca Nepenthes vogelii belongs to the loosely defined \\"N. maxima complex\\", which also includes, among other species, N. boschiana, N. chaniana, N. epiphytica, N. eymae, N. faizaliana, N. fusca, N. klossii, N. maxima, N. platychila, and N. stenophylla.Robinson, A.S., J. Nerz & A. Wistuba 2011. Nepenthes epiphytica, a new pitcher plant from East Kalimantan. In: McPherson, S.R. New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 36‚Äì51. Nepenthes vogelii is thought to be most closely related to N. fusca. It differs from that species in having much smaller pitchers and lacking appendages on the underside of the lid. In addition, the lid of N. vogelii is broadly triangular as opposed to the narrowly triangular lid of N. fusca. The colour of the pitchers‚Äîlight cream with dark speckles‚Äîis also distinctive. These features also distinguish it from N. burbidgeae and N. stenophylla. Nepenthes vogelii shows close affinities to N. platychila. However, unlike the lower pitchers of N. vogelii, those of N. platychila bear wings and have a relatively wide peristome.Lee, C.C. 2002. Nepenthes platychila (Nepenthaceae), a new species of pitcher plant from Sarawak, Borneo. The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore 54: 257-261. Notes :a.Some authors treat N. fallax in synonymy with N. stenophylla,Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. while others consider them to be two distinct species, with plants commonly referred to as N. stenophylla actually representing N. fallax.

Alongside the Honda CB750, and later the Kawasaki triples, it brought a new level of sophistication to street motorcycles, marking the beginning of the superbike era. The Honda CB750 overshadowed the Trident to be remembered as the 'first superbike', in spite of the Triumph Trident actually debuting before the Honda by a few weeks. It had a air-cooled OHV unit construction straight-three engine, with four gears and a conventional chassis and suspension. The engine had less vibration than the existing 360¬∞ twins. The Rocket 3/Trident was part of Triumph's plan to extend the model range beyond their 650 cc parallel twins. It was the last major motorcycle developed by Triumph at Meriden, West Midlands, created to meet the demands of the US market. Although BSA experienced serious financial difficulties, 27,480 Rocket 3/Tridents were produced during its seven-year history.Bacon, 1995. p.114 Development The Triumph Trident was designed by Bert Hopwood and Doug Hele. The Trident's three-cylinder design was developed from Triumph's 1959 5TA unit-construction 500 cc parallel-twin (which had origins in Edward Turner's 1937 Triumph Speed Twin). The Trident has an extra cylinder and, following Triumph practice, its OHV pushrod engine has separate camshafts for the inlet and exhaust valves.Bacon, 1995. p.108.Prototype Triumph Trident P1, which was on display at the London Motorcycle Museum Although the prototype was ready by 1965, the factory delayed for years for a cosmetic redesign which meant that its eventually introduction was overshadowed by the apparently more modern Honda CB750, introduced in 1969. Unlike the CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had horizontally split crankcases, the Trident engine was essentially a vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360¬∞ crankshaft, this new triple had crankpins offset 120¬∞ and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet multiplate clutch, this triple had a dry single-plate clutch in a housing between the primary chaincase and the gearbox. Mounted on the end of the gearbox mainshaft (where the clutch would be expected) was a large transmission shock-absorber. Test engineers developed the chassis' handling characteristics by affixing lead weights on a standard 650 Bonneville. The first prototype (P1) was running by 1965, and it seemed that Triumph might have a machine in production by 1967. However, the decision to produce a BSA version with sloping cylinders and employ Ogle Design to give the early Tridents/Rocket 3s their \\"square tank\\" added bulk and of weight, delaying production by 18 months. In 1966 a P2 prototype was produced with a more production-based Trident engine, different bore and stroke dimensions and improved cooling. Hele got from a Trident engine, leading to speculation that further development might have led to a British superbike. All the three- cylinder engines (and the Rocket 3 motorcycles) were produced at BSA's Small Heath site, but final assembly of the Triumph Trident model was carried out at Meriden in Coventry. The major differences were the engine and frame: the BSA had an A65-style double-loop cradle frame (with engine mounted at a slant), while the Triumph had a Bonneville-style single downtube frame with vertical cylinders. Other differences were cosmetic. Though the badges on the actual bike said Rocket 3, the BSA-branded bike's name was styled in print as Rocket III in BSA's own advertising, but in third party media it was printed as Rocket 3, or sometimes Rocket Three. Triumphs sold better in the US, despite BSA's Daytona racing successes during the early 1970s. Sales did not meet expectations; for the 1971 model year a fifth gear was added, creating the BSA A75RV and Triumph T150V. BSA were having financial difficulties, and only some 205 five-speed Rocket 3s were built before production of the BSA variant ceased. Production of the five-speed Triumph T150V (with a front disc brake replacing the original drum) continued until 1974. For the 1975 model year, the Trident was updated to the T160 which was given electric starting, front and rear disc brakes, and a left-foot gear change. Like the Rocket 3, the T160 also featured a forward-slanted cylinder block, which gave better weight distribution and more space behind the engine for ancillaries. Reception BSA Rocket 3, restyled for 1971 The prototype triples had the \\"Triumph look\\", with a teardrop-shaped tank. BSA/Triumph then commissioned Ogle Design for a redesign, leading to an 18-month delay. The new motorcycle had a squarer fuel tank and a less-traditional look, with sloped cylinders and \\"ray-gun\\" silencers. The Rocket 3/Trident was introduced in summer of 1968 to critical acclaim, but was eclipsed four weeks later by the Honda CB750. Compared to the British triple, the CB750 had a five-speed gearbox, overhead camshaft, oil- tight engine, electric start and a disc brake. The Honda outsold the Triumph in the US market; in 1970, to revive sales Triumph restyled export versions with the \\"classic\\" look. In 1968 the new triples disappointed the American BSA-Triumph management, who knew that Honda had a motorcycle under development. They felt the price of $1,800 (¬£895) was too high, and technical details (like vertically-split crankcases and a pushrod OHV valve train were too conventional.Bacon, 1995. p.115 However, they acknowledged that the bike was fast and the US sales team launched it by setting speed records at Daytona (which were only broken in 1971 by the Kawasaki Z1). Cycle World recorded a top speed of in their 1968 road test, along with acceleration times of of 5.6 seconds and in 13.71 seconds at . The magazine's braking test was in , and the fuel consumption was . Triumph X-75 Hurricane Triumph X-75 Hurricane US BSA vice-president Don Brown felt that the BSA/Triumph triples needed a different look to succeed in the US. He commissioned designer Craig Vetter to redesign the BSA A75 (making it sleeker and better balanced) and disclosed the Vetter project to Peter Thornton (president of BSA/Triumph North America). In October 1969, Vetter displayed his customised A75. The bike was then sent to the UK, where it received a lukewarm reception from chief designer Bert Hopwood (but a favourable public reaction); the Vetter BSA Rocket3 became the Triumph X-75 Hurricane. Model T160 1975 Trident T160 with electric starting, front and rear disc brakes and left-foot gear change In November 1974, the T150V was succeeded by the modified T160. Some changes were due to market response to the earlier Tridents; others complied with American safety legislation. With forward-sloping cylinders (like the BSA Rocket3), electric start and a left-hand gearshift, NVT made a final effort to save large-scale production and reduce the gap between the Trident and the Honda CB750. The T160 was manufactured for a little over a year, with production ending in early 1976 (when NVT collapsed).Bacon, 1995. p.115-116. Around 7,000 T160 models were built for the 1975 model year; due to slow sales some were still being sold as late as the end of 1977. Changes on the T160: * Forward-leaning cylinder layout derived from BSA Rocket 3 (allowing a larger air box) * Improved centre of gravity * Electric start * Five-speed gearbox (first used on the T150V) * Front and rear disc brakes * Left-hand gear shift (US safety requirement) * Annular silencers (to meet lower US noise-level requirement) * Redesigned instrument panel and handlebar switchgear * Return to traditional Triumph styling Cardinal In December 1975 final shipments of 288 and 224 motorcycles were destined for Australia and the US, respectively, but NVT diverted them to fill an order from the Saudi Arabian police force. Most UK police had switched to BMW motorcycles, but a few (such as the Yorkshire Constabulary) still used the Trident. About 450 bikes were sent to Saudi Arabia; the last 130 were still in the UK when the Saudis cancelled the remainder of the order, and NVT Motorcycles sold them as the Triumph Cardinal. At the time, the list price of a stock T160 was ¬£1,215;Bacon, 1995. p.192. although the \\"police accessories\\" were worth only ¬£150, NVT listed the Cardinal for ¬£1,522.80. In 1982, European dealers imported about 180 low- mileage Tridents from Saudi Arabia; the poorly maintained, sand-encrusted machines were restored and sold as standard T160s. Quadrant The Triumph Quadrant was designed and built by Doug Hele in 1973.Motorcycle Classics article on George Poole's home-made Triumph Quadrent It was a 1,000 cc four- cylinder motorcycle made from Trident parts (although the camshaft was sourced outside the factory). The fourth cylinder resulted from grafting an extra mid- crankcase unit; since the primary chaincase and final drive sprocket could not be moved, the fourth cylinder protruded from the right side of the bike. Why Hele developed this machine is unknown, since the lopsided design could never compete with Japanese motorcycles such as the Honda CB750 or the Kawasaki Z1. An inside view is that Hele's efforts were a waste of resources that, with NVT's precarious finances, should have been directed to marketing the 900 cc triple Thunderbird III.\\"BSA ‚Äì Born 1861, Died 1973\\" Bill Murray July 1984 Model T180 Thunderbird III In 1975 an NVT prototype 870 cc triple, the T180 Triumph Thunderbird III, was developed but it did not reach production. NVT passed on the prototype to the Meriden co-operative, which also did not proceed to production (despite experimenting with the engine in an oil-bearing frame).Save The Triumph Bonneville ! The Inside Story of the Meriden Workers' Co-op by John Rosamond (Veloce 2009) A prototype \\"Norton 900 Commando\\" was also built with the T180 engine in a Norton Commando frame. Racing Rob North framed BSA Rocket 3 F750 class at the Sammy Miller Museum Doug Hele continued to develop the engine, and in 1971 joined frame expert Rob North to produce the Formula 750 racing machines. At the 1971 Daytona 200 the British three-cylinder bikes took the top three places; Dick Mann won on a BSA Rocket 3, followed by Gene Romero on a Triumph Trident and Don Emde third on another BSA Rocket 3. John Cooper rode a BSA Rocket 3 to an upset victory over 500 cc world champion Giacomo Agostini in the 1971 Race of the Year at Mallory Park. Cooper finished three-fifths of a second ahead of Agostini's MV Agusta. The best-known bike was a production-class Trident prepared by a team led by Les Williams called Slippery Sam, a roadster prepared for production-class road racing to controlled specifications using selected adaptations only, available from the factory as part-numbered inventory. Williams' team won consecutive 750 cc production races at the Isle of Man TT for the five years between 1971 and 1975, and in the new F750 event for race-specification machines, Triumph and BSA machines with Rob North frames placed first and second.IoM TT official site, 1971 overview Retrieved 7 March 2015 Bert Hopwood recommended a production version of the racing triple, producing at 8,250 rpm, but his suggestion was not adopted. Further racing development was done in Duarte, California under racing manager Dan Macias. Tom Mellor set four world speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats in September 2008 with a 1969 Triumph Trident T150. End of production Financial and management problems at BSA and the disintegration of the British motorcycle industry during the early 1970s led to a government-sponsored merger, \\"NVT\\", in July 1973 with Norton. Although Norton was very much smaller than BSA-Triumph,In its prime, BSA had been the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world. MCN and it had only one product, the ageing pre-unit Commando, nevertheless control of NVT was given to Dennis Poore, the boss of Norton. Poore was much more \\"in tune\\" with motorbikes than were the crusty BSA management, but Poore's business plan proved to be an asset-strip of BSA for Manganese-Bronze, rather than a consolidation of the remnants of the UK motorcycle industry. NVT's restructuring plans triggered a strike at Triumph's Meriden factory in September 1974. Production of the Trident was eventually transferred to BSA's Small Heath factory in March 1974, but the lengthy labour dispute disrupted production, and very few Small Heath Tridents came into being.\\"Meriden-a few ad hoc observations\\" Bill Murray 24 March 1983Insider monograph: \\"BSA ‚Äì Born 1861, Died 1973\\" Bill Murray July 1984 Later use of Trident and Rocket names After Triumph at Meriden collapsed, a new firm, Triumph Motorcycles Ltd, was established at Hinckley. The new firm manufactured from 1990 a new range of motorcycles with a modular engine design. Some of these bikes were called \\"Triumph Tridents\\"; and much later a \\"Triumph Rocket III\\" was produced.

The New Rule of the Wireless\\" was first published in Forbes ASAP, March 29th, 1993. Negroponte‚Äôs WIRED articles 1 and 2Roddy, David // Wireless Review; 01/01/98, Vol. 15 Issue 1, p84 He suggested that due to the accidents of engineering history we had ended up with static devices ‚Äì such as televisions ‚Äì receiving their content via signals travelling over the airways, while devices that could have been mobile and personal ‚Äì such as telephones ‚Äì were receiving their content over static cables. It was his idea that a better use of available communication resource would result if the information, (such as phone calls). going through the cables was to go through the air, and that going through the air (such as TV programmes) would be delivered via cables. Negroponte called this process ‚Äútrading places‚Äù. His co-presenter, George Gilder, at an event organized by Northern Telecom, called it the ‚ÄúNegroponte Switch‚Äù, and that name stuck from then on. Nicholas Negroponte had concerns for via signals within static devices. According to this article, it is emphasized that there would be a better use of communication, if the information were to be connected through the air. After, George Gilder , created the name, their became a wanted influence for another device. The switch became a challenge for keeping the media service working. Other claims of the switch were that it was unwiring. As the upcoming of more mobile devices came about, connections were needed for the data network, and bandwidths were required and deliverable in wired or fibre-optic systems growth. It became steadily less sensible to use wireless broadcast as a way of communicating with static installations. At some point the switch takes place, as the limited radio bandwidth is reallocated to data service to mobile equipment, and television and other media move to cable. Cory Doctorow, author and sometime Electronic Frontier Foundation activist, has described the process of the switch as unwiring, a move away from a global internetwork, which in reality passes through many chokepoints where data may be controlled and inspected, toward one which uses available bandwidth frugally by passing communications in a mesh and avoiding chokepoints. He and Charles Stross wrote a collaborative short story Unwirer on the process. The blending of civil liberty and technology may be considered as an effort to reimplement the Internet in the interests of the users, freedom and democracy.  Decline of Negroponte Switch & Benefits  = Reasons to eliminate = Millions of consumers were speculating to abandon the \\"Negroponte Switch\\", because of the fee-based services. Michael Powell (lobbyist) addressed the issue at a press conference, and made points of the T.V. stations, along with DBS attain. There were assumptions that there was no need to protect the switch if most Americans were not receiving free over-the-air television anyway. In order for this process to occur, the federal law had to take action of requiring digital reception towards newer television sets. Nicholas Negroponte had many concerns for the signals, and even stated that the switch was a challenge for media service. More mobile devices were beginning to expand, which required connections for the network and wired or fibre-optic systems for growing. Communication became less accessible for wireless broadcasting. The U.S. market was predicted to not meet any of the threshold penetration rate. Digital T.V. technology became less resisting, compared to the digital OTA television, that the market declined. Having subscription- based television broadcasting would increase ways of eliminating inefficiencies. The goal was to encourage the transition of digital television within the communication markets. = Benefits for Consumers = Consumers were willing to buy new television sets that could receive OTA digital signals. Once the TV band was able to process after this, then valuable wireless services would create mobile telephones, fixed or broadband access, digital television, and satellite communications. Being that there were problems associated with over-the-air transition to television, consumers were refusing to purchase the digital television receivers. Consumers knew if the programs were being blocked that they would pay more money to access it. The use of television sets became higher in U.S. households. Smaller T.V. stations would be able to save about $1 billion, if released. Different television companies had marketing advantages and created a type of relationship with households due to the costs. The technology transition became inexpensive, and the success of subscribed television service overpowered the T.V. Band. Consumers wanted to avoid all the expenditures that were required for newer digital T.V. receivers. This saved them at least $150 billion for that. Consumers could avoid the expenses of not purchasing digital T.V., and get benefits towards new competition and service innovation.  Influences for change to digital television  The development of valuable communication networks would help with more opportunities towards new wireless applications. Support for this came from multi-channel video program distributors, network operators, infrastructure suppliers, hardware and software producers, chip makers, and a range of content and application vendors. T.V. providers wanted to supply the households with services, as well as enhancing the system scale. The reallocation of T.V. band spectrum's would give social gains towards digital television transitions. Broadcasters that have chosen to abandon the OTA transmissions will not be affected because the expansion of television will be influenced by the market. Converging would allow the stations to get value from the use of radio waves. Digital television in the U.S. consists of three different ideas, the first one would be the digital signal. Having an antenna connected to a digital television allows the use of broadcasting radio signals. The use of digital television didn't require as much of any fee based services compared to the Switch. If users switched to digital television, than they could have access to more commercial digital T.V. stations if they had the receiver. Considering that digital television is a way of having interactive television, I think this can relate to the impact of digital media. This source is a part of the global market of technology, which is what we as individuals partake in. Digital televisions could possibly replace the different versions that are already being used in individuals homes. Some individuals may think that there is no value or reason to add extra channels to their televisions, which is another valid argument. The conversion process towards adding this can be complicated to where users may not want to convert their digital televisions for the future to come. For all we know, the future of digital television could become better or worse, or it may just go away. I think in order for the Switch, to be completely \\"tossed\\", that the use of digital television should become a challenge for the use of media service.

However, Heinrich \\"Hein\\" Severloh, a German machine gunner on Omaha Beach that day, wrote in his book WN62: A German Soldier's Memories of the Defence of Omaha Beach, Normandy, June 6, 1944 that Pluskat was not with his unit the day of the invasion and \\"was not truthfully portrayed\\" in the film. Pluskat's men fired their guns on Omaha Beach until they ran out of ammunition. Pluskat was with Generalleutnant Kurt Dittmar when they surrendered to soldiers of the U.S. 30th Infantry Division at Magdeburg on 23 April 1945. For the production of The Longest Day, Pluskat was one of many Axis and Allied military consultants to have actually been on the beach on June 6. In the film, he was portrayed by Hans Christian Blech. References =Bibliography= * Tanne, Philippe. Batterie de Crisbecq ‚Äî The Crisbecq Battery (in French and English).

Native to central Thailand, Schomburgk's deer was described by Edward Blyth in 1863 and named after Sir Robert H. Schomburgk, who was the British consul in Bangkok from 1857 to 1864. It is thought to have gone extinct by 1938, but there is speculation that the deer might still exist. Description The only mounted specimen, in Paris Close-up of the head This deer was a graceful species similar in appearance to the barasingha. The pelt was a dark brown with lighter underparts. The underside of the tail was white. Males possessed basket-like antlers, upon which all the main tines branched. This caused the deer to have up to 33 points on their antlers and the outer edge of the rack to be up to long. Females had no antlers. Habitat Schomburgk's deer inhabited swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs in central Thailand, particularly in the Chao Phraya River valley near Bangkok. This deer avoided dense vegetation. They lived in herds that consisted of a single adult male, a few females, and their young. However, during the flooding that occurred during the rainy season, the herds were forced together upon higher pieces of land which could turn into islands. This made them easy targets for hunters. Extinction Commercial production of rice for export began in the late-19th century in Thailand, leading to the loss of nearly all grassland and swamp areas on which this deer depended. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the century restricted the species further until it became extinct. The wild population of Schomburgk's deer is thought to have died out because of overhunting by 1932, with the last captive individual being killed in 1938. The species was listed as extinct in the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, some scientists consider this species to be still extant. In 1991, antlers were discovered in a Chinese medicine shop in Laos. Laurent Chaz√©e, an agronomist with the United Nations, later identified the antlers from a photograph he took as coming from Schomburgk's deer. Only one mounted specimen is known to exist, which currently resides in Paris's Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle after living in the zoo there until 1868.

It is very closely related to N. maxima, from which it differs in its wine glass-shaped upper pitchers.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The specific epithet eymae honours Pierre Joseph Eyma, a Dutch botanist who worked extensively in the Dutch East Indies and who originally discovered the species.van Steenis-Kruseman, M.J., et al. 2006. Cyclopaedia of Malesian Collectors: Pierre Joseph Eyma. Nationaal Herbarium Nederland. Botanical history Nepenthes eymae was discovered in central Sulawesi by Dutch botanist Pierre Joseph Eyma in 1938.D'Amato, P. 1993. Nepenthes eymai. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 22(1‚Äì2): 21. Eyma's original material of this species includes the herbarium specimen Eyma 3968, which bears a male inflorescence. Nepenthes eymae was formally described by Shigeo Kurata in a 1984 issue of The Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society.Nepenthes eymae Shigeo Kurata. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). The holotype, designated as Kurata, Atsumi & Komatsu 102a, was collected on the northern spur of Mount Lumut in Central Sulawesi,Schlauer, J. Nepenthes eymae. Carnivorous Plant Database. at an altitude of 1850 m, on November 5, 1983. A series of isotypes (Kurata, Atsumi & Komatsu 103, 104, and 105) was also listed by Kurata. The repository of these four specimens is not indicated in the type description and they have not been located, but if they were deposited in a public institution this is likely to have been the herbarium of the Nippon Dental College (NDC).Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1‚Äì157. Despite this, the species name is valid per Article 37 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, and Kurata's description includes an illustration of the holotype on page 44. Kurata published the species with the specific epithet eymai, honouring Pierre Joseph Eyma. Other authors later noted that although Eyma was male, the name is feminine, and so the epithet was emended to eymae. Almost concurrently with Kurata's publication, John Turnbull and Anne Middleton described the same species under the name N. infundibuliformis in the journal Reinwardtia. Kurata's description was published on February 6, whereas Turnbull and Middleton's was printed four days later, on February 10. As such, the name N. eymae holds nomenclatural priority and N. infundibuliformis is considered a heterotypic synonym. A similar situation involved the descriptions of N. glabrata and N. hamata by the same authors. Turnbull and Middleton's description is based on the specimen J.R.Turnbull & A.T.Middleton 83148a, which was collected by the authors on September 20, 1983, from Mount Lumut Kecil in Sulawesi at the coordinates , at an altitude of 1500 m. In their description of the species, Turnbull and Middleton stated that the type material was deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens, but Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek were unable to locate it and wrote that it \\"appear[s] not to have been deposited at Bogor as stated\\". In addition to the herbarium specimens of N. eymae mentioned here, a number of others have appeared in the literature. Most authors regard N. eymae as a distinct species and it has been treated as such in all major monographs on the genus, including Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek's \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\" (1997)Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. and \\"Nepenthaceae\\" (2001), as well as Stewart McPherson's Pitcher Plants of the Old World (2009). Nonetheless, some authors have expressed doubt that it merits distinction from N. maxima at the species level.D'Amato, P. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley.Evans, D.P. 2009. New cultivars: Nepenthes maxima ‚ÄòLake Poso‚Äô. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 38(1): 18‚Äì22. In Pitcher Plants of the Old World, McPherson wrote that \\"the specific status of N. eymae seems warranted since the two taxa [N. eymae and N. maxima] appear to occur both together and in isolated, self-sustaining communities\\". Whatever the status of this taxon, the vast majority of plants cultivated under the name N. eymae do not exhibit the abruptly contracted upper pitchers commonly associated with it.Mey, F.S. 2011. The real Nepenthes eymae?. Strange Fruits: A Garden's Chronicle, December 10, 2011. Description Nepenthes eymae is a climbing plant growing to a height of up to 8 m. The stem, which may be branched, is two-ridged and up to 8 mm in diameter. Internodes are up to 6 cm long. Axillary buds, which are found 3‚Äì10 mm above the leaf axils in climbing stems, are spike-like and measure up to 10 mm (rarely 20 mm) in length by 1.5 mm in width. rosette plant bearing lower pitchers Leaves are coriaceous and petiolate. The lamina (leaf blade) is oblong or oblong-elliptic and reaches up to 35 cm in length by 12 cm in width. The laminar apex is rounded or acute to obtuse and is not peltate. The base is obtuse and attenuate, narrowing to form a petiole. The petiole is canaliculate and occasionally winged, the wings being around 4 mm wide. The petiole may be up to 18 cm long in etiolated plants, but is more typically up to 10 cm long. It clasps the stem for around half of its circumference and is abruptly decurrent, sending off a pair of low ridges to the node below. Longitudinal and pinnate veins are inconspicuous. Rosette and lower pitchers are generally ovate throughout, but may also be cylindrical. They are often slightly constricted below the pitcher orifice. Mature lower pitchers are the largest traps produced by the plant, growing to 24 cm in height by 16 cm in width. A pair of wings (‚â§2 cm wide) is present on the ventral surface of the pitcher cup; the fringe elements are up to 8 mm long. The rear of the pitcher is elongated into a pronounced neck. The waxy zone of the inner surface is reduced. The pitcher mouth is ovate and concave, and has an oblique insertion. The peristome is glossy and more-or-less cylindrical in cross section. It is up to 2 cm wide at the front, becoming expanded at the sides and rear, where it reaches a maximum width of over 5 cm. The outer margin of the peristome may be sinuate, whereas the inner margin is deeply incurved, especially towards the back of the pitcher. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 34% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The two lobes of the peristome are typically separated by a gap of several millimetres under the lid. The peristome ribs are well developed, being up to 2 mm high. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate to triangular, growing to 5 cm in length by 3 cm in width. It has an acuminate apex and a truncate to auriculate base. The lid is noted for commonly exhibiting irregular, highly crenellated margins. Two prominent appendages are often found on the lid's lower surface. The first, a triangular basal crest, is up to 12 mm long. The second, a filiform or triangular apical appendage, is up to 18 mm long. Both the appendages and the lid's midline bear elliptic, bordered glands measuring up to 2 mm by 1 mm. The remainder of the lid's lower surface bears many smaller glands. An unbranched spur up to 10 mm long is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers are narrowly infundibular in the basal half to three-quarters, rapidly expanding to become broadly infundibular in the upper portion.Wistuba, A. 2001. Nepenthes photographs. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 30(2): 63. They may be shortly contracted directly below the orifice. Upper pitchers are significantly smaller than their terrestrial counterparts, reaching only 15 cm in height by 8 cm in width. Characteristically, the hollow pitcher tube continues past the curved basal portion of the trap and for a few centimetres up the tendril. This is also commonly seen in N. flava, N. fusca, N. jamban, N. ovata, and N. vogelii. The wings are often reduced to ridges, although no vestige of the wings may be apparent in some specimens. These ridges typically run parallel in the lower part of the pitcher, becoming divergent above. The pitcher mouth is horizontal and straight. The peristome is flattened, glossy and up to 1.5 cm wide, being of approximately equal width across its span or broader towards the rear. The peristome ribs are highly reduced but conspicuous, being only up to 0.5 mm high and spaced up to 0.5 mm apart. The rear of the pitcher is elongated into an acuminate neck (‚â§3 cm long) that may be vertical or inclined forwards at a considerable angle relative to the pitcher orifice. The peristome's inner margin lacks teeth, while the outer margin is often sinuate at the base of the neck. The lid is typically hastate and very narrow, measuring up to 8 cm in length, with basal and middle widths of up to 2.5 and 1 cm, respectively. It bears rounded basal lobes and an obtuse to abruptly rounded apex. It is often curled upwards and may be crenellated at the margins. The presence of appendages is variable in upper pitchers: the lid may possess a pair of appendages as in terrestrial pitchers or may lack them completely. Where these appendages are present, the basal one is hook-shaped and up to 8 mm long and the apical one filiform and up to 12 mm long. The glands of the lower lid surface are similar to those found in lower pitchers. The spur is inserted 10 mm below the lid. It may be simple or bifid at its apex, and measures up to 10 mm in length. Developing pitchers have laterally appressed walls and a pronounced bulge at the rear, which holds the spur upright. The spur has a closed bifurcation at this point. Nepenthes eymae has a racemose inflorescence. The male inflorescence measures up to 30 cm in length by 2.5 cm in width (flowers included), of which the peduncle (‚â§3 mm wide at its base) constitutes up to 11 cm and the rachis up to 20 cm. Flowers are borne singly or in pairs, the two-flowered partial peduncles being located towards the base of the inflorescence. The partial peduncles are ebracteate and number 30‚Äì40. They are approximately 4 mm long, being formed from a pair of basally-united pedicels around 10 mm long. Tepals are elliptic and around 4 mm long by 2 mm wide. The androphore is around 4 mm long and bears an anther head measuring 1 mm by 1.5 mm. An indumentum of soft, orange to reddish-brown hairs is often present on all mature vegetative parts, including the stem, lower lid surface, and laminar surfaces. This covering consists of tufted hairs up to 0.05 mm long and simple hairs typically up to 0.8 mm long (those of the tendril, midrib, lid and spur are denser and longer, reaching 2 mm). However, the indumentum is variable and may be reduced to the point of being completely inconspicuous in some populations. The stem and midribs are yellowish green, and the laminae dark green. The tendrils may be yellow to green or tinged red. In terrestrial traps, the pitcher cups may be white, green, yellow, brown, or red, and are often red speckled. Traps bearing a conspicuous indumentum may have a maroon sheen under certain light conditions. The inner surface ranges from yellow or olive green to almost brown, and commonly has darker blotches of red, brown, or purple. The peristome is usually dark, from reddish brown to black throughout in older specimens. It frequently bears stripes ranging from yellow to black. The operculum is green to brown and often mottled with red to black markings on its lower surface. Upper pitcher are predominantly yellow, sometimes bearing red to purple flecks on the inner surface and lid underside. The appearance of the peristome is variable: it may be a solid orange to red (in which case it is often darker towards the inner edge), or it may be narrowly streaked with red, brown, purple, or black. Tepals are red. No infraspecific taxa of N. eymae have been described. An epiphytic specimen with red-mottled lower pitchers Ecology Nepenthes eymae is endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It has been recorded from the provinces of Central Sulawesi (including the East Peninsula) and West Sulawesi. Many of the peaks in these regions are poorly known and may support as-yet undiscovered populations of N. eymae. The species has a wide altitudinal distribution of 1000 to at least 2000 m above sea level, typically being found above 1400 m. The species generally grows terrestrially, but may also be epiphytic at higher elevations. It has been recorded from a wide variety of habitats, including heath forest, river banks, exposed sites such as cliff faces and landslides, and disturbed or recovering secondary vegetation (such as previously logged dipterocarp forest). Towards the upper end of its altitudinal range, N. eymae is found among the ridge and summit vegetation of upper montane forest. The species occurs in both shaded and exposed sites, but grows best in the latter. Nepenthes eymae has no confirmed natural hybrids, although introgression may take place where this species is sympatric with N. maxima. The conservation status of N. eymae is listed as Least concern on the IUCN Red List, based on an assessment carried out in 2018. In 2009, Stewart McPherson wrote that the species is \\"widespread and locally abundant\\" across its range and that most populations are \\"remote and not seriously threatened at present\\". Nepenthes eymae is known to occur in one protected area (Morowali Nature Reserve), although the full extent of its range is unknown. Carnivory Nepenthes eymae produces an extremely thick, mucilaginous pitcher fluid that coats the entire inner surface of the traps in a thin film. This is seen in cultivated plants as well and is most prominent in upper pitchers, which must contend with the action of the wind. These pitchers appear to function at least in part as flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping small flying insects above the surface of the fluid. The prey then gradually slide down into the base of the pitcher where they are digested. This trapping method was noted by Peter D'Amato in 1993, who observed that, in cultivated plants, lower pitchers were more successful at catching ants than were upper pitchers. A 2011 study that used cultivated material of N. eymae recorded a mean digestive fluid relaxation time of 0.096 seconds (¬± 0.000) for this species.Bonhomme, V., H. Pelloux-Prayer, E. Jousselin, Y. Forterre, J.-J. Labat & L. Gaume 2011. Slippery or sticky? Functional diversity in the trapping strategy of Nepenthes carnivorous plants. New Phytologist 191(2): 545‚Äì554. As for the majority of studied highland Nepenthes (but not lowlanders), this value differed significantly (P < 0.001) from that of distilled water, leading the authors to categorise N. eymae as a viscoelastic species. Similarly viscous pitcher fluid is found in the group of closely allied Sumatran species that includes N. aristolochioides, N. dubia, N. flava, N. inermis, N. jacquelineae, N. jamban, N. talangensis, and N. tenuis. These species all share infundibular pitchers. Related species Nepenthes eymae belongs to the loosely defined \\"N. maxima complex\\", which also includes, among other species, N. boschiana, N. chaniana, N. epiphytica, N. faizaliana, N. fusca, N. klossii, N. maxima, N. platychila, N. stenophylla, and N. vogelii.Robinson, A.S., J. Nerz & A. Wistuba 2011. Nepenthes epiphytica, a new pitcher plant from East Kalimantan. In: McPherson, S.R. New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 36‚Äì51. Nepenthes eymae is very closely allied to the extremely polymorphic N. maxima, which is widespread across Sulawesi, New Guinea, and the Maluku Islands. It differs from this species in its wingless, infundibular and relatively small upper pitchers, ovate lower pitchers, and hastate lid. While some forms of N. maxima also produce entirely infundibular aerial traps, these are not usually as abruptly contracted (and therefore wine glass-shaped) as in N. eymae, and may or may not have fringed wings. Where the two species grow side-by-side, introgression may blur these morphological boundaries and make circumscription difficult. Like N. eymae, N. maxima and N. klossii (another closely related species) also commonly have two lid appendages. Nepenthes fusca of Borneo may produce aerial pitchers resembling those of N. eymae, although its lower pitchers are considerably narrower and cylindrical in shape. The lower pitchers of N. eymae could potentially be confused with those of another Bornean endemic, N. veitchii, although otherwise these species have little in common, particularly with respect to the upper pitchers. Notes :a.Jan Schlauer's Carnivorous Plant Database lists the specimen number as 83140a and the collection date as September 29, 1983. :b.Other published specimens of N. eymae include Lack & Grimes 1786 (includes a climbing stem with an upper pitcher) and Cheek s.n. (includes a lower pitcher). Both of these specimens, along with Eyma 3968, are illustrated in a line drawing by Camilla Speight in Martin Cheek and Matthew Jebb's 2001 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\".

It was mostly used for football matches. The stadium had a capacity of 25,800 people and was built in 1955. The ground was demolished in 2005 to make room for a new stadium that has been opened in December 2006. In 5 November 1933 Germany played a friendly match against Norway (2:2) here which name of stadium was Stadion am G√ºbser Damm. History After World War II the city of Magdeburg planned to erect a sports center consisting among others of a stadium with a capacity for 80,000 people and a natatorium. However, the city was unable to acquire the site originally intended and so the project was abandoned. Instead, the city decided to build a new stadium east of the Elbe river, at the site of the SV Victoria 96 Magdeburg stadium. In order to erect the stands, about of rubble were transported from the ruins of the city. The stadium was equipped with an athletics track and was opened in front of a crowd of 40,000 on September 18, 1955. Over the years, it was upgraded several times, parts of the stands were put under a roof, and floodlights were installed. However, after the reunification of Germany the stadium gradually fell into disrepair and in 2004 the city council decided to build a new one at the same site. The Ernst-Grube-Stadion was demolished between March and June 2005, and construction of the new stadium began on July 4, 2005. It hosted the home matches of 1. FC Magdeburg until 2004. The last competitive match was played there on December 4, 2004 against FSV Zwickau.

The report was commissioned by the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and was headed by the former head of the State Prosecution Criminal Department Talia Sasson. Talia Sasson would later run for the Israeli elections as part of the left wing party Meretz.  The report  The report detailed how officials in the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Housing and Construction and the settlement division of the World Zionist Organization spent millions of shekels from state budgets to support the unauthorized outposts. The Sasson report called it a \\"blatant violation of the law\\" and said \\"drastic steps\\" were needed to rectify the situation. It describes secret cooperation between various ministries and official institutions to consolidate \\"wildcat\\" outposts, which settlers began erecting more than a decade ago. Sasson added that the problem was ongoing, saying \\"the process of outpost expansion is profoundly under way.\\" The report states: * The housing ministry supplied 400 mobile homes for outposts on private Palestinian land. * The defense ministry approved the positioning of trailers to begin new outposts. * The education ministry paid for nurseries and their teachers. * The energy ministry connected outposts to the electricity grid. * Roads to outposts were paid for with taxpayers' money. The report mentioned 150 communities in the West Bank with incomplete or nonexistent permits, but Sasson cautions that this list was not exhaustive, due to the lack of cooperation of some ministries and government offices which, according to her, failed to hand over some important documents. She recommended that the Housing Ministry be stripped of authority over construction of settlements in the West Bank, and that this power be transferred to the cabinet. The Housing Minister at the time of the tabling the report, Isaac Herzog (Labour), said following the release of the report that every expense earmarked for the settlements would subsequently need the approval of the Ministry's director-general. Up until then, the heads of each department at the Ministry had been able to sign off on expenses for various construction and infrastructure matters at the settlements. The settlement expansion initiative was backed by Sharon when he was Foreign Minister under Binyamin Netanyahu. In 1998 Sharon publicly urged settlers to seize hilltops in order to break up the contiguity of Palestinian areas and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying: \\"Let everyone get a move on and take some hilltops! Whatever we take, will be ours, and whatever we don't take, will not be ours!\\" The report did not mention Sharon, however. Nevertheless, the report prompted calls that Sharon and other former and current government officials face legal repercussions for their alleged official involvement in the funding of illegal settlements.:: APN :: Shalom Achshav Announcements Settler leaders have rejected criticism of illegality and wrongdoing, protesting that they were participating in officially sanctioned community planning initiatives. According to the Sasson Report, the establishment of an outpost requires government approval. However, such a regulation was not put in place until 6 December 2004, when Attorney General Menachem Mazuz issued the directive. Until then, according to the , a group of pro-settlement attorneys, the status of an outpost was regulated in accordance with Government Resolution 150 from 2 August 1996, which stipulated that the Defense Minister had the authority to authorize new outpost communities. According to the Land of Israel Legal Forum, nearly all of the Jewish neighborhoods deemed \\"unauthorized\\" by Talia Sasson were established before Mazuz‚Äôs 2004 stipulation and are therefore, in fact, legally authorized.Legal Forum: ¬¥Unauthorized Outposts¬¥ Are Legal Communities - Inside Israel - Israel News - Arutz Sheva Such an argument has yet to be legally established. Sasson recommended that Sharon consider criminal investigations against those suspected of involvement.  Reactions  Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the report. \\"It is time for the international community to say 'enough' to Israel and work with the same determination as on other matters,\\" said Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei. A US embassy spokesman in Tel Aviv also repeated Washington's longstanding call for Israel to remove the outposts. Settler leader Shaul Goldstein said Mr Sharon should be the one to face questioning over the report's findings, adding \\"It's obvious that the one who sent us in order to protect the roads and land is the prime minister so he should look in the mirror. Mr Sharon has to be questioned - not us.\\" According to the Haaretz newspaper, Herzog claimed that \\"the main responsibility for the building of illegal outposts in recent years falls with my predecessor, Effi Eitam and his director general.\\" He also added that when he took up the position earlier this year, he ordered that no funds be transferred to the illegal outposts, as well as the establishment of a joint Defense Ministry and Prime Minister's Office team to coordinate the budgets for the settlements. Eitam replied in reaction to the report and the associated comments, saying that all illegal outposts he had approved during his time in office were approved in coordination with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, had his full backing and were sometimes initiated by him. Eitam claimed that Talia Sasson was not an objective surveyor and that the report was politically motivated.Arutz Sheva  Peace Now report  In November 2006, the Israeli NGO Peace Now published a report which they claimed to be mostly based on the same government data as used by Sasson. According to the report, almost 40% of the land area of West Bank settlements is privately owned by Palestinians.Peace Now publication: November 2006 report However, in 2007 Peace Now released partially reduced figures estimating 32.4% of the land \\"held\\" for the West Bank settlements is privately owned by Palestinians.

This episode is also known as \\"Welsh Rugby\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie.  Plot  The Goodies receive an invitation, from the Reverend Llewellyn Llewellyn Llewellyn Llewellyn, to attend an Eisteddfod in Llan Dlubber in Wales. Tim is excited by this; the others less so. Despite this, Graeme gets his computer to create a traditional folk song. Tim declares it to be rubbish, provoking Bill's retort: \\"It's good enough for the Taffy Druids, isn't it?\\" Tim takes offence to this, warning Bill that Welsh people are very sensitive - \\"if you annoy them, they break your fingers!\\" When they meet the Reverend, they find that he is amazed that the Goodies want to eat and drink tea etc. He tells them that eating, drinking tea, and other such activities are sinful. The Reverend is with the Church of the Seventh Day Repressionists, and the church has disallowed anything that could even be remotely construed as fun: \\"You'll catch none of us committing one... of the Nine Thousand, Seven Hundred, and Sixty-Four Deadly Sins!\\" When the Goodies comment on the fun there should be at the Eisteddfod, the Reverend says that the Eisteddfod is the International Festival of Gloom, stating: \\"Enjoyment? There's no enjoyment at the eisteddfod. 'Eisteddfod' is an old Welsh word, you see, from the Old Welsh -- 'Eistedd' meaning 'bored', and 'fod' meaning 'stiff'\\". The Reverend suggests the Goodies go to bed early, after a nice brisk rub down with a Brillo Pad. At this point, Bill is ready to leave and go home. Graeme, however, decides that the Goodies should stay, and remain as competitors in the Eisteddfod, and to be as entertaining as possible. As a consequence, they put on an enthusiastic display of entertainment, and they bring down the wrath of the Reverend on their heads. The Reverend decides to sacrifice the Goodies. Before he sacrifices the Goodies. he leads his congregation in a devotional song, which just happens to be a well-known rugby song. The Goodies, recognising the song, throw themselves into singing in full voice. This surprises the Reverend. When the Goodies press this temporary advantage by pretending to be Welsh, the Reverend declares that he can't kill fellow Welshmen, tells them that his church (revealed as \\"Welsh Druids\\") worships the game of rugby union, and invites the Goodies to join them. Tim declines on the basis that they are Church of England. The Reverend claims that his is the greatest religion, and Tim challenges him to prove it. This results in the \\"Ecclesiastical Rugby Sevens\\" competition, in which various teams made up from churchmen from religious groups play against each other (one of the Seven Rugby teams is made up entirely of Derek Nimmos, and the \\"Festival of Light\\" is dominated by Mary Whitehouse, who is amusingly brutal). Eventually, the \\"Welsh Druids\\" win the tournament, and their celebrations are less than holy. Tim discovers that half of the Welsh rugby national team are not holy and they're playing with the \\"Druids\\", and he disqualifies the team because they had brought in nonreligious players. The \\"Druids\\" take offence at being denied their rightful position as winners, and decide to use the Goodies as balls in a rough informal game of Rugby.

Botanical history Figure 26 from \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\" showing a portion of a climbing stem with a male inflorescence (Pulle 843 bis; labelled a) and dwarf plants from the mountain top (Lam 1654; labelled b and c). =Early collections= Herman Johannes Lam, after whom the species is named, made a number of collections of N. lamii during the Van Overeem Expedition of 1920. He collected both male and female floral material on October 17, 1920, on the flanks of Doorman Top (now known as Mount Anggemuk), West Papua, at an elevation of 3250 m (or 3200 m). These specimens are collectively designated as Lam 1637. Lam made a further collection of N. lamii on the following day, October 18, this time from 3520 m on Doorman Top. It represents the uppermost altitudinal limit for this species and for all Nepenthes. This material also consists of both male and female parts and is designated as Lam 1654. Both of Lam's specimens represent greatly stunted, dwarf plants. They are deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens. =Grouping with N. vieillardii= The first author to describe specimens of N. lamii was B. H. Danser in his seminal 1928 monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\". Danser interpreted specimens of N. lamii as representing an outlying population of N. vieillardii (previously recorded only from New Caledonia) and used two specimens of N. lamii (Pulle 843 bis and Lam 1654) to illustrate the latter species (figure 26 in his monograph). In addition to the specimens mentioned above, Danser also listed Docters van Leeuwen 10834 as New Guinean material of what he identified as N. vieillardii. Danser explained his interpretation of N. vieillardii as follows: > N. Vieillardii has only been recorded from New Caledonia and the Isle of > Pines up to the present, but the materials collected by the latter > expeditions have shown, that at least in the western part of New Guinea it > is not rare, in the latter country it varies more than in New Caledonia but > it seemed impossible to me to distinguish separate species. Most alike the > plants of New Caledonia are the number Pulle 834 and those of Docters van > Leeuwen ; they only differ from the New Caledonia plants by the slightly > developed indumentum, and the lid being more elliptical and bearing many > glands on its lower surface. The plants of the Doormantop (Lam 1637 & 1654) > have strongly abbreviate stems and are obviously an alpine form only ; they > have nearly round lids like the plants of New Caledonia. The plants from the > Ericatop are small and delicate in all parts ; they agree with the numbers > first mentioned, by the elliptical and very glandular lids ; when the other > New Guinea forms were not known, I would not have hesitated to distinguish > those from the Ericatop specifically from those from New Caledonia. [...] > > The habitat of this species in New Guinea are as well the virgin forest and > the scrub as the treeless mountain tops. On the Doormantop, where Lam > collected his plants, one would not expect Nepenthes, the winds being there > very strong and the temperature often very low, according to Lam often below > the freezing point before sunrise. This hardiness gives N. Vieillardii a > fair chance of dispersion. For most of the remainder of the 20th century, authors followed Danser in treating N. lamii as a geographically isolated population of N. vieillardii. A prominent example of this is Matthew Jebb's 1991 monograph, \\"An account of Nepenthes in New Guinea\\", where an illustration of N. lamii (figure 27) is labelled as showing N. vieillardii. In 1994, A. Wistuba, H. Rischer, B. Baumgartl, and B. Kistler observed wild plants of N. lamii (which they called N. vieillardii) during a trip to Doorman Top in search of the enigmatic N. paniculata.Wistuba, A. 1994. Re: Nepenthes-discussion. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, September 15, 1994. The group were unsuccessful in rediscovering the latter species, but found N. maxima on the mountain. =Recognition as a distinct species= Nepenthes lamii was formally described by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek in their 1997 monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\". The authors distinguished it from N. vieillardii on the basis of a number of features of pitcher and indumentum morphology. They selected the holotype and isotype specimens from the Lam 1637 series; both are deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes lamii. Carnivorous Plant Database.Nepenthes lamii M.Jebb & Cheek. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). The type specimen is notable for exhibiting densely glandular tendrils. The next detailed treatments of N. lamii appeared in Cheek and Jebb's updated monograph of 2001, \\"Nepenthaceae\\", and Stewart McPherson's 2009 work, Pitcher Plants of the Old World, which included colour habitat photographs of the species. Description Nepenthes lamii reaches a maximum height of around 4 m, although plants growing towards the upper altitudinal limit of this species are greatly stunted shrublets. The stem, which may be branched, is rounded or angular in cross section and has internodes up to 8 cm long. Leaves are thinly coriaceous and sessile. The lamina (leaf blade) is most commonly linear, but may also be lanceolate. It reaches 22 cm in length by 5 cm in width. It has an acute to acuminate apex and an obtuse base that may be decurrent for more than 2 cm down the stem, although it is variable in this respect. Three to four longitudinal veins are typically present on either side of the midrib, restricted to the distal quarter to third of the lamina, although they may number as many as 5 or as few as 0. Pinnate veins, which may or may not be distinct, emerge obliquely from the midrib to form an irregular network in the distal half of the lamina. Tendrils may be densely glandular in some specimens. Laminae are typically green throughout, but may be tinged with purple, especially in stunted plants from higher elevations. The midrib and tendrils are often yellow and turn orange to red upon exposure to strong sunlight. Rosette and lower pitchers are typically ovate in the basal half of the pitcher cup, becoming cylindrical and sometimes slightly infundibular above. A conspicuous hip often delimits these two parts of the trap. Terrestrial pitchers may also be entirely ovate. They are relatively small, rarely exceeding 7 cm in height by 3 cm in width, although they occasionally reach 12 cm by 4 cm. A pair of wings (‚â§8 mm wide) runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. The wings bear fringe elements up to 5 mm long. The pitcher mouth is suborbicular and has an oblique insertion. The peristome is cylindrical and becomes flattened and broader towards the sides and rear, measuring up to 7 mm in width. It bears ribs up to 0.5 mm high and spaced up to 0.8 mm apart. On the inner margin of the peristome, the ribs terminate in teeth up 1 mm long. The pitcher lid or operculum is orbicular to elliptic with a rounded apex and a rounded to cordate base. It bears no appendages, although the midline may be thickened into a 1 mm high ridge. It reaches 4.5 cm in length by 3.8 cm in width. The lower surface of the lid bears numerous nectar glands. Most are orbicular and measure 0.1‚Äì0.2 mm in diameter; this type occurs at a density of 1500‚Äì2000/cm2. Larger, longitudinally elliptic glands of 0.4 mm, and occasionally even up to 3 mm, are concentrated around the midline. An unbranched spur measuring up to 5 mm in length is inserted near the base of the lid. It may or may not be flattened. Lower pitchers are typically reddish on their outer surface, often having speckles of a darker red colour. The inner surface varies from white to light orange. The peristome may be orange, through red, to purple. The lid is often yellowish on its lower surface and the same colour as the pitcher cup on its upper surface. Stunted plants from higher altitudes typically produce dark terrestrial pitchers. Upper pitchers are infundibular and somewhat inflated in the basal quarter to third of the pitcher cup, becoming cylindrical or slightly infundibular above. A conspicuous hip often delimits these two parts of the trap. Rarely they may be wholly obovoid. Aerial traps are considerably larger than their terrestrial counterparts, growing to 18 cm in height by 5 cm in width. Ribs are present in place of wings. The peristome is cylindrical and up to 5 mm wide, being either uniformly broad throughout or slightly expanded at the sides and rear. Other parts are similar to those found in terrestrial traps. Aerial pitchers are usually yellowish throughout, occasionally with tinges of orange or red in older specimens. The ventral ridges are sometimes completely red. The inner surface may be white to cream coloured. The peristome ranges in colour from yellow to red, whereas the lid is most commonly yellow throughout. Nepenthes lamii has a racemose inflorescence up to 14 cm long. The peduncle constitutes up to 7 cm of this length and has a basal width of around 2 mm. Flowers are borne solitarily on pedicels (‚â§10 mm long) that lack bracts. Tepals are elliptic and measure up to 3 mm in length by 3.3 mm in width. The androphore is up to 2.5 mm long and bears an anther head measuring up to 1.25 mm by 1.5 mm. Most parts of the plant lack a persistent indumentum, being glabrous. A very sparse covering of pale brown, woolly-scurfy hairs measuring 0.2‚Äì0.4 mm is present on developing parts. The only mature parts that retain an indumentum are the inflorescence and tendrils, which bear an inconspicuously puberulent covering of simple, black hairs of around 0.3 mm. Ecology Nepenthes lamii is endemic to the higher peaks of central Papua province in West Papua, New Guinea, including Doorman Top (also known simply as Mount Doorman) and Mount Erica of the Hellwig Mountains. Sizable populations of this species have been found near Tembagapura, a mining town situated at around 1900 m in the Sudirman Range. Nepenthes lamii has an altitudinal distribution of 1460‚Äì3520 m above sea level. The uppermost altitudinal limit of this species represents the highest known elevation of any Nepenthes, although Nepenthes sp. Papua has been found at similar altitudes of around 3500 m. The species is highly variable in terms of growth habit and stature. At lower elevations, it is a scrambling climber that grows both terrestrially and epiphytically in a variety of habitats, including mossy forest, recovering vegetation, open scrub, and stunted lower and upper montane forest. It is exposed to strong or direct sunlight at these sites. Plants from higher altitudes become progressively more stunted and grow terrestrially among montane scrub and grasses, montane heath, or in open sites with little other vegetation. These dwarf ultrahighland specimens experience some of the lowest temperatures of any Nepenthes; nighttime temperatures as low as 4 ¬∞C are not uncommon above 3200 m and on the upper slopes of Doorman Top they may fall below freezing. Plants growing in exposed sites on the mountain top also experience very strong winds. Although N. maxima has also been recorded from Doorman Top, no natural hybrids involving N. lamii have been found to date. The size and distribution of natural populations of N. lamii are incompletely known, making it difficult to assess the species's conservation status. However, the populations found near Tembagapura appear to be secure for the time being due to the tight controls on access and development present in the area. The other known populations of N. lamii are all located in remote parts of Papua and many have not seen human contact in decades. Stewart McPherson writes that N. lamii \\"may be anticipated from many of the high peaks of central Papua, and the species may accordingly have a wider distribution than is currently appreciated\\". Related species Nepenthes lamii is quite morphologically distinct from all other Nepenthes of New Guinea and is thus easily identified in the wild. Its pitchers are somewhat reminiscent of those of N. murudensis and the giant form of N. tentaculata, but both of these taxa are restricted to Borneo. Furthermore, although similar, the traps of N. lamii differ in that they have a round, as opposed to angular, pitcher mouth, and mature specimens never have filaments on the upper surface of the lid. In addition, the lower pitchers are ovate to ovate-cylindrical in N. lamii and possess a wider peristome. Although long confused with N. vieillardii, N. lamii can be distinguished from that species on the basis of several stable differences. Nepenthes lamii almost completely lacks an indumentum on mature parts, whereas N. vieillardii bears a sparse to dense covering of white hairs measuring around 1 mm in length. In addition, the peristome ribs of N. lamii are usually more widely spaced at 0.3‚Äì0.4 mm apart versus 0.2‚Äì0.3 mm in N. vieillardii. The density of nectar glands on the underside of the lid is also much higher in N. lamii (1500‚Äì2000 glands/cm2 versus 75‚Äì100 glands/cm2).Kurata, K., T. Jaffr√© & H. Setoguchi 2004.

Population: History In the 1910s, a railway between Sonkovo and Mga was built. The railway station which is now located in the town of Pestovo was named after the village of Russkoye Pestovo, located from the station. The first train arrived to the station in 1915. The name of Russkoye Pestovo, and subsequently the name of Pestovo, originates from the personal Novgorodian name Pest. At the time, the area was a part of Ustyuzhensky Uyezd in Cherepovets Governorate. In 1924, a sawmill was constructed on the bank of the Mologa close to the station. The sawmill was built by a German company and given to it as a concession. In 1925, a settlement of Pestovo, serving the sawmill, was founded. On August 1, 1927, Cherepovets Governorate was abolished, and its territory was merged into Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. The uyezds were abolished as well and, effective October 1, 1927, Pestovsky District was established, with the administrative center in Pestovo.Snytko et al., p. 85 On September 19, 1927, Pestovo was granted work settlement status.Snytko et al., p. 127 On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.Snytko et al., pp. 87‚Äì88 On July 5, 1944, Pestovsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast.Snytko et al., pp. 218‚Äì219 On January 12, 1965, Pestovo was granted the town status.

It was directed by Terence Fisher, and stars Paul Massie as Dr. Jekyll, and co-stars Dawn Addams, Christopher Lee and David Kossoff. The screenplay was written by Wolf Mankowitz, based on the 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. In contrast to other film versions, Jekyll was portrayed as a rather bland and faceless person, while Hyde was presented as suave and handsome. This reflects director Fisher's belief in what critics (such as biographer Wheeler Winston Dixon) called \\"the charm of evil\\".Wheeler Winston Dixon The Charm of Evil: The Films of Terence Fisher (with an introduction by John Carpenter). Metuchen N. J. and London: Scarecrow Press 1991. 574 pages. The film is unusual in that it was one of the few adaptations of the story where the Jekyll/Hyde character does not die in the story's conclusion. The film was released in North America to theaters by American International Pictures under the titles House of Fright and Jekyll's Inferno and on American TV under its original British title. Plot Dr. Henry Jekyll's wife, Kitty, is secretly involved with his friend Paul Allen (who hounds money from Jekyll). Ignoring the warnings of his colleague and friend Dr. Ernst Littauer, the middle-aged, mild-mannered Jekyll concocts a chemical potion which he hopes will help him learn the depths of the human mind. By testing the potion on himself, he transforms into Mr. Edward Hyde, a young and handsome, but also murderous and lecherous man. Soon, Hyde becomes bored with conventional debauchery and when he sets his eyes on Kitty, he decides he must have her. When Kitty rejects him, Hyde rapes her and leaves her unconscious. When Kitty wakes up in the bed, she immediately notices that Hyde has scratched her neck in various places. Distressed, Kitty walks over to the table, where she finds a note written to her. When Kitty goes into the other room looking for Paul, she looks in to find out that her lover has been bitten by a venomous snake. To Kitty's misfortune, Paul is dead. Kitty walks over to the patio, puts her leg over the balcony, covers her ears in response to the loud music playing from the party and allows herself to fall off the balcony and through the glass roof covering the party guests. Hyde frames his other self for these crimes. The next day, Jekyll is horrified to learn of what Hyde has done. After speaking to his other half via a mirror, Jekyll turns uncontrollably into Hyde. Hyde then kills a man in Jekyll's laboratory by shooting him in the back and sets his body up on a desk. Hyde then sets fire to the laboratory as police arrive. Via a window, Hyde pretends that Jekyll is trying to kill him as the building burns. After escaping the building, Hyde claims Jekyll tried to kill Hyde and ended up shooting himself due to madness as the innocent man and Jekyll's laboratory burns. A few hours later, Hyde is summoned to the police station where he and some officers discuss the crime. After declaring Dr. Jekyll responsible for the crimes, Hyde tries to leave the building, but at the last minute Jekyll fights him from the inside and takes over again. As Dr. Jekyll sits on a bench, looking as sickly as ever, he is surrounded by astonished people and arrested for his alleged crimes.

Argentinian actress Isabel Sarli was offered a role in the film. Reception Reviews were mixed to negative. The Monthly Film Bulletin of the U.K. wrote that the film \\"may be forgiven for tampering with a classic, but not for doing so with such a depressing lack of either wit or competence ... Silliness, in fact, has got the better of the film to such an extent that even its most calculatedly vicious episodes appear only mildly grotesque. The production, which uses up colour film lavishly on such episodes as a cancan sequence, is otherwise hard-up for ideas.\\" Variety gave the film a good review, praising Paul Massie for an \\"interesting performance\\" and Jack Asher for \\"colorful and sure\\" camerawork. Eugene Archer of The New York Times called the film \\"lurid\\", and Massie \\"frankly ridiculous.\\" Harrison's Reports graded the film as \\"Fair\\", adding, \\"Horror fans will hardly be scared by this well-mounted British import...Paul Massie does the best he can in the poorly written twin role.\\" The film lost Hammer an estimated ¬£30,000.Marcus Hearn, The Hammer Vault, Titan Books 2011, p. 38 References External links  Category:English-language films Category:1960 horror films Category:1960 films Category:British films Category:Hammer Film Productions horror films Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde films Category:Films based on horror novels Category:Films directed by Terence Fisher Category:Films with screenplays by Wolf Mankowitz Category:Films scored by Monty Norman ","title":"The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"},{"id":"4851945","text":"Jezerski vrh may refer to: * Maja Jezerc√´, the highest point of the Prokletije and the entire Dinaric Alps * Seebergsattel, a high mountain pass connecting the Austrian state of Carinthia with the Slovenian region of Carinthia.

By 1584, he is mentioned in government interrogation reports as \\"the chiefest reliever of priests\\".

According to Christopher Grene, Lloyd gave Horner, alias Forest, a quart of wine. Grene says that since at the time of Lloyd's trial, Horner was only a supposed priest, being neither under arrest, condemned, nor outlawed, the court was unsure if he even was a priest. Lloyd was executed at Tyburn 30 August 1588, at about twenty-two years of age.  See also  * List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation References External links *Bl.

Born in Egypt, Curiel led the communist Democratic Movement for National Liberation until he was expelled from the country in 1950. Settling in France, Curiel aided the Algerian Front de Lib√©ration Nationale and other national liberation causes, including in South Africa and Latin America. In 1978 Curiel was assassinated in Paris; his murderer has never been identified. Biography =Early life and family= Curiel was born in Cairo to a Sephardic Italian-Jewish family. He became an Egyptian citizen in 1935.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, pp. 106‚Äì107. His brother Raoul Curiel became a respected archeologist and numismatist, specializing in Central Asian studies. A cousin was Eugenio Curiel, a physicist and anti-fascist militant who was murdered in Italy in 1945. Another cousin was the noted British KGB spy George Blake. The latter said that the older Curiel had been influential as a communist in shaping his political views, as Blake met him as a teenager. His son is the French journalist Alain Gresh, who was born in Cairo in 1948 and grew up in Paris. =Political career in Egypt= In 1943 Curiel founded the communist Egyptian Movement for National Liberation (HAMETU) ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉŸá ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ±ŸäŸá ŸÑŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±ÿ± ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜŸä ÿ≠ŸÖÿ™Ÿà, which in 1947 became the Democratic Movement for National Liberation (HADETU). He was repeatedly arrested, along with many other communists. Despite his Egyptian citizenship, he was forced to emigrate in 1950. The Democratic Movement for National Liberation was an active participant in the 1952 revolution led by the free officers and Gamal Abdel Nasser. The revolutionary council and the free officers had many members from HADETU; the most eminent of these were Khaled Mohy el din ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ŸÖÿ≠Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ, Yousef Sedeek ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ ÿµÿØŸäŸÇ and Ahmed Hamroush ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ≠ŸÖÿ±Ÿàÿ¥. Curiel settled in France and led a circle of Jewish communist emigres from Egypt known as the \\"Rome Group\\". =Anti-colonial activism in Paris= Curiel worked for the Jeanson network which supported the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale (FLN) during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62). He was arrested by the French security services in 1960. Curiel was a founder of \\"Solidarit√©\\", a support group for various anti-colonial and opposition movements in the Third World (in particular Africa and Latin America), such as the African National Congress (ANC). In 1976 he initiated contacts with Israeli and Palestinian representatives willing to negotiate a mutual recognition. Several meetings, later known as the \\"Paris talks\\", were organized. Under the chairmanship of Pierre Mend√®s France, they included Issam Sartawi, adviser to Yasser Arafat; and Uri AvneryHe referred to \\"my friendship with Henri Curiel, a Jewish-Egyptian revolutionary who helped us in our contacts with the PLO\\", Uri Avnery, 'Two Americas,' Counterpunch 24 March 2008 and Mattityahu Peled, members of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace (ICIPP). On 21 June 1976, Georges Suffert published an article in Le Point reporting Curiel as the \\"head of the terrorist support network\\", connected with the KGB. He was put under house arrest in Digne, an administrative measure that was lifted once the accusation was demonstrated to be untrue.\\"Henri Curiel, citizen of the third world\\", Le Monde diplomatique, April 1998 An American CIA report from 1981 (a Special National Intelligence Estimate) said that Curiel's organization \\"has provided support to a wide variety of Third World leftist revolutionary organizations\\", including \\"false documents, financial aid, and safehaven before and after operations, as well as some illegal training in France in weapons and explosives.\\" The authors further comment that his group's \\"association with non-communist and nonviolent leaders, including clergymen, has tended to cloak the nature and extent of its operations.\\"Soviet Support for International Terrorism and Revolutionary Violence: Special National Intelligence Estimate (1981). p. 23. Available at =Assassination= Curiel's grave at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Henri Curiel was assassinated in Paris on 4 May 1978. Two far-right groups (OAS and the Charles Martel Group) claimed responsibility, but the case is still unsolved. Police and journalistic investigations suggest other suspects: * Jean-Pierre Ma√Øon, a French criminal linked to the SDECE and the OAS, who worked as an informant for Lucien Aim√©-Blanc, may have killed Henri Curiel on behalf of a Spanish death squad Lucien Aim√©-Blanc, 2006 * Abu Nidal group (it allegedly later shot Issam Sartawi), allegedly commissioned by the KGBAlexandre Adler, 2006 * South African Bureau of State Security (because of Curiel's aid to the ANC) Henri Curiel is buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. Curiel's work in promoting dialogue between the PLO and left-wing Israelis was continued throughout the 1980's by the Comit√© Palestine et Isra√´l Vivront , headed by Sorbonne lecturer Joyce Blau - Curiel's close associate and fellow Egyptian exile The archives of the Comit√© Palestine et Isra√´l Vivront are deposited at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam . =In fiction= Henri Curiel appears in several parts of the 1982 spy thriller Shadow of Shadows by Ted Allbeury, whose plot is focused on George Blake. Allbeury takes at face value the assertions of Curiel having been a KGB agent, and assumes that for some time in the 1950s Curiel was Blake's KGB contact - for which there is no historical proof of any kind.

Biography Lipertis was born in Larnaca in 1866 (exact date disputed‚Äìeither 22 September or 26 October). His father, Theofanis Lipertis hailed from Kyrenia, but moved to Larnaca where he set up a trading company. His mother was Kokonou Modinos. He obtained his basic education from various literary figures of Larnaca. He then furthered his studies in Beirut (from 1880‚Äì1884) where he studied languages at the American University of Beirut and the Jesuit Universit√© Saint-Joseph specializing in English and French.

For the next decade he worked in various governmental departments such as payroll officer in the public works department, inspector of vineyard diseases, coastguard official etc. Through his various jobs he came into contact with the Cypriot countryside and its genuine inhabitants, along with getting to know the various dialects spoken in the different regions of Cyprus. In 1900 he left Cyprus for Naples where he studied philosophy and then to Athens for theology studies. He also traveled to Egypt in search of employment. On his return he began working as a teacher in the capital Nicosia. He first worked at the Pancyprian Gymnasium from 1910‚Äì1912 as a French language teacher and then at The English School.

Volume II, Appendix I, missions, vehicles, equipment. (AD333266). Its declassified technical report had been compiled by R. J. Oberto, Los Angeles Division of North American Aviation. His report described the LRV as an offensive weapons system. Popular Mechanics obtained information on the LRV from a Freedom of Information Act request after documents describing the project were declassified in 1999. Related research commenced during the late 1950s. The Convair/Pomona division of General Dynamics initiated a project entitled Pye Wacket.Parsch, A. (2003-2005). Pye Wacket Its purpose was to determine the feasibility of developing a missile-defense system based on flying discs (lenticular vehicles). Although Pye Wacket was terminated by 1961, research had shown lenticular-shaped vehicles possessed sound re-entry characteristics.Hilton, W. F. (1958, April).

(AD263072) Subsequently, research proceeded towards developing manned lenticular re-entry vehicles during the 1960s and '70s. According to Oberto's report, the LRV was a 40-foot half-saucer with a flat rear edge. The design- study documents indicated it could support a crew of four men for six-week orbital missions. Propulsion was from a rocket engine (either chemical or nuclear) and the craft would also have contained an onboard nuclear reactor for electrical power generation. The existence of the LRV program may lend credence to the military flying saucers theory of unidentified flying objects. However, the flight characteristics of the LRV, as described by these documents, are more similar to a standard orbital space capsule of the 1960s era rather than the rapid motion and sudden velocity change characteristics of many reported UFOs.Maccabee, B. (1997). Acceleration. As of the publication of the Popular Mechanics article, there has been no official confirmation as to whether the Lenticular Reentry Vehicle ever flew.

He was only the third player to win these three events in a single season and as of 2020 he is the last player to have achieved this. The win allowed Williams to become world number one again, the first player to regain the position. Williams had only lost 19 frames through the first four rounds, winning 52. With three of his matches going to a deciding frame, Doherty played 132 frames in the tournament, a record for the modern era, with only his quarter final win over Higgins having been decided by more than two frames.

Serbo-Croatian Prokletije and Albanian Bjeshk√´t e Nemuna both mean \\"the accursed (mountains)\\", possibly because they are perceived as insurmountable and wild. In Albanian, another name for the mountain range since the 20th century is Alpet Shqiptare, meaning \\"Albanian Alps\\".  Location and relief  Annotated image of the area from the air The Prokletije mountains, the southernmost part of the Dinaric Alps, stretch more than from Skadar Lake along the Montenegrin‚ÄìAlbanian border in the southwest to Kosovo in the northeast. These points are at 42¬∞45' and 42¬∞15' N in the Mediterranean zone of the western Balkan Peninsula.Website des Montenegrinischen Tourismusministeriums Akademia e Shkencave e RPSSH: Fjalor enciklopedik shqiptar, Tirana 1985 und Gjeografia fizike e Shqip√´ris√´, Tirana 1990 The southern boundary of the Prokletije is found at the river Drin and its tributary Valbona. In a broader sense the Prokletije also include the mountain ranges to Mitrovica with the Hajla and Mokna massifs. Some authors, however, see the river Lim as the northern boundary of the Prokletije in geological terms. From Skadar lake, the mountains stretch northeast along the Cijevna river area, then curve slightly to the east in the direction of ƒêeravica summit above Metohija (450m) basin in Kosovo. From here, the Prokletije turn northwards over the Bogiƒáeviƒáa massif and ƒåakor pass, and continue with another row of mountains. The Prokletije finish in the area of upper Ibar river valley near the city of Kosovska Mitrovica, just after the Suva Planina () massif that encircles Metohija basin from the north and northwest. The Prokletije are ethnographically and sociologically diverse due to many tribes living in the region as sheep herders. Names of various Albanian tribes (Hoti, Gruda, Kelmendi, Kastrati, Dukagjini, Shkreli, Shala, Nikaj, Krasniqi, Gashi and Rugova) refer to their geographical locations within the range.  Geology  ƒêeravica, eastern face Ski resort of Bog√´ Maja Harapit ‚Äì 1000m unscaled wall face, as seen from Thethi The Prokletije are a typical Dinaric Karst high mountain range with a pronounced steep topography and glacial features. Maximum relief differences of are found in the Valbona, Grbaja and Ropojani and Cijevna Valley. Overhanging walls and ridges forming pointed peaks are typical of the western and central Prokletije. The eastern mountains are less rugged with lower relief. The valleys show characteristic effects of Pleistocene glaciation. Most of the area was modified by glacial activity with karstic areas in the western parts. The range was formed by the folding resulting from the collision of the African and Eurasian plates. Nowhere in the Balkans have glaciers left so much evidence of erosion. After the Alps, these mountains are the most glaciated in Europe south of the Scandinavian ice sheet. They have very steep limestone slopes with abundant karst features. The Prokletije is a large, rugged, pathless range. It is one of the rare mountain ranges in Europe that has not been explored entirely. In some areas, the Prokletije run almost parallel with the ≈†ar Mountains in North Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo. This tectonic crash produced the unusual zig-zag shape of Prokletije range, and also their curving from the dominant Dinaric northwestern ‚Äì southeastern direction toward the northeastern one. In the western and central parts of the range the composition of the mountains is of mainly uniform with Mesozoic limestones and dolomites of the Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. In the eastern Prokletije in addition to the limestone and dolomite series, there are rocks from the late Palaeozoic and Triassic periods, medium-Triassic volcanic rocks and Jurassic metamorphic rocks. The Kalktafel of Prokletije is cut deeply with valleys in a variety of rock blocks of the mountains north of P√´rroi i That√´, the Biga e Gimajive south of it, the Jezerca block between Shala and Valbona valley, the massif of the Maja e Hekurave, the plateau of the Maja e Kolats north of Valbona and Shk√´lzen northeast of Valbona. The valleys were formed by Ice Age glaciers, which created very steep walls and hollows up to deep. The south wall of the Maja Harapit is high, making it the highest rock face on the Balkan Peninsula. Although some scientific research gives the Prokletije the status of a separate mountain chain, in most other ways this chain is still considered the highest of all Dinaric areas, connected with the Dinaric mountain chain in terms of geology, morphology, and ethnography. = Massifs = The Prokletije itself are made up of many large sections or mountain massifs/groups, all of which are connected to one another. These massifs include the Popluks group with a height of , the Shkurt group at , the Radohim√´s group at , the Zabor√´s e Krasni√ß√´s at , the Bjelic group at , the Karanfili-Brada group at , the Rab√´s group at , the Ershellit group at , the Kakinjes group at , the Shk√´lzen group at , the Bogiƒáevica group at , the Horolac group at , the Kershi Kocaj group at , the Maja e Zez√´ group at , the Lumbardhit group at , the Kopranik group at , the Strellc group at , the ƒêeravica group at , the Junik group at , the Starac-Qokorr group , the Hajla group at , the Stedim-Ahmica group at , the Zleb-Rusulija group at , the Mokna group at and the Suva Planina group at . = Canyons and valleys = Tamara Gorge in Albania The erosion of the Prokletije mountains by glaciers left many telltale features behind. Deep river canyons and flat valleys wind around the ridges of the mountains. The largest and most popular canyon is Rugova Canyon. It is situated in Kosovo and is long from the border with Montenegro to the city of Peƒá and is deep. It has very steep vertical mountain slopes on both sides. Valleys common at lower altitudes are also found at the alpine level, creating mountain passes and valley troughs. The most well-known valley to be high up in the mountains is Buni Jezerce in Albania. Buni Jezerce means \\"Valley of the Lakes\\" and it contains six small glacial lakes, the biggest being called the Big lake of Buni Jezerce. Canyons in the Prokletije * Rugova Canyon * De√ßani Canyon * Gashi Canyon * Cemi Canyon Valleys in the Prokletije * Vermosh Valley * Valbona Valley * Thethi Valley * Ropojona Valley * Gerbja Valley * Buni Jezerce * Cemi i Nik√ßit Valley  Rivers and lakes  Leqinat lake Lake Plav The Prokletije include many of the important rivers of the southeastern part of the Western Balkans. Rivers in this range fall roughly into two main categories, those that flow into the Lim and those that enter the White Drin and meet the Black Drin downstream at the Drin confluence. The southern and eastern slopes of Prokletije fall into the latter category. The Tara and Lim rivers, two major sources of the Dinaric river system, originate on the northern borders of the Prokletije. The V√´rmosh originates in the northwest mountainous part in Montenegro, close to the border with Albania. As a tributary of the Drina it drains into the Danube and then into the Black Sea. The Lim flows through the Plav lake. The Ibar, which originates on the slopes of the Hajla, takes a similar route into the Danube via the West Morava in Serbia. In the southern Prokletije, the Drin dominates. It drains most of the ranges with its tributaries and when measured from the source of the White Drin in Radavc to the mouth of the Drin near Lezha, it is long. However, not all of the Drin flows near or parallel to the Prokletije. One Drin tributary is the Valbona, which drains into the Adriatic Sea, and its eastern tributary the Gashi River. To the west of the Prokletije is the Cijevna, which drains the northwestern part of the Montenegrin-Albanian border area to the Adriatic. Water levels fluctuate due to the karst hydrological drought in the Prokletije. Some rivers or streams, such as P√´rroi i That√´ in Albania, dry out completely during the summer droughts. Although the Peƒáka Bistrica in Kosovo is short, it is very powerful and carved the Rugova Canyon. There are about 20 small alpine lakes of glacial origin in the Prokletije. Many lakes are in the Bogi√ßevica border area between Kosovo and Albania and the Buni i Jezerc√´ trough near the Jezerca and Bojs peaks. Some lakes, such as Liqenat Lake in Kosovo and Hrid Lake in Montenegro, have become tourist attractions due to their locations and scenery. Hrid Lake today is a clear example of a well- preserved glacial relief. In the Pleistocene period (1.8‚Äì0.01 million years ago) this was a collection area for ice that fell down over steps of rock from surrounding peaks, dragging with it heterogeneous material. Precipitation washed away smaller rocks, but larger ones remain on the southwestern and western lake shore. The lake is long, wide and about deep on average. In addition to precipitation, it receives water from sources near its shores. The largest lake is Lake Plav in Montenegro. The lake lies at an altitude of above sea level in the Plav valley, nestled between the Prokletije and the Visitor range. The surface area of Lake Plav is and it extends north-south for some . Waterfalls are also found in some parts of the range. The White Drin Waterfall in Kosovo reaches a height of . Because it is not far from the city of Peƒá, it is easily accessible and frequented by many visitors. The Grunas Waterfall in Albania is high and is in the Thethi National Park. The Ali Pasha natural springs in Montenegro near the town of Gusinje are the premium attraction for the town.

In the village of Boga in the dry valley, precipitation is per year, and otherwise per year is normal. At higher elevations snow is found even in summer, except in very dry years. In winter some villages in the Albanian part of the Prokletije are completely cut off from the rest of the world for months due to the very heavy snow. = Glaciation = Today (as around 2015) on the shady northern slopes of the Prokletije, there are at least five active glaciers that probably formed during the late Holocene period, and some inactive glaciers between 1,980 and 2,420 meters high. The trough valleys of Ropojani, Grbaja and Valbona were carved by kilometres of glaciers during the last Ice Age. Detailed geomorphological mapping was used to reconstruct the positions of former glaciers. The longest glacier of Ropojana had a length of and a surface area of ; others include Valbona glacier at and , Grbaja Glacier at and and Bogiƒáeviƒáa Glacier at and. In addition about 20 small lakes of glacial origin are found as described above, among them the lake group Buni i Jezerce to the north side of Jezerca, the Ridsko Lake, Lake Bukumisko and Rikavacko Lake. A recent report from geographers at the University of Manchester details the discovery of four previously unknown glaciers in the Albanian part of the Prokletije range at 1980‚Äì2100 m high, found in the area close to Maja e Jezerces. The glaciers, the largest of which is currently the size of six football pitches, vary in size every year according to the amount of winter snowfall and temperatures during the following summer. Their average total surface area is . Glacier-climate modeling suggests that these glaciers require annual accumulation of between (rainfall equivalent) to balance melting, which would correspond to between of snow. A significant proportion of this accumulation is likely to be sourced from windblown snow and, in particular, avalanching snow. It is estimated that the total accumulation needed to balance melting is potentially up to twice the amount accumulated from direct precipitation. The presence of these glaciers, the southernmost in Europe, at altitudes well below the regional snow line highlights the importance of local controls on glacier development. The geographers think at least eight glaciers were present in neighbouring mountains during the 19th century, correlating with the culmination of the 'Little Ice Age' in the European Alps.  Flora  Pinus heldreichii in front of Popluks and Jezerca peaks. Wulfenia baldaccii, an endemic species Ancient forests around Gjeravica The vegetation of the Prokletije is among the richest on the Balkan Peninsula and one of the main central European regions for flora. To date, 1611 wild plants have been described in the Albanian part alone.Marash Rakaj: Floristic and chorological news from north Albania, in: Botanica Serbica, 33 (2), Institute of Botany and Botanical Garden Jevremovac, Belgrad 2009, Seiten 177‚Äì183 In total, 50 flora species are endemic, sub-endemic and endangered plant species. The southern edge of mountains have a sub-Mediterranean character. Various evergreen bushes are found in the deepest valleys of the canyons and sunny slopes, and in the higher valleys deciduous Shibljak shrubs are common. In the mountains over 100 medicinal herbs are found, including species of the genus Primula, Satureja and Sideritis. Because of its altitude and its favored habitat, the range is one of the centers of arcto-alpine relict flora of the Balkan Peninsula.Stevanoviƒá V, Vukojiƒçiƒá S, ≈†in≈æar-Sekuliƒá J, Lazareviƒá M, Tomoviƒá G & Tan K. 2009. Distribution and diversity of Arctic- Alpine species in the Balkans. Plant Syst. Evol. 283: 219‚Äì235. Distribution and diversity of Arctic-Alpine species in the Balkans. Out of 77 arcto-alpine species of former glacial flora on the Balkan Peninsula, a little over 50 species can be found in the Prokltije. The levels of vegetation in Prokletije meet the alpine level, from upland valleys through the montane mountain stage on forest-free alpine and subalpine mats and subnivale tundra caused by permafrost in vast heaps of rubble with raw soils. A real snow level is not widely spread, although in the high altitudes snow and fern fields can also keep during the summer on four very small glaciers at high altitudes, the highest one found in the shade of Jezerca. Beech, fir and silicate spruce forests dominate the mountain areas. Rarely, however, the Northern Europe species are found, typically the Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. The drought- resistant Mediterranean-sized black pine Pinus nigra is also common. Aspens Populus tremula grow in damp sites alongside mountain maple Acer pseudoplatanus and Norway spruce Picea abies. The Prokletije is one of the southernmost areas where spruce grow in Europe. The \\"combat zones\\" of the forest are formed with dense thickets of mountain pine Pinus mugos. Conifers like the snakeskin pine Pinus heldreichii are on carbonate rocks and the Macedonian pine Pinus peuce of silicates are typical elements of the endemic Balkan flora. These are of special interest for natural history. A cushion- sedge and blue grass lawn of Seslerion juncifoliae grows in alpine areas and, on shallow limestone soils, Oxytropidion dinaricae, to which the alpine grass krumm grows as in the Alps. Other plants include Alpine aster Aster alpinus, edelweiss Leontopodium alpinum and white mountain avens Dryas octopetala.Treasures These plants are atypical alpine plants specially adapted to the short growing season, UV radiation, cold and thin soils. The flora in the rocky areas of the Prokletije are particularly noteworthy, because they are rare rich and endemic species, including the Tertiary relic Amphoricarpos neumayeri. Many species of flora are either endemic or are mainly found in the Prokletije. A plantain plant Plantaginaceae is found in the central Prokletije as a variant of the alpine Wulfenie, but 700 km away it does not grow. Petasites doerfleri is only found on the Jezerca peaks, and the Albanian lily Lilium albanicum and Viola ducagjinica are only found at the top of the Maja Radohim√´s slope.Petrit Imeraj, Joost Smets, in: Gilian Gloyer: Albania Bradt Travel Guide, Bucks 2006 (zweite Ausgabe), Also noteworthy is the Viola vilaensis Hayek. Viola chelmea belong to a violet species that occur on the Montenegrin-Albanian border area, especially at the lake Bukumirsko Jezero at 2,100 meters, and are only found on Asia Minor and the Balkans where they can grow due to woody, robust rhizome, cleistogamous flowers, and a lack of foothills. The Prokletije is also the only European area where the Tertiary relic Forsythia europaea grow.  Fauna  Lynxs are one of the largest predators in the area Large mammal species that have long been extinct in other regions are found here, such as the Eurasian brown bear, grey wolf, red fox, European wildcat, roe deer, fallow deer, red deer, wild boar and European otter.Wolfgang Fremuth (Herausgeber): Albania ‚Äì Guide to its Natural Treasures, Verlag Herwig Klemp, Tirana 2000, The highly endangered Balkan lynx, a subspecies of the Eurasian lynx, is mainly found in the Thethi National Park where about roughly 20‚Äì50 individuals still roam, though poaching is still a large threat. Chamois are found throughout the high altitudes. About 720 chamois live between the borders of Kosovo and Montenegro alone. There is speculation that the mouflon roamed the Prokletije until World War I, when it disappeared. Bird species include the golden eagle, snake eagle, honey buzzard, peregrine falcon, capercaillie, rock partridge, scops owl, Eurasian eagle owl and the snow finch. The rivers are home to a growing number of marble trout. Among the amphibians are the alpine salamander (southernmost habitat),http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/19843/0 fire salamander, yellow-bellied toad and fire bellied toad . The rich herpetofauna include the fence lizard, green lizard, Greek tortoise and snakes such as the true vipers, including the poisonous horned viper and adder. So far 140 species of butterflies have been found, which makes Prokletije the richest area in Europe for butterflies. The Prokletije have one endemic species of lizard, the Prokletije rock lizard or Dinarolacerta montenegrina, named after the range.  Early climbing  British climbers Sleeman, Elmalie and Ellwood were the first to reach the summit of Maja Jezerc√´ on 26 July 1929.Reveue de g√©ographie: ‚Äì Volumes 10‚Äì13 ‚Äì Page 8 Years later Austrian mountaineers also scaled the summit. Many explorers and scientists have visited the Prokletije, collecting rocks and samples to display in museums. Before any of these expeditions, the highest peak of the range was believed to be Shk√´lzen at high, followed by Maja Radohim√´s at . By early summer 1929 all the summits were measured by Italian geodetes.  National parks  Grunas Waterfall in Thethi National Park Valbona River in Valbona Valley National Park There are four national parks in Prokletije ‚Äî one each in Montenegro and Kosovo, and two in Albania. The Theth National Park in Albania was designated in 1966 and covers an area of along the Thethi River. The main attraction in the park is the Grunas Waterfall. The Valbona Valley National Park in Albania was also designated in 1996 and covers including the Valbona Valley and the Valbona River. This park is also referred to as the Gem of Albania. Kosovo, Albania, and Montenegro are planning to create another tri-state park in the area, that will be called the Balkans Peace Park. There are plans to create the enlarged Albanian Alps National Park in Albania, which would include areas of Vermosh, Thethi, Valbona and Gashi River in a massive area of . The park on the Kosovar side was established in 2012 with an area of , covering the high alpine areas as well as the Rugova Canyon and important rivers. The Montenegrin part of the Prokletije range was declared a national park in 2009, comprising an area of . A part of Maja e Rop√´s mountain was declared a floral mountain reserve in 1955, covering an area of of mainly Macedonian pine, pine and beech. In the same year the Kozhnjar area was declared a fauna reserve in particular to protect the chamois, covering an area of .Summit Post ‚Äì Bogi√ßevica Illegal deforestation is still a major problem today. To some extent even the national parks are affected. In dry summers forest fires are common. All the large mammals including wolves, chamois, foxes, badgers and wild boar are hunted without regard to national park boundaries.  Settlement, economy and transport  Bajram Curri of the mountains north of the city The Proketije are home to Albanians, Montenegrins, Serbs and Bosniaks, but they are only very sparsely populated. At the edges there are some settlements: the Albanian Koplik and the Montenegrin Tuzi in the west near the Skadar Lake; Plav and Gusinje in of the northern valley of the upper Lim river in Montenegro and Bajram Curri, the main town of the district Tropoja, in the eastern Prokletije. Even the somewhat more distant, larger cities of Shkodra, Podgorica, ƒêakovica and Peƒá create their sphere of influence and are frequently visited by inhabitants of the highlands for errands, administrative procedures and market sales. Koman Gorge serves as a transport route for ferries In the mountains themselves villages only have up to a few hundred inhabitants. They are often scattered settlements without a clear core. Among the biggest are Tamara and Selca, both in the valley of the Cem and belonging to the community of the Kelmend. The community of eight villages ‚Äì including Vermosh ‚Äì comprises 6,600 inhabitants. Tamara is currently the only place in the central mountains with infrastructure such as a secondary school. Tamara and Vermosh share a maternity hospital. Until the collapse of communism there were such facilities, for example, in the Shala Valley. Many residents of the villages in the interior such as Boga, Theth or Valbona live there only in the summer months, as the villages are cut off for many weeks during winter. In addition to the seasonal migration, the whole mountain area is suffering from a severe \\"brain drain\\", as its income from agriculture is low. Many leave to seek work and a little more comfort in the region of Shkodra and Koplik, Tirana or abroad.Renate Ndarurinze: Albanien entdecken, Trescher Verlag, Berlin 2006, As the year-round population dwindles as the terrain becomes less accessible, there are few state or local government employees such as teachers. Local income comes from agriculture, semi-illegal forestry and tourism. In a few places like Theth tourism has been revitalized by recreational hiking. With the help of GTZ, 40 private houses (also referred to as guest houses, or han in Albanian) have been transformed into tourist accommodations or B&Bs.; In 2010 there were 130 beds available in total ‚Äì 100 more than in 2007. Additionally, hiking trails have been marked and trails maps and travel guides published. In the period from 2006 to 2009, the number of tourists rose from 300 to around 7,500 per year. Unlike in the rest of Albania, the increase was due to foreign tourists. Lakes such as Plav and Hrid also receive many tourists during the summer months. In many villages there are small hydroelectric power plants that supply the village with electricity. Many villages were already settled by the 15th century, and some valleys have been inhabited since the Stone Age.

It then leads to the source elevation of the Qafa e Predelecit after Vermosh, followed by another border crossing, ending at Gusinje. the SH20 stretch between Hani Hotit and Tamare has been paved and upgraded to European standards. From west to east, there is only the SH21 road recently paved from Koplik to Boga, while from Qafa Thores leading to Theth the road is still under construction and in bad shape. From Theth, there is a bad track down to the Shala Valley Church and only a walking path along the river leads to Shkodra. SH22 road over the Qafa e Morin√´s at Bajram Curri after ƒêakovica has been reconstructed. In the past, the only route for crossing the border between Montenegro and Kosovo was via Rugova Canyon, which was very dangerous and steep.

The southern end is Worli, northern end is Bandra Reclamation and Mahim is in the centre. The bay was named after the islands of Mahim and Salsette were merged in the early 19th century. The Mithi River drains into Mahim Creek which drains into the Bay, and forms the border between the city and its suburbs. During the colonial era, the Portuguese built a watch tower called Castella de Aguada on the northern side. Later, the British built the Worli Fort to the south and Mahim Fort near the creek to defend the seven islands of Bombay against attacks by the Portuguese and the Marathas. The bay holds a small indigenous fishing population known as the Kolis. A large infrastructural project, the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, now links the two ends of the bay by a flyover bridge which reduced the commuting time between the suburbs and the city. During the monsoon season the sea waves hit against the walls and sometimes also enters the small bylanes. The bay is highly polluted due to the drainage of the polluted Mithi river into it. Mahim bay shifts according to the tide; during high tide, water rushes to the Bandra side and during low tide, the Worli side has much water. Recently tar deposits have been found in the bay. The bay is highly unsafe for swimming or Ganpati immersion. The flooding situation is growing worse. Approximately the sea floods the area once a week. It reaches up to the walls of Bombay Scottish School. The school authorities are advised to shut their sea facing gates to ensure safety of the children. The most frightening situation occurred after the start of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link project. the waves entered the small bylanes with great velocity. The Cafe Coffee Day and the Barista outlets were nearly touched by the rising waves. The citizens living on the sea facing side of the Veer Savarkar Marg have been warned repeatedly of building check walls to prevent loss of lives and destruction of any movable or immovable property. The students of Bombay Scottish School are also repeatedly told not to go on the beach for safety reasons. The environmentalists in that area have said that the bay has come ahead nearly by 100 metres. This bay is a cause of concern for the local bodies. It is predicted that the waves will nearly submerge Shivaji Park if their arrival to the shore is so fast. The land at the bay has sunk by 5 mm due to the rampant erosion due to the ferocious sea.

Life and career Clark was born in August 1822 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to James and Mary ( Cottman) Clark. His grandfather, Michael Clark, was of English stock from Lancashire, England, but born in Dublin, Ireland. Michael Clark emigrated to the United States at the end of the American Revolutionary War to avoid anti- Catholic persecution in England. Edward Clark's father, James, was one of Michael's three sons, and was an architect in Philadelphia and a well-known teacher of architectural drawing. Edward Clark's mother, Mary, was the daughter of John Cottman, a captain in the Pennsylvania Regiment during the American Revolution. Edward Clark was educated in both public and private schools in Philadelphia. He received his architectural training from his uncle, Thomas Clark, who was an engineer in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He received training in architectural and free-hand drawing from his father. While still in his late teens, Clark was apprenticed to the nationally known Philadelphia architect Thomas U. Walter. As an apprentice, he helped Walter design and plan the buildings for Girard College. In 1851, Walter was appointed the Architect of the Capitol and charged with designing and building the United States Capitol dome and the north (Senate) and south (House) wings of the United States Capitol. Clark accompanied Walter to Washington, D.C., and was Walter's chief assistant on the three projects. Although Walter was author of the general plan and layout of the dome wings, nearly all the detail work was done by Clark. While architectural and planning work progressed on the dome in the 1850s, Clark also assisted Walter in completing the U.S. Patent Office Building and the D.C. General Post Office building. During the American Civil War, Clark also designed and oversaw the construction of numerous arsenals, forts, and hospitals in the Washington, D.C., area. Clark was appointed Capitol architect by President Andrew Johnson upon his mentor's resignation on August 30, 1865, and completed the extension project in 1868. Clark introduced many technological improvements to the Capitol, including electricity, steam heat, and elevators. During Clark's tenure, the Capitol Grounds were greatly enlarged and Frederick Law Olmsted, the greatest landscape architect of the day, was commissioned to design the grounds and terraces. Also during Clark's administration, the Library of Congress moved to its own building, and the west central interior of the Capitol was reconstructed. In 1872, Clark was hired by the state of Iowa to revise plans for the Iowa State Capitol, whose original design had proven too costly to build. Clark retained the general plan of the building, and (working closely with original co-designer Alfred H. Piquenard), revised the plans. It was Clark's building which was eventually constructed. Personal life and death Edward Clark loved literature, and owned one of the largest private libraries in the city at the time of his death. Although not a musician himself, he loved music and had one of the largest private music libraries in the region. He spoke French, Italian, and Latin, and his library contained a large number of works about architecture written in those languages. An ardent art admirer, he was a close friend of William Wilson Corcoran, who founded the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Clark sat on the Corcoran Gallery's board of trustees from its founding, and was at his death the longest-serving trustee. Clark was a member of the Clarendon Historical Society of Edinburgh, the American Institute of Architects, the Archeological Institute of America, the American Institute for the Advancement of Science, the Franklin Institute, the American Forestry Association, and the Washington Monument Society. Clark married Evelyn F. Freeman of Boston, Massachusetts, in 1860. She was a descendant of Sir Edward Freeman, one of the first settlers of Cape Cod. They had two sons, Edward and Watson, and twin daughters, Eveline and Charlotte. Evelyn Clark died in 1896. Clark was enfeebled by old age in the last two years of his life. He died on January 6, 1902, at his home in Washington, D.C., of an undisclosed illness from which he had suffered for several weeks. An Episcopalian, he was buried at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C..

Thanu, starring Vijay and Genelia, Bipasha Basu in lead roles, with Vadivelu, Santhanam and Raghuvaran appearing in supporting roles. The film marks Bipasha's Tamil debut.The score and soundtrack is composed by Devi Sri Prasad. Jeeva and V. T. Vijayan handled the cinematography and editing respectively. The film released on 14 April 2005, on Tamil New Year's Day. Plot Sachein (Vijay), a carefree and happy going guy joins a college in Ooty and falls for Shalini (Genelia) immediately on seeing her in first sight. Shalini studies in the same college as Sachein and is considered a popular and beautiful student, while also being a short tempered and arrogant girl with an upper-middle class status. Sachein comes to know all of this information about her from Arnold aka Ayyasamy (Vadivelu), who is a guy that studies in the college for about nine years and keeps studying there because he thinks that students should give their respect to their college professors, while also informing Sachein, that there are so many boys trying to impress her. This makes Sachein take a different route and he starts mocking Shalini in front of her, which irritates her. Slowly, they both become good friends, after Sachein saved her father in a bike accident. Santhanam (Santhanam), who is another student in the college also loves Shalini. But, he feels jealous seeing her and Sachein being good friends and decides to separate them. Santhanam writes in one of the walls of the college, that Sachein loves Shalini and this angers Shalini, as she misunderstands that Sachein has done it. Shalini shouts at Sachein, but Sachein informs Shalini, that he is so outspoken and does not want to write in the college wall to convey his love, which makes Shalini realize her mistake. But to her surprise, Sachein informs that, although he has not written it, but the content present on the wall is true which means that he is in love with Shalini. This again angers Shalini and she shouts at him that she considered him only as a good friend and that she wasn't in love with him. Later, Shalini overhears Sachein challenging Santhanam that Shalini will convey her love within the next thirty days, as their college years will be completed by then. Shalini challenges Sachein that she will never fall in love with him. Manju (Bipasha Basu) is also from the same college and she likes Sachein. Shalini gets jealous when she spots Sachein and Manju together often. But Manju informs Shalini that Sachein loves Shalini so much and asks her not to hide her feelings, as it is very evident that Shalini too likes Sachein. This makes Shalini realize her love towards Sachein. Sachein comes to know that Shalini‚Äôs parents have arranged a wedding for her and he meets Shalini on the last day of their college and says that he has lost the challenge and he will be leaving Ooty tomorrow. But Shalini hides her feelings towards Sachein and she plans to propose her love the next day as she wants to win the challenge by not conveying her love within the 30 days. On the 31st day, Shalini is excited and goes to propose Sachein. But suddenly, she meets Gowtham (Raghuvaran) on the way, who is Sachein‚Äôs father. Gowtham is a billionaire, in which this fact makes the entire college be surprised that Sachein is the only son of a rich business tycoon, as Sachein always stays very simple and down to earth. Now Shalini feels bad, that if she proposes her love towards Sachein at this moment, then he might misunderstand that she decided to marry him after knowing that he is so rich and decides to stay calm. Sachein leaves to the Coimbatore International Airport in Coimbatore and Shalini also follows him. In the airport, Shalini could not control her emotions and proposes to Sachein. She also revealed that it is her ego that didn‚Äôt let her convey her love during the last thirty days. Sachein feels so happy and the couple are united.

Also known as orthodox economics, it can be contrasted to heterodox economics, which encompasses various schools or approaches that are only accepted by a minority of economists. The economics profession has traditionally been associated with neoclassical economicsDavid C. Colander (2000). Complexity and History of Economic Thought, 35.. This association has however been challenged by prominent historians of economic thought like David Collander. They argue the current economic mainstream theories (game theory, behavioral economics, industrial organization, information economics ...) share very little common ground with the initial axioms of neoclassical economics.  History  Economics has always featured multiple schools of economic thought, with different schools having different prominence across countries and over time. The current use of the term \\"mainstream economics\\" is specific to the post‚ÄìWorld War II era, particularly in the English-speaking world, and to a lesser extent globally. Prior to the development and prevalence of classical economics, the dominant school in Europe was mercantilism, which was rather a loose set of related ideas than an institutionalized school. With the development of modern economics, conventionally given as the late 18th-century The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, British economics developed and became dominated by what is now called the classical school. From The Wealth of Nations until the Great Depression, the dominant school within the English-speaking world was classical economics, and its successor, neoclassical economics.The precise distinction and relationship between classical economics and neoclassical economics is a debated point. Suffice to say that these are the ex post facto terms used to refer to successive chronological periods of an interrelated group of theories. In continental Europe, the earlier work of the physiocrats in France formed a distinct tradition, as did the later work of the historical school of economics in Germany, and throughout the 19th century there were debates in British economics, notably the opposition underconsumptionist school. During the Great Depression and the following Second World War, the school of Keynesian economics gained attention, which built on the work of the underconsumptionist school, and gained prominence as part of the neoclassical synthesis, which was the post‚ÄìWorld War II merger of Keynesian macroeconomics and neoclassical microeconomics that prevailed from the 1950s till the 1970s.Clark, B. (1998). Political-economy: A comparative approach. Westport, CT: Preager. In continental Europe, by contrast, Keynesian economics was rejected, with German thought dominated by the explicitly normative Freiburg school, whose political philosophy of ordoliberalism formed the intellectual basis of Germany's post-war social market economy. Within developing economies, which formed the majority of the world's population, various schools of development economics have been influential. In the 1970s, the consensus in macroeconomics collapsed as a result of the failure of the neoclassical synthesis to explain the phenomenon of stagflation: subsequent to this, two schools of thought in the field emerged: New Keynesianism and New classical macroeconomics. Both sought to rebuild macroeconomics using microfoundations- to explain macroeconomic phenomenon using microeconomics.https://www.nber.org/chapters/c11099Chapter 1. Snowdon, Brian and Vane, Howard R., (2005). Modern Macroeconomics: Its Origin, Development and Current State. Edward Elgar Publishing, Over the course of the 1980s and the 1990s, macroeconomists coalesced around a paradigm known as the new neoclassical synthesis, which combines elements of both New Keynesian and New classical macroeconomics, and forms the basis for the current consensus, which covers previously disputed areas of macroeconomics. The consensus built around this synthesis is characterised by an unprecedented agreement on methodological questions (such as the need to validate models econometrically); such agreement had, until the new synthesis, historically eluded macroeconomics- even during the neoclassical synthesis. The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 and the ensuing global economic crisis exposed modelling failures in the field of short-term macroeconomics, which was publicly confused with all of mainstream economics. = Term = The term \\"mainstream economics\\" came into use in the late 20th century. It appeared in 2001 edition of the seminal textbook Economics by Samuelson and NordhausPaul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus (2001), 17th ed., Economics on the inside back cover in the \\"Family Tree of Economics,\\" which depicts arrows into \\"Modern Mainstream Economics\\" from J.M. Keynes (1936) and neoclassical economics (1860‚Äì1910). The term \\"neoclassical synthesis\\" itself also first appears in the 1955 edition of Samuelson's textbook.Olivier Jean Blanchard (1987), \\"neoclassical synthesis,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 3, pp. 634‚Äì36.  Scope  Mainstream economics can be defined, as distinct from other schools of economics, by various criteria, notably by its assumptions, its methods, and its topics. It is however also useful to challenge this distinction in light of the mutation of mainstream economics. = Assumptions = While being long rejected by many heterodox schools, several assumptions used to underpin many mainstream economic models. These include the neoclassical assumptions of rational choice theory, a representative agent, and, often, rational expectations. However, much of modern economic mainstream modeling consists of exploring the effects that complicating factors have on models, such as imperfect and asymmetric information, bounded rationality, incomplete markets, imperfect competition, heterogenous agents https://www.nber.org/papers/w21897.pdf and transaction costs. Originally, the starting point of orthodox economic analysis was the individual. Individuals and firms were generally defined as units with a common goal: maximisation through rational behaviour. The only differences consisted of: * the specific objective of the maximisation (individuals tend to maximise utility and firms profit); * and the constraints faced in the process of maximisation (individuals might be constrained by limited income or commodity prices and firms might be constrained by technology or availability of inputs). From this (descriptive) theoretical framework, neoclassical economists like Alfred Marshall often derived - although not systematically - the political prescription that political action should not be used to solve the problems of the economic system. Instead, the solution ought to derive from an intervention on the above-mentioned maximisation objectives and constraints. It is in this context that economic capitalism finds its justification. Yet, mainstream economics now includes descriptive theories of market and government failure and private and public goods.These developments suggest a range of views on the desirability or otherwise of government intervention, from a more normative perspective.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2535453 = Methods = Additionally, some economic fields include elements of both mainstream economics and heterodox economics: for example, Austrian economics,A Companion to the History of Economic Thought (2003). Blackwell Publishing. p. 452 institutional economics, neuroeconomics and non-linear complexity theory. They may use neoclassical economics as a point of departure. At least one institutionalist has argued that \\"neoclassical economics no longer dominates a mainstream economics.\\" = Topics = Economics has been initially shaped as a discipline concerned with a range of issues revolving around money and wealth. However, in the 1930s, mainstream economics began to mutate into a science of human decision. In 1931, Lionel Robbins famously wrote \\"Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\\". This drew a line of demarcation between mainstream economics and other disciplines and schools studying the economy. The mainstream approach of economics as a science of decision-making contributed to enlarge the scope of the discipline. Economists like Gary Becker began to study seemingly distant fields as crime, the family, law, politics, and religion. This expansion is sometimes referred to as economic imperialism.

Bosnian pyramids claim Osmanagiƒá by the Visoƒçica hill in July 2019. In April 2005, Osmanagiƒá was invited to visit Visoƒçica and its fortress ruins. During the visit Osmanagiƒá noticed the pyramidal shape of Visoƒçica hill. He subsequently wrote a book promoting the claim that the hill was the remains of an ancient, man-made pyramid, which he claimed was one of five colossal stone structures in the shape of a pyramid with an extensive prehistoric tunnel network. He named those structures \\"Bosnian pyramids\\", and established a charitable foundation, the 'Archaeological Park: Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun Foundation', to fund the promotion and investigation of the site. Osmanagiƒá claimed that he wished to excavate in order to \\"break a cloud of negative energy, allowing the Earth to receive cosmic energy from the centre of the galaxy\\". In early 2006, geologists from the University of Tuzla analyzed core samples at Visoƒçica. Their tests showed that the hill is composed of the same material as other mountains in the area: alternating layers of conglomerate, clay and sandstone. Excavations revealed layers of fractured conglomerate at Visoƒçica, while those at Pljesevica uncovered cracked sandstone plates, separated by layers of silt and clay. Robert M. Schoch, associate professor of Natural Science at Boston University, said at the time, \\"What [Osmanagiƒá has] found isn't even unusual or spectacular from the geological point of view. It's completely straightforward and mundane.\\" In April 2006, twenty-one historians, geologists and archaeologists signed an open letter describing the excavations as amateurish and lacking proper scientific supervision. The 'Bosnian Pyramid' project is alleged to have done considerable damage to the archaeological heritage of the area, which contains ruins of a medieval capital, Roman observation post, and earlier remains. Anthony Harding, Professor of Archaeology at Exeter University and then-president of the European Association of Archeologists, said that, \\"Osmanagiƒá is conducting a pseudo- archaeological project that, disgracefully, threatens to destroy parts of Bosnia's real heritage.\\" Other claims Osmanagiƒá's theories and credibility have come under near-universal criticism from the scientific community since he gained prominence in marketing the excavations at Visoƒçica. He is interested in pyramids but is an amateur in their study. During this period, he has pursued graduate study at the University of Sarajevo, where his doctoral adviser was Hidajet Repovac, Professor of Sociology at Faculty of Political Science in Sarajevo. In his 2009 doctoral thesis, Osmanagiƒç claims that the Maya Civilization of Mesoamerica predates the Olmec, and that their culture mysteriously ceased to exist after the 10th century CE. He also discusses in some detail Mayan crystal skulls, positing that they were created with the use of advanced technology. He discusses the alleged psychological and parapsychological phenomena surrounding them.Osmanagiƒá's PhD thesis He suggests that the Maya had contact with the Chinese, giving as an example a jade carving of a jaguar, which he posits is carved from Chinese nephrite. Others have identified the material as jadeite, a material used by the Mayans. As early as 2007, Repovac was part of the Foundation set up by Osmanagiƒá to support excavations on the hills. Repovac also served as one of the co- chairmen of the 2008 International Conference on the (so-called) Bosnian Pyramids. In an article in Archaeology Magazine, Beth Kampschror refers to Osmanagiƒá's book, The World of the Maya (2004), which suggests that the Maya were descendants of aliens from the Pleiades by way of Atlantis. Osmanagiƒá wrote in his book, \\"Were perhaps those who were ready picked up in spaceships by their mentors from the Pleiades star cluster? Or perhaps they joined the Lords of the Galaxy and, in pods of light, set off on a journey with no return.\\"Kampschror, Beth. \\"Pyramid Scheme.\\" Archaeology. July/Aug 2006, Vol. 59 Issue 4, p22-28. Osmanagiƒá also wrote, > \\"It is my theory that the Maya should be considered watchmakers of the > cosmos whose mission it is to adjust the Earthly frequency and bring it into > accordance with the vibrations of our Sun;... Their ancestors, the > civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria, erected the first temples on energy > potent points of the Planet. Their most important function was to serve as a > gateway to other worlds and dimensions.\\" In his book Alternative History (2003, published in Bosnian), Osmanagiƒá suggests that Hitler and other leading Nazis escaped from Germany at the end of World War II to an underground base in Antarctica.

Population: History Soltsy, whose name owes to the nearby salt water springs, was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1390 and in the following played an important role as an intermediate station on the trade route connecting Novgorod and Pskov. In 1471, the Battle of Shelon between Muscovite forces led by Ivan III and the army of the Novgorod Republic took place near Soltsy, which marked the end of political independence of the Novgorod Republic. Soltsy eventually became a part of the Moscow State. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the territory was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, and in 1772, Pskov Governorate was established (existing between 1777 and 1796 as Pskov Viceroyalty). In 1776, Porkhovsky Uyezd was transferred from Novgorod Governorate to Pskov Governorate. Soltsy was the seat of Soletskaya Volost of Porkhovsky Uyezd. In August 1927, the uyezds were abolished and, effective October 1, 1927, Soletsky District was established, with the administrative center in Soltsy.Snytko et al., p. 85 Pskov Governorate was abolished as well and the district became a part of Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. At the same time, Soltsy was granted town status. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between July 13 to 16, 1941 and again from July 22, 1941 to February 21, 1944, Soltsy was occupied by German troops.Snytko et al., p. 135 On July 5, 1944, Soltsy, together with Soletsky District, was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Soltsy serves as the administrative center of Soletsky District.Law #559-OZ As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated within Soletsky District as the town of district significance of Soltsy.Resolution #121 As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Soltsy is incorporated within Soletsky Municipal District as Soletskoye Urban Settlement.Law #399-OZ Economy =Industry= The main branches of industry in Soltsy are electronic industry and food industry. =Transportation= The railway connecting St. Petersburg and Nevel via Dno crosses the district from north to south, running close to Soltsy. The railway connecting Bologoye and Pskov via Staraya Russa crosses the southern tip of the district; however, there are no significant stations on this line within the district's territory. The town is located along the Veliky Novgorod‚ÄìPskov highway and is also connected by road to Staraya Russa via Volot.

After attending the Frunze Military Academy in 1931‚Äì1934, he served in the Far East in 1935 and was afterwards assigned to the Auto-Armoured Tank Directorate in Moscow. During this period, he studied intensively the principles of modern armoured warfare, as developed by western theorists (Generals Von Kleist, Guderian, Fuller) as well as the doctrine of \\"Deep Operations\\" as theorized by Triandafillov and Tukhachevsky. His next assignments were as military attach√© in Poland (where he was the last military attach√©, leaving few days before the Soviet invasion) and China, before taking a post of lecturer in tactics at the Kazan tank school. Second World War Very surprisingly, and to his extreme frustration, Rybalko spent the first year of the war as a lecturer in Kazan. He finally got an operational assignment in May 1942 as deputy commander of the 3rd Tank Army of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. All through the war, Rybalko's name was closely associated with the 3rd Tank Army. In the winter of 1942‚Äì1943, included in the Voronezh Front, his Tank Army spearheaded the different operations that tried to exploit and transform the Germans' defeat in Stalingrad in a large-scale strategic victory in the southern theater of operations. This included Operation Star in February, aimed at the liberation of Kharkov ‚Äì one of the first major Soviet cities to be reconquered by the Red Army. But Manstein's counter-offensive recaptured the city and inflicted serious damages to an exhausted and over-extended 3rd Tank Army. Refitted and renamed 3rd Guards Tank Army, Rybalko's army played crucial roles in the strategic counter-offensives that followed the Battle of Kursk (Operation Kutuzov), in the recapture of Kiev (6 November 1943). The winter and spring of 1944 saw a succession of large operations aiming at the destruction of the southern wing of the Wehrmacht. These operations (Zhitomir- Berdichev in Dec 1943 ‚Äì Jan 1944, Proskurov-Chernivtsi in March‚ÄìApril 1944) succeeded at least in the complete liberation of Ukraine by the end of the summer. In these various operations, Rybalko showed impressive tactical and operational skills, particularly during the Lvov-Sandomierz Operation. Still in command of his 3rd Guards Tank Army, Rybalko took a major place in the various operations that were launched in North Ukraine, Galicia (summer 1944) and Silesia (late 1944 and winter 1945). Finally, as part of Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, Rybalko's army was one of the four Guards Tank armies engaged in the giant battle for Berlin. Immediately after the capture of Berlin Rybalko and his tank army were tasked with the assault on the city in the Prague offensive and on 9 May they liberated Prague. Post-war Following the war he became commander of the mechanized forces of Red Army. Rybalko emerged from the war as one of the most brilliant soviet tank commanders. He fully understood the nature of armoured warfare and mastered the operational aspects of armoured armies command. The Tashkent Higher Tank Command School is named after him.

The quizzes usually focus on puzzles, such as filling in blanks, identifying subjects, or other forms of word puzzles. The channels make money by encouraging viewers to call a toll phone number for the chance to play. The first dedicated quiz channel is considered to be Germany's 9Live, which launched on September 1, 2001. The best known example in the United Kingdom is Quiz TV (2004‚Äì2006), the first to launch in that country. Two major commercial television networks, ITV and Channel Four Television Corporation, through Ostrich Media launched ITV Play and Quiz Call respectively to capitalize on the phenomenon. There are a large amount of quiz channels, particularly on satellite television, with many clones of each other. They are most common at night, where many smaller channels close down and show the quiz channel content in return for a share of the revenue. Portugal also has a substantial amount of quiz programmes, especially on terrestrial channels (including public RTP), however in the daytime they are disguised as pimba-themed talk shows, with blatant phone-in cutaways and quiz participation. Due to a number of incidents where the fairness of quiz channels and shows came to the attention of the media and regulators in the UK, a number of broadcasters have switched to other types of participation television, focusing primarily on roulette but also bingo and other casino games as well as branching out into other forms of participation television, such as televised sex lines. Scandals in Britain Most of the major controversies involving participatory television have occurred in the United Kingdom, where these shows have been late-night staples on some channels. Quiz channels have received large number of complaints due to use of premium-rate telephone numbers, \\"impossible\\" questions and gambling. Often it is far from clear how it is possible to reach the suggested 'right' answer. Some people who are heavily involved in the quiz industry in the UK have complained about the standard and ambiguity of the questions used on the programme. Questions in some games, as an example, Quizmania's tower games are usually very easy and open ended, often with scores of possible answers, but only a handful of which win prizes. This means that the competition becomes less of a quiz and more like a game of chance. A Culture, Media and Sports select committee report suggested that the odds of a viewer getting through to the studio is up to 8,500 to one(free subscription required) and for an ITV Play show, 400 to one. Some estimates suggest that phone-in quizzes generate around ¬£50 million a year for broadcasters, making them a crucial source of income at a time of increasing pressure on advertising revenue. Ofcom proposed to class participation TV channels in the same way as teleshopping channels. This would give consumers more protection against fraudulent channels.Swinford, Steven. TV quiz sets callers a costly question by The Sunday Times, published September 24, 2006, retrieved September 24, 2006. According to an article in The Times, Ofcom was expected to receive an estimated 800 complaints about quiz channels in 2007, an increase from 450 in 2005.McLaren, Elsa. TV quiz shows accused of misleading viewers. Published by The Times on November 28, 2006. Accessed November 29, 2006. =Culture, media and sport select committee hearing= On November 28, 2006, an all-party Culture, Media and Sport select committee held a hearing into the concerns regarding the way that quiz channels operate. The broadcasting minister, Shaun Woodward said that no action would be taken on any of the quiz channel operators until the parties had reported their findings. The Gambling commission said they would look into British Sky Broadcasting's concerns over quiz channels that quiz channels are a form of gambling and should be regulated.Oatts, Joanne. Rival's quiz shows \\"illegal lotteries\\" . Published by Digital Spy on November 29, 2006. Accessed November 29, 2006. Nick Rust from BSkyB, said to the committee that quiz channels should be considered gambling.TV phone-in quizzes 'a lottery' . Publishes by BBC News on November 28, 2006. Accessed December 2, 2006 The committee heard evidence from Ofcom, the Citizens Advice Bureau, television executives and individuals. Points raised included the price of calls, whether the player got through or not. Jeff Henry, a director of ITV consumer said that one in four hundred players have a chance in getting through to The Mint programme. Jeff Henry also stated that by putting up details that there is a one in four hundred chance of winning, then \\"it would be out of date and we would be accused of misleading you.\\" Points also raised were the answers given for questions set, including an example from ITV Play programme Quizmania, where the obscure answers Rawlplugs and balaclava were given for a question on the contents of a woman's handbag, and examples of where callers were cut off from calling Quiz Call for forty minutes. The commission was also told that viewers are encouraged to call in but are not told that they only have a 0.5% chance of getting through. Shari Vahl, from BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme told the committee that one woman had spent ¬£1,500 on calls and suggested that programmes get 200 calls a minute, which makes getting through to the studio a slim chance. However, producers and operators of quiz shows and channels have stated that only a small minority of people have a problem with being addicted to calling shows and channels. Report findings On January 25, 2007, the select committee released its report into the participation television channel industry. The committee said that the channels should be classed as gambling and not a game of skill. The report made a few recommendations as to how the industry should be regulated. These include more transparency to viewers on the odds of getting through to the studio, including a recommendation of the odds of getting through being shown through an on-screen graphic. The report also said that questions should be verified by a third party before they can be broadcast. =BIG Game TV!= BIG Game TV! was the subject of a City of London Police investigation brought by the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours in May 2006 over allegations that receptionists were told to ignore all incoming calls for long periods of time while 150-200 calls per minute were clocked up at 75p a time.BIG Game TV - The Fraud Squad Raids by the BBC for the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, broadcast May 19, 2006, retrieved May 27, 2006.

The City of London Police said there would be no charges brought against the channel, following its investigation. =British Sky Broadcasting ‚Äì Quiz channels move on Sky Digital EPG= British Sky Broadcasting made an attempt to counter the problems somewhat by moving the EPG numbers of the channels on its Sky Digital service to the 840's section under the heading of \\"Gaming and Dating\\". Many of the quiz channels got around this by broadcasting on other channels, notably the general entertainment channels. =Gambling Commission Participation TV consultation= By law, only charities and Camelot are allowed to run lotteries. Any prize competitions in newspapers, magazines and television shows have to be \\"games of skill\\". In an effort to crack down on unofficial lotteries the Government is insisting that television phone-in quizzes become harder since it claims they are otherwise games of chance. In August 2006, the Gambling Commission in the United Kingdom started a consultation regarding the way that participation television operate. The consultation is designed to clear up the confusion between prize competitions, free draws and lotteries, ahead of the Gambling Act 2005, which came into force in September 2007. If the consultation shows that participation TV shows and channels operate more like lotteries rather than games of skill, they could be required by law to give 20% of their revenue to charity.Views sought on free draws and prize competitions published by the Gambling Commission, issued on August 3, 2006, retrieved August 13, 2006.Webdale, Jonathan.

Under the new Gambling Act, the Gambling Commission will have the power to prosecute broadcasters if it believes they are persistently flouting the law by running illegal lotteries. \\"There are already rules, but what the Gambling Act does is introduce a better definition so that the rules are enforceable\\", said a spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. \\"At the moment the rules are not clear enough to prevent these kinds of quizzes where the questions are ridiculously easy in order to maximise the number of entrants\\". =ICSTIS= The United Kingdom premium phone regulator, ICSTIS has reported an increase in complaints about quiz shows and channels. A BBC News article stated that \\"nearly 10% of all enquiries about premium rate services received by ICSTIS between September and November last year were specifically regarding television contests\\". On October 10, 2006, ICSTIS announced that it would be investigating participation television channels after complaints it received from the public into concerns that players are paying too much to enter the quizzes by phone. ICSTIS also said that it wanted callers to know how much each call would cost them and the odds of winning any prize. ICSTIS raised concern that players were unaware that they would be charged for each call regardless of whether the player got through to the studio or not.TV quiz calls face charges probe by BBC News, published October 10, 2006, retrieved October 10, 2006. On March 9, 2007 in the wake of a number of technical problems and controversies over premium rate phone-ins on television shows and quiz channels, ICSTIS warned television companies that any illegal operating would be investigated by the police. ICSTIS also announced measures to bring in licensing to restore public confidence in competitions. =ITV Play= Criticisms about Quizmania, The Mint and other, similar phone-in quiz shows and television channels have been levelled by various groups of people. Some people who are heavily involved in the quiz industry in the UK have complained about the standard and ambiguity of the questions used on the programme. Questions in the tower games (see above) are usually very easy and open ended, often with scores of possible answers, but only a handful of which win prizes. This means that the competition becomes less of a quiz and more like a game of chance. Organisations such as the Gambling Commission have expressed concerns that Quizmania and similar programmes encourage gambling. HM Treasury are currently examining the regulations surrounding phone-in quiz shows. Phone-in game shows are scrutinised by Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator and ICSTIS, who regulate premium rate phone numbers in the UK; both organisations have received complaints from viewers about phone-in game shows. An article on the BBC website noted that \\"ICSTIS - the organisation that regulates premium rate telephone services in the UK - had acknowledged that the growth in the number of puzzle channels has been \\"matched by an increase in complaints about them\\". According to this article, \\"nearly 10% of all enquiries about premium rate services received by Icstis between September and November last year were specifically regarding television contests\\". Despite the criticisms, Quizmania became the first live and interactive quizshow to broadcast on analogue terrestrial television. =Quiz Call= In a Sunday Times article published on September 24, Quiz Call admitted that it had taken calls at 75p a call without any chance of the callers getting through for a chance to win and Quiz Call apologised for using its own staff members to pose as winners. Channel 4 have since sold off Quiz Call due to increasing levels of bad reputation from the channel. In the Culture, Media and Sport committee held on November 28, 2006 representatives from Quiz Call admitted that one instance of people being put on hold did occur and that the producer responsible no longer works for Ostrich Media. =2007 television phone-in scandals = In 2007, a series of scandals broke out involving allegations of phone-in segments of television programmes and quiz channels conning viewers. Richard & Judy on Channel 4 were accused of encouraging viewers to enter the 'You Say We Pay' segment after the winner had been picked. The competition was indefinitely suspended soon afterwards and was later cancelled permanently. Channel 4 Racing was also affected after a software glitch allowed callers to enter a competition even though the competition had ended. ITV suspended all programmes involving premium rate phone-ins on 5 March 2007, including its quiz channel ITV Play. This was to allow independent auditor Deloitte to conduct a review of the fairness of revenue-generating phone-ins in programmes carried by ITV including Dancing on Ice and The X Factor. ITV Play was taken off the air during the review, but for a few days it ran a limited after midnight service for only four hours before on March 13, ITV announced that ITV Play had been permanently closed down. Five followed suit when they were alleged to have displayed the name of a fictional winner on BrainTeaser after they failed to find a genuine winner. Five was later fined ¬£300,000 by Ofcom - the highest ever amount from the broadcasting watchdog. The BBC was also affected by these scandals. Saturday Kitchen on BBC One were accused of encouraging viewers to phone in to a pre-recorded programme. On 14 March 2007 the BBC children's programme Blue Peter was revealed to have used a girl who was visiting the studio to pose as a caller live on the show. The BBC stated that a technical error prevented 14,000 callers from getting a chance to win in the competition. Konnie Huq apologised over the phone-in problem on the March 14 airing of the show. On 20 March 2007 it was revealed that 11,500 votes for the Dancing on Ice final three days earlier on ITV were lost as they were not delivered to Vodafone until the following Monday morning. On 23 April 2007, a BBC Panorama investigation disclosed that callers to GMTV's phone-in competitions may have been defrauded out of millions of pounds, because the telephone system operator, Opera Interactive Technology, had determined the winners before the phone lines had closed. GMTV responded by suspending the phone-in quizzes, but claimed that \\"it was confident it had not breached regulators' codes\\". Opera Interactive also denied any wrongdoing.\\"Viewers 'lose millions' to GMTV\\" , BBC News, 23 April 2007. Accessed 2007-04-23.

This process is generally caused by both isolation from speakers of the first language (\\"L1\\") and the acquisition and use of a second language (\\"L2\\"), which interferes with the correct production and comprehension of the first. Such interference from a second language is likely experienced to some extent by all bilinguals, but is most evident among speakers for whom a language other than their first has started to play an important, if not dominant, role in everyday life; these speakers are more likely to experience language attrition.K√∂pke, Barbara., Schimd, Monika (2007) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/Laboratoire de Neuropsycholinguistique, Universit√© de Toulouse, Le Mirail, France \\"Bilingualism and Attrition\\" It is common among immigrants that travel to countries where languages foreign to them are used. There are several factors which affect the process. Frequent exposure and use of a particular language is often assumed adequate to maintain the native language system intact. However, research has often failed to confirm this prediction.Schimd, Monika (2008) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands \\"Defining Language Attrition\\" A positive attitude towards the potentially attriting language or its speech community and motivation to retain the language are other factors which may reduce attrition. These factors are too difficult to confirm by research.Dusseldorp, Elise., Schimd, Monika (2010) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/TNO, Quality of Life & Leiden University, The Netherlands \\"Quantitative analyses in a multivariate study of language attrition: The impact of extralinguistic factors\\" However, a person's age can well predict the likelihood of attrition; children are demonstrably more likely to lose their first language than adults.K√∂pke & Schmid 2004 Schmid, M. S., K√∂pke, B., Keijzer, M., & Weilemar, L. (Eds.). (2004). First language attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues (Vol. 28). John Benjamins Publishing. These factors are similar to those that affect second-language acquisition and the two processes are sometimes compared. However, the overall impact of these factors is far less than that for second language acquisition. Language attrition results in a decrease of language proficiency. The current consensus is that it manifests itself first and most noticeably in speakers' vocabulary (in their lexical access and their mental lexicon),Schmid, M. S., K√∂pke, B., Keijzer, M., & Weilemar, L. (Eds.). (2004). First language attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues (Vol. 28). John Benjamins Publishing. while grammatical and especially phonological representations appear more stable among speakers who emigrated after puberty. Study The term first language attrition (FLA) refers to the gradual decline in native language proficiency. As speakers use their L2 frequently and become proficient (or even dominant) in it, some aspects of the L1 can deteriorate or become subject to L2 influence. The study of language attrition became a subfield of linguistics with a 1980 conference at the University of Pennsylvania called \\"Loss of Language Skills\\".Lambert, Richard D., Freed, Barbara F.. 1982. The Loss of language skills. The University of California The aim of the conference was to discuss areas of second language attrition and to discuss ideas for possible future research. The conference revealed that attrition is a wide topic, with numerous factors and taking many forms. Decades later, the field of first language attrition gained new momentum with two conferences held in Amsterdam in 2002 and 2005, as well as a series of graduate workshops and panels at international conferences, such as the International Symposium on Bilingualism (2007, 2009), the annual conferences of the European Second Language Association, and the AILA World Congress (2008). The outcomes of some of these meetings were later published in edited volumes. To study the process of language attrition, researchers initially looked at neighboring areas of linguistics to identify which parts of the L1 system attrite first; lacking years of direct experimental data, linguists studied language contact, creolization, L2 acquisition, and aphasia, and applied their findings to language acquisition. One issue that is faced when researching attrition is distinguishing between normal L2 influence on the L1 and actual attrition of the L1. Since all bilinguals experience some degree of cross linguistic influence, where the L2 interferes with the retrieval of the speaker's L1, it is difficult to determine if delays and/or mistakes in the L1 are due to attrition or caused by CLI. Also, simultaneous bilinguals may not have a language that is indistinguishable from that of a native speaker or a language where their knowledge of it is less extensive than a native speaker's; therefore testing for attrition is difficult. Manifestations =Lexical attrition= The first linguistic system to be affected by first language attrition is the lexicon. The lexical-semantic relationship usually starts to deteriorate first and most quickly, driven by Cross Linguistic Interference (CLI) from the speaker's L2, and it is believed to be exacerbated by continued exposure to, and frequent use of, the L2. Evidence for such interlanguage effects can be seen in a study by Pavlenko (2003, 2004) which shows that there was some semantic extension from the L2, which was English, into the L1 Russian speakers' lexicons. In order to test for lexical attrition, researchers used tests such as picture naming tasks, where they place a picture of an item in front of the participant and ask them to name it, or by measuring lexical diversity in the speaker's spontaneous speech (speech that is unprompted and improvised). In both cases, attriters performed worse than non- attriters.Ammerlaan, T. (1996). \\"You get a bit wobbly...\\": exploring bilingual lexical retrieval processes in the context of first language attrition. Nijmegen, Netherlands: S.n.Hulsen, M. (2000). Language loss and language processing: three generations of Dutch migrants in New Zealand. S.l.: S.n One hypothesis suggests that when a speaker tries to access a lexical item from their L1 they are also competing with the translation equivalents of their L2 and that there is either a problem with activating the L1 due to infrequent use or with the inhibition of the competing L2. =Grammatical attrition= Grammatical attrition can be defined as \\"the disintegration of the structure of a first language (L1) in contact situations with a second language (L2)\\".Seliger, H. W., & Vago, R. M. (1991). First language attrition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. In a study of bilingual Swedes raised outside of Sweden, who in their late twenties returned to their home country for schooling, there was noted to be attrition of their L1. The participants demonstrated a complete retention of the underlying syntactic structure of their L1. Notably, they exhibited the V2, verb second, word order present in most Germanic languages, except English. This rule requires the tense-marked verb of a main clause to occur in the second position of the sentence, even if that means it comes before the subject (e.g. there is an adverb at the beginning of the sentence). These speakers' ability to form sentences with V2 word order was compared against L2 learners who often overproduce the rigid SVO word order rather than applying the V2 rule. Although the study did not show evidence for attrition of syntax of the person's L1, there was evidence for attrition in the expatriates' morphology, especially in terms of agreement. They found that the bilinguals would choose to use the unmarked morphemes in place of the marked one when having to differentiate between gender and plurality; also they tend to overgeneralize where certain morphemes can be used. For example, they may use the suffix /-a/, which is used to express an indefinite plural, and overextend this morpheme to also represent the indefinite singular. There is little evidence to support the view that there is a complete restructuring of the language systems. That is, even under language attrition the syntax is largely unaffected and any variability observed is thought to be due to interference from another language, rather than attrition.Tsimpli, I., Sorace, A., Heycock, C., & Filiaci, F. (2004). First language attrition and syntactic subjects: a study of Greek and Italian near-native speakers of English\\" International Journal of Bilingualism 8(3), 257-277. Retrieved from http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~antonell/TsimpliSoraceHeycockFiliaci2004.pdf L1 attriters, like L2 learners, may use language differently from native speakers. In particular, they can have variability on certain rules which native speakers apply deterministically.Sorace, A. 2005. \\"Selective optionality in language development\\". In: Cornips, L. & Corrigan, K. P., (eds.), Syntax and Variation: reconciling the biological and the social, pp. 55‚Äì80 Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins. In the context of attrition, however, there is strong evidence that this optionality is not indicative of any underlying representational deficits: the same individuals do not appear to encounter recurring problems with the same kinds of grammatical phenomena in different speech situations or on different tasks. This suggests that problems of L1 attriters are due to momentary conflicts between the two linguistic systems and not indicative of a structural change to underlying linguistic knowledge (that is, to an emerging representational deficit of any kind). This assumption is in line with a range of investigations of L1 attrition which argue that this process may affect interface phenomena (e.g. the distribution of overt and null subjects in pro-drop languages) but will not touch the narrow syntax.Montrul, S. 2004. \\"Convergent outcomes in L2 acquisition and L1 loss\\". In: Schmid, M. S., K√∂pke, B., Keijzer, M. & Weilemar, L. (eds.), First Language Attrition: interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues (pp. 259‚Äì279). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.Montrul, S. 2008. Incomplete Acquisition in Bilingualism: re-examining the age factor. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. =Phonological attrition= Phonological attrition is a form of language loss that affects the speaker's ability to produce their native language with their native accent. A study of five native speakers of American English who moved to Brazil and learned Portuguese as their L2 demonstrates the possibility that one could lose one's L1 accent in place of an accent that is directly influenced by the L2. It is thought that phonological loss can occur to those who are closer to native-like fluency in the L2, especially in terms of phonological production, and for those who have immersed themselves and built a connection to the culture of the country for the L2. A sociolinguistic approach to this phenomenon is that the acquisition of a native-like L2 accent and the subsequent loss of one's native accent is influenced by the societal norms of the country and the speakers' attempt to adapt in order to feel a part of the culture they are trying to assimilate into. This type of attrition is not to be confused with contact-induced change since that would mean speech production changes due to an increased use of another language and not due to the less frequent use of the L1. Studies and hypotheses Lambert and MooreLambert, R. D. & Moore, S. J. (1986). \\"Problem Areas in the Study of Language Attrition\\". In: Weltens, B., de Bot, K. & van Els, T. (eds.), Language Attrition in Progress, Studies on Language Acquisition (p. 177 ‚Äì p. 186). Dordrecht, NL: Foris Publications. attempted to define numerous hypotheses regarding the nature of language loss, crossed with various aspects of language. They envisioned a test to be given to American State Department employees that would include four linguistic categories (syntax, morphology, lexicon, and phonology) and three skill areas (reading, listening, and speaking). A translation component would feature on a sub- section of each skill area tested. The test was to include linguistic features that are the most difficult, according to teachers, for students to master. Such a test may confound testing what was not acquired with what was lost. Lambert, in personal communication with K√∂pke and Schmid, described the results as 'not substantial enough to help much in the development of the new field of language skill attrition'. The use of translation tests to study language loss is inappropriate for a number of reasons: it is questionable what such tests measure; too much variation; the difference between attriters and bilinguals is complex; activating two languages at once may cause interference. YoshitomiYoshitomi, A. (1992). \\"Towards a Model of Language Attrition: neurological and psychological contributions\\". In: Issues in Applied Linguistics; Vol 3, No 2: 293-318. attempted to define a model of language attrition that was related to neurological and psychological aspects of language learning and unlearning. She discussed four possible hypotheses and five key aspects related to acquisition and attrition. The hypotheses are: * 1. Reverse order: last learned, first forgotten. Studies by RussellRussell, Robert (1999). \\"Lexical maintenance and attrition in Japanese as a second language\\". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts (p. 114 ‚Äì p. 141). Oxford: Oxford University Press. and HayashiHayashi, Brenda (1999). \\"Testing the regression hypotheis: the remains of the Japanese negation system in Micronesia\\". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.). Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts (p. 154 ‚Äì p. 168). Oxford: Oxford University Press both looked at the Japanese negation system and both found that attrition was the reverse order of acquisition. Yoshitomi and others, including Yukawa,Yukawa, E. (1998). L1 Japanese Attrition and Regaining: three case studies of two early bilingual children. Tokyo: Kurosio Publishers argue that attrition can occur so rapidly, it is impossible to determine the order of loss. * 2. Inverse relation: better learned, better retained. Language items that are acquired first also happen to be those that are most reinforced. As a result, hypotheses 1 and 2 capture the main linguistic characteristics of language attrition * 3. Critical period: at or around age 9. As a child grows, he becomes less able to master native-like abilities. Furthermore, various linguistic features (for example phonology or syntax) may have different stages or age limits for mastering. Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire \\"native-like-ness\\", but that there is no cut-off point in particular. Furthermore, they discuss a number of cases where a native-like L2 was acquired during adulthood. * 4. Affect: motivation and attitude. According to Yoshitomi, the five key aspects related to attrition are neuroplasticity, consolidation, permastore/savings, decreased accessibility, and receptive versus productive abilities. = The regression hypothesis = The regression hypothesis, first formulated by Roman Jakobson in 1941 and originally formulated on the phonology of only Slavic languages,De Bot (1991) De Bot, K., & Weltens, B. (1991). Recapitulation, regression, and language loss. First language attrition, 31-51. goes back to the beginnings of psychology and psychoanalysis. It states that which was learned first will be retained last, both in 'normal' processes of forgetting and in pathological conditions such as aphasia or dementia. As a template for language attrition, the regression hypothesis has long seemed an attractive paradigm. However, regression is not in itself a theoretical or explanatory framework. Both order of acquisition and order of attrition need to be put into the larger context of linguistic theory in order to gain explanatory adequacy. Keijzer (2007) conducted a study on the attrition of Dutch in Anglophone Canada. She finds some evidence that later-learned rules, such as diminutive and plural formation, indeed erode before earlier learned grammatical rules. However, there is also considerable interaction between the first and second language and so a straightforward 'regression pattern' cannot be observed. Also, parallels in noun and verb phrase morphology could be present because of the nature of the tests or because of avoidance by the participants. In a follow up 2010 article, Keijzer suggests that the regression hypothesis may be more applicable to morphology than to syntax. Citing the studies on the regression hypothesis that have been done, Yukawa says that the results have been contradictory. It is possible that attrition is a case-by-case situation depending on a number of variables (age, proficiency,& literacy, the similarities between the L1 and L2, and whether the L1 or the L2 is attriting). The threshold hypothesis states that there may be a level of proficiency that once attained, enables the attriting language to remain stable.  Factors  =Age effect= Children are more susceptible to (first) language attrition than adults. Research shows an age effect around the ages of 8 through 13. Before this time period, a first language can attrite under certain circumstances, the most prominent being a sudden decline in exposure to the first language. Various case studies show that children who emigrate before puberty and have little to no exposure to their first language end up losing the first language. In 2009, a study compared two groups of Swedish-speaking groups: native Swedish speakers and Korean international adoptees who were at risk for losing their Korean. Of the Korean adoptees, those who were adopted the earliest essentially lost their Korean and those adopted later still retained some of it, although it was primarily their comprehension of Korean that was spared. A 2007 study looked at Korean adoptees in France and found that they performed on par with native French speakers in French proficiency and Korean.Pallier 2007 Pallier, C. (2007). Critical periods in language acquisition and language attrition. Language attrition: Theoretical perspectives, 155-168. Attrition of a first language does not guarantee an advantage in learning a second language. Attriters are outperformed by native speakers of the second language in proficiency. A 2009 study tested the Swedish proficiency of Swedish speakers who had attrited knowledge of Spanish. These participants did show almost but not quite native-like proficiency when compared to native Swedish speakers, and they did not show an advantage when compared with bilingual Swedish- Spanish speakers. On the other hand, L1 attrition may also occur if the overall effort to maintain the first language is insufficient while exposed to a dominant L2 environment. Another recent investigation, focusing on the development of language in late bilinguals (i.e. adults past puberty), has claimed that maintenance of the mother tongue in an L1 environment requires little to no maintenance for individuals, whereas those in the L2 environment have an additive requirement for the maintenance of the L1 and the development of the L2 (Optiz, 2013). There have been cases in which adults have undergone first language attrition. A 2011 study tested adult monolingual English speakers, adult monolingual Russian speakers and adult bilingual English- Russian speakers on naming various liquid containers (cup, glass, mug, etc.) in both English and Russian. The results showed that the bilinguals had attrited Russian vocabulary because they did not label these liquid containers the same way as the monolingual Russian speakers. When grouped according to Age of Acquisition (AoA) of English, the bilinguals showed an effect of AoA (or perhaps the length of exposure to the L2) in that bilinguals with earlier AoA (mean AoA 3.4 years) exhibited much stronger attrition than bilinguals with later AoA (mean AoA 22.8 years). That is, the individuals with earlier AoA were the more different from monolingual Russian speakers in their labeling and categorization of drinking vessels, than the people with later AoA. However, even the late AoA bilinguals exhibited some degree of attrition in that they labeled the drinking vessels differently from native monolingual Russian-speaking adults.  Critical period hypothesis  Given that exposure to an L2 at a younger age typically leads to stronger attrition of the L1 than L2 exposure at later ages, there may be a relationship between language attrition and the critical period hypothesis. The critical period for language claims that there is an optimal time period for humans to acquire language, and after this time language acquisition is more difficult (though not impossible). Language attrition also seems to have a time period; before around age 12, a first language is most susceptible to attrition if there is reduced exposure to that language. Research shows that the complete attrition of a language would occur before the critical period ends. All available evidence on the age effect for L1 attrition, therefore, indicates that the development of susceptibility displays a curved, not a linear, function. This suggests that in native language learning there is indeed a Critical Period effect, and that full development of native language capacities necessitates exposure to L1 input for the entire duration of this CP. L2 attrition In Hansen & Reetz-Kurashige (1999), Hansen cites her own research on L2-Hindi and Urdu attrition in young children. As young pre-school children in India and Pakistan, the subjects of her study were often judged to be native speakers of Hindi or Urdu; their mother was far less proficient. On return visits to their home country, the United States, both children appeared to lose all their L2 while the mother noticed no decline in her own L2 abilities. Twenty years later, those same young children as adults comprehend not a word from recordings of their own animated conversations in Hindi-Urdu; the mother still understands much of them. Yamamoto (2001) found a link between age and bilinguality. In fact, a number of factors are at play in bilingual families. In her study, bicultural families that maintained only one language, the minority language, in the household, were able to raise bilingual, bicultural children without fail. Families that adopted the one parent ‚Äì one language policy were able to raise bilingual children at first but when the children joined the dominant language school system, there was a 50% chance that children would lose their minority language abilities. In families that had more than one child, the older child was most likely to retain two languages, if it was at all possible. Younger siblings in families with more than two other brothers and sisters had little chance of maintaining or ever becoming bilingual. = Age of arrival = There are few principled and systematic investigations of FLA specifically investigating the impact of AoA. However, converging evidence suggests an age effect on FLA which is much stronger and more clearly delineated than the effects that have been found in SLA research. Two studies that consider prepuberty and postpuberty migrants (Ammerlaan, 1996, AoA 0‚Äì29 yrs; Pelc, 2001, AoA 8‚Äì32 years) find that AoA is one of the most important predictors of ultimate proficiency, and a number of studies that investigate the impact of age among postpuberty migrants fail to find any effect at all (K√∂pke, 1999, AoA 14‚Äì36 yrs; Schmid, 2002, AoA 12‚Äì29 yrs; Schmid, 2007, AoA 17‚Äì51 yrs). A range of studies conducted by Montrul on Spanish heritage speakers in the US as well as Spanish-English bilinguals with varying levels of AoA also suggests that the L1 system of early bilinguals may be similar to that of L2 speakers, while later learners pattern with monolinguals in their L1 (e.g. Montrul, 2008; Montrul, 2009). These findings therefore indicate strongly that early (prepuberty) and late (postpuberty) exposure to an L2 environment have a different impact on possible fossilization and/or deterioration of the linguistic system. =Frequency of use= Frequency of use has been shown to be an important factor in language attrition. Decline in use of a given language leads to gradual loss of that language. In the face of much evidence to the contrary, one study is often cited to suggest that frequency of use does not correlate strongly with language attrition. Their methodology, however, can be called into question, especially concerning the small sample size and the reliance on self reported data. The researchers themselves state that their findings may be inaccurate. The overall evidence suggests that frequency of use is a strong indicator of language attrition. =Motivation= Motivation could be defined as the willingness and desire to learn a second language, or, in the case of attrition, the incentive to maintain a language. Motivation can be split into four categories, but it is often simply split into two distinct forms: the instrumental and the integrative. Instrumental motivation, in the case of attrition, is the desire to maintain a language in order to complete a specific goal, i.e. maintaining a language to maintain a job. Integrative motivation, however, is motivation that comes from a desire to fit in or maintain one's cultural ties. These inferences can be drawn, as strategies for knowledge maintenance will, by definition, precisely oppose actions that lead to forgetting. There are differences in attrition related to motivation depending on the type at hand. Instrumental motivation is often less potent than integrative motivation, but, given sufficient incentives, it can be equally as powerful. A 1972 study by Gardner and Lambert emphasized the importance of integrative motivation in particular in regards to factors relating to language acquisition, and, by extension, language attrition.

(See that article for historical formulations.) It states that the dynamics of a physical system are determined by a variational problem for a functional based on a single function, the Lagrangian, which contains all physical information concerning the system and the forces acting on it. The variational problem is equivalent to and allows for the derivation of the differential equations of motion of the physical system. Although formulated originally for classical mechanics, Hamilton's principle also applies to classical fields such as the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, and plays an important role in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and criticality theories. configuration space (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (Œ¥S = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (Œ¥q). Mathematical formulation Hamilton's principle states that the true evolution q(t) of a system described by N generalized coordinates q = (q1, q2, ..., qN) between two specified states q1 = q(t1) and q2 = q(t2) at two specified times t1 and t2 is a stationary point (a point where the variation is zero) of the action functional : \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{q}] \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\\\\mathbf{q}(t),\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}(t),t)\\\\, dt where L(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}},t) is the Lagrangian function for the system.

The action \\\\mathcal{S} is a functional, i.e., something that takes as its input a function and returns a single number, a scalar.

Let q(t) represent the true evolution of the system between two specified states q1 = q(t1) and q2 = q(t2) at two specified times t1 and t2, and let Œµ(t) be a small perturbation that is zero at the endpoints of the trajectory : \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon(t_1) = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon(t_2) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ 0 To first order in the perturbation Œµ(t), the change in the action functional \\\\delta\\\\mathcal{S} would be : \\\\delta \\\\mathcal{S} = \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\\\; \\\\left[ L(\\\\mathbf{q}+\\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon,\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}} +\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}})- L(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}) \\\\right]dt = \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\\\; \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}} + \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}} \\\\right)\\\\,dt where we have expanded the Lagrangian L to first order in the perturbation Œµ(t).

This requirement can be satisfied if and only if \\\\- \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}} = 0 border=2 border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA}} These equations are called the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations for the variational problem. =Canonical momenta and constants of motion= The conjugate momentum pk for a generalized coordinate qk is defined by the equation :p_k \\\\ \\\\overset{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_k}. An important special case of the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation occurs when L does not contain a generalized coordinate qk explicitly, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q_k}=0 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_k} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\frac{d p_k}{dt} = 0 \\\\,, that is, the conjugate momentum is a constant of the motion. In such cases, the coordinate qk is called a cyclic coordinate. For example, if we use polar coordinates t, r, Œ∏ to describe the planar motion of a particle, and if L does not depend on Œ∏, the conjugate momentum is the conserved angular momentum. =Example: Free particle in polar coordinates= Trivial examples help to appreciate the use of the action principle via the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations. A free particle (mass m and velocity v) in Euclidean space moves in a straight line. Using the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations, this can be shown in polar coordinates as follows. In the absence of a potential, the Lagrangian is simply equal to the kinetic energy : L = \\\\frac{1}{2} mv^2= \\\\frac{1}{2}m \\\\left( \\\\dot{x}^2 + \\\\dot{y}^2 \\\\right) in orthonormal (x,y) coordinates, where the dot represents differentiation with respect to the curve parameter (usually the time, t). Therefore, upon application of the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations, : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{x}} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\qquad m\\\\ddot{x} = 0 And likewise for y. Thus the Euler‚ÄìLagrange formulation can be used to derive Newton's laws. In polar coordinates (r, œÜ) the kinetic energy and hence the Lagrangian becomes : L = \\\\frac{1}{2}m \\\\left( \\\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}^2 \\\\right). The radial r and œÜ components of the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations become, respectively :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{r}} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial r} = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\qquad \\\\ddot{r} - r\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}^2 = 0 :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}} \\\\right)-\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi} = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\qquad \\\\ddot{\\\\varphi} + \\\\frac{2}{r}\\\\dot{r}\\\\dot{\\\\varphi} = 0. The solution of these two equations is given by : r = \\\\sqrt{(a t + b)^2 + c^2} : \\\\varphi = \\\\tan^{-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{a t + b}{c} \\\\right) + d for a set of constants a, b, c, d determined by initial conditions. Thus, indeed, the solution is a straight line given in polar coordinates: a is the velocity, c is the distance of the closest approach to the origin, and d is the angle of motion. Applied to deformable bodies Hamilton's principle is an important variational principle in elastodynamics. As opposed to a system composed of rigid bodies, deformable bodies have an infinite number of degrees of freedom and occupy continuous regions of space; consequently, the state of the system is described by using continuous functions of space and time. The extended Hamilton Principle for such bodies is given by : \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\\\left[ \\\\delta W_e + \\\\delta T - \\\\delta U \\\\right]dt = 0 where T is the kinetic energy, U is the elastic energy, We is the work done by external loads on the body, and t1, t2 the initial and final times. If the system is conservative, the work done by external forces may be derived from a scalar potential V. In this case, : \\\\delta \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\\\left[ T - (U + V) \\\\right]dt = 0. This is called Hamilton's principle and it is invariant under coordinate transformations. Comparison with Maupertuis' principle Hamilton's principle and Maupertuis' principle are occasionally confused and both have been called (incorrectly) the principle of least action. They differ in three important ways: * their definition of the action... :Maupertuis' principle uses an integral over the generalized coordinates known as the abbreviated action or reduced action ::\\\\mathcal{S}_{0} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{q} :where p = (p1, p2, ..., pN) are the conjugate momenta defined above. By contrast, Hamilton's principle uses \\\\mathcal{S}, the integral of the Lagrangian over time. *the solution that they determine... :Hamilton's principle determines the trajectory q(t) as a function of time, whereas Maupertuis' principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinates. For example, Maupertuis' principle determines the shape of the ellipse on which a particle moves under the influence of an inverse-square central force such as gravity, but does not describe per se how the particle moves along that trajectory. (However, this time parameterization may be determined from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculations using the conservation of energy). By contrast, Hamilton's principle directly specifies the motion along the ellipse as a function of time. *...and the constraints on the variation. :Maupertuis' principle requires that the two endpoint states q1 and q2 be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory (same energy for each trajectory). This forces the endpoint times to be varied as well. By contrast, Hamilton's principle does not require the conservation of energy, but does require that the endpoint times t1 and t2 be specified as well as the endpoint states q1 and q2. Action principle for fields =Classical field theory= The action principle can be extended to obtain the equations of motion for fields, such as the electromagnetic field or gravity. The Einstein equation utilizes the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action as constrained by a variational principle. The path of a body in a gravitational field (i.e. free fall in space time, a so-called geodesic) can be found using the action principle. =Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory= In quantum mechanics, the system does not follow a single path whose action is stationary, but the behavior of the system depends on all imaginable paths and the value of their action. The action corresponding to the various paths is used to calculate the path integral, that gives the probability amplitudes of the various outcomes. Although equivalent in classical mechanics with Newton's laws, the action principle is better suited for generalizations and plays an important role in modern physics. Indeed, this principle is one of the great generalizations in physical science. In particular, it is fully appreciated and best understood within quantum mechanics. Richard Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is based on a stationary-action principle, using path integrals. Maxwell's equations can be derived as conditions of stationary action.

Early life Watts was born in the village of Sallins, County Kildare Ireland to Charles Watts and his wife Margaret (n√©e Boyse). He had seven brothers who, like him, all joined the army as commissioned officers; five of them (including him) reached the rank of captain. His education was completed by 1802, and thereafter he worked for a short time at a bank in Dublin, and then in a firm of architects for approximately 18 months.  Military commission On 24 July 1804 he was commissioned into the army as an ensign in the 64th Regiment of Foot, which was at that time stationed in the West Indies. In 1805 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and transferred to the 46th Regiment. During January and February 1810 he was involved in the action which, on 4 February 1810, took the island of Guadeloupe from the French. He returned to England with the 46th Regiment in 1811, where they were assigned garrison duty on Jersey until 16 June 1812; they were then on duty on the Isle of Wight until August 1813. New South Wales =Aide-de-camp= In August 1813 the 46th Regiment was ordered to proceed to the colony of New South Wales to relieve the 73rd Regiment of Foot which, under the leadership of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, had forcibly deported their predecessors, the corrupt New South Wales Corps. The 46th Regiment travelled in three ships, Windham and General Hewitt, departing England on 23 August 1813, and followed three months later by Three Bees. Watts travelled on Windham, and arrived in Sydney on 11 February 1814. On 3 June 1814 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, and became a family friend to Macquarie and his wife Elizabeth. Watts supported Governor Macquarie's attempts to integrate emancipists into free society, however this was resisted by many free settlers and members of the military, including Watts' own commanding officer Colonel George Molle, of the 46th Regiment. Governor Macquarie wrote to Lord Bathurst (Secretary of State for War and the Colonies) and the Duke of York (the second son of King George III) criticising the insubordinate behaviour of the various military officers who refused to attend civil functions which were attended by emancipists. Macquarie also listed the names of loyal and well-behaved officers in his letters, which included the name of his aide-de-camp, John Watts. Watts lived with the Macquaries for five years, and was warmly regarded by them as one of the family. =Architect= National Trust of Australia headquarters Observatory Hill, Sydney. Old Government House, Parramatta. The Governor was a prolific builder and, as the colony had a serious shortage of architects and engineers, he soon made use of Watts' architectural skills, asking him to design a new military hospital to be built on what is now called Observatory Hill in Sydney. This building later functioned as Fort Street High School from at 1849 to 1975, and today is the headquarters of the New South Wales branch of the National Trust of Australia. The inner-core of this building remains behind the later Victorian facade. Watts' successful completion of his first assignment led to more, many of which were based around the new inland settlement of Parramatta. In 1815-16 he worked on the repair and enhancement of Government House at Parramatta. He also designed a hospital at Parramatta 1817‚Äì18, a military barrackshttp://www.lancers.org.au/site/Lancer_Barracks_Detailed_History.asp 1818-20, added two steeples to St John's Church at Parramatta 1818‚Äì19, worked on repairs to the road and bridges between Sydney and Parramatta, and the construction of a dam across the Parramatta River in 1818. Mrs Macquarie considered the improved water supply to Parramatta to be Watts' greatest achievement, as up to that time Parramatta had tended to suffer from a lack of drinking water in summer.http://www.lancers.org.au/site/Lancer_Barracks_Detailed_History.asp#architect He worked closely with Mrs Elizabeth Macquarie on the modifications to St John's Church and Government House at Parramatta, and is listed as one of those who accompanied the Macquaries on their tours to Bathurst in 1815, and to the Cowpastures area (in the vicinity of modern Camden)http://www.stonequarry.com.au/towns/theoaks.html in the same year. =Departure= When Governor Macquarie's illegitimate nephew, the rakish Hector Macquarie arrived in New South Wales on 14 April 1818, Watts offered to relinquish his position, to allow Hector Macquarie to become the Governor's new aide-de-camp. This offer was rejected by Lachlan Macquarie, who encouraged Watts to write to England to seek promotion. After eight months with no reply, Watts resigned as aide-de-camp, and the Governor granted his request for a two-year leave of absence from his regiment and duty, so that he could travel to England to follow up on his letter. The Governor publicly gave Watts his \\"best thanks\\" for his \\"architectural services and Taste\\", in an announcement in the Sydney Gazette, published on 2 January 1819. After putting in some hurried work on the Parramatta military barracks, which were still under construction, Watts sailed for England on 1 April 1819, on the transport ship Shipley. Macquarie gave him official despatches to deliver, as well as various personal presents for certain members of the Royal Family and also the Secretary of State, Lord Bathurst. Britain After his arrival in Britain, Watts was promoted to the rank of captain in Macquarie's old regiment, the 73rd Foot, on 24 February 1820. At that time the regiment was stationed in Ceylon, and not due to return to England until the following year. What he did during this period is unknown. In 1822, Governor Macquarie returned from Australia and, after securing seven weeks' leave from his returned regiment, Watts went to visit the Macquaries, meeting them in Glasgow on 2 September 1822. During his stay in Scotland, Watts fell in love with Elizabeth Macquarie's niece, Jane Campbell, and made a proposal of marriage. They were married on 16 January 1823, although the Macquaries were away on an eight- month tour of Europe at the time. Watts resigned his commission in the army in 1824, and settled down to married life in Campbeltown, Scotland, where he and his wife Jane raised a family of seven children. During this thirteen-year period, he made periodic trips to visit his parents living in Dublin, and eventually moved his family there in 1837. In 1834, while still living in Campbeltown, he sought an official position in Van Diemen's Land and wrote to Elizabeth Macquarie, asking if she would write a letter to the Home Secretary Henry Goulburn in support of his request. Although she did assist Watts, he was unsuccessful. =South Australia= In 1840, Watts decided to emigrate to the colony of South Australia, where his brother Henry was Postmaster General. He and his family left the port of Greenock Scotland, on 17 September 1840 on the ship John Cooper. They arrived in Port Adelaide, South Australia, on 8 March 1841. He was appointed Postmaster General for South Australia on 1 April 1841 in his brother's place, and held the position for 20 years. They lived at the corner of King William Street and North Terrace, later the site of the Bank of New South Wales. He was one of the original trustees of the Savings Bank of South Australia. Their eldest daughter, Margaret Elizabeth, married Charles Hervey Bagot's son Christopher; their son, John Bagot, married Lucy Ayers, daughter of Sir Henry. Their youngest daughter, Jane, married B. T. Solly, Private Secretary to the Governor of Tasmania. He retired on 29 June 1861 and was succeeded by James William Lewis, then in 1870 the Post Office was amalgamated with the Telegraph Office and Charles Todd was appointed as its head. He was an active member of the Aborigines' Friends' Association. Captain Watts died at the Bagot home \\"Nurney House\\" between Kingston Terrace and Stanley Street, North Adelaide in 1873, aged almost 87 years.

Michaelides was born in Lefkoniko, a village in the Famagusta District of Cyprus, between 1849 and 1853. In 1862 he moved to Nicosia to attend Secondary School. His first contact with the arts came in the form of religious icons in the archbishopric in Nicosia, where he trained as an artist. He subsequently moved to the Diocese of Larnaca where concentrated on painting in the care of his uncle. In 1873 he published his first poems \\"Usury\\" () and \\"Nightingales and Owls\\" () and in 1875 he moved to Naples, Italy for further studies in painting. Michaelides left Italy in 1877 and went to Greece where he enlisted as a volunteer in the Greek army and fought for the liberation of Thessaly. With the end of Ottoman rule of Cyprus in 1878, he returned to Limassol, Cyprus, staying at the local premises of the Diocese of Larnaca. There he began to write for the local newspaper \\"Alithia\\" ( \\"Truth\\"). Michaelides wrote several poems in Katharevousa, Dhimotiki and the Cypriot Dialect. His first poetry collection, \\"The Weak Lyre\\" (), was published in 1882. In 1884 he was appointed to work as a nurse thereby securing an income, room and board. He then began to write for the newspaper \\"Salpinga\\"( \\"Clarion\\"). In 1888 he began the publication of the satirical magazine \\"Diavolos\\" ( \\"Devil\\"). In 1883 he wrote \\"The Fairy\\" (), followed by his most famous work \\"The 9th of July 1821\\" (), a poem written in the Cypriot dialect detailing the events leading to the execution of the Greek Cypriot leadership, including Archbishop Kyprianos, by the Ottoman rulers of the time. : :::--from ·ºôŒΩŒΩŒ¨œÑŒ∑ ·º∏ŒøœÖŒªŒØŒøœÖ, ŒíŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒúŒπœáŒ±Œ∑ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ The \\"9th of July\\" was followed by \\"The Woman From Chios\\" ().

In 2008 it had 13,800 inhabitants. It is from Lecce, in the Salento ‚Äì the historic Terra d'Otranto. History Probably the name Monteroni comes from Latin Mons Tyronum, meaning \\"mount of the spear-men\\" and hinting its origin as a training camp for the Roman legions. In fact originally the Romans apparently established a military stronghold on the hill nowadays called San Filii. From this era of romanisation of the region, coins and other archaeological material has been found and studied. During the Norman period, the fiefdom of Monteroni was part of the County of Lecce. In 1250 Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (and also sovereign of the Kingdom of Sicily) granted the fiefdom to the De Cremona family, followed in this feudal office by the Montoroni family who held it until the 16th century. The Montoroni built the first Baronial Palace in the town in the original shape of a small fortress. When the fief passed onto the Duke of Spongano, the Baronial Palace was enlarged and gained the current Leccese Baroque style. Monteroni di Lecce owes the baroque period also its bell tower and the two chapels, which were in the central square (currently ‚ÄúPiazza I. Falconieri‚Äù) on the site currently occupied by the major church ‚ÄúChiesa Matrice‚Äù. Feudalism in the south of Italy was abolished with the events following the French Revolution when also the Kingdom of Naples became a republic and then a Napoleonic kingdom. Since then it was the ‚ÄúMunicipality of Monteroni di Lecce‚Äù which took over and carried on the sorts of the fief of Monteroni.

He served as the Chief Director and the head of global operations for Mossad from 1963 to 1968, before entering into politics and holding two ministerial positions. He was also widely regarded as the most successful intelligence officer and a leading political figure for Israel. Biography Amit was born in Tiberias as Meir Slutsky during the Mandate era, cousin of the Russian poet, Boris Slutsky. He later adopted the name Amit which means \\"colleague\\" in Hebrew and was called Meir Amit Slutsky. At a young age, he joined kibbutz Alonim in the lower Galilee and enlisted in the Haganah. He fought for the Haganah during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He remained in the military and rose through the ranks to become a major general. During his military career he came to be regarded as a prot√©g√© of Moshe Dayan. In the late 1950s Amit studied at Columbia Business School in New York City, earning an MBA degree. After returning to Israel, Amit entered the Israeli intelligence community, first as a major general at the head of IDF Intelligence in 1961, and then as Mossad Director in 1963. He was the only figure in Israel's history to hold the position of Mossad chief and head of military intelligence at the same time. As Director, he orchestrated some of the Mossad's greatest successes, including the spy Eli Cohen who penetrated the highest levels of the Syrian government. It was also during his time that the Mossad engineered the defection of an Assyrian Iraqi pilot who flew the then new Mig-21 from Iraq to Israel. Amit is particularly known for his success in expanding Israel's human intelligence (HUMINT), especially in the Arab world. During the lead up to the Six-Day War in 1967, Amit had a network of informants that permeated the entire Egyptian military, providing key details for Israel's pre-emptive strike on Egyptian air bases and subsequent ground offensive. Meir Amit Slutsky also built strong personal relationships within the CIA and was a very close ally of the Americans, he was deployed on several special projects with the CIA across the globe and brought many people to justice with his creative techniques of espionage. One of the most notable examples was in the mid 1980s when he personally recruited and help train what turned out to be one of Mossad's most successful agents. The recruit was an American from a southern Illinois town near St. Louis, Missouri. He met Amit after transferring from Kansas University to Columbia University in New York. His code name was Ranan, and under Amit's mentoring the nineteen-year-old American became the youngest team leader of its most prolific Kidon unit, Israel's elite espionage and assassination outfit. Following his retirement from the Mossad, he continued to be an active voice in the intelligence community and did work for the Israeli government. Following the lead of other former generals, Amit joined the Democratic Movement for Change party, and was elected to the Knesset in the 1977 elections. He was appointed Minister of Transportation and Minister of Communications in Menachem Begin's government, but resigned both posts on 15 September 1978 after the Democratic Movement for Change broke up. Amit subsequently joined Shinui, before defecting to the Alignment (The Israeli labor party) in 1980. He lost his seat in the 1981 elections. He was later the chairman of Israel's Center for Special Studies, and in 2003, was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State. Upon news of his death in July 2009, Israeli President Shimon Peres stated: > \\"Entire Generations owe Meir Amit Slutsky a debt of gratitude for his > immense contribution to Mossad and the defense community, a large part which > remains secret now in building the strength and deterrence of Israel. He was > a natural leader, whom people trusted, and at the same time he was a > visionary for the state. We are proud to have a personality of his stature > born in our country \\" References * Oren, Michael B. Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East.

She is best known for having funded the construction of the Mahim causeway in Mumbai (Bombay), which serves today as an important link between the island city of Mumbai with its north-western suburbs. Personal life Avabai was born the daughter of Framji Batlivala, a Parsi merchant from Daman who carried out a trade in bottles in the Fort area of downtown Mumbai (Bombay). The family belonged to the Parsi community. As per Indian custom of that era, Avabai was wed at age 10 to the 20-year-old Jamshetjee, who had lost both his parents at a young age and was then venturing his first foray into commerce under the tutelage of Avabai's father. Jamshetjee was Avabai's first cousin, being the son of Framji's sister Jeevibai. The couple enjoyed a marriage of great felicity and were the parents of seven sons and three daughters; however, four sons and two daughters succumbed to the dangers that plagued infancy in the 19th century. As a merchant, Jamshetjee enjoyed success far beyond his expectations and accumulated a vast fortune; by some estimates, he was worth a stupendous two crore (twenty million) rupees by age 40. Both he and Avabai were unstinting in their philanthropic efforts and are credited with funding as many as 126 different public charities. In recognition of these services to the public good, Jamshetjee was conferred a knighthood in 1842 and Avabai become Lady Jeejeebhoy. Subsequently, in 1857, a baronetcy was conferred upon Jamshetjee. Mahim causeway Before 1845, there was no connection by land between the present-day Mumbai neighbourhoods of Mahim and Bandra; people had to be ferried across the Mahim Creek. This was dangerous during the monsoons, when the seas around Mumbai are extremely rough; people sometimes lost their lives merely in crossing between Mahim and Bandra on the ferries. The passage of carriages and other vehicles was impossible and separate arrangements for conveyance had to be made on either side. The government deliberated upon the matter, estimated the required expense as being one lakh rupees, and made it known that paucity of funds precluded the expenditure of what was then a vast sum of money. Avabai, perhaps by personal experience, well knew the importance to local residents of building the causeway, and resolved upon seeing the needful done. She arranged with the government to have the causeway constructed by them at her expense. As the daughter of Framji, who had funded Jamshetjee's early mercantile ventures and received a share of the proceeds, Avabai was a lady of independent means. She stipulated that given the circumstances of the causeway's construction, no toll should ever be charged by the government for its use. Construction of the Mahim causeway began in 1841 and was completed in 1845. The estimated cost of construction was far exceeded, and finally amounted to Rs. 1,57,000/-, all of which was paid out of money donated to the treasury by Avabai from her personal funds. The causeway bears a dedication to Lady Avabai Jeejeebhoy in four languages.

Their music incorporates styles such as death metal, industrial metal, and some traces of gypsy jazz. History D√•√•th was started by Eyal Levi and Mike Kameron, who had been playing in bands since they were in middle school. The two friends attended Berklee College of Music in Boston but eventually left school to concentrate full-time on making money. The band was originally known as Dirt Nap before the name change in 2004. D√•√•th's first album, Futility, was self- released in 2004. Their Roadrunner Records debut, The Hinderers, was released in March 2007. D√•√•th have so far released two music videos from The Hinderers, the first being \\"Festival Mass Soulform,\\" which was created prior to getting signed, and helped them gain Roadrunner's interest. The second video, \\"Subterfuge,\\" was released in February 2007. In March 2007, D√•√•th was confirmed to play the second stage (rotating slots) at Ozzfest. On October 22, 2007, blabbermouth.net reported that live singer Sean Farber had left the band. A few months later, on February 28, 2008, blabbermouth.net then reported that Sean Z. (who had filled in after Sean Farber had left) had been named the new singer. Apparently, Mike Kameron is also no longer in D√•√•th, as his name is not mentioned on the official D√•√•th Myspace page anymore. 2007 also consisted of more notable tours for D√•√•th. In January they toured the US with Job For a Cowboy, The Acacia Strain, and Psyopus. In the spring there was a European run with Unearth and Job for a Cowboy. That summer featured not only Ozzfest, but Summer Slaughter dates, a Dying Fetus tour, and various Devildriver offdates. Later on that fall D√•√•th toured the US and Canada with Dark Funeral and Naglfar. To end the album cycle, D√•√•th performed three shows in Japan with Zyklon. The band's third album The Concealers was released on April 21, 2009 by Century Media Records via a partnership with Roadrunner Records. D√•√•th released one music video from \\"The Concealers\\" which was for the song \\"Day Of Endless Light.\\" There was a good bit of touring behind \\"The Concealers\\" as well. Spring of 2009 featured a full US tour with Dragonforce and Cynic. Summer was the full US and Canada with Goatwhore and Abigail Williams. That fall D√•√•th returned to Europe with Chimaira, Unearth, and Throwdown. During the break between the final tour for \\"The Concealers\\" album cycle and the writing sessions for the upcoming D√•√•th album, guitarists Eyal Levi, and Emil Werstler released an instrumental CD entitled \\"Avalanche of Worms.\\" It was released April 20, 2010, via Magna Carta Records under the artist name Levi/Werstler. Sean Reinert from Cynic (ex Death) played the drums on it. D√•√•th released their fourth studio album in October 2010 via Century Media Records. In 2011 it was revealed that Emil Werstler, and Sean Zatorsky would be filling the vacant Bass and Keyboard/Vocal (respectively) duties for Chimaira. In 2012 it was revealed that Emil Werstler is officially the new lead guitarist for Chimaira as well as Jeremy Creamer filling the Bass duties in Chimaira left vacant by Werstler's promotion.

In 2007, as part of a \\"reverse product placement\\" marketing campaign for The Simpsons Movie, real life versions of a number of Simpsons products were sold in 7-Eleven stores. Real cans of Buzz Cola, boxes of Krusty-O's cereal, Squishees, and a special edition (#711) of the Radioactive Man Comic were all sold in stores alongside other The Simpsons merchandise. Buzz Cola Buzz Cola is a brand of cola, and an officially licensed product of Twentieth Century Fox. Its slogan is \\"twice the sugar, twice the caffeine\\". The slogan is a parody of the former Jolt Cola slogan \\"all the sugar and twice the caffeine\\". A prior slogan used was \\"There's a little boogie in every bottle (can)\\". Sometimes Buzz Cola is used for making a statement of the advertising industry. In \\"E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)\\" (season 11, 1999) the Simpson family is at the movies watching the ads. Here they watch an Allied Forces soldier storm the Normandy beaches and charge a German. The German falls to the ground dead and the Allied soldier reaches for a can of Buzz Cola in his belt pocket. A voice over then says \\"Buzz Cola: The taste you kill for!\\" and then the German comes alive again to say \\"Available in ze lobby\\". Jonathan Grey writes in his book Watching With The Simpsons that \\"the cola ad, for instance, scorns the proclivity of ads to use any gimmick to grasp attention, regardless of ethics\\".Gray, pp. 1-2 Although a general parody of popular cola drinks, parallels can be observed between Buzz Cola and Pepsi. For example, many of the mock television commercials that appear for Buzz Cola on The Simpsons follow the same youth-oriented approach of real Pepsi commercials. In another example, Homer gets his arm stuck in a vending machine selling \\"Crystal Buzz Cola\\", a parody of Crystal Pepsi. In the episode Dude, Where's My Ranch?, Maggie Simpson dances in her crib with her midriff exposed while a Britney Spears tune plays in the background and produces a can of Buzz Cola at the end of her small dance, parodying the Pepsi advertising done by Spears in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There is also a \\"Buzz Cola with Lemon\\" version of the product, with the slogan \\"damn, that's a lemony cola\\". In addition, in a later episode, there was an old ad for Buzz Cola, stating that it has the \\"rejuvenating power of cocaine\\" in it. In the video game The Simpsons: Hit & Run, aliens Kang and Kodos use a \\"new and improved\\" Buzz Cola formula to brainwash the citizens of Springfield into performing stupid stunts for their reality TV show, Foolish Earthlings. They also dump it into the town's water supply, which reanimates the dead and creates zombies. In July 2007, 7-Eleven rebranded some stores to look like Kwik-E-Marts in select cities to promote The Simpsons Movie. Real cans of Buzz Cola were available at those locations, as well as most other 7-Elevens throughout the United States and Canada. The soda in these cans was produced by the Cott Corporation, which also makes RC Cola outside the United States. Buzz Cola first appeared in the 1984 movie Surf II. Duff Beer Duff Beer With its loud-mouthed corporate spokesperson Duffman, Duff Beer is a parody of stereotypical American beer: cheap, mass- produced, poor-quality and heavily advertised. It is Homer's favorite beer and sold in all the bars of Springfield. Its slogan is \\"Can't get enough of that wonderful Duff\\". The chief competitor of Duff Beer is Fudd Beer, which is intentionally spelled with a parallel swapping of the consonants. Homer became aware of Fudd Beer while patronizing a \\"redneck bar\\" in nearby Spittle County. It was later revealed to be considered very popular in Springfield's rival town of Shelbyville. Moe said he thought it had been banned \\"after all those hillbillies went blind\\", suggesting methanol poisoning. Lion Nathan, an Australian brewery, started to brew their own ‚ÄòDuff‚Äô in the mid-1990s. 20th Century Fox sued, and only a few cans were produced. In the process, the beer became a collectors‚Äô item, with one case selling for $US13,000. Duff Beer was not sold at 7-Eleven because the promoters wanted to have \\"good, responsible fun.\\" However, a Duff Energy Drink was released in place of the Duff Beer. Krusty-O's Krusty-O's is a brand of breakfast cereal endorsed by Krusty the Clown which prominently features his likeness on the box. The real KrustyO's, sold by 7 Eleven, were produced by the Malt-O-Meal corporation. Krusty-Brand Cereal is the catalyst for the episode \\"'Round Springfield\\", when Bart swallows a \\"jagged metal Krusty-O\\" included in the box as a premium and is sent to the hospital. Later in the episode when Krusty holds a press conference to show that swallowing the jagged metal Krusty-O is not dangerous, he immediately begins to gag before he is informed he swallowed a \\"regular\\" Krusty-O, which he claims must be \\"poison\\". At the end of the episode, another box of Krusty-O's is shown with the promotion: \\"Flesh-Eating Bacteria In Every Box!\\". The current cost of a box of frosty Krusty-O's is $6.66 according to the cash register in the opening credits of season 16. Radioactive Man Radioactive Man #1 Radioactive Man is within the show a long-running superhero comic book series featuring Radioactive Man and his sidekick, Fallout Boy. According to one episode, there are 1,000 issues of the comic book. In the real world, Bongo Comics has produced a smaller number of issues of Radioactive Man. Radioactive Man is one of the four 'premiere' series released by Bongo Comics in late 1993. The series has been released in two volumes, an early run from 1993‚Äì1994, and the current run that has been published since 2000. Smaller Radioactive Man stories have also been published in Simpsons Comics. As a tie-in promotion of The Simpsons Movie a special \\"Radioactive Man Comic Book Edition #711\\" was sold at 7-Elevens as part of their Kwik-E-Mart promotion. Within the Bongo Comics, Radioactive Man is secretly Claude Kane III, a millionaire playboy whose personality was well-intentioned, but bumbling and not overly bright. In addition (which became a recurring storyline element), Claude's personality was permanently stuck in a conservative 1950s outlook on everything, no matter what the time era in question was. A running gag is that in order to preserve his secret identity, Claude is constantly wearing various types of hats, in order to conceal the lightning bolt-shaped shrapnel sticking out of his head. Issue #1 of the Bongo comic differs from Radioactive Man #1 as seen in The Simpsons episode \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\". While featuring a similar scenario and accident (Claude getting his trousers caught on barbed wire just before a mega-bomb explodes is a parody of Bruce Banner getting caught by the Gamma Bomb in the Incredible Hulk #1), the Bongo series' Claude was not wearing tattered clothes. In the comic book, Claude's survival is due in part to a large thunderbolt-shaped shard of metal embedded in his head by the explosion. Claude would attempt to remove the bolt throughout the book series, but each attempt has nasty consequences which results in it being put back in his scalp again. Additionally, the bolt's presence would save his life numerous times in increasingly bizarre ways. Maintaining the satirical standards of the television show, these comics often parody genre comic books, and the reader can follow the evolution of Radioactive Man from a 1950s irradiated hero through the politically reactionary or radical years of the 1960s and 1970s, and the dark, troubled years of the 1980s and 1990s comic book hero. Indeed, one comic displays a startling similarity to Alan Moore's Watchmen, with Radioactive Man taking the part of state-supported hero Doctor Manhattan. The comics are published as if they were the actual Simpsons universe's Radioactive Man comics; a \\"1970s\\"-published comic features a letter written by a ten-year-old Marge Bouvier, for instance. The comic also takes the idea that the title has been running since the 1950s and each issue of the real series is a random issue from that run. So one issue might be issue #357, the next #432 and the next #34, etc. Squishee Squishee (sometimes spelled Squishy or Squishie) is a frozen slushie from The Simpsons TV series, usually purchased at the fictional Kwik-E-Mart which is managed by Apu. It is an apparent reference to 7-Eleven's Slurpee. In the thirteenth-season episode \\"The Sweetest Apu\\", Apu has the Squishee machine replaced with one of a similar drink called the \\"Smooshie,\\" whose flavors reportedly include \\"shopping bag\\" and \\"dog fur\\". The fictional version of Squishees are reputed for being dangerous to health ‚Äî Squishee flavorings have, if ingested in sufficient quantities, hallucinogenic properties. According to the Simpsons comic, Squishees allegedly contain no natural ingredients (not even pure water), create dangerous cases of brain freeze, and are even described as \\"a thick, gloopy, tooth-rotting mixture of crushed ice and syrup\\". Flavors include: blue, red, lime green, Chutney, Wheatgrass, Champagne, cherry, and the Twenty-One Syrup Salute. Bart and Milhouse on one occasion went on a \\"Squishee bender\\" after drinking a squishee that was made entirely from syrup. Many other random flavors appear in the comics, including Chinese New Year, Plum, Raita and the black-colored \\"Squish of Death\\" (which causes spontaneous vomiting), which actually turned out to be just a mixture of the red and blue flavors. In 2007 as part of the Kwik-E-Mart promotion for The Simpsons Movie, Slurpees at 7-Elevens were renamed \\"Squishees\\" and sold in special collector cups. Tomacco Tomacco was originally a fictional plant that was a hybrid between tomatoes and tobacco, from a 1999 episode of The Simpsons titled \\"E-I- E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)\\". The method used to create the tomacco in the episode is fictional. In the episode, the tomacco was accidentally created by Homer when he planted and fertilized his tomato and tobacco fields with plutonium. The result is a tomato that apparently has a dried, brown tobacco center, and, although being described as tasting terrible by many characters, is also immediately and powerfully addictive. The creation is promptly labeled \\"tomacco\\" by Homer and sold in large quantities to unsuspecting passersby. A cigarette company, Laramie Tobacco Co., seeing the opportunity to legally sell their products to children, offers to buy the rights to market tomacco, but Homer demands one thousand times as much money as they wish to pay him, and the company withdraws. Eventually, all of the tomacco plants are eaten by farm animals ‚Äî except for the one remaining plant, which later goes down in an explosive helicopter crash with the cigarette company's lawyers. The process of making tomacco was first revealed in a 1959 Scientific American article, which stated that nicotine could be found in the tomato plant after grafting. Due to the academic and industrial importance of this breakthrough process, this article was reprinted in a 1968 Scientific American compilation.Bio- Organic Chemistry, on page 170. A Simpsons fan, Rob Baur of Lake Oswego, Oregon, was inspired by the episode. Remembering the article in a textbook, Baur cultivated a tomacco in 2003 by grafting together tobacco and tomato plants. The plant produced fruit that looked like a normal tomato, but Baur suspected that it contained a lethal amount of nicotine and thus would be inedible. Testing later proved that the leaves of the plant contained some nicotine, though a sample from the fruit was unable to be examined by the same laboratory. Both plants are members of the same family, Solanaceae or nightshade. The tomacco plant bore tomaccoes until it died after 18 months, spending one winter indoors. Baur was featured on the \\"E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)\\" audio commentary in the Simpsons Season 11 DVD box set discussing the plant and resulting fame. The 2004 convention of the American Dialect Society named tomacco as the new word \\"least likely to succeed.\\"Summary of \\"Among the New Words\\", American Speech, Volume 79, Number 2, Summer 2004. Tomacco was a wordspy.com \\"Word of the Day\\".Word Spy - tomacco Tomacco juice is shown with Marge's other groceries in the new opening theme. Also, there is a tomacco field in The Simpsons: Hit and Run. The tomacco plant is also part of the Simpsons app Tapped Out and can be chosen to plant and grow on Cletus' farm.

The federal organization has its office located in Berlin and is represented by its president Hubert Weiger. There are 2,200 local groups and, like Germany itself, the BUND is divided into 16 state organisations. There are up to 20 working parties specialised such as in law, water, waste, health, forest, energy, and gene technology; everyone can participate. The working parties often include renowned scientist and participate in official parliament hearings, comment on new laws and develop ecologic concepts. Moreover, the expert knowledge is widely spread through workshops and brochures. All members of the BUND under the age of 27 are automatically members of the youth organisation BUNDjugend. The BUND logo symbolises the earth as a green ball held by two protecting hands.  History  Meat Atlas introduces facts and figures about meat production and consumption The BUND was founded on 20 July 1975, as a federation of already existing regional groups. The BUND's co- founders were Horst Stern, Bernhard Grzimek, Herbert Gruhl, Enoch zu Guttenberg, Hubert Weinzierl and 16 others including Bodo Manstein and Gerhard Thielcke. The original name ‚ÄûBund f√ºr Natur- und Umweltschutz Deutschland (BNUD)‚Äú was changed in 1977 for better readability. In 1989 the BUND became a member of Friends of the Earth International. In 1990 five Associations were founded in East Germany. BUND was founding member of the Berlin Energy Table which successfully pushed for a Referendum on the recommunalization of energy supply in Berlin in 2013. The referendum however failed to obtain a sufficient number of yes votes despite a strong majority amongst those that did vote.
