He also edited and shot the special effects for Terry Gilliam's films Brazil and Time Bandits. Early years Doyle was born in London from an Irish father, Bob Doyle, and an Asturian mother. His father fought for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. He schooled at Haverstock School and left to join Nobel Prize winner Prof. Peter Medawar's team as a junior technician at University College London. He completed his Bachelor of Science at the University of London before going to the London Film School. Career Doyle has directed the films Love Potion (1987), about a drug rehabilitation centre, and Chemical Wedding (2008), an occult thriller starring Simon Callow which he wrote with Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson. He has also written Twilight of the Gods, a play about the relationship between Wagner and Nietzsche which was performed at the Edinburgh Festival. In 2013, he later adapted the play into a film which he both wrote and directed. He has also directed music videos, including those for Kate Bush's \\"Cloudbusting\\" and Iron Maiden's hit \\"Can I Play with Madness\\". He has written two books - Chemical Wedding, a novel that expands on the film, and The Life of (Brian) Jesus, which compares the Monty Python film with the actual Biblical events and comes to the conclusion that this is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. Doyle also appeared in the Monty Python film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, playing the police sergeant who abruptly ends the film by breaking the camera.

Buhlig was born in Chicago to a German immigrant father from Saxony, the baker Moritz Buhlig, and his wife Louise. He received early lessons from August Hyllested, Wilhelm Middelschulte and Margaret Cameron, who had studied with the legendary Teodor Leszetycki. In 1897, 16-year-old Buhlig moved to Vienna to study with Teodor Leszetycki himself. Upon completing his studies in 1900, he gave his first public concert in 1901 in Berlin, and toured extensively in Europe until late 1906. He lived in Berlin until May 1916, where he tutored pupils privately, among others Grete Sultan and Grete Trakl, the sister of the Austrian poet Georg Trakl.Extensive information on Buhlig's artistic views and his relationship with Grete Trakl in Bax 2014. In 1907 Buhlig made his first mature American debut, with the Philadelphia Orchestra in New York City. In 1918 Buhlig joined the staff of the Juilliard School (then called \\"Institute of Musical Art\\") in New York as a piano teacher: he gave recitals of Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Schubert and Schumann (with emphasis on Beethoven).Olmstead 1999, 50. However, he soon left the position and went to Europe again. Some years later he returned to the US and settled in Los Angeles, dividing his time between teaching and performing. He died in Los Angeles. As a pianist, Buhlig was highly regarded for his performances of Bach (particularly the two piano transcription of The Art of Fugue he made and performed), late Beethoven and Brahms.Hopkins, Grove. However, much of his repertoire was contemporary or near-contemporary music. He gave the American premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's Op. 11 and performed pieces by other European modernists such as Ferruccio Busoni, B√©la Bart√≥k, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and Claude Debussy. He also played music by new composers: Ruth Crawford and Adolf Weiss among others.Tick 1997, 63. In the 1920s he began playing Henry Cowell (whom he also taught) and his circle. In early 1930s Buhlig tutored John Cage: it was he who advised Cage to study with Schoenberg. The German pianist Grete Sultan, mentor to Christian Wolff and friend to Cage (whom she had met in 1946 through Buhlig), had studied under Buhlig in early 1900s - they became lifelong friends.Bredow 2012.

It was originally published by Tong Li Comics in Taiwan and has been translated into several languages, including English.

It was Chen's first full-length manhua. Volume 1 included a short story entitled \\"99 Roses\\", and volume 2 included \\"Peggy\\" and \\"The Funeral Procession of Stars\\", all originally published in Star Girls in its March, May, and July 1999 issues, respectively. The collected volumes were soon thereafter published in South Korea, China, and Hong Kong. At Anime Expo in June 2007, Tokyopop announced it had licensed The Other Side of the Mirror for release in English. In December 2007, Tokyopop published volume one of the series, and in April 2008, volume two. Translation was provided by J.Y. Standaert with an adaptation by Kereth Cowe-Spigai, and the cover featured praise from Joss Whedon. The release included the short stories included with the original Taiwanese volumes, plus an interview and sketches by Chen. Chen promoted the release at the 2007 New York Anime Festival and Anime USA 2007, an event to which she will return in 2008. In 2008, the series was also published in Italian by JPOP.

The station was located from Oslo West Station (Oslo V) along what was initially the Drammen Line and now is the Sk√∏yen‚ÄìFilipstad Line. Skarpsno was a local station served by the Oslo Commuter Rail and featured an island platform on an elevated segment. The station opened on 15 May 1882, ten years after the Drammen Line was taken into use. It received a new station building and platform in 1917, designed by Eivind Gleditsch. The station was manned until 1968. The Oslo Tunnel opened in 1980, rerouting most traffic away from Oslo V. Both stations closed on 28 May 1989 and the station was demolished in 1993. For a while it had a ferry services to Bygd√∏y. History The plans from 1868 for the Drammen Line called for it to run along Frognerkilen to Pipervika, where it would terminate at Oslo West Station. A consequence of this was that the line would run straight through a fashionable residential area. For the residents, this caused the railway to hinder access to the waterfront, although they were permitted access through level crossings with gates. The Drammen Line opened on 7 October 1872, but Skarpsno Station was not opened until 15 May 1882. During the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition a branch line was built from Skarpsno to Frogner, which carried a mixture of trains and trams. The ferry in front of the station in 1924 The line from Sandvika to Oslo was substantially upgraded between 1917 and 1922. The freight handling was moved from Oslo V to Filipstad and on 26 January 1916 a separate railway line opened from Skarpsno to there. Like many of the stations on the section, Skarpsno was rebuilt as an elevated railway. The tracks were raised, allowing the level crossings to be removed and the roads to run through underpasses. This involved the station being rebuilt so it received an island platform. Eivind Gleditsch at NSB Arktitektkontor designed a new station building, which opened in 1917. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at Skarpsno and standard gauge traffic was carried out on the northern track. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All‚Äìstandard gauge operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. Electric traction started operation on 30 August 1922. An interlocking system was installed in 1924. From 13 December 1965 Skarpsno Station was remotely controlled from the signal box at Oslo V, and it was no longer manned by a train dispatcher. Ticket sales continued until they were terminated on 1 March 1968. Following the construction of the Oslo Tunnel, which opened on 1 June 1980, services to Oslo V were reduced. Skarpsno was, along with Oslo V, the only station on the old part of the Drammen Line, which was renamed the Sk√∏yen‚ÄìFilipstad Line. Oslo West Station terminated services on 28 May 1989 and so did Skarpsno on the same day. The station building was demolished in 1993. Facilities Skarpsno Station was located from Oslo West Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The station had an island platform accessible from below, as it was located on a segment of elevated railway. The station building, designed by Eivind Gleditsc, was in Baroque Revival architecture. Skarpsno Station was situated south of the neighbourhood of Skarpsno, between it and Frognerkilen. Traditionally located on the Drammen Line, that line is now part of the Sk√∏yen‚ÄìFilipstad Line. Service Skarpsno was served by Oslo Commuter Rail trains. From 1922 they operated with a half-hour headway to Oslo West Station. Until 1962 there was an electric ferry service from Skarpsno, which operated across the fjord to Oscarshall on Bygd√∏y.

It starts with eighth notes, changes to triplets, and then sixteenth notes, and then five notes per beat, etc. until it climaxes with thirty-second notes (eight per beat). After this climax, the main theme recapitulates, but is soon succeeded by a more intense melody in octaves along with triplet sixteenth notes in the left hand (six notes per beat). The key then changes from A minor to A major, and the piece goes into a long and winding section of free-flowing sixteenth notes alternating by groups of two in the right and left hand. The sixteenth notes flow into the high register and a small falling and rising arpeggio seemingly concludes the piece. However, Alkan adds one more small flourish before finally ending in A major. =Le vent= Le vent (the Wind) is in B minor. The piece is in three sections, roughly in ABA' form. The outer sections contain chromatic scales throughout, like the impromptu, and the middle section contrasts with arpeggios accompanying the melody instead of chromatic scales. These chromatic scales include a 2 page transition, completely composed of dual chromatic scales sweeping the span of most of the keyboard. The first theme clearly represents the wind, with sad extended chords superimposed by languid chromatics. The second theme is in D major (the relative key to B minor), and features sweeps for the left hand while the right performs the melody in octaves (quoting the Allegretto of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony) with tremolos played within. Then the first theme returns fiercely with tremolos instead of chords for the left hand. Surprisingly, after chilling chromatic scales deep in the bass register, the piece ends with one final light ascending chromatic scale and a B major chord. Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote of this piece in 1932 that it was > familiar ... ‚Äî too familiar one is tempted to say, for most people think of > Alkan, indeed only know him, as the composer of ‚ÄòLe Vent‚Äô, as they know only > the Sibelius of the ‚ÄòValse Triste‚Äô or ‚ÄòFinlandia‚Äô; the great master of ‚ÄòLe > festin d'√âsope‚Äô and the Fourth Symphony respectively being completely a > terra incognita.Sorabji (1932), p. 214 =Morte= Morte (Dead), in E minor, quotes the Gregorian chant of Dies Irae. The piece is the longest of the three, and features difficult, dense chord passages, sixths, trills, tremolos and repeated notes. In part of the piece, there is a constant tolling of a B in a very similar way as Ravel's \\"Le Gibet\\" from Gaspard de la nuit, composed over 70 years later. Near the end, there is a very passionate and intense buildup that leads to quick short chords similar to the final part of Chopin's Ballade No. 4 in F minor right before the coda. The piece ends by quoting the \\"Aime-moi\\" theme, some chromatic scales very similar to those in \\"Le vent\\" and finally concludes very abruptly with a long trill and two short 16th note chords. Sorabji considered this > the most remarkable number of the set ... a moving and tragic elegy or dirge > ... full of astonishing hardiesses, both technical, pianistic and harmonic, > and its ending is as weirdly uncanny as it is original and daring.Sorabji > (1932), pp. 214-5  Reception  The pieces received a virulent review from Robert Schumann, who wrote: > It has a considerable flavour of Sue and Sand.

It contains 118 graves of some of the earliest Dutch settlers of Cow Neck (as today's Port Washington was then known) and their descendants, buried from 1737 to 1892. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The cemetery is a small, nearly square plot surrounded by tall oak trees. It is fenced off and locked, not open to the public. The graves are arranged in 13 rows by family. Originally it was part of the 110 acre (44 ha) Rapelje farm. The property was separated from Rapelje's farm and sold in July, 1786 to members of the Onderdonk, Schenck, Hegeman and Dodge families.Goldberg, Nicholas. (June 15, 1988) Newsday At Cemetery, Past Lives On. Section: News; Page 37. The earliest-dated markers are those of Andries Onderdonk and his wife Geertruy, which date to 1731 and 1738 respectively. Other bodies were reburied there prior to the Rapeljes' sale of the property and its official designation as a cemetery in 1796. All headstones face west. The markers, mostly sandstone but for a few in marble, show a variation in styles consistent with their time periods. Eighteenth-century markers are sandstone detailed with \\"soul effigies\\", a tripartite lobed top with a face in the center and other decoration in the wings. By the end of that century and the beginning of the next, the lobed top was plain, the inscriptions began with \\"In Memory\\" or \\"In Memoriam\\", and there are at least two marble headstones with the willow-and-urn motif common in neoclassical gravestones from the 1820s on. The last graves, from the late 19th century, are made of unadorned marble, common to that time. All the tombstones seem to rise naturally out of the ground, moldy and ancient. The Monforts, one of the families with ancestors buried in the cemetery, owned and continued to maintain the cemetery not only throughout its period of active use but for almost a century thereafter. In 1984 Burtis Monfort transferred it to the town of North Hempstead, which has maintained it ever since. Notable burials Some of those buried at Monfort played important roles in early local history. Martin Schenck (1740‚Äì1793) was one of the signers of North Hempstead's Declaration of Independence from then-Loyalist Hempstead during the Revolution. Andrew Onderdonk (1756‚Äì1793) was a captain in the militia and later a New York State Senator. Joseph Onderdonk (1766‚Äì1852) was present at George Washington's inauguration as a young man and would later introduce modern techniques to local agriculture and serve as a district highway supervisor for North Hempstead. In addition, Henry Onderdonk Jr. (died 1886) was a Long Island historian who married his first cousin, Maria Onderdonk and wrote such books as \\"Revolutionary Incidents of Queens County.\\"Onderdonk Jr., Henry.

The election was triggered when, on 30 June 2008, the sitting MP David Marshall stood down due to ill health. The by-election was won by John Mason, candidate of the Scottish National Party, who defeated the Labour candidate Margaret Curran. Curran subsequently regained the seat for Labour in the 2010 general election. The election was significant as it was the second safe Labour seat to be contested, and to be lost, since a downturn in political fortunes for the Labour Party and incumbent UK Labour Government under the Premiership of Gordon Brown, and was also held in the wake of the resignation of the Leader of the Scottish Labour Party , Wendy Alexander. The seat was the third safest Labour seat in Scotland, and their 26th safest seat in the UK. Results History The Glasgow East constituency was created for the 2005 general election. Its area came from the majority of the Glasgow Baillieston constituency, with the remainder formed from the Glasgow Shettleston constituency. It is one of the most deprived constituencies in the UK, with 30% of the working-age population on unemployment or incapacity benefit and nearly 40% of children growing up in homes where there is no adult in paid employment. In the 2005 general election the new Glasgow East seat was Labour's 26th safest seat in terms of percentage majority, and within Scotland, the seat at which it received its second highest share of the vote. In the 2005 election, Labour defeated the Scottish National Party (SNP) by a majority of 13,507 votes, who beat the Liberal Democrats to third place by 1,603 votes. Prior to his 2005 win of Glasgow East, Marshall had continually held the predecessor seat of Glasgow Shettleston since 1979. Shettleston had been held continuously by previous Labour Party members since an Independent Labour Party member defected to Labour in 1947. The Glasgow Baillieston constituency, and its predecessor seat Glasgow Provan, had always returned Labour MPs since its creation in 1955. In the 2007 Scottish parliamentary elections Labour lost power to the SNP, who formed a minority government. In this election, the SNP deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon won the neighbouring Glasgow Govan Scottish Parliament constituency with a swing from Labour of 10.7%, while all other Glasgow constituencies remained in Labour control. On 28 June 2008, Marshall informed local party leaders that he would be stepping down on medical advice, after 10 weeks of sick leave from the House of Commons. On 30 June 2008 Marshall accepted the post of Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, a device allowing him in effect to resign as an MP, triggering the by-election Political situation The election gained attention throughout the UK due to worsening results for Labour during 2008. The Daily Record had asserted that if Labour lost the by-election, further pressure would be heaped on Gordon Brown. The by-election followed a run of poor results since May, in the Crewe and Nantwich and Henley by- elections in England, English and Welsh local elections and losing the London mayoralty. By the end of May, Labour had registered its worst ever independent opinion poll result since records began in 1943, of 23%. This was also the first by-election since Labour declined to field a candidate in the Haltemprice and Howden by-election in England 14 days previously, fought over a recent controversial government anti-terrorism bill. The by-election also came within days of the controversial resignation of the Scottish Labour leader Wendy Alexander, with voting for a replacement not taking place before polling.BBC News Q&A;: Labour leadership election, 30 June 2008BBC News Gordon eyes Labour leadership bid, 1 July 2008 Turnout is usually lower in by- elections; at the previous general election turnout was 48% but was down just under 6% at 42.25%. Voter share was likely to have been distributed differently, with nine candidates standing for this election, compared to five in 2005. Turnout was higher than expected, despite the election being held during the school holidays, and during a traditional Glasgow holiday period. In a Scotland-wide opinion poll of Westminster voting intentions, released on 11 July, the SNP was on 33%, with Labour on 29%, Conservatives on 20% Lib Dem on 14%. However, in an opinion poll conducted solely within the Glasgow East constituency, released on 12 July, Labour led on 47%, SNP on 33%, Liberal Democrats on 9% and the Conservatives on 7%. Candidates When nominations closed, there were nine candidates. The SNP chose John Mason, a longtime resident of the constituency, and leader of the opposition on Glasgow City Council. The Labour Party had some difficulty finding a candidate. The most likely initial choice, local councillor George Ryan, failed to attend a selection meeting. The position was then offered to Stephen Purcell, the Labour leader of Glasgow council, then Lesley Quinn and Frank McAveety, the party's general secretary and the MSP for Glasgow Shettleston respectively, but all turned it down . The position was eventually accepted by fifth-choice candidate Margaret Curran, MSP for Glasgow Baillieston, on 7 July. The Green Party selected Dr. Eileen Duke, a retired GP and co-convenor of the party's local branch, on 5 July. The Scottish Socialist Party stood Frances Curran, a former MSP who originally came from the east end of Glasgow. Solidarity stood Tricia McLeish, a trade union activist who lived in the constituency. Howitt stood under the label \\"Freedom-4-Choice\\", a minor party of his own creation, having stood under the same title in the Haltemprice and Howden by-election. Aftermath As a result of the United States diplomatic cables leak, the website WikiLeaks later disclosed that senior US diplomats perceived Gordon Brown to be \\"finished\\" following the result. Curran would subsequently defeat Mason and regain the seat for Labour in the 2010 general election with a majority of almost 12,000, only to be defeated herself by the SNP in 2015. 2005 election result The seat was created at the 2005 election.

Life and career Born at Yelets in Oryol Governorate, she began acting at an amateur theatre club in the Siberian city of Tomsk. She then moved to Moscow and studied acting under Alexander Lensky at the Moscow Theatrical school, from which she graduated in 1901 as an actress. From 1901 to 1945 Varvara Massalitinova was a permanent member of the troupe at Maly Academic Theatre in Moscow.

During the 1950s it was carried nationally by NBC and then ABC television. The program featured live country music (performed mainly by local musicians but on lesser occasions by national stars) and what was then called \\"hayseed\\" comedy, much of which was the inspiration for the later TV series Hee Haw. It is credited as the first country music program regularly broadcast by a national network. History Inspired by the Shreveport-based Louisiana Hayride, the show was originally called Boone County Jamboree (named for nearby Boone County in Northern Kentucky). Midwestern Hayride was first broadcast before 1937 and was carried live on radio each Saturday evening through the early 1970s. Television station WLW-T came on the air in 1948, sharing larger quarters with radio station WLW in the former Elks Building, re-christened Crosley Square. It eventually became the originating studio for the regional network Avco Broadcasting Corporation, which included WLW-A in Atlanta, WLW-D in Dayton, WLW-C in Columbus and later WLW-I in Indianapolis (after WLW-A was sold) when the program moved to television in the early 1950s. Then originating from WLW-T, Midwestern Hayride was simulcast on WLW radio until the early 1960s, then was revived in the mid-60s. At the show's peak there was a one-year waiting list for tickets to be in the audience (100 people was the limit for each weekly show). In 1951, Midwestern Hayride was picked up by NBC-TV as a summer replacement for Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows. NBC aired it each of the following summers through 1956, except 1953. ABC-TV then carried it during the summers of 1957-59\\\\. For much of its television run MH was hosted by Dean Richards, lead vocalist of The Lucky Pennies, a local singing group. Richards also introduced a \\"Polka Time\\" segment (geared to Cincinnati's German heritage and its local breweries) aired near the program's close until 1969, when he was replaced by Henson Cargill riding on the success of his hit song \\"Skip a Rope\\". By the early 1970s, then-16 year MH veteran Kenny Price, a popular musician and comedian nicknamed The Round Mound of Sound, had a string of country hits for RCA Records including local favorite \\"The Sheriff of Boone County\\". On the strength of those hits, Price was picked to be the new host of the show, which by then had shortened its name to Hayride (Louisiana Hayride had succumbed to rock and roll's popularity and left the airwaves by 1960). Like many other locally produced shows of the day, Hayride become increasingly more expensive to produce, and WLW-TV executives decided to bring the show to an end in 1972. Kenny Price became a regular on Nashville-based Hee Haw four years later and remained there until his death in 1987. In 2009, WYNS-FM, a low-power community FM station in Waynesville, Ohio (north of Cincinnati), announced it would commence a similar live weekly country music broadcast, The Ohio Hayride, beginning May 15, 2010.

Nine parishes, each with its own church and glebe land, were created when colonisation became official in 1612, but there was rarely more than a pair of ordained ministers to share between them over the following two centuries. From 1825 to 1839, Bermuda was attached to the See of Nova Scotia. Bermuda then became part of the Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda from its creation in 1839 until 1919. In 1879, the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop.

He was born in Beijing, China. Zhong, one of the last private pupils of Russian violin pedagogue Raphael Bronstein, also studied with Bronstein's student Elmar Oliveira. Zhong's violin prowess was recognized at age 14 by renowned violinist Nathan Milstein, and led to a series of concerts promoted and arranged by Milstein's manager Harold Shaw in United States, including a debut at New York's Carnegie Hall main stage at age 16. After which, he went on performing as a soloist and, more often, recitalist in cities of North and South America, Western Europe, and Asia. He is noted for his instrumental fluency and artistic insight that delivers incisive and noble musical interpretations. Born to a family of professional violinists, Zhong started violin lessons around age four with his parents. His progress was quick enough that at age 11 he won a national audition with the fiendish Paganini Violin Concerto No. 1 and the prolific Ciaconne by Bach. This earned him a place in the studio of veteran violin professor Ke Qiang Sui at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Zhong traveled to the United States alone to pursue studies at age 13. He was accepted as a pupil by Raphael Bronstein, who also offered the young boy shelter along with scholarship. Zhong lived and studied at Bronstein's home until the professor's death, and continued to work with Ariana Bronne, Bronstein's daughter, until he had earned his Bachelor of Music degree at Manhattan School of Music in New York City. Afterward, Zhong sought Bronstein's famed student Elmar Oliveira for further advice and obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree at State University of New York at Purchase. Zhong performs in a number of professional orchestras in North California. Notably, he is the Associate Concertmaster in Santa Rosa Symphony, and Concertmaster at the Mendocino Music Festival. As a violin instructor, Zhong teaches at Sonoma State University, and has held professorship at Western Illinois University (2002-2004) and California State University, Los Angeles (2004-2009), and taught master-classes in universities in North America, South America, and China. Zhong is the author of the violin instruction book A Violinist's Handbook, A Simpler Manual to Learn the Instrument, a method manual that combines the Leopold Auer Violin School guidelines with his own findings in practical solutions. He became a U.S. citizen in 2000.

It stars George Sanders, Margaret Lindsay, and Vincent Price, and tells the story of a family consumed by greed in which one brother frames another for murder. It is a remake of the 1910 film of the same name, which starred Mary Fuller. The film's musical score was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Score. The plot of the film differs dramatically from the plot of the novel on which it is based. Plot In the late 17th century, Colonel Jaffrey Pyncheon, falsely accused a poor carpenter, Matthew Maule, of witchcraft. Maule was hanged. Pyncheon took his land and built the luxurious Pyncheon home on it. But Maule cursed the Pyncheons, and the colonel soon died. The family has lived during the next 160 years desperately afraid of the \\"Maule curse\\". In the mid-19th century, Col. Pyncheon's great-great grandson Jaffrey Pyncheon (George Sanders) is a lawyer just embarking on his career. His elder brother, Clifford (Vincent Price), lives at home with their father, Gerald Pyncheon (Gilbert Emery). Jaffrey is obsessed with legends that say a vast sum of money is hidden in the Pyncheon house. Jaffrey is summoned to his father's home when Clifford informs him that the house is to be sold to pay his father's debts. Jaffrey, terrified at losing the lost treasure, pries up floorboards and searches in the walls at night for the lost gold. Clifford, however, doesn't believe the family stories. He wants to marry his cousin, Hepzibah Pyncheon (Margaret Lindsay), sell the house, and move to New York City. When Gerald decides not to sell the house after all, Clifford and his father argue violently. Gerald dies of a heart attack, and strikes his head as he falls. Jaffrey, knowing Clifford is innocent, nonetheless accuses him of murder. Clifford is convicted and imprisoned, but renews \\"Maule's curse\\" upon Jaffrey before being led away. Gerald's will gives all three children sizeable yearly incomes, but leaves the house to Hepzibah. Hepzibah throws Jaffrey out of the house and seals all the doors and windows so that no light can be admitted. Over the next two decades, she rarely leaves her home. In 1841, Clifford is given a new cellmate, who identifies himself as Matthew Maule (Dick Foran). He and Clifford become close friends. Maule is shortly released, and takes the name \\"Holgrave.\\" An abolitionist, he rents a room from Hepzibah Pyncheon. Shortly thereafter, a distant cousin dies and Hepzibah takes in the cousin's daughter, Phoebe Pyncheon (Nan Grey). Desperate for money, Hepzibah opens a small shop in a room of her home. With the beautiful, vivacious Phoebe running the shop, it is a success and earns her much money. The governor releases Clifford from prison, who returns to the Pyncheon house. \\"Holgrave\\" spreads rumors about town that Clifford has been poring over old documents, has found a secret stairway in the house, and is tearing up the Pyncheon home in search of the long-lost treasure. Jaffrey has invested money from wealthy abolitionists in risky investments involving the slave trade. Realizing he might be able to seize control of the house, Jaffrey uses these rumors to accuse Clifford of insanity. Jaffrey visits the house, and hears banging ‚Äî which he assumes is Clifford searching for the gold. Jaffrey leaves, triumphant. Hepzibah discovers that Holgrave is making these noises, and evicts him from the house despite the protests of Phoebe (who is in love with him). A worried Hepzibah then searches Holgrave's room and discovers he is really Matthew Maule. She warns Clifford, who admits that he has known all along who Holgrave is and that Holgrave is part of his plan to clear his name. Jaffrey visits the house and tells Clifford that he intends to have him committed. Clifford responds by asking Jaffrey to sign a document that clears Clifford's name. Jaffrey refuses. Deacon Arnold Foster (Miles Mander), who loaned Jaffrey the investment funds, arrives and demands the money back. Jaffrey refuses. The deacon goes into the hallway and commits suicide. Hepzibah accuses Jaffrey of murder. Panicking, Jaffrey signs the document and tells Clifford that he can have the lost treasure so long as Clifford does not accuse him of murder. Clifford admits that there is no hidden staircase and no gold. It's all been a trick on Jaffrey, played by Clifford and Matthew Maule. Hearing the name of Maule, Jaffrey collapses dead. With Clifford's name cleared, he marries Hepzibah and Maule marries Phoebe. They restore the house, and put it up for sale.

This version, which is now lost, starred Mary Fuller. Republic Pictures announced a remake in 1935, but it went into development hell and was never made. =Producer and script writing= Universal Studios began planning its remake of The House of the Seven Gables probably in early 1939. Pre-production for the film was secretive, as the studio feared that other companies with more financial resources might rush a House of Seven Gables into production before Universal could finish its version. The studio wanted the picture to be a low-budget B film, which would be released as a double feature with another B film. It was budgeted at a low $152,625 ($ in dollars), but was still considered one of Universal's \\"prestige\\" horror films. Screenwriter Lester Cole says it was unclear why Universal chose to make the film, although it may have been because the book was in the public domain. Film historian Don G. Smith, however, argues for an economic reason: Horror films were popular again. A national outcry against the gruesomeness of the 1935 film The Raven had convinced Universal Studios executives to place a ban on the production of horror films at the studio. But a New York City movie theater ran a triple-bill of Dracula, Frankenstein, and Son of Kong in 1938, and ticket sales were so strong that the theater ran the films 21 hours a day. Universal swiftly lifted its ban, and began production on a series of horror pictures: Son of Frankenstein, Sherlock Holmes and the House of Fear (aka The House of Fear), Black Friday, The Invisible Man Returns, The Mummy's Hand, The Invisible Woman, and The House of the Seven Gables. Universal announced it would begin work on The House of the Seven Gables on October 10, 1939. The studio assigned one of its B-picture producers, Burt Kelly, to oversee the production. Kelly had an extensive background in theater, and had held a number of associate producer and producer positions at various studios. Universal also assigned one of its young staff writers, Harold Greene, to produce a treatment of the novel. Kelly had his choice of whom to hire as screenwriter, however, and he chose Lester Cole. Kelly had worked with Cole on a number of films, and film historian Bob Herzberg suggests that Kelly held progressive views which were shared by Cole (who openly held communist political views). Kelly, who Cole felt had \\"a real feeling for film and decent human instincts\\", was also a loyal friend of Cole's. Universal Studios initially balked at Kelly's decision because Cole's salary was $600 a week ($ in dollars), but Kelly insisted and the studio gave in. The lengthy novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne needed extensive cutting to turn it into a filmable script. Cole substantially cut much of the beginning of the novel, and altered a good deal of the plot‚Äîremaining faithful to the spirit of the novel if not its actual narrative. But Cole did more than adapt the novel. He purposefully injected extensive left-wing political views into the script. He turned the character of Matthew Maule/\\"Holgrave\\" into an abolitionist, and depicted capitalists like Jaffrey Pyncheon and Arnold Foster as illegal slave-traders. He also greatly sharpened Hawthorne's critique of materialism, and depicted the punishment for greed coming not from God (as Hawthorne did) but from moral and freedom-loving people. Film historian Lawrence Raw has argued that Cole, and to a lesser extent Greene, also wanted the story to attack authoritarianism. Cole in particular was deeply aware of the wave of fascism and dictatorship sweeping across Europe in the 1930s, and Raw argues that Cole transformed the film into a \\"propaganda piece\\" in which Jaffrey Pyncheon was a metaphor for governmental tyranny. Film historian and literary critic Thomas S. Hischak has argued that the final script ended up less about the novel and more about \\"variations on a theme by Hawthorne\\". =Production and casting= The film's low budget meant only modest production values. Nevertheless, production designer Jack Otterson went to Salem, Massachusetts, to take photographs and measurements of the Turner-Ingersoll Mansion (the inspiration for the House of the Seven Gables in Hawthorne's novel). A facade of the House of the Seven Gables was constructed on the Colonial Street backlot at Universal Studios (it remained standing into the 21st century). Interiors took up three soundstages at Universal Studios, with the primary sets representing the Seven Gables living room, lower hallway, and upper hallway. Props included more than 500 pieces of authentic early American tableware, kitchen pots, and kitchen utensils. Jack Pierce, makeup artist famous for his work in Universal's horror movies of the 1930s, came up with the makeup design for the lead performers (who age two decades or more during the course of the picture). Universal Studios tested Margaret Lindsay for the role of Hepzibah Pyncheon on December 27, 1939. Robert Cummings was originally cast as Clifford Pyncheon about December 28, but he fell ill the following day and was forced to leave the production. Price was cast most likely because he had forged a good working relationship with Kelly and May in October 1939 while working on The Invisible Man Returns. The studio announced Price's and Lindsay's casting, along with those of Nan Grey and George Sanders, on December 29. Studio publicists noted that the role of Matthew Maule remained unfilled. The Los Angeles Times reported that principal photography was to have begun about December 24, but cameras did not begin rolling until December 29, 1939. The production shut down the same day due to casting problems and set construction delays. One of the problems was the height of the lead actors: Studio carpenters made the set for the average actor's height of , but Price () and Sanders () were too tall. Doorway lintels and ceilings were quickly raised. Shooting resumed on January 3. The production was already three days behind schedule on January 5 due to problems with the period costumes, lighting, and the time-consuming aging makeup, and rain had delayed exterior shooting at the Seven Gables House. Additional casting decisions were announced on January 4. Alan Napier, who had forged a deep friendship with Joe May on The Invisible Man Returns as well, was cast as the postman, Fuller. Dick Foran was cast as Matthew Maule and Gilbert Emery as Gerald Pyncheon that same day. Hiring for the major roles was not resolved until January 12, 1940, when the studio announced the casting of Cecil Kellaway and Charles Trowbridge. The following day, Universal announced that a song, \\"The Color of Your Eyes\\" (music and lyrics by Ralph Freed and Frank Skinner), had been added to the picture, and would be sung by Vincent Price. Additional delays occurred when airplanes flying over the set disrupted more exterior filming in mid January. Universal now began to put pressure on director Joe May to speed up the production. May did so, and by January 24 Trowbridge had finished all his scenes and had moved on to his next picture. The same day, Miles Mander was cast in the role of Arnold Foster. By working into the night (ten times between January 12 and the end of principal photography, the production did not break until 10 o'clock in the evening) the production was able to end in late January after 23 days of shooting (just two days over budget). The film's final cost was $161,625. =Directing and acting= Joe May was hired as director because he'd helmed a series of Universal horror films in 1939, all of which had done well at the box office. May's background significantly influenced the film. He had fled his native Austria in 1934 due to the rise of Austrofascism, and became a contract director at Universal. May saw The House of the Seven Gables as a metaphor for opposing fascism and celebrating freedom of thought. But his background influenced the film in other ways, too. Alan Napier and Vincent Price both said that May had a heavy German accent, and had difficulty making himself understood in English. This hampered May's ability to direct his actors, and the studio ordered screenwriter Lester Cole to act as dialogue director. Coming out of the German and Austrian film tradition, May was well versed in German Expressionism, and he introduced visual elements of this genre to the film. In one example, when Hepzibah descends the staircase, she casts a stark shadow against the wall. This is a visual doppelg√§nger, indicating that the character has two aspects which will be revealed in the film (the happy, youthful girl and the bitter, repressed spinster). May also used mise-en-sc√®ne, such as window panes or shadows, to show that the characters are trapped by Seven Gables or by circumstance. George Sanders, a notoriously quick-witted individual with a cruel streak, did not get along with director Joe May, and Sanders ridiculed him openly. Alan Napier also said he had a poor on-set relationship with Sanders, who vociferously disliked Napier's good friend Anne Froelick. Film historians Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, and John Brunas alleged that Price and Sanders also feuded on the set. But Price himself denied that he had a poor relationship with Sanders. Price later wrote that Sanders was \\"a dear and wonderful man. I knew him really intimately, and was very, very fond of him. He only pretended to be a dreadful man\\". Premieres and reception =Premieres= The House of the Seven Gables premiered in Chicago, Illinois, on February 29, 1940, along with Black Friday. Vincent Price and Bela Lugosi, stars of the respective films, were in attendance. The film went into general release on April 12, 1940, the same day it made its New York City premiere. =Reception= The film was released to generally good reviews in the press. Lester Cole felt the script was one of the best he ever wrote, and later said that few reviewers made note of the extensive plot revisions he had made. Price and Sanders, both relative unknowns at the time, delivered good performances which boosted their careers significantly. Film historian Thomas S. Hischak said Margaret Lindsay was also very good as Hepzibah Pyncheon. Composer Frank Skinner received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The film's reputation suffered in the 1950s. During the Second Red Scare of 1947 to 1957, Universal Studio executives criticized the film because, they said, Kelly and Cole had injected radical politics into the script and the directing. Modern critics give mixed reviews to the picture. Vincent Price biographer Denis Meikle has called the film \\"overly sentimental\\", and criticized the aging make-up as not very good. He thought the movie was suspenseful, but also typical of the \\"mild\\" and \\"inoffensive\\" period pictures of the era. Price remake The novel The House of the Seven Gables served as the basis of one of three stories in the 1963 anthology horror film Twice Told Tales. The story, which departs significantly from both the book and the 1940 film, has Vincent Price portraying \\"Gerald Pyncheon\\" (a composite character)‚Äîa murderer who meets a supernatural end.

Mills was also involved in the suppression of the Ku Klux Klan in Laurens County, South Carolina; My Story, 126-29. Shortly after the Civil War, Mills began to improve the regulation cartridge belt by attempting to weave the whole belt in one piece without sewing. The improved belt was adopted by the U.S. Army, but the numbers needed by the frontier army were small. At the commencement of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Mills and his associates expanded their factory to produce a thousand belts a day, but the quick conclusion of the war left Mills practically bankrupt. Nevertheless, after giving some belts to Canadian troops headed for the Boer War, Mills soon received orders from the British government, and his success was assured. Having made a small fortune by 1905, Mills sold his interest.Dictionary of American Biography, 7: 1.

Greenhouse gas emissions  Calculation of Carbon Intensity of Soy biodiesel grown in the US and burnt in the UK, using figures calculated by the UK government for the purposes of the Renewable transport fuel obligation. Graph of UK figures for the Carbon Intensity of Biodiesels and fossil fuels. This graph assumes that all biodiesel is used in its country of origin. It also assumes that the diesel is produced from pre-existing croplands rather than by changing land useGraph derived from information found in UK government document.Carbon and Sustainability Reporting Within the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation An often mentioned incentive for using biodiesel is its capacity to lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to those of fossil fuels. Whether this is true or not depends on many factors. A general critic to biodiesel is the land use change, which have potential to cause even more emissions than what would be caused by using fossil fuels alone. * Yet this problem would be fixed with algal biofuel which can use land unsuitable for agriculture. Carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases. Although the burning of biodiesel produces carbon dioxide emissions similar to those from ordinary fossil fuels, the plant feedstock used in the production absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when it grows. Plants absorb carbon dioxide through a process known as photosynthesis which allows it to store energy from sunlight in the form of sugars and starches. After the biomass is converted into biodiesel and burned as fuel the energy and carbon is released again. Some of that energy can be used to power an engine while the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. When considering the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions it is therefore important to consider the whole production process and what indirect effects such production might cause. The effect on carbon dioxide emissions is highly dependent on production methods and the type of feedstock used. Calculating the carbon intensity of biofuels is a complex and inexact process, and is highly dependent on the assumptions made in the calculation. A calculation usually includes: * Emissions from growing the feedstock (e.g. Petrochemicals used in fertilizers) * Emissions from transporting the feedstock to the factory * Emissions from processing the feedstock into biodiesel * Absorption of CO2 Emissions from growing the feedstock Other factors can be very significant but are sometimes not considered. These include: * Emissions from the change in land use of the area where the fuel feedstock is grown. * Emissions from transportation of the biodiesel from the factory to its point of use * The efficiency of the biodiesel compared with standard diesel * The amount of Carbon Dioxide produced at the tail pipe. (Biodiesel can produce 4.7% more) * The benefits due to the production of useful by-products, such as cattle feed or glycerine If land use change is not considered and assuming today's production methods, biodiesel from rapeseed and sunflower oil produce 45%-65% lower greenhouse gas emissions than petrodiesel. *Summary: However, there is ongoing research to improve the efficiency of the production process. Biodiesel produced from used cooking oil or other waste fat could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 85%. As long as the feedstock is grown on existing cropland, land use change has little or no effect on greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is concern that increased feedstock production directly affects the rate of deforestation. Such clearcutting cause carbon stored in the forest, soil and peat layers to be released. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation is so large that the benefits from lower emissions (caused by biodiesel use alone) would be negligible for hundreds of years. Biofuel produced from feedstock such as palm oil could therefore cause much higher carbon dioxide emissions than some types of fossil fuels.  Pollution  In the United States, biodiesel is the only alternative fuel to have successfully completed the Health Effects Testing requirements (Tier I and Tier II) of the Clean Air Act (1990). Biodiesel can reduce the direct tailpipe-emission of particulates, small particles of solid combustion products, on vehicles with particulate filters by as much as 20 percent compared with low-sulfur (< 50 ppm) diesel. Particulate emissions as the result of production are reduced by around 50 percent compared with fossil-sourced diesel.  Biodegradation  A University of Idaho study compared biodegradation rates of biodiesel, neat vegetable oils, biodiesel and petroleum diesel blends, and neat 2-D diesel fuel. Using low concentrations of the product to be degraded (10 ppm) in nutrient and sewage sludge amended solutions, they demonstrated that biodiesel degraded at the same rate as a dextrose control and 5 times as quickly as petroleum diesel over a period of 28 days, and that biodiesel blends doubled the rate of petroleum diesel degradation through co-metabolism. The same study examined soil degradation using 10 000 ppm of biodiesel and petroleum diesel, and found biodiesel degraded at twice the rate of petroleum diesel in soil. In all cases, it was determined biodiesel also degraded more completely than petroleum diesel, which produced poorly degradable undetermined intermediates. Toxicity studies for the same project demonstrated no mortalities and few toxic effects on rats and rabbits with up to 5000 mg/kg of biodiesel. Petroleum diesel showed no mortalities at the same concentration either, however toxic effects such as hair loss and urinary discolouring were noted with concentrations of >2000 mg/l in rabbits.:  Biodegradation in Aquatic Environments  As biodiesel becomes more widely used, it is important to consider how consumption affects water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Research examining the biodegradability of different biodiesel fuels found that all of the biofuels studied (including Neat Rapeseed oil, Neat Soybean oil, and their modified ester products) were ‚Äúreadily biodegradable‚Äù compounds, and had a relatively high biodegradation rate in water.Zhang, X.; Peterson, C. L.; Reece, D.; Moller, G.; Haws, R. Biodegradability of Biodiesel in the Aquatic Environment. ASABE 1998, 41(5), 1423-1430 Additionally, the presence of biodiesel can increase the rate of diesel biodegradation via co-metabolism. As the ratio of biodiesel is increased in biodiesel/diesel mixtures, the faster the diesel is degraded. Another study using controlled experimental conditions also showed that fatty acid methyl esters, the primary molecules in biodiesel, degraded much faster than petroleum diesel in sea water.DeMello, J. A.; Carmichael, C. A.; Peacock, E. E.; Nelson, R. K.; Arey, J. S.; Reddy, C. M. Biodegradation and Environmental Behavior of Biodiesel Mixtures in the Sea: An Initial Study. Marine Poll. Bull. 2007, 54, 894-904  Carbonyl Emissions  When considering the emissions from fossil fuel and biofuel use, research typically focuses on major pollutants such as hydrocarbons. It is generally recognized that using biodiesel in place of diesel results in a substantial reduction in regulated gas emissions, but there has been a lack of information in research literature about the non-regulated compounds which also play a role in air pollution.He, C.; Ge, Y.; Tan, J.; You, K.; Han, X.; Wang, J.; You, Q.; Shah, A. N. Comparison of Carbonyl Compounds Emissions from Diesel Engine Fueled with Biodiesel and Diesel. Atmos. Environ. 2009, 43, 3657-3661 One study focused on the emissions of non-criteria carbonyl compounds from the burning of pure diesel and biodiesel blends in heavy-duty diesel engines. The results found that carbonyl emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde, were higher in biodiesel mixtures than emissions from pure diesel. Biodiesel use results in higher carbonyl emissions but lower total hydrocarbon emissions, which may be better as an alternative fuel source. Other studies have been done which conflict with these results, but comparisons are difficult to make due to various factors that differ between studies (such as types of fuel and engines used). In a paper which compared 12 research articles on carbonyl emissions from biodiesel fuel use, it found that 8 of the papers reported increased carbonyl compound emissions while 4 showed the opposite. This is evidence that there is still much research required on these compounds.

Chertoff (born March 29, 1950 in New York, NY) is an American five- time Grammy-nominated producer responsible for such hits as Joan Osborne's \\"One of Us\\", Cyndi Lauper's \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" and \\"Time After Time\\" and Sophie B. Hawkins' \\"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\\". Both Cyndi Lauper's album She's So Unusual and Joan Osborne's album Relish were debut albums that garnered multi-platinum sales and multiple Grammy nominations. Chertoff was nominated twice for 'album of the year', twice for 'record of the year' and also for 'producer of the year.' Biography Chertoff attended the University of Pennsylvania, and whilst in Philadelphia he met soon-to-be long- time friends Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian and formed a musical collaboration that has lasted to this day. Chertoff played drums in a local band \\"Wax\\" with Hyman and later produced and played with the band Baby Grand, which included both Hyman and Bazilian. He was a major force behind the signing of Hyman and Bazilian's later band, The Hooters to Columbia Records, where he produced their multi-platinum albums, Nervous Night, One Way Home, and Zig Zag. Chertoff's A&R; career began under the training of music legend Clive Davis at the inception of Arista Records. In his all-purpose A&R;/production role, Chertoff signed and produced, edited and remixed tracks for many Arista artists including The Kinks and the Alan Parsons Project. Chertoff's Arista career culminated in his co-production of Air Supply's first million-seller, Lost in Love as well as his co-production of the theme from Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind with acclaimed composer John Williams. In 1980, Chertoff joined Columbia Records, rising to Senior Vice President of A&R; in 1989. Over the next three years, while heading the A&R; department, he oversaw the creative efforts of dozens of careers. He signed artists such as The Band and Sophie B. Hawkins, and brought in label deals such as the successful Ruff House Records which resulted in albums from The Fugees, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, Kris Kross, and Cypress Hill. One of Chertoff's biggest successes in his Columbia days was producing Lauper's debut album, She's So Unusual. The album sold 9 million copies with perennial hits such as, \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\", \\"All Through the Night\\", \\"When You Were Mine\\" and \\"Money Changes Everything.\\" He brought together Hyman and Lauper who co-wrote the #1 smash, \\"Time After Time.\\" Lauper and Chertoff then teamed up to write the hit, \\"She Bop.\\" In 1992, Chertoff started his Blue Gorilla label at Polygram to allow him the opportunity to get back to concentrating in the studio on a select roster of artists. Blue Gorilla immediately performed well, exceeding expectations, with Joan Osborne' Relish, a multi-platinum album and worldwide smash which also garnered an amazing 7-Grammy nominations, including 'producer of the year'. Chertoff co-wrote and co-produced the song \\"Christmas of Love\\" for Ron Howard's film How the Grinch Stole Christmas and he co-wrote and co- produced the theme for Jerry Zucker's film, Rat Race with Jon Carin from Pink Floyd and songwriter David Forman, who also performed the lead vocals for each song. He is currently producing The Dream Jam Band, a group that writes and performs music for family audiences. Largo is based on the second movement of Dvorak's \\"Symphony from the New World.\\" The album, which Chertoff co-produced and co-wrote, features David Forman, The Chieftains, Taj Mahal, Garth Hudson, Levon Helm, Lauper, Osborne, Carole King, Hyman and Bazilian and uses Dvorak's journey to America as a timeless tapestry of American blues and folk music. He is currently in collaboration to bring Largo to the stage.

It is located near the intersection of Hinman and Brownington Center roads. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 9, 1973. The district consists of five buildings within the Old Stone House Museum complex and three neighboring houses, dating from the early 19th century. History In the early 19th century, Brownington was a community on the Hinman Settler Road, a primary route in the county. It was on the stagecoach route from Boston, Massachusetts to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Prior to 1816, the village was one of two county seats. Residents developed a number of facilities to take advantage of the town's situation. Old Stone House (Athenian Hall) Alexander Twilight alone constructed this four-story granite building which was used as a dormitory for out-of-town boarding students at the nearby Orleans County Grammar School. He called it \\"Athenian Hall.\\" Granite was almost never used in building construction in the early 19th century in Orleans County. No one knows where the granite came from.New York Times retrieved June 29, 2008 The dormitory closed in 1859, two years after Twilight's death. The Orleans County Historical Society bought it in 1918 for $500. Today it is called \\"The Old Stone House Museum.\\" It is one of the best-preserved institutional buildings of its era in the United States. Operated as an historical museum, it contains collections of 18th, 19th, and early 20th-century furniture, paintings, decorative art, folk art, tools and household items.VMGA retrieved June 29, 2008 Alexander Twilight House Across the road from the Old Stone House is Alexander Twilight's own house, which he built in 1830. He and his wife accepted several boarding students at their house each year; these students slept in rooms on the second floor of the house. Students continued to board with the Twilights after Athenian Hall dormitory was built. The Orleans County Historical Society bought the house in 1999. It has been restored and serves as a visitor center for the Museum and as an office for the Historical Society. Lawrence Barn This is an English-style barn built during the first half of the 19th century. It is similar to the one that was originally associated with the Twilight House. It was moved to its present site in 1997. It houses an exhibit illustrating two centuries of farming in Orleans County. Museum Education Center This building was probably the original house on the site of the Alexander Twilight House. It was donated to the Museum in 1978 and is used as an education center. Cyrus Eaton House Cyrus Eaton, a friend of Twilight, built this house in 1834. The architecture is late Federal-style, partially remodeled in the vernacular Greek Revival style. The building has been thoroughly restored, including the cedar shake roof. It contains the archives and research collections of the Historical Society. Behind the house is a well established mid-nineteenth century perennial garden. Samuel Read Hall House This house was built by George West in 1831 in the Federal style. For 21 years it was the home of Samuel Read Hall, who taught at the Orleans County Grammar School. Purchased by the Historical Society in 2006, the Samuel Read Hall House is being restored. Brownington Congregational Church and Village Cemetery The church was completed in 1841. Both Twilight and Hall were ministers there. In 1899 Brownington native William Barstow Strong, who had attended the Orleans County Grammar School, paid for extensive remodeling of the church's interior and furnished a bell and spire for the belfry. Prospect Hill and Observatory Tower When the classrooms of the grammar school were nearby, students climbed this hill for evening vespers. In 1898, Strong built an observatory at the top. This was recreated by the Grange in 1975 for the national bicentennial. It was rebuilt again in 1998. Rice and Going Hotel Built in 1815, this farmhouse was once operated as a hotel. It is privately owned today. Orleans County Grammar School William Baxter paid for the construction of this building in 1823. It was constructed at the base of Prospect Hill. In 1869, it was moved down the road by about . The building was owned by the town of Brownington and housed the Grange. in 2016, it was moved west of the church closer to the District. Simulating the work of the 19th century, 44 oxen appeared to be hitched to the historic building to tow it to the new site.

He also published his books as Alfred Bronowski, Fred Garland and Alfred Murawski. Commemorative statue of Alfred Szklarski in Grunwald Square in Katowice. Biography Szklarski was born in Chicago, Illinois, as the son of an √©migr√© and journalist, Andrzej Szklarski, and Maria n√©e Markosik. He started school in Chicago but he moved to Poland with his father in 1926. At first he lived in W≈Çoc≈Çawek where he continued his education. Then in 1932 he moved to Warsaw where he studied at the Academy of Political Sciences until 1938. The graduation paved the way for his diplomatic career but his plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Szklarski stayed in the Polish capital during the German occupation. He joined the Armia Krajowa resistance and took part in the Warsaw Uprising as a volunteer rifleman. After the uprising's fall, he moved to Krak√≥w but in February 1945 he went to live in Katowice in Upper Silesia where he remained until his death. In the year 1949 he was tried by the communists for his publications in a daily New Courier of Warsaw as well as other German propaganda newspapers, which led in 1949 to him being accused of collaborating with the Germans. He was sentenced to eight years in prison but he was released in 1953 after serving 4 years. Career Alfred Szklarski debuted during the German occupation of Poland with novels which were aimed at adults. These included: ≈ªelazny pazur (Iron claw, 1942), Krwawe diamenty (Bloody diamonds, 1943) and Tajemnica grobowca (The secret of the tomb, 1944). They were published in the New Courier of Warsaw. In the post-war period he started to sign his writings with pseudonyms: Alfred Bronowski and Fred Garland. However, his publishing house persuaded him to write youth novels signed with his real name. That was how his best known books came into existence, namely the series of novels about Tomek Wilmowski, a young boy who travels the world with his friends (Polish emigrants) and experiences great adventures. Tomek, who is the main character of the books, learns the value of friendship, study, responsibility, etc. The series of 9 books is full of geographical, historical, cultural and biological knowledge as well as humour and entertainment which is aimed at adolescents and young adults. Szklarski co- authored, with his wife Krystyna Szklarska, a trilogy about the Sioux titled Z≈Çoto G√≥r Czarnych (The Gold of the Black Hills). The books described hunting bisons, the beliefs, intertribal conflicts and the later Native Americans' first contact with the white people as well as their fights. It is claimed that Szklarski's books about history and sufferings of the indigenous peoples of America were inspired by his own war experience as well as Polish people's tragic history and invaders' cruelty. He is considered to have believed that the history of Native Americans is similar to a great extent to the history of Poland. The only difference was that Poles have managed to finally endure invasions, long years of occupation, extermination, Germanisation and Russification, whereas tribes of America eventually lost their free homeland which was taken over by the Whites.Piotr Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, Alfred Szklarski at DumnizPolski.pl (pl) He strongly condemned interracial violence, and supported the idea of reconciliation between nations. The popularity of his books brought him several awards, including Orle Pi√≥ro (1968) and Order of the Smile in 1971. He was given awards by two Polish Prime Ministers (1973, 1987) for his literary works for young readers. He was a member of the Association of Polish Authors. His books have been translated into Russian and Bulgarian. They have been published in Braille. , 11 million copies had been printed.

The series is made up of three core games: Diablo, Diablo II, and Diablo III. Expansions include the third-party published Hellfire, which follows the first game, Lord of Destruction, published by Blizzard and released after the second game, and Reaper of Souls, which follows the third game. Additional content is provided through story elements explored in other media forms. Diablo IV was announced at BlizzCon 2019. The series is set in the fantasy world of Sanctuary. The three games in the series take place in similar geographic areas, with several common areas including the town of Tristram and the region around Mount Arreat. Additional setting is provided by the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, two separate realms with ties to Sanctuary. The series focuses on the battle between the humans living on Sanctuary and the Prime Evils, demons who are led by Diablo, the series' chief antagonist. The humans are occasionally aided by angels, notably the archangel of justice, Tyrael. The characters in the world of Sanctuary are primarily humans, angels, and various classes of demons and monsters. The series has resulted in the publishing of several books relevant to the Diablo setting, covering a wide range of the timelines of the universe. There are also comics that explore various stories within the world of Sanctuary. , the series has sold over 24.8 million copies worldwide.http://eu.blizzard.com/en- gb/%20%20company/press/pressreleases.html?id=10032357 Games =Diablo= The setting of Diablo is the town of Tristram, the de facto capital of the Kingdom of Khanduras on the world of Sanctuary. The actual fighting takes place beneath the town in a maze of dungeons, catacombs, and caves that lead into the depths of Hell. The plot of Diablo centers around a player character undertaking a series of quests to free Tristram from Hell-spawned evil, descending through twelve levels of dungeons into Hell itself (the final four levels), where the player battles the titular character, Diablo, Lord of Terror ‚Äî one of the seven \\"Evils\\", devils who once ruled Hell. Diablo offers three character classes and the Hellfire expansion offers three more. Players can play as Warriors, Rogues (archers), or Sorcerers. Each class has its own place in the game's history, and all three classes make appearances as non- player characters in the sequel. All three classes have the same general skills and access to the same spells. Each of them has a class-specific skill (Item Repair, Trap Disarm, and Staff Recharge, respectively) that has as many drawbacks as benefits, except for Trap Disarm. Hellfire Diablo: Hellfire offers an additional character class: the Monk, in addition to two hidden character classes: the Barbarian and the Bard. The Monk fights best with staves or his bare hands and gains bonuses from wearing light or no armor. The Barbarian can wield two handed axes with only one hand but is entirely unable to cast spells throughout most of the game. The Bard is a character with relatively balanced statistics who can wield two single-handed weapons simultaneously. The Barbarian and the Bard can only be played using a file tweak, as they were unfinished. They utilize the art of the Warrior and Rogue, respectively, and have no lore. Additional quests and multiplayer capabilities (although not over Battle.net) are also unlockable through this simple tweak. Hellfire added two new dungeon environments on top of the four in the original Diablo: the Nest and the Crypt. Each of these environments contains various new monsters to fight, but they contain no random quests or bosses and the generated levels contain no shrines or libraries. The final boss of Hellfire, Na-Krul, is found in the last level of the Sacred Crypt. Hellfires development was started by Blizzard but later passed to Sierra to finish. =Diablo II= At the end of the first game, a warrior tried to contain Diablo's soul within himself. The warrior was unable to do so, and, by the beginning of Diablo II, The Lord of Terror had taken control of the warrior's body and begun the process of freeing his two brothers, Mephisto and Baal. Players can choose from five distinct characters (seven when including the expansion) to control in their quest and explore the world of Sanctuary through four acts. At the end of each of the four acts, players face different devils, with Diablo at the end of the game. The character classes in particular were received much better than the previous game's. Unlike its predecessor, Diablo II provides an explanation for each character class to pursue Diablo: *The oracles of the Amazons foretold that the final battle when mankind would at last be free of angelic and demonic manipulation was at hand. *The Barbarians also expect a \\"final battle\\", in which they would be key players in deciding the fate of the world. *The Necromancers determine that the Evils have grown too powerful and thus ally themselves with the forces of Light to restore balance to the world. *The Paladins, wracked with guilt over their actions during the Inquisition, seek justice upon Mephisto, the true cause of the bloody crusade. *The Sorceresses join the battle with their mighty spells to stop the corruption of magic by the Evils. Characters from the previous game are also present in Diablo II. The Rogues (as NPCs) are the hostesses of the player during Act I, and Sorcerers are seen regularly in Acts II and III. Unlike the original, each character has three distinct sets of skills/spells that they can use in the game. Several of the characters can also conjure magical minions, such as a Valkyrie (Amazon) or Skeletons and Golems (Necromancer). All players also have the option to hire a Rogue (Act I), a Warrior (Act II), or an Iron Wolf (a type of melee Sorcerer, Act III) to accompany them and help slay monsters. These \\"hirelings\\" have a few of their own skills and can be a great benefit to the player. Lord of Destruction Blizzard released Diablo II: Lord of Destruction on June 29, 2001. In the expansion, set after the events of Diablo II, players seek to destroy Diablo's brother, Baal. The expansion includes a new act, new items, and two new character classes: *The Druids are descended from the Barbarians and have come out of hiding in preparation for the final battle between mankind and the Evils. *The Assassins have policed the mage-clans for centuries. Now, with news that Terror and Destruction (Diablo and Baal) roam free, the Assassins unleash their fury on Hell itself. Barbarians can also be hired in the new Act. The summoned units of the expansion characters are called \\"minions\\". Hirelings can be resurrected in Lord of Destruction and can be equipped with armor and weapons. =Diablo III= Diablo III was announced at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational on June 28, 2008. Diablo III takes place 20 years after Diablo II. Five character classes are present in Diablo III: The only directly returning class is the Barbarian. The Barbarians have a variety of revamped skills at their disposal based on the use of their incredible physical prowess. The Barbarian is able to Whirlwind through crowds, cleave through swarms, leap across crags, and crush opponents upon landing. The Witch Doctor is a new character reminiscent of the Diablo II Necromancer, but with skills more traditionally associated with voodoo culture. The Witch Doctor has the ability to summon monsters, cast curses, harvest souls, and hurl poisons and explosives at enemies. The Wizard is a version of the Sorceress from Diablo II or the Sorcerer from Diablo, though it is much more than a mere elementalist. The Wizard's abilities range from shooting lightning, fire, and ice at their enemies to slowing time and teleporting around enemies and through walls. The Monk is a melee attacker, using martial arts to cripple foes, resist damage, deflect projectiles, attack with blinding speed, and land explosive killing blows. The Demon Hunter is a ranged rogue class. It was the last class to be introduced, and specializes in ranged attacks, setting traps for enemies, and evasion skills. The combat system was redone as well. Instead of the previous skill selection system used in Diablo II there is an action bar at the bottom of the screen. This change replaces the area where the potion-belt used to be in Diablo II. For the first time in the series, players are able to choose the gender of their characters upon creation. The gender of the characters affects only visuals and voices. Diablo IIIs release date was announced on March 15, 2012 and the game was released worldwide on May 15, 2012. Reaper of Souls Diablo III: Reaper of Souls is an expansion pack for Diablo III. It was revealed at Gamescom 2013. It was developed for the PC and Mac versions of Diablo III and released on March 25, 2014 for those platforms. Reaper of Souls has been ported to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. The Diablo III expansion includes a new character class, the Crusader, similar in style to the Paladin from Diablo II. The game takes place after Diablo is defeated by the Nephalem protagonist and sealed in the Black Soulstone, leading to a brief period of peace. Diablo's essence, however, still lingers and cannot be destroyed. Therefore, Tyrael hides it, even from the angels in Heaven. Right as the Soulstone is being placed so that none may touch it, a death wind passes and Malthael is revealed as the \\"Grim Reaper\\". He used to be the Archangel of Wisdom, but became the Archangel of Death after the Worldstone was destroyed and he was corrupted. He kills almost everyone in the scene, except Tyrael (it is unknown why he does not kill Tyrael, though it is suggested that his motivations are to cleanse Sanctuary of evil, including mankind, as they are born of angel and demon. Tyrael, being an angel who became mortal, contains no part of a demon) and one survivor of the Horadrim, who is able to escape and, at Tyrael's orders, relay the event to the Nephalem hero. Malthael takes the Soulstone and exits; even now that he is corrupt, he is still trying to eradicate evil. However the issue is that humans are descendants of angels and demons. Even though the demon lineage has been diluted through millennia, Malthael still views all humans as evil. He then sets out to use the power of the Black Soulstone to eradicate humans and demons, and end the Eternal Conflict forever. The enemies that the hero fights throughout this Act are a mixture of angels, persuaded by Malthael and the Soulstone, that almost seem like demons, as they are murdering thousands of innocent humans. Malthael is able to absorb the soul of every human that is killed as a result of the Soulstone and continues to grow stronger with every death. In order to finally fight Malthael, the Nephalem hero must become death, just as Malthael had become. This is why Tyrael's sword passed through Malthael in the opening scene of this Act. Tyrael was unable to kill death because he was now a mortal. The Nephalem hero is able to absorb the souls of his deceased brethren towards the end of the Act in order to fight death (Malthael). During the last battle, Malthael merges with the Black Soulstone, possibly believing he can contain Diablo's essence inside of him as well. Eventually Malthael is defeated by the Nephalem hero but this indicates that Diablo's essence has been released from within Malthael and can once again wreak havoc on the world of life. Rise of the Necromancer Diablo III: Rise of the Necromancer is a second expansion for Diablo III. It was announced at BlizzCon 2016. It was released for the PC, Mac, and console versions of Diablo III on June 27, 2017. It introduces the Necromancer class, which prefers to strike from a distance, unleashing destruction from afar. The skeletal undead under their command overwhelm enemies before they have a chance to strike, and the horrific curses the necromancers employ cripple even the most resistant of demons. Necromancers can use their throngs of undead to create diversions, or to simply open a path for their master to escape to safety. =Diablo Immortal= Diablo Immortal is the fourth installment in the Diablo franchise and is currently in development as an MMORPG for iOS and Android by Blizzard Entertainment and NetEase. It was announced during BlizzCon 2018. It takes place after the events of Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. It was met with negative reception from fans upon its announcement. The criticism has been particularly hard in social media where Blizzard has been criticized for removing comments from their YouTube trailer.https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/3/18059222/diablo-immortal- blizzard-response-blizzconhttps://www.polygon.com/2018/11/5/18064290/blizzard- diablo-immortal-reaction-explainer-blizzcon =Diablo IV= A fourth title in the series was announced at BlizzCon 2019. =Cancelled projects= Diablo Junior Diablo Junior was the working title for a cancelled single-player- only prequel to the original game. It started development after the release of Diablo II and was intended to be released on Game Boy Color and/or Game Boy Advance. It was planned to be released in three different cartridges in the style of the Pok√©mon games, each featuring a different class from original Diablo (warrior, rogue or sorcerer). The project was eventually scrapped due to high production costs. Project Hades After the release of Reaper of Souls, a development team lead by Josh Mosqueira began work on a game that would be similar to Dark Souls, code-named Hades. The project was developed from 2014 to 2016 and featured an increase in difficulty and an over-the- shoulder, third-person perspective, rather than the isometric style of previous Diablo titles. The cancellation of Hades coincided with Mosqueira leaving Blizzard. Gameplay There are many features that are universal in the Diablo series. Point and click means that the mouse is mainly used for moving and using abilities. Diablo heavily relies on a constant search for better weapons and armor, known as loot. Items are randomly generated and usually have many attributes assigned to them. Various maps in the Diablo world are randomly generated in each game, which increases the replayability. Due to its randomly generated maps and \\"hack and slash\\" nature, Diablo may be loosely considered a roguelike, though with real-time gameplay, graphics, and sound. It was in fact originally conceived and pitched to Blizzard as what amounted to a graphical roguelike.\\"[The idea for Diablo] was modified over and over until it solidified when [Dave Brevik] was in college and got hooked on an ASCII game called Moria/Angband. When we pitched Diablo to Blizzard, we pitched a turn-based, single-player DOS game.\\" The adventurer being based in a town above the dungeon and being able to use \\"scrolls of town portal\\" is a specific influence from Moria. Setting and characters The universe of Diablo is divided into three realms: the High Heavens, the Burning Hells, and the human world of Sanctuary. Ever since their creation, the angels of the High Heavens and the demons of the Burning Hells have been at war with one another. Sanctuary was created by rebel angels and demons tired of the war, with their first children being dubbed Nephalem. The descendants of the Nephalem are humanity, and become a focal point for both angels and demons who wish to influence them for their own goals due to sharing angelic and demonic heritage.Burns, Matt. Book of Tyrael October 22, 2013. Insight Editions.2013-09-10, Malthael the bad guy... wait what?. Blizzard Entertainment, accessed on 2013-09-11 The series' titular character and main antagonist is Diablo, the Lord of Terror. In the beginning of the story, he functions as one of the seven Great Evils presiding over the Burning Hells. Diablo eventually becomes the Prime Evil after absorbing the six other Great Evils, including his two brothers: Baal, the Lord of Destruction, and Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred.Diablo (manual). 1996. Irvine, Calif.: Blizzard Entertainment. Two key characters who oppose Diablo in the series are Deckard Cain, an elderly scholar and the last descendant of the original Horadrim who serves as the core narrator of lore in the first three Diablo gamesDille, Flint. Book of Cain December 13, 2011. Insight Editions.; and the Angel of Justice Tyrael, a member of the High Heavens' ruling Angiris Council who is sympathetic to humanity. Due to the ending of Diablo 2 and the events of Diablo 3, some humans begin awakening their Nephalem heritage. This awakening allows them to challenge the final Evils and eventually Diablo himself, after he manipulates events to become the Prime Evil. Though initially imprisoned, Diablo escapes and the Nephalem are perceived as a threat due to felling both angels and demons.https://us.diablo3.com/en/game/the-story-of-diablo/ Other media =Novelizations= =Comics= Tales of Sanctuary by Phil Amara, Dave Land, and Francisco Ruiz Velasco is a comic book released on November 9, 2001 by Dark Horse Comics. It features three stories: *Rage is about Azgar, a Druid in his struggle against Baal's minions. *The Hand of Naz is about Renit the Dark Stalker, a Barbarian who allies with the Necromancer Cairo to find the titular artifact. *Hatred's Bride is about Hale, a Paladin who saves a girl, Bay, from demons and seeks to protect her. In November 2011, DC Comics started producing a five-issue miniseries (Diablo III: Sword of Justice) by Aaron Williams with art and covers by Joseph LaCroix. =Merchandise= Action figures for the Barbarian character class, Unraveller, and Diablo were sold in Blizzard's online store and at retailers to complement the release of Diablo II. An 18-inch collectible statue of Diablo III's Barbarian class has been produced for sale by Sideshow Collectibles. =Heroes of the Storm= In 2015, Blizzard released Heroes of the Storm, a crossover multiplayer online battle arena video game, in which players can control over 15 characters from the Diablo universe as playable heroes. All character classes from Diablo III, popular classes from Diablo II, as well as notable characters from the franchise, including Diablo, Deckard Cain, Leoric the Skeleton King, The Butcher, Tyrael, Mephisto, Azmodan, Imperius, Auriel, and Malthael, are represented within the game. Heroes of the Storm features two Diablo-themed battlegrounds, Battlefield of Eternity and Infernal Shrines. Various soundtracks from Diablo franchise, such as Jungle (Act III) and Ancients from Diablo II, and Reaper of Souls from Diablo III, are present as background music in the game. Reception The games in the Diablo series have been well received by critics and were financial successes. Diablo II sold 4 million copies in the year it was released. Diablo III sold 3.5 million copies in the first day and 6.3 million copies in the first week. Another 1.2 million copies were given to subscribers to Blizzard's Annual Pass service. The Diablo III release was the fastest-selling PC game of all time. The titular character of the series has been well received as the franchise's overarching antagonist. GamePro ranked Diablo #14 on its list of the most diabolical video game villains of all time, noting that he \\"corrupts the soul of the hero of Diablo I in order to reincarnate in Diablo II\\". In 2010, IGN ranked Diablo 74th in the \\"Top 100 Video Game Villains\\" and they stated that \\"Just saying the word \\"demonic\\" conjures up all sorts of imagery and thoughts about strange rituals, the spilling of blood, and a host of other things Sunday school teachers warn kids about\\". Complex staff ranked Diablo 7th in their list of the 50 coolest video game villains of all time, describing the character as the \\"epitome of all evil comes in the form of a giant red behemoth that resembles the classic image of Satan as portrayed in most Judeo-Christian imagery, and he's one bad muh.\\" Diablo placed #44 on a list of top 50 video game villains featured by Guinness World Records in 2013.

They were a rival design by Maffei to the Bavarian PtL 2/2 or Glaskasten locomotives built by Krauss. In common with the Krauss engines the ML 2/2 had the axle arrangement B, semi-automatic gravity firing that enabled one-man operation, and gangways with railings, front and rear, that allowed safe transit to the coaches. The valve gear was, however, a completely different affair. These locomotives had two external cylinders each with opposing pistons that were positioned between the two axles. The axles were linked via coupling rod on the inside. In 1906 Maffei delivered the first three locomotives (railway numbers 4001‚Äì4003). In spite of the unusual, and for a two-cylinder locomotive, extremely complicated gear system, the engines proved themselves, and Maffei supplied another 21 examples up to 1908 (Nos. 4004 - 4024). The positive experience with these locomotives also led to the construction of the Class MCCi steam railbus, whose driven bogie and boiler were very similar to those of the ML 2/2. Three locomotives were sold to the United Fireclay Factories (Vereinigten Schamottefabriken) in Marktredwitz in 1922. The remaining machines were all including in the renumbering plan of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft in 1923 as 98 361-384. However, they were retired by 1924. The reason was the complicated and maintenance-intensive driving gear.

J. et al.: Forest Trees of Australia. CSIRO Publishing, CollingwoodBrooker, M. I. H. & Kleinig, D. A. 2006: Field Guide to Eucalypts, Volume 1 South-eastern Australia. Bloomings Books, Melbourne Taxonomy and naming Shining gum was first formally described in 1899 by Henry Deane and Joseph Maiden, who gave it the name Eucalyptus goniocalyx var. nitens and published the description in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. In 1913, Maiden raised the variety to species status as E. nitens, publishing the change in his book, A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. The specific epithet (nitens) is a Latin word meaning \\"shining\\", referring to the leaves, flower buds, fruit and bark of this species. Distribution Eucalyptus nitens occurs in Victoria on ranges east and north-east of Melbourne at high altitudes on the east of the Great Dividing Range from the Blue Range, Mt Monda and Mt Torbreck eastwards. It is also found on the high tablelands and mountains of southern New South Wales. There are two widely disjunct populations at high altitude (around ) at Barrington Tops and near Ebor in north eastern New South Wales. Uses In Tasmania Eucalyptus nitens is one of the most important plantation tree species along with Eucalyptus globulus (Tasmanian blue gum) and Pinus radiata (Monterey pine). The timber is mainly used in general construction but is beginning to be used in furniture where the discolourations may be a feature.VWA page Victorian Woodworkers Association Possible toxicity Extracts from Eucalyptus nitens leaves have been found to be toxic to mollusc larvae. However, this study did not compare the toxicity of Eucalyptus nitens with other species and it is not known if it is any more or less toxic than other eucalypts. Eucalyptus oil, which is extracted from the leaves of eucalypts, is known to be toxic and have antiseptic properties. Toxicological studies (in six laboratories) reported on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Australian Story program Feb 2010 found that the surface scum (foam) collected from a river supplying water to a Tasmanian town kills water fleas, mollusc larvae and human cell lines, and it was reported on the same program that \\"a large increase in cancer sufferers and a lot of people with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus\\" might have the same cause. However, studies commissioned by the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services found no reliable evidence that people who source water from this river are less healthy than people living elsewhere. Furthermore, although the Australian Story programs implied that Eucalyptus nitens plantations were the source of the toxins (which initiated widespread claims that such plantations represented 'toxic plantations' or 'poisonous plantations'), foam samples from native forest catchments devoid of both plantations and Eucalyptus nitens had previously been found to be similarly toxic. These natural toxins are highly concentrated (approximately 1400 fold) in river foam. The claims and all available scientific data relating to the issue were reviewed by an Environment Protection Authority appointed group (established by Premier Bartlett) of eminent scientists from the University of Tasmania, Griffith University, Monash University and CSIRO in the first half of 2010. It was conclusively found by them that the water quality of the George River is of excellent standard, the cancer rates within the catchment are no higher than the Tasmanian average, and that any concern raised regarding the toxins in water foam was largely due to erroneous sampling techniques in the aforementioned toxicological studies. In June 2011 an internal ABC investigation found that the programs in question fell short of ABC editorial standards relating to contextual accuracy and balance. After the Australian Story went to air the Tasmanian Director of Public Health, Dr Roscoe Taylor, had had an activated carbon purification system added to the St Helens water treatment plant. Dr Taylor stated at the time of its installation that \\"No scientific evidence has been presented to confirm the drinking water in St Helens was unsafe for human health before this precaution was taken\\". The filter was not removed after the review panel published its report. The rebuttal of the George River Water's Panels deliberations on the scientists research and findings (NIWA's scientist, Dr Chris Hickey) sent to the ABC in July 2010 was posted on the ABC website at the time of the ABC's managing director's statement in June 2011.

It was launched in 2005. The aim of the award was \\"to encourage emerging writers, contribute to Australian literary culture, and fulfil the ABC's charter by reflecting the diversity of the Australian community and adding to a sense of national identity\\". The award was supported by ABC Local Radio and ABC TV. The prize was a A$10,000 advance and publication through ABC Books. The winning book was also broadcast on ABC Local Radio and published as an audio book by ABC Audio. The award had four judges, three of whom changed each year. It comprised ABC Books commissioning editor Jo Mackay, a fiction writer, a local ABC radio broadcaster, and someone involved in literary education or debate such as a newspaper literary editor. Background The award was the brainchild of the ABC Books publisher, Stuart Neal, and Jo Mackay, who were concerned about the falling sales of literary fiction.Grunseit, Paula (2008) \\"Getting recognised\\", goodreading, April 2008 Jo Mackay said that they took pride in the fact that the competition, unlike most other new manuscript competitions which are geared to young writers, has no age restrictions. Stuart Neal argued that such competitions are important. He said that \\"if competitions like this can unearth the next Tim Winton, for example, then there's a major economic benefit, as well as the benefit to the literary world, of unknown writers getting a go. If you don't do things like this you don't find the next hot Australian fiction writer\\". However, he said that commercial potential was not a criterion used by the judges. History The inaugural winner was The Pilo Family Circus by Will Elliott. It went on to win the Aurealis Award for Best Novel, the Ditmar Award for Best Horror Novel and was shortlisted for the International Horror Guild Award. There were some 900 entries in the first year, and 300-400 entries the next two years. Early judges of the award included novelists Delia Falconer and Luke Davies, and literary editor of The Australian Murray Waldren. The award came to an end when ABC books was taken over by Harper Collins in 2009 ending fiction publishing.

Coritiba won the championship for the first time, beating Bangu in the finals; both qualified for the 1986 Copa Libertadores. This season bears the bizarre distinction of being one of the few seasons in recorded top-level professional worldwide football history in which a team won the national championship outright while scoring fewer goals than it allowed. Coritiba managed to win the title despite finishing with a negative overall goal differential. Another example is the 1986 K League, another split phase competition where the team that won a phase performed badly in another, before winning a finals knock out competition to win the championship. Uberl√¢ndia finished with a goal differential of zero, but ended in 37th place. Format There was a first phase (which consisted of two rounds), a second phase, a semifinal, and a final. During the first two phases, a win counted as two points while a draw counted as one, as was common at the time. ;First phase, Groups A and B: 20 clubs, selected from past championship records, divided into two groups of 10, with each club playing only the clubs of the other group. There were two rounds played. The winner of each group in each round would qualify (four teams in all). In addition, the two teams in each group with the best overall points from both rounds added together would qualify for the second phase. Therefore, a total of eight teams would qualify from Groups A and B. ;First phase, Groups C and D: 24 clubs, 22 selected from their records in the 1984 state championships, plus the finalists of the 1984 S√©rie B, divided into two groups of 12, playing in two rounds, with each club playing only the clubs of their own group. Again, two full rounds were played. The winner of each round in each group would qualify (four teams in all). In addition, the two teams in each group with the best overall points from both rounds added together would qualify for the second phase. Therefore, a total of eight teams would qualify from Groups C and D. ;Second phase: The 16 qualified teams of the first phase were placed into four mini-leagues (or groups) with four teams each.

The songs commute between Irish folk, bluegrass, country and roots music.  History  The Permanent Cure was formed in 1976 on St. Stephen's Green in Dublin, Ireland. The band's members were George Kaye, who was singer/songwriter, was playing on fiddle and on guitar, Dermot O'Connor, who was singer/songwriter, was playing on mandolin and on guitar, Leo Gillespie, who was singer/songwriter, was playing on guitar and blues harp and Pat Gibbs, who was singer, and was playing on clarinet, saxophone, piano and chromatic harmonica. They appeared on prime time in Irish Television (also in Gay Byrne's Late Late Show) and played in Dublin, Cork and Galway. With the unique music and the humor, between madness and typical black humor they quickly got the reputation of the \\"world's only acoustic punk band\\". Then, they recorded their first album \\"The Permanent Cure works..!\\" created by the record label Chrysalis Records. The band played with, among others, Dubliners and various other folk bands at Guinness concerts throughout the country. The band broke with various solo projects in 1998. The Permanent Cure was back to life in 2007. Leo Gillespie, Patrick Gibbs and Dermot O'Connor left the band, but Thomas Gallagher, Lars M√∂ller and Andreas Plate became new members of the band. It is now performing mainly in Germany.

Magazine Pg. 23 is a British guitarist who was a member of Ultravox, Magazine and Visage. Biography =Early career= Robin Simon played guitar in an original local band in and around Halifax in the early to mid-1970s, including a line-up which featured future Ultravox member Billy Currie.\\"AjantaMusic\\", Independent Artists Company He moved to London in 1975 and later joined the punk pop band Ians Radio (later called Neo) in 1976. Neo were one of the bands on the early London punk live scene. They featured on the Live at the Vortex album and supported Ultravox several times at the Marquee club in London, before Simon was offered the guitarist position in Ultravox.\\"Neo \\", punkmodpop =Ultravox= Simon joined Ultravox, replacing Stevie Shears, in 1977, bringing a more multi-dimensional sound to the band. This was due to his pioneering use of a guitar multi effects pedals sound, including a guitar monitor amp with tremolo effect. Timed echo, on the song Slow Motion, plus Chorus, Flanger, fuzz, wah-wah, delay and compressor pedals created a guitar sound unique at that time. He co-wrote the single \\"Slow Motion\\" from their 1978 third album, Systems of Romance, the original Ultravox line-up's only official hit. \\"[78] Robin Simon ‚Äì guitar (ex-NEO) repl. Shears ... [Apr 79] Robin ... departed to Magazine.\\"Welbourn Tekh, \\"Ultravox ‚Äì Systems of Romance (review)\\", Head Heritage In addition to playing all guitars on Systems of Romance, Simon co-produced it with the band, Conny Plank (of Kraftwerk fame) and Dave Hutchins. He also pioneered the use of synthesizers that were put through guitar effects pedals, prior to Gary Numan's echoing of the technique, notably on the track \\"Quiet Men\\". In early 1979, after the US tour with the band and no longer on Island Records, having been dropped by the label despite increased sales and positive reviews, John Foxx left Ultravox. Simon left some months later. He felt that without John Foxx, who had founded and named the band, and was its main songwriter, a new singer could cause the band to lose its integrity. While on the USA tour, Simon met Grace Weisbard, and returned to New York three months later to marry her on 25 April 1979. He lived in Coney Island, New York, for a year, and jammed with, among others, a local electro post-punk band called The FutantsMetamatic Forum: Robin Simon ‚Äì The Futants (along with Defunkt keyboardist Martin Fischer). Grace Simon (n√©e Weisbard) moved to England with him, during his time with Magazine, before returning to New York. =Magazine= After Returning to England, Simon joined Magazine in 1980, replacing John McGeoch.New Musical Express, 26 July 1980 \\"Magazine have already recruited a replacement for John. He is former Ultravox guitarist Robin Simon who has been rehearsing with the band for the past three weeks and has already been writing material with them.\\" After Magazine's tour of the United States and Australia/New Zealand plus a later live appearance with them the movie Urgh! A Music War and on the German TV show Rockpalast, he moved on from the band to record with John Foxx again, on the Garden album. He played on the song \\"Saddest Quay\\", from Magazine keyboards player Dave Formula's solo album, Satellite Sweetheart, in 2009.Larkin, Colin (1992) \\"The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and new wave Music\\", Guinness Publishing, =John Foxx= Simon contributed to Foxx's solo albums The Garden (1981), The Golden Section (1983), and In Mysterious Ways (1985). He also performed on stage during his 1983 tour and at a special John Foxx & the Maths show at London's Roundhouse in 2010. =Humania= Ultravox had gone on to greater success with Midge Ure fronting the band, but when Ure left the band in 1988, Billy Currie formed a new band which later included Simon. Using the early name of Uvox at rehearsal stage, they later used the name Humania. Live gigs at London's Marquee club and the borderline followed, though Currie later moved on from the project to reform a new lineup of Ultravox.Grant, Steven, Robbins, Ira, & Reno, Brad \\"Ultravox\\", Trouser Press The band was short-lived, with Currie subsequently forming another incarnation of Ultravox without Simon.

It uses original music from the Oscar Straus 1908 operetta of the same name, which was based on George Bernard Shaw‚Äôs 1894 play Arms and the Man. Unable to come to terms with Shaw, the studio used a story to which it already had rights:The operetta was filmed for television in 1955. Ris√´ Stevens starred with Eddie Albert. the Ferenc Moln√°r play The Guardsman, (originally Test≈ër) . The plot centers on the romantic misunderstandings and professional conflicts between two recently married opera singers, played by Metropolitan Opera star Ris√´ Stevens (in her film debut) and Nelson Eddy, who perform excerpts from the operetta during the film. This screenplay was written by Leonard Lee and Keith Winter. The Guardsman‚Äîa huge hit on Broadway in 1924‚Äî was brought to the screen in 1931, with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne reprising their stage roles as married actors. Plot The opening panel reads: ‚ÄúThis story takes place in Balkany. The time we cannot fix it. When Russians Prussians Turks and Czechs were reticent to mix it.‚Äù The film was produced in June‚ÄìJuly 1941. The Axis powers had already invaded and subjugated the Balkans. Karl Lang and Maria Lanyi are not only successful opera stars, they have also recently been married. However, both suffer pangs of jealousy where the other is concerned, since both receive quite a bit of attention from members of the opposite sex. Karl's jealousy is heightened, however, when Maria tells him that she intends to leave their current musical comedy career and seek a career in opera. Karl sees it as a pretext to spend more time away from him. In order to test his jealous suspicions, Karl hatches a plan to impersonate a Russian singer, Vassily Vassilievitch, and romance Maria in that guise. The plan goes awry, however, when Maria seemingly begins to respond to Vassily's advances. Unknown to Karl, Maria has seen through his impersonation and is thrilled that her husband would go to such lengths for her attention. Even the couple's dog sees through Karl's disguise. When events come to a head with an on-stage confrontation between a disguised Karl and Maria, she reveals her knowledge all along that Vassily was really Karl, and the two live happily ever after, except, of course, for Maria's continued flirtations. Cast * Nelson Eddy as Karl Lang, aka Vassily VassilievitchAccording to the American Film Institute catalog, the spelling of Karl‚Äôs alias varies among copyright documents, and never appears on screen. * Ris√´ Stevens as Maria Lanyi, Karl's Wife * Nigel Bruce as Bernard Fischer, Critic * Florence Bates as Madame 'Pugsie' Helene *Dorothy Raye as Magda (as Dorothy Gilmore) * Nydia Westman as Liesel, Maria's Maid *Max Barwyn as Anton, Karl's Valet * Charles Judels as Klementor, Double Eagle Manager Reception  In his November 1, 1941, review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther told readers > ‚ÄúOnce you are properly acquainted with the contradictory fact that Metro's > \\"The Chocolate Soldier\\" ...is not Oscar Straus's \\"Chocolate Soldier‚Äù... but > is Ferenc Molnar's \\"The Guardsman\\" in a versatile disguise, then we can > safely commend it as a tidy and tuneful musical film....\\"The Guardsman,\\" by > previous demonstration, is a story that's hard to beat; the score from the > Straus operetta, on which the present title is based, is packed with > melodious songs...

As to the performances, Crowther praised Stevens as ‚Äú...a charming and talented singer with a surprising ability to act ...nicely suited for the role of the wife to a man who is so jealous that he assumes the disguise of another in order to test her.‚Äù On the other hand, Crowther observed of her co-star: ‚ÄúMr. Eddy is an utter revelation in the character and costume of a mad Cossack, which is what he temporarily pretends to be. As a matter of fact, he manages to alter his style so much that we have a generous suggestion: why not stick to the Russian...?‚Äù On TCM.com, Leonard Maltin gives the film 2 out of 4 stars, commenting: ‚Äú Much too talky and not enough music.‚Äù Awards The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: * Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (Karl Freund) * Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture: Scoring of a Musical Film (Herbert Stothart) and Musical Adaptation and Direction (Bronislau Kaper) * Sound Recording (Douglas Shearer) References External links  * Category:1941 films Category:1941 musical films Category:American films Category:American musical films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on works by Ferenc Moln√°r Category:Films directed by Roy Del Ruth Category:Films set in Vienna Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films produced by Victor Saville ","title":"The Chocolate Soldier (film)"},{"id":"18175533","text":"Winnie the Witch (also known as Winnie and Wilbur since 2016) is a series of nineteen picture books, written by Valerie Thomas and illustrated by Korky Paul.

Born in present-day Ena, Gifu, she was the founder of what is today Jissen Women's University. Biography Utako Shimoda was born into a samurai family as Seki Hirao, in Gifu Prefecture. In the run up to the Meiji Restoration, the Hirao family were firmly on the side of the Emperor, and when the Shogunate fell, Utako's father was given a prominent position in Tokyo, where the family moved in 1870. Seki was well-educated and recognised as an excellent poet, so much so that the empress changed her name to Utako (poem child). In 1879 she married the swordsman Takeo Shimoda, but when he fell ill Utako was forced to open her house as a private school, teaching poetry and Chinese classics to the wives of a number of ex-samurai officials. Takeo died in 1884 and Utako threw herself into her work as a full-time educator, becoming a teacher and principal at the Girls' Peer School. Her interest in women's education took her to Europe (where she enjoyed an audience with Queen Victoria) and America for two years, returning to Japan in 1895 with a raft of new ideas to overhaul Japanese education for women, with equality of education for men and women being the main tenet. In 1899 she established Jissen Women's University for Japanese women and female Chinese exchange students. Utako Shimoda's vision and work did much to modernise and improve women's education in Japan (she is even responsible for the navy-style girls' school uniform), not just in the realm of improving the mind, but in physical education as well. She was an early student of Jigoro Kano, the founder of modern Judo. She founded three women's schools and wrote over 80 books. She died from pneumonia in 1936, aged 82.

Plot The story, set in contemporary Italy, portrays the destruction of a young couple's marriage caused by Gioconda Dianti (Theda Bara), a beautiful but highly vindictive young woman. After being deserted by her former lover Luigi, she longs for revenge and vows, \\"As this man has done to me, so shall I do to all men. From now on my heart is ice, my passion consuming fire.

Soon she focuses her spiteful intentions on Lucio Sattella (Paul Doucet), a talented sculptor she encounters on a beach. Gioconda quickly manages to charm her way into his life by visiting Lucio's studio and agreeing to model for his masterpiece, a statue of a sphinx. Her flirtatious manner and enticing looks quickly captivate the artist, who is already married but falls hopelessly in love with her, so much so that he abandons his wife Silvia (Doris Heywood) and their three-year-old daughter Beata (Jane Lee). Later, torn by the emotional stresses of his lust for Gioconda, his love of art, and guilt for leaving his family, a despondent Lucio attempts suicide. He shoots himself but survives. Silvia then nurses her severely wounded husband back to health; nevertheless, he returns to Gioconda. Enraged with jealousy and now desperate, Silvia confronts the sinister interloper in Lucio's studio, where the \\"vamp\\" continues to ridicule Silvia's efforts to win back her husband. A struggle between the two women ensues as Gioconda attempts to destroy Lucio's sculpture. The sphinx statue is knocked over, falls on Silvia, and crushes and maims her hands. Finally, the crippled wife discards any lingering devotion she has to Lucio and leaves him. Tormented by remorse and his rising hatred for the ruthless siren who has ruined his life, the once hopeful artist descends into madness, becoming a \\"raving maniac\\".

Two states in particular, Ohio and Kansas, drew significant media coverage during the summer and early fall of 1915 for their efforts to prevent or limit the public's exposure to the film. In a news item dated June 30 and titled \\"'Devil's Daughter' Censored\\", Variety updates its subscribers on the situation in Cincinnati: Following the midnight screening at his theater, the Grand's manager and the secretary of Cincinnati's retail association traveled to Columbus on June 28 \\"to protest\\" the censors' cuts to the film and to ask authorities at the state capital \\"to reconsider\\" their order.

Bara herself is the focus in most of those reviews, for in the months prior to the release of The Devil's Daughter she had greatly increased her celebrity in three other Fox releases, most notably by her performance in A Fool There Was, which was also directed by Frank Powell. Like that film, The Devil's Daughter again showcased Bara as a femme fatale, a \\"vamp\\" who lures men with her exotic beauty and sexuality and then drains them‚Äînot of their actual blood like the vampire character developed by Irish novelist Bram Stoker‚Äîonly of their will and complete ability to resist her control. In assessing Bara's return to that role, the critic for Motion Picture News, George Proctor, recognizes in his review her screen appeal and its association with the film's artistry. He also commends the performances of several other cast members: Many newspapers across the country in 1915 also complimented the film and the power of Bara's sultry portrayal of Gioconda.

Arthur was raised to be a farmer, like his father before him. He attended public schools along with his siblings, and worked hard at excelling in the technological fields of study, and labored on the farm during term breaks. From an early age, he exhibited an interest in science and an aptitude for mechanics. When his family boarded George Poe for several years, he began to assist the inventor with his work. Poe, by then nearly blind and paralytic, soon discovered the boy had both the technical skills and dexterity to perform fine metal work, and could act as his veritable hands and eyes on tasks of minute detail. Poe approached the Ostrander family with a proposition; if Arthur would assist him full-time, he and his two assistants, (J. P. Jackson, M.D., and Francis Morgan, M.D.) would privately tutor Arthur through high school. The family consented, and he exited the schooling system to become a full-time member of the artificial respiration device team at age ten. He worked with Poe, Jackson, and Morgan for the next several years, and toured with them when they demonstrated the artificial respirator in 1907. In doing so he received a rigorous education in science, in addition to classes in Classical Studies and the arts provided quid pro quo by his tutors.

Sum rules are used to describe the properties of many physical systems, including solids, atoms, atomic nuclei, and nuclear constituents such as protons and neutrons. The sum rules are derived from general principles, and are useful in situations where the behavior of individual energy levels is too complex to be described by a precise quantum-mechanical theory. In general, sum rules are derived by using Heisenberg's quantum-mechanical algebra to construct operator equalities, which are then applied to the particles or energy levels of a system. Derivation of sum rules Assume that the Hamiltonian \\\\hat{H} has a complete set of eigenfunctions n\\\\rangle with eigenvalues E_n: : \\\\hat{H} n\\\\rangle = E_n n\\\\rangle. For the Hermitian operator \\\\hat{A} we define the repeated commutator \\\\hat{C}^{(k)} iteratively by: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{C}^{(0)} & \\\\equiv \\\\hat{A}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{C}^{(1)} & \\\\equiv [\\\\hat{H}, \\\\hat{A}] = \\\\hat{H}\\\\hat{A}-\\\\hat{A}\\\\hat{H}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{C}^{(k)} & \\\\equiv [\\\\hat{H}, \\\\hat{C}^{(k-1)}], \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ k=1,2,\\\\ldots \\\\end{align} The operator \\\\hat{C}^{(0)} is Hermitian since \\\\hat{A} is defined to be Hermitian. The operator \\\\hat{C}^{(1)} is anti-Hermitian: : \\\\left(\\\\hat{C}^{(1)}\\\\right)^\\\\dagger = (\\\\hat{H}\\\\hat{A})^\\\\dagger-(\\\\hat{A}\\\\hat{H})^\\\\dagger = \\\\hat{A}\\\\hat{H} - \\\\hat{H}\\\\hat{A} = -\\\\hat{C}^{(1)}. By induction one finds: : \\\\left(\\\\hat{C}^{(k)}\\\\right)^\\\\dagger = (-1)^k \\\\hat{C}^{(k)} and also : \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{C}^{(k)}  n \\\\rangle = (E_m-E_n)^k \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle. For a Hermitian operator we have : \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle^2 = \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle^\\\\ast = \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle \\\\langle n  \\\\hat{A}  m \\\\rangle. Using this relation we derive: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\langle m  [\\\\hat{A}, \\\\hat{C}^{(k)} ]  m \\\\rangle &= \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A} \\\\hat{C}^{(k)}  m \\\\rangle - \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{C}^{(k)}\\\\hat{A}  m \\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_n \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A} n\\\\rangle\\\\langle n \\\\hat{C}^{(k)}  m \\\\rangle - \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{C}^{(k)} n\\\\rangle\\\\langle n \\\\hat{A}  m \\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_n \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A} n\\\\rangle \\\\langle n \\\\hat{A} m \\\\rangle (E_n-E_m)^k - (E_m-E_n)^k \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A} n\\\\rangle\\\\langle n \\\\hat{A}  m \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_n (1-(-1)^k) (E_n- E_m)^k \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle^2. \\\\end{align} The result can be written as : \\\\langle m  [\\\\hat{A}, \\\\hat{C}^{(k)} ]  m \\\\rangle = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\mbox{if }k\\\\mbox{ is even} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\sum_n (E_n-E_m)^k \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle^2, & \\\\mbox{if }k\\\\mbox{ is odd}. \\\\end{cases} For k=1 this gives: : \\\\langle m  [\\\\hat{A}, [\\\\hat{H},\\\\hat{A}  m \\\\rangle = 2 \\\\sum_n (E_n-E_m) \\\\langle m  \\\\hat{A}  n \\\\rangle^2.

Biography He was born in Thiais, France. His family lived at 2 Place des Vosges in Paris in a historic 17th-century building in which he lived all his life. Dufr√©noy went to school at the Oratoriens Catholic school (√©cole Massillon, 2 quai des C√©lestins, Paris 4√®me) from age 5 to 17. At 17, after some hesitation between the study of architecture and painting, Dufr√©noy chose to become a painter. Dufr√©noy studied with Jean-Paul Laurens at the Acad√©mie Julian from 1887. In 1890 he began a period of two years as the only pupil of D√©sir√© Laugier, from whom he learned a great deal. His early works which he started showing in 1895 were very much influenced by Impressionism. In 1902 he made his first trip to Venice, a place he fell in love with and would return to almost every year until 1939, except during World War I. He discovered the great Venetian masters Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. Art critic Marius-Ary Leblond wrote that his Venice works \\"follow in the great tradition of the Venetian Masters, he puts himself in the direct line of succession to the Italians; he remains an opulent and aristocratic Venetian in his works.\\" He started participating in major shows, among them the Salon International de Reims in 1903 (with three canvases); and in 1904 the Salon des Ind√©pendants. He became a member of the Salon d'Automne, of which he would later become a committee member and a board member and to which he remained faithful until his last years. Bernheim- Jeune (an important Paris art dealer) bought his \\"Rue √† l'omnibus\\" at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. In 1905 he traveled to Italy to paint with his friend Pierre Girieud. In 1907 Marius-Ary Leblond published a very positive review of Dufr√©noy's work, and ranked him among the best in his generation. His gallerist from then on was Druet, who also supported artists such as Bonnard, Derain, Friesz, Marquet, and Vuillard. After Druet closed in 1934 his main gallerist was Katia Granoff. On 29 January 1914 he married Marguerite de Baroncelli-Javon. She was the sister of Marquis Folco de Baroncelli-Javon and of the filmmaker Jacques de Baroncelli. Folco was a well known \\"manadier\\" who raised bulls for bullfights on his estate in Camargue and befriended Buffalo Bill. Along with Marguerite, who was queen of the F√©librige from 1906 to 1913, Folco was a friend of proven√ßal poets Mistral and Joseph d'Arbaud. Georges and Marguerite had two daughters and two sons. Vue de Lyon by Georges Dufr√©noy: poster advertising Salon d'Automne of 1937 Georges fought during World War I and continued painting and selling his works successfully afterwards.

These symptoms can be seen in many different psychiatric and mental disorders, which can lead to more specific diagnoses of an individual's condition. However, some of the situations might not fall under specific categories listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Minor depressive disorder is an example of one of these nonspecific diagnoses, as it is a disorder classified in the DSM-IV-TR under the category Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS). The classification of NOS depressive disorders is up for debate. Minor depressive disorder as a term was never an officially accepted term, but was listed in Appendix B of the DSM-IV-TR. This is the only version of the DSM that contains the term, as the prior versions and the most recent edition, DSM-5, does not mention it. A person is considered to have minor depressive disorder if they experience 2 to 4 depressive symptoms, with one of them being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, during a 2-week period. The person must not have experienced the symptoms for 2 years and there must not have been one specific event that caused the symptoms to arise. Although not all cases of minor depressive disorder are deemed in need of treatment, some cases are treated similarly to major depressive disorder. This treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), anti-depressant medication, and combination therapy. A lot of research supports the notion that minor depressive disorder is an early stage of major depressive disorder, or that it is simply highly predictive of subsequent major depressive disorder.  Signs and symptoms  Minor depressive disorder is very similar to major depressive disorder in the symptoms present. Generally, a person's mood is affected by thoughts and feelings of being sad or down on themself or by a loss of interest in nearly all activities. People can experience ups and downs in their life everyday where an event, action, stress or many other factors can affect their feelings on that day. However, depression occurs when those feelings of sadness persist for longer than a few weeks. A person is considered to have minor depressive disorder if they experience 2 to 4 depressive symptoms during a 2-week period. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lists the major depressive symptoms. Depressed mood most of the day and/or loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities must be experienced by the individual to be considered to have minor depressive disorder. Without either of these two symptoms, the disorder is not classified as minor depressive disorder. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss or weight gain without trying to diet (an increase/decrease in appetite can provide clues as well), insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or psychomotor retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, and feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt. All of these signs can compound on each other to create the last major symptom group of minor depressive disorder: thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, plans to commit suicide, or a suicide attempt. Minor depressive disorder differs from major depressive disorder in the number of symptoms present with 5 or more symptoms necessary for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Both disorders require either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities to be one of the symptoms and the symptoms need to be present for two weeks or longer. Symptoms also must be present for the majority of the length of a day and present for a majority of the days in the two-week period. Diagnosis can only occur if the symptoms cause \\"clinically significant distress or impairment\\". Dysthymia consists of the same depressive symptoms, but its main differentiable feature is its longer-lasting nature as compared to minor depressive disorder. Dysthymia was replaced in the DSM-5 by persistent depressive disorder, which combined dysthymia with chronic major depressive disorder.  Treatment  Treatment of minor depressive disorder has not been studied as extensively as major depressive disorder. Although there are often similarities in the treatments used, there are also differences in what may work better for the treatment of minor depressive disorder. Some third-party payers do not pay to cover treatment for minor depressive disorder. The leading treatment techniques for minor depressive disorder are the use of antidepressants and therapy. Typically, patients with minor depression were treated by watchful waiting, prescribed antidepressants, and given brief supportive counseling, but Problem-Solving Treatment for Primary Care (PST-PC) is a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy that has gained popularity. In one study, PST-PC and Paroxetine, an antidepressant, were shown to be equally effective in significantly reducing symptoms. In another study, PST-PC was compared with the more typical care of the time and shown to reduce symptoms more quickly. Although the use of antidepressants has been widely used, not all agree that it is an appropriate treatment for some minor depression disorder settings. Another alternative that has been researched is the use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). This herbal treatment has been studied by various groups with various results. Some studies show evidence of the treatment being helpful to treat minor depression, but others show that it does no better than the placebo. History At its core, minor depressive disorder is the same illness as major depressive disorder with its symptoms being less pronounced. This ties its history closely to that of major depressive disorder. Depression in the past has largely been shrouded in mystery, as its causes and appropriate treatment were largely unknown. By the 1950s, it was clear that depression could be both a mental and largely physical disease, thus being able to be treated through both psychotherapy and medication. When the DSM-IV- TR was created and major depressive disorder was spelled out more clearly, there still seemed to be an uncategorized range of depression. People in this category did not have a complete set of symptoms in order to be diagnosed with major depression, but still were undoubtedly depressed. The DSM-IV-TR solution to this uncatergorized range of depression was to create Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). This group of not specified disorders included minor depressive disorder. In the recent switch to the current DSM-5, minor depressive disorder was dropped from the list of depression disorders. With the disappearance of minor depressive disorder from the DSM-5, there has been confusion between dysthymic disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and minor depressive disorder. Dysthymic disorder was a subsection in the DSM-IV- TR under mood disorders. In the DSM-5, dysthymia is relabeled as \\"Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)\\". There are differences between persistent depressive disorder and minor depressive disorder including: length of symptom presence, the number of symptoms present, and recurrent periods. The diagnosis of minor depressive disorder has historically been harder to outline, which could have perhaps lead to the disappearance of the disorder. The DSM-IV-TR includes a statement detailing the difficulty of diagnosis, \\"symptoms meeting research criteria for minor depressive disorder can be difficult to distinguish from periods of sadness that are an inherent part of everyday life\\".

It offered roughly double the range, increased off-boresight tracking angles, and considerably improved reliability. Originally intended to be replaced by the further improved AN/APQ-167, modernized F-5s have typically moved to the entirely new AN/APG-69 instead. Like the earlier APQ-153, the APQ-159 was a purely air-to- air radar system. It had four primary modes of operation, two search modes with different ranges using a simple B-Scope display, a C-Scope gunnery display with ranging and automatic lock-on (\\"dogfight mode\\"), and a similar mode used with the AIM-9 Sidewinder that calculated the missile's engagement envelope and provided cues to the pilot to fly into the envelope. The radar offered no air-to-ground modes at all, nor was it capable of firing the AIM-7 Sparrow in spite of its BVR-capable range. The APQ-159's primary upgrade was the addition of a new planar phased array antenna, replacing the -153's parabolic dish. This made the antenna smaller front-to-back which allowed it to be pointed to higher angles within the nose. It also greatly reduced the sidelobes, which improved gain and allowed the range to be greatly increased from the -153's roughly to the -159's . The electronics were also upgraded, offering increased frequency agility and dramatically improving mean time between failure (MTBF) from about 62 hours in the -153 to 125 in the latest models of the -159, which have actually demonstrated 150 hours MTBF in the field. Several versions of the APQ-159 were built over its lifetime. It was initially offered in four separate models with the same radar electronics, but different displays. The APQ-159-1 and -2 models used a display that could operate in television mode to operate the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, while the -3 and -4 lacked this capability. The -1 and -3 models had a single display, while the -2 and -4's had dual displays for use in the two seater F-5F. The APQ-159-5 version was a product improvement that further improved reliability and reduced weight to the same as the original APQ-153, making in-field upgrades much simpler. The final version was the APQ-159-7. Technologies of AN/APQ-159 have been adopted for another radar, the AN/APQ-167. This is similar to the dual-display AN/APQ-159,Jane's Avionics, 1991-92 edition, Jane's Information Group, 1991. which thus is essentially the AN/APQ-159 equivalent of AN/APQ-157. However, the new radar was not adopted by foreign customers originally targeted, and instead, it is used on Cessna T-47A Citation by USAF for radar operator training.APQ-167 on T-47 See also *Northrop F-5 *AN/APQ-153 References *AN/APQ-159(V) radar (United States), Jane's Avionics, July 12, 2002 External links *USDynamics AN/APQ-159 Category:Aircraft radars Category:Military radars of the United States Category:Radars of the United States Air Force Category:Emerson Electric radars ","title":"AN/APQ-159"},{"id":"18176598","text":"Destruction is a 1915 American silent drama film directed by Will S.

Magnetohydrodynamics studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids - in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Observed properties of the waves (e.g. period, wavelength, amplitude, temporal and spatial signatures (what is the shape of the wave perturbation?), characteristic scenarios of the wave evolution (is the wave damped?), combined with a theoretical modelling of the wave phenomena (dispersion relations, evolutionary equations, etc.), may reflect physical parameters of the corona which are not accessible in situ, such as the coronal magnetic field strength and Alfv√©n velocity and coronal dissipative coefficients. Originally, the method of MHD coronal seismology was suggested by Y. Uchida in 1970 for propagating waves, and B. Roberts et al. in 1984 for standing waves, but was not practically applied until the late 90s due to a lack of necessary observational resolution. Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's seismology, helioseismology, and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kind are used to probe a medium. The theoretical foundation of coronal seismology is the dispersion relation of MHD modes of a plasma cylinder: a plasma structure which is nonuniform in the transverse direction and extended along the magnetic field. This model works well for the description of a number of plasma structures observed in the solar corona: e.g. coronal loops, prominence fibrils, plumes, various filaments. Such a structure acts as a waveguide of MHD waves. This discussion is adapted from Nakariakov & Verwichte (2009). Types of magnetohydrodynamic waves There are several distinct kinds of MHD modes which have quite different dispersive, polarisation, and propagation properties: * Kink (or transverse) modes, which are oblique fast magnetoacoustic (also known as magnetosonic waves) guided by the plasma structure; the mode causes the displacement of the axis of the plasma structure. These modes are weakly compressible, but could nevertheless be observed with imaging instruments as periodic standing or propagating displacements of coronal structures, e.g. coronal loops. The frequency of transverse or \\"kink\\" modes is given by the following expression: :\\\\omega_{K}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2k_{z}B^{2}}{\\\\mu(\\\\rho_{i}+\\\\rho_{e})}} For kink modes the parameter the azimuthal wave number in a cylindrical model of a loop, m is equal to 1, meaning that the cylinder is swaying with fixed ends. * Sausage modes, which are also oblique fast magnetoacoustic waves guided by the plasma structure; the mode causes expansions and contractions of the plasma structure, but does not displace its axis. These modes are compressible and cause significant variation of the absolute value of the magnetic field in the oscillating structure. The frequency of sausage modes is given by the following expression: :\\\\omega_{S}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\\\\mu\\\\rho_{e}}} For sausage modes the parameter m is equal to 0; this would be interpreted as a \\"breathing\\" in and out, again with fixed endpoints. * Longitudinal (or slow, or acoustic) modes, which are slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating mainly along the magnetic field in the plasma structure; these mode are essentially compressible. The magnetic field perturbation in these modes is negligible. The frequency of slow modes is given by the following expression: :\\\\omega_{L}=\\\\sqrt{k^{2}_{z}\\\\left ( \\\\frac{C_{s}^{2}C_{A}^{2}}{C_{s}^{2}+C_{A}^{2}} \\\\right )} Where we define C_{s} as the sound speed and C_{A} as the Alfv√©n velocity. * Torsional (Alfv√©n or twist) modes are incompressible transverse perturbations of the magnetic field along certain individual magnetic surfaces. In contrast with kink modes, torsional modes cannot be observed with imaging instruments, as they do not cause the displacement of either the structure axis or its boundary. :\\\\omega_{A}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\\\\mu\\\\rho_{i}}} Observations TRACE image of a coronal arcade Wave and oscillatory phenomena are observed in the hot plasma of the corona mainly in EUV, optical and microwave bands with a number of spaceborne and ground-based instruments, e.g. the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH, see the Nobeyama radio observatory). Phenomenologically, researchers distinguish between compressible waves in polar plumes and in legs of large coronal loops, flare-generated transverse oscillations of loops, acoustic oscillations of loops, propagating kink waves in loops and in structures above arcades (an arcade being a close collection of loops in a cylindrical structure, see image to right), sausage oscillations of flaring loops, and oscillations of prominences and fibrils (see solar prominence), and this list is continuously updated. Coronal seismology is one of the aims of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. A mission to send a spacecraft as close as 9 solar radii from the sun, Parker Solar Probe, is planned for launch in 2015 and aims to provide in-situ measurements of the solar magnetic field, solar wind and corona. It should include a magnetometer and plasma wave sensor, allowing unprecedented observations for coronal seismology. Conclusions The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density scale height, \\"fine structure\\" (by which is meant the variation in structure of an inhomogeneous structure such as an inhomogeneous coronal loop) and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups. Work relating to the coronal magnetic field was mentioned earlier. It has been shown that sufficiently broadband slow magnetoacoustic waves, consistent with currently available observations in the low frequency part of the spectrum, could provide the rate of heat deposition sufficient to heat a coronal loop. Regarding the density scale height, transverse oscillations of coronal loops that have both variable circular cross-sectional area and plasma density in the longitudinal direction have been studied theoretically. A second order ordinary differential equation has been derived describing the displacement of the loop axis. Together with boundary conditions, solving this equation determines the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes. The coronal density scale height could then be estimated by using the observed ratio of the fundamental frequency and first overtone of loop kink oscillations. Little is known of coronal fine structure. Doppler shift oscillations in hot active region loops obtained with the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation instrument (SUMER) aboard SOHO have been studied. The spectra were recorded along a 300 arcsec slit placed at a fixed position in the corona above the active regions. Some oscillations showed phase propagation along the slit in one or both directions with apparent speeds in the range of 8‚Äì102 km per second, together with distinctly different intensity and line width distributions along the slit. These features can be explained by the excitation of the oscillation at a footpoint of an inhomogeneous coronal loop, e.g. a loop with fine structure.

As Allmusic point out in their review, with Khan's well-known affinity and acclaim for interpreting jazz standards in mind, which through most of her career on the Warner Bros. label had been relegated to the backburner, an album with the title ClassiKhan could at first glance very easily be mistaken for being a belated sequel to 1982's Echoes of an Era. While the album indeed does focus on jazz and swing standards like \\"Stormy Weather\\", \\"Hazel's Hips\\", \\"Round Midnight\\" and \\"Teach Me Tonight\\" it also features an eclectic selection of classics from other genres, like pop culture favourites such as Broadway show tune \\"Hey Big Spender\\" from the musical Sweet Charity, Peggy Lee's \\"Is That All There Is?\\" penned by Leiber & Stoller and even a 60's country and western classic in the form of Patsy Cline's \\"Crazy\\", written by Willie Nelson. ClassiKhan also features the themes of classic film favourites from Khan's youth, \\"To Sir With Love\\" and the James Bond themes \\"Goldfinger\\" and \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\". The collection concludes with one new composition, the ballad \\"I Believe\\", co-written by Khan and the album's producer Ira Shickman. The title ClassiKhan is naturally also a reference to Khan's accompaniment on the set. On the Echoes of an Era album it was a five- piece all-star jazz ensemble, on ClassiKhan it is The New York All Star Musicians - but with the addition of the full London Symphony Orchestra, conducted and arranged by Eve Nelson and with orchestrations by producer Ira Schickman and Gary Anderson. The album was mainly recorded at London's legendary Abbey Road Studios and it features guest appearances by among others pianist Joe Sample and percussionist Sheila E., best known for her work with Prince. ClassiKhan was both a critical and commercial success, even reaching #42 on Billboard's R&B; albums chart. As of 2005 it has sold 46,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

He is commemorated as a saint by the Syriac Orthodox Church in the Martyrology of Rabban Sliba, and his feast day is 22 April. Under considerable pressure from the most prominent non-Chalcedonians, Peter agreed to become patriarch of Antioch, and thus spiritual leader of the Syrian non-Chalcedonians, in opposition to its incumbent Paul the Black, and led the church as he faced the division he inherited from Paul's tenure as patriarch. Whilst he had some success in dealing with the tritheists, Peter quarrelled with his erstwhile ally the Egyptian non-Chalcedonian Pope Damian of Alexandria, and entered into a schism with him that would persist past his death until 616. Biography =Early life= Peter was born at Callinicum in c. 550, and was the son of an orator named Paul. He was educated in Greek, Syriac, philosophy, and theology, and likely became a monk at the monastery of Saint Ananias near Callinicum. The 570s was a tumultuous period for the Syrian non-Chalcedonian community as its spiritual leader and patriarch of Antioch Paul the Black was declared deposed by the Egyptian non-Chalcedonian Pope Damian of Alexandria and eminent bishop Jacob Baradaeus, thus creating a schism between the Paulites, who supported Paul as patriarch, and Jacobites, who supported the deposition of Paul. Paul's opponents conspired to consecrate a new patriarch of Antioch in his stead, and Jacob Baradaeus twice offered to appoint Peter as Paul's successor, but he refused on both occasions as he was reluctant to assume the office whilst Paul was still alive. Damian travelled to Syria in 579 after Jacob Baradaeus' death to arrange for the election of a new patriarch, and again Peter was asked to become patriarch, but he refused once more. Finally, after Damian had unsuccessfully attempted to consecrate a certain Severus as patriarch, and a meeting between the Paulites and Jacobites at Constantinople in 580 had failed to reunite the factions, Peter relented and agreed to become patriarch of Antioch on Damian's request. The sources differ on the date, location, and bishop responsible for Peter's consecration. The Chronicle of 1234 places Peter's consecration in 570/571 (AG 882), the Zuqnin Chronicle gives 578 (AG 889), and John of Ephesus in his Ecclesiastical History records 581 (AG 892). The Chronicle of 846 also supports 580/581 (AG 892) as the year of Peter's consecration. The earliest date 570/571 is disregarded as an erroneous copy of 581, and 578, although previously accepted by earlier Syriac historians, including William Wright, Rubens Duval, Carl Anton Baumstark, Jean-Baptiste Chabot, and Ortiz de Urbina, has since been rejected in favour of 581. John of Ephesus reported that Peter was consecrated patriarch of Antioch by Damian at Alexandria, and is supported by the Chronicle of 1234, whereas the historians Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus record that Peter was consecrated at the aforementioned monastery of Saint Ananias by the archbishop Joseph of Amid with the support of the Egyptian non-Chalcedonians. It is also suggested that he was consecrated at the monastery of Gubo Baroyo near Cyrrhus. After his consecration, Peter sent a letter to Damian to confirm their churches were in communion, and included a refutation of tritheism. Damian responded with a letter to Peter to give his official endorsement, and enthusiastically praised the new patriarch of Antioch. =Patriarch of Antioch= Upon his ascension to the patriarchal office, Peter became remorseful that he had agreed to become patriarch whilst its previous incumbent still lived, travelled to Alexandria with the theologians Probus and archimandrite John Barbour, and offered his resignation to Damian in an effort to reunite the Paulites and Jacobites. Damian refused Peter's offer, and Paul may have died soon after, thus bringing an end to the split between the two factions, however, it is alternatively asserted that Paul instead died in 584, suggesting the schism endured for several more years. Peter returned to Syria, whereas his companions Probus and John Barbour decided to remain at Alexandria as they had become disgruntled with Peter for not consecrating them as bishops. In 582, Peter met with the Cilician tritheist bishops Antoninus and Elias and archimandrite Theodore to discuss their reunion with the Syrian non-Chalcedonians under Peter, and he asserted that he would only assent to this if they renounced tritheism and its proponents, namely John Philoponus, and accepted the denunciation of tritheism as expressed in the aforementioned synodal letters of Peter and Damian, and the treatise of Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria. To Theodore's surprise, Antoninus renounced tritheism, and was supported by Elias, but neither of the two bishops broke off from the tritheist faction. After several years, the tritheists Elias and Theodore met with Peter on behalf of Conon of Tarsus and Antoninus to again discuss the patriarch's demands for their reunion. At the meeting's conclusion, Elias and Theodore accepted Peter's main conditions, and it was agreed they would write to the other tritheists at Constantinople to consult them before a union was formalised. A few days later, Peter received the delegation's reply and a letter from Elias declaring an end to talks of union as Conon and Antoninus refused to condemn proponents of tritheism. Theodore concurred with Conon and Antoninus, but Elias separated from the tritheist faction at this point and met with Peter. Elias underwent penance for a short period of time, presented Peter with a plerophoria (confession of faith) in accordance with his conditions on 21 July 585, and entered into communion with him. At Alexandria, Probus and John Barbour had been swayed to Neo-Chalcedonism by Stephanus of Alexandria, and the former's open support for this christological position had led Damian to expel him from the city, and he travelled to Syria to continue his campaign in support of the position against non-Chalcedonianism. Probus was consequently excommunicated, and after an appeal from John Barbour, who had concealed his support for neo-Chalcedonism, Peter convened a synod at the monastery of Gubo Baroyo in c. 585 to hear an apologia by John Barbour that he had composed in defence of Probus. The synod concluded that John had also adopted neo-Chalcedonism, and he was duly deposed and excommunicated, and Peter issued a synodal letter to condemn and refute their christological position. =Alexandrine schism= In c. 586, the formerly cordial relationship between Peter and Damian was soured by theological controversy, and ultimately led to schism between their two churches that would endure until its resolution in 616. However, the origins of this quarrel is obscured by the partisanship of the available sources. The Egyptian sources, the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Synaxaire Arabe-Jacobite, support Damian, and subsequently attest that the dispute had begun with Peter's synodal letter to Damian, in which he had allegedly declared it was unnecessary to speak of the Trinity, thereby constituting an accusation of the heresy of sabellianism, but had also supported the division of the Trinity, thus suggesting he supported tritheism, which was theologically opposed to sabellianism. It is claimed that Peter had ignored a treatise from Damian that had informed him of his errors. On the other hand, the Syrian sources, including Peter's letters and the histories of Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus, favour Peter, and record the dispute had begun after Damian had written an anti-tritheist book in response to a tritheist tract, and sent it to Peter to be examined and correct any errors. Peter's reply to Damian gave praise of his refutation of tritheism, but also noted that he may have deviated from the doctrine that had been established by the Cappadocian Fathers, Cyril of Alexandria, Severus of Antioch, and Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria, and asked that he clarified several points. Damian resented Peter's request, and claimed that he had rejected his work out of envy, thus prompting Peter to assemble a synod, which compiled and conveyed a text to Damian to reply to his claims. This was to no avail, however, as Damian issued festal letters and apologia to defend his book, and continued to criticise Peter. Peter issued a letter addressed to the Church of Alexandria to encourage its members to prevail upon Damian to resolve the dispute. According to Michael the Syrian, after Peter had invited him to meet to discuss their disagreement several times, Damian reluctantly agreed to meet at Paralos in Egypt to make arrangements for a formal debate between the two. However, Peter, in his letter to the monastery of the Antonines at the Enaton in Egypt, instead relayed that he had travelled to Egypt with his entourage without any prior agreement with Damian, and had planned to travel to Alexandria, but had been prevented from entering the city and made to stay at Paralos, only three days march from the city. Both Michael the Syrian's history and Peter's letter suggest that, although he did not meet with Damian at Paralos, he did receive a number of letters from him whilst he was there. Peter's letter to the Antonines attests that after staying at Paralos for four months, during which time he was poorly treated, Peter and his companions were expelled from Egypt with no agreement on a meeting between him and Damian, whereas Michael the Syrian's history suggests a second meeting was arranged to be held in the province of Arabia. The letter from Peter to the Syrians at Alexandria clarifies that a meeting in Arabia was agreed upon once Damian had travelled to Tyre in secret, and sent representatives to Peter at his residence at the monastery of Gubo Baroyo. As a region with a strong non-Chalcedonian presence, and the residence of the non-Chalcedonian Ghassanids, who had previously arbitrated ecclesiastical disputes, Arabia was an ideal location for the meeting between the two patriarchs under the arbitration of the Ghassanid phylarch Jafna. Thus the phylarch Jafna presided over two ill-fated meetings in Arabia in 587, the first of which was held at a monastery, and the second took place at the Church of Saint Sergius at Jabiyah. Both meetings were tumultuous as Damian's entourage created commotion and Jafna could not impose order on the proceedings. Nothing came of the discussions as no agreement could be made on the location or participants of a synod to discuss their theological disagreement, and ultimately Jafna gave up and left out of frustration. Peter continued to push for a resolution, and he followed Damian when he returned to Egypt after the assembly in Arabia, but this was in vain as Damian evaded any meeting by travelling from monastery to monastery. =Later life= Peter's failure to end the dispute with Damian even after he had followed him to Egypt led him to write a treatise later named Contra Damianum (\\"Against Damian\\") to provide an account of the dispute between the two patriarchs. The treatise served as a defence against Damian's accusations of sabellianism and tritheism, and at its end Peter declared an end to the communion with Damian, thus officially marking the schism between the Syrian and Egyptian non-Chalcedonian churches. Peter later died of natural causes on 22 April 591, and was buried at the monastery of Gubo Baroyo. Works Peter is known to have written an anaphora in Syriac, which survives in two manuscripts dated to the 15th century, and a poem on the crucifixion in Syriac, of which a single manuscript likely from the end of the 6th century is still extant. Contra Damianum (\\"Against Damian\\") survives in six manuscripts, the most complete of which includes chapters five to twenty-two of book two, and all fifty chapters of book three. In the treatise, Peter utilised quotations from Church Fathers to support his argument, including Athanasius of Alexandria, Basil of Caesarea, Cyril of Alexandria, Eustathius of Antioch, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom, and Severus of Antioch. He quoted at least 107 passages from 27 of Severus' works.

Urbina (; born 1946) is a former United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Education and career Urbina earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Georgetown University in 1967. He received his Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1970. He began his legal career as a public defender. He worked for the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia from 1970 to 1972 and was in private practice in Washington, D.C., from 1972 to 1974. He was on the faculty of Howard University Law School from 1974 to 1981. In 1981, he became an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, serving until his appointment to the United States District Court. Federal judicial service Urbina was nominated by President Bill Clinton on March 22, 1994, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated by Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. He was confirmed by the Senate on June 15, 1994, and received commission on June 16, 1994. He assumed senior status on January 31, 2011 and retired on May 31, 2012. Notable cases =Omar v. Harvey= Urbina was assigned as the judge in Omar v. Harvey, in which Shawqi Ahmad Omar, an American citizen, captured and detained in Iraq by United States military forces operating as part of the Multi-National Force-Iraq, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus preventing the U.S. military from transferring him from U.S. military custody at Camp Cropper into the custody of Iraqi authorities for trial on terrorism charges in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. Urbina issued an ex parte temporary restraining order requiring that Omar \\"not be removed from United States custody\\" and later convered the order into a preliminary injunction. The government appealed, and the D.C. Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, affirmed that the District Court had habeas jurisdiction under the U.S. Supreme Court precedent in Hirota v. MacArthur and that Omar's case could be reviewed because he had not yet been convicted by a foreign court. The case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard this matter together with Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674 (2008). The Court unanimously affirmed Judge Urbina's conclusion that the habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2241(c)(1), extends to U.S. citizens held overseas by American forces subject to an American chain of command, even if acting as part of a multinational coalition, but also found that habeas corpus provided the petitioners with no relief because \\"habeas corpus does not require the United States to shelter such fugitives from the criminal justice system of the sovereign with authority to prosecute them.\\" *Omar v. Harvey, 416 F. Supp. 2d 19 (D.D.C. 2006). *mar v. Harvey, 479 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2007). *Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674 (2008). =Guantanamo Bay detainees= In Rasul v. Rumsfeld (2006), Urbina found that British detainees at Guantanamo Bay could not bring a civil lawsuit against government officials under the Alien Tort Statute or the Geneva Conventions for alleged torture and mistreatment. Urbina did, however, find that the detainees could sue under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act for alleged restraints on their religious free expression. That later judgment was then reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Urbina presided over a number of habeas corpus petitions submitted on behalf of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In October 2008, he ordered the release of a small group of Uighur detainees from Guantanamo into the United States because they are no longer regarded as enemy combatants. Saeed Hatim v. Barack Obama On December 16, 2009, Urbina ordered Guantanamo captive \\"Saeed Hatim\\" to be released. According to Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald Urbina's release order was sealed, and it \\"brought the so-called habeas corpus scorecard to 32 losses and nine victories by the Pentagon of detainee challenges from Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba.\\" Dean Boyd, a Department of Justice spokesman, told Rosenberg the Government was reviewing its options in how to react to the ruling. =Blackwater Baghdad shootings prosecution= On December 31, 2009, a month before five Blackwater Worldwide security guards implicated in the September 2007, Nisour Square, Baghdad, shooting incident were to go on trial, Urbina dismissed the case. Urbina said that the prosecutors improperly relied upon statements the guards gave to State Department investigators. The guards were required to make the statements if they wanted to keep their jobs‚Äîthus making them inadmissible under the Fifth Amendment. The immunity issue was a problem that lawyers for the government anticipated as long as a year ago when they briefed Congress on the matter. Judge Urbina dismissed the indictment of the five men who pleaded not guilty to voluntary manslaughter and firearms violations: Paul Slough, Evan Liberty, Dustin Heard, Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten. In 2011, a federal appeals court overruled Urbina, reinstated the charges against four out of the five men. In 2014, all four were convicted. Dozens of Iraqis, including the estates of some of the victims allegedly killed by Blackwater employees, filed a separate lawsuit last year alleging that Blackwater employees engaged in indiscriminate killings and beatings. The civil case is still before a Virginia court. Blackwater contractors had been hired to guard US diplomats in Iraq. The guards said insurgents ambushed them in a traffic circle. Prosecutors said the men unleashed an unprovoked attack on civilians using machine guns and grenades. The shooting led to the unraveling of the North Carolina-based company, which since has replaced its management and changed its name to Xe Services. =Heller v. District of Columbia= A District of Columbia resident, Dick Anthony Heller filed suit against the District challenging the constitutionality of its laws regulating gun registration and gun restriction. Urbina dismissed Heller v. District of Columbia in 2010 and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The dismissal was appealed and overturned in a 2-1 vote. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in a 5-4 vote sided with Heller and declare the District's regulations unconstitutional. =Electronic Privacy Information Center v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security= The Transportation Security Administration has taken several thousand images of individuals passing through the Full Body Scanner to demonstrate its effectiveness to TSA employees. The EPIC sued the DHS for the release of the images. Urbina sided with the TSA, arguing that a release of the images would threaten national security.http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/12/airport.scanner.images/index.html From CNN. accessed 1/12/11 References External links * * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Georgetown University Law Center alumni Category:Hispanic and Latino American judges Category:Judges of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Category:Judges presiding over Guantanamo habeas petitions Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:Judges of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Category:United States district court judges appointed by Bill Clinton Category:20th-century American judges Category:21st-century American judges ","title":"Ricardo M.

The foreigner uses this word in such direct meaning, namely, knifing a monarch to death as being on a par with an act of Macbeth, or decapitating a monarch with guillotine which is not a royal guillotine as it can be used for every kinds of person from prostitute to royalty...therefore, the Thai style of executing a monarch can daze and dumbfound foreigners (and the Thai people who do not understand the Thai history).

He was acquitted. An important test case, the trial brought to public attention the dilemmas for doctors in treating severely disabled newborn infants. Arthur felt strongly that doctors should always act in the best interests of the child, with the full support of the parents. In some cases this meant not prolonging the child's life, in order to prevent future suffering. Opinion polls taken at the time of the trial indicated huge public support for Arthur's approach.McHaffie, H.E. and Fowlie, P.W. (1996). Life, Death and Decisions. Hale: Hochland and Hochland The outcome of the trial confirmed that ‚Äònursing care only‚Äô is an acceptable form of treatment, and that administering a drug to relieve suffering is not an offence, even if it accelerates death. Ambiguities remain, however, about what is legally permissible in the treatment of disabled infants: if a doctor or anyone else intentionally kills a child, however disadvantaged, this would still be considered to be murder.Gunn, M.J. and Smith, J.C. (1985). Arthur‚Äôs case and the right to life of a Down syndrome child. The Criminal Law Review, pp. 705‚Äì715 Family The descendant of Sir George Arthur, Arthur's father was a civil servant in India. In 1954 Arthur married Janet Stella Brain, daughter of Walter Russell Brain, a former president of the Royal College of Physicians made a baronet in 1954. Together they had one son and five daughters. There are coincidences in Leonard Arthur's family that relate to Down syndrome. Arthur's mother-in-law, Janet Brain's mother, was Stella Langdon Down, the granddaughter of John Langdon Down who gave the first systematic description of Down syndrome in 1867 and after whom the syndrome is named. Stella had a brother, John, who had Down syndrome. He was named after his grandfather John Langdon Down, although he was born after his grandfather's death.O. Conor Ward (1998) John Langdon Down, A Caring Pioneer. London: Royal Society of Medicine Press. Career After attending Aldenham School in Elstree, Hertfordshire, Arthur received an MB and BChir at Cambridge University. He did National Service on the front line in Korea, as a medical officer in support of the Durham Light Infantry. Post-registration posts followed in Birmingham, London, Newcastle and Plymouth, and he obtained the MRCP in 1957. He worked as a senior paediatric registrar in Ibadan, Nigeria and then in Bristol. In 1965 he became a consultant paediatrician in Derby. He served on the Council of the British Paediatric Association, was secretary of the Paediatric Section of the Royal Society of Medicine and chaired the Trent Regional Advisory Sub-committee in Paediatrics, sitting also on the Regional Medical Committee. He also chaired a Derbyshire County Council Advisory Committee on children at risk of non- accidental injury. He was elected FRCP shortly before he died, aged 57, on 25 December 1983.The Lancet, 1984, p. 115 Arthur was described by a colleague as a \\"a kind, gentle, compassionate man who cared deeply for his patients and their families. A great supporter of the weak or poor, he was motivated by firm Christian beliefs\\".British Medical Journal, vol. 288, p.344 When he was suspended from work after his first court appearance, a petition with some 19,000 signatures, including three Derbyshire MPs, called for his reinstatement.Derby Evening Telegraph, 30.10.01 A former patient wrote in 2001: \\"He was the very best doctor around. I know. I was one of his patients. And after all these years I still miss him.\\"Derby Evening Telegraph, 13.11.01 John Pearson John Pearson was born on 28 June 1980. He had Down's syndrome and was later found to have had additional abnormalities of his lung, heart and brain. Shortly after the birth, Arthur talked to John Pearson's parents and then wrote in the case notes, \\"Parents do not wish the baby to survive. Nursing care only.\\" He prescribed DF118 (an opiate based painkiller), to be given ‚Äòas required‚Äô in doses of 5 mg at four hourly intervals. The child died three days later, on 1 July 1980, the cause of death being identified as bronchopneumonia as a result of Down's syndrome. Arthur was subsequently charged with murder, but the possibility that the child's death was caused by his other defects caused the original charge to be reduced, during the trial, to attempted murder. Trial Sir Thomas Hetherington, Director of Public Prosecutions, described the decision to prosecute Arthur as the \\"most difficult\\" of his career. Arthur was tried on 5 November 1981 in Leicester Crown Court and defended by George Carman. Arthur did not give evidence in his own trial.The Culture of Death ‚Äì Gerard Wright His defence did call other distinguished expert witnesses though, such as Sir Douglas Black, then President of the Royal College of Physicians, who said: > I say that it is ethical, in the case of a child suffering from Down's, and > with a parental wish that it should not survive, to terminate life providing > other considerations are taken into account such as the status and ability > of the parents to cope in a way that the child could otherwise have had a > happy life. Carman argued in his closing remarks: > He could, like Pontius Pilate, have washed his hands of the matter. He did > not, because good doctors do not turn away. Are we to condemn him as a > criminal because he helped two people [the mother and child] at the time of > their greatest need? Are we to condemn a doctor because he cared?Independent The jury deliberated for two hours and found Arthur not guilty. During the trial the Daily Mail newspaper published an opinion article about euthanasia by Malcolm Muggeridge, and was tried for contempt of court. Although the Mail was aware the trial was taking place, their defence was that the article was a discussion of public affairs under section 5 of the newly enacted Contempt of Court Act 1981. The House of Lords held that the article did create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the trial but, as it was written in good faith to support a pro-life by-election candidate, and made no mention of the Arthur case, the risk of prejudice was merely incidental. Legal legacy The case established that it was acceptable practice to prescribe ‚Äònursing care only‚Äô. It also confirmed the principle that \\"the administration of a drug by a doctor when it is necessary to relieve pain is a proper medical practice even when the doctor knows that the drugs will themselves cause the patient‚Äôs death\\". Criticism MJ Gunn and JC Smith are critical of the judge's summing up.Arthurs Case and the Right to Life of a Downs Syndrome Child (1985), Criminal Law Review 705 Arthur had admitted to the police that the effect of the drug given, apart from being a sedative, was also to stop the child seeking sustenance and that this had been intended by him. A witness, Professor Campbell, concurred that this was a justifiable practice. The judge made no mention of this potential homicidal intent during the summing up however, something which has been criticised, amongst others, by Gerald Wright, QC.Killing the Willing...

Plot Maria is set in Saint Petersburg during the Russian Civil War. In the aftermath of the October Revolution, the once iron clad Russian class system has disintegrated. The plot focuses on the aristocratic Mukovnin family and their attempts to adapt to the hardships of war communism and chaos. The elderly General Mukovnin is writing books about Russia's military history, where he criticizes the harsh treatment of common soldiers under the Imperial Russian Army. He sympathizes with Lenin's Bolsheviks and regards them as \\"gatherers of the Russian lands\\" akin to Ivan Kalita. His daughter, the ditzy and superficial Ludmila, is hoping for an advantageous marriage with Isaac Dimshits, the Jewish mob boss who dominates the city's black market food supply. Her cousin, Katya Felsen, is unhappy and pessimistic about the new regime, despite having an affair with a senior Soviet Army officer. The General's eldest daughter, Maria, is an idealistic Communist and a political officer assigned to the Soviet Army. During the entire play, she is away on the front and is quoted, but never seen. Ultimately, Dimshits makes sexual advances to Ludmila, who repels them by claiming to have toothache, to his great discontent and humiliation. Ludmila's intentions are to achieve Dimshits' respect and finally marry him. Dimshits, however, is already married, and only wants Ludmila as a mistress. According to Dimshits, \\"People like her are unworthy of even tying my wife's shoelaces!\\" At the time of their next rendezvous, the embittered Dimshits does not show up. In the adjacent apartment, Captain Viskovsky, a White Army officer turned jewel thief who works for Dimshits and whose advances were rejected by Maria. Viskovsky is drinking together with Yasha Kravchenko, a corrupt artillery officer in the Red Army. Viskovsky invites Ludmila in, gets her drunk and then rapes her in a nearby room. Disgusted, Kravchenko reproaches him for having infected Ludmila with Gonorrhea. Viskovsky threatens to beat Kravchenko, who pulls his gun and initiates a gun battle in which each kills the other. As a result, the Soviet police, or militsiya, arrest Ludmila, the lone survivor. At the station, the interrogator assumes that she is a prostitute who smuggles thread for Dimshits' gang. While she protests her innocence and begs for a doctor, the interrogator demands to know how many times she has been arrested, and then shouts in anger that he has not slept in five days. A crippled World War I veteran, who also works for Dimshits, arrives at the Mukovnins' apartment with the news. The General, fearful that she may have been arrested by the CHEKA, first intends to demand her release, then realizes that that is impossible and instead wants to take advice with Maria. Therefore, he checks to make sure that his other daughter, Maria, has received his earlier telegram, in which he urged her to return from the front to visit him. He learns that the telegram has been delivered and convinces himself that Maria will be coming very soon. He even declares that he is not worried about Ludmila and that this will be a valuable lesson for her, but then has a massive heart attack seconds later. His condition is critical, but it proves impossible to fetch a doctor at night to help him. Soon afterwards, a soldier from Maria's division arrives. He announces that Maria has been unable to come because of the continuing military operations. The General enters the room, expecting to see Maria, but is shocked to see only a soldier he does not know and possibly assumes that Maria has been killed. He instantly dies of a massive stroke. Later, two workers prepare the Mukovnins' former apartment for its new tenants. They are \\"bossed around\\" by their forewoman, the local street-sweeper, who is in charge of apartments. Katya arrives with Sushkin, a person who describes himself as a \\"lover of antiquities\\". She announces that she is selling the Mukovnins' antique furniture on Maria's orders. The forewoman of the workers refuses to allow this, saying that the new tenants were promised a fully furnished apartment. An enraged Sushkin threatens her, hinting that he can bring \\"people\\" (presumably militsiya men or CHEKA agents) to arrest her. However, she refuses to yield unless he can show her a warrant. After Sushkin leaves in a huff, the two workers comment on the forewoman's conduct and observe that she wasn't so daring during the old general's time. Yet, they recall the general as a nice person, loved by the common people. Meanwhile, the new tenants, a worker and his pregnant wife, settle into their new home. Reception Maria is rooted in Babel's work as an investigative reporter for Maxim Gorky's Menshevik newspaper, Novaya zhizn (–ù–æ–≤–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å). Babel published there between March and July 1918, when Vladimir Lenin ordered the closing of all newspapers not controlled by the CPSU. Babel later recalled, however, > \\"My journalistic work gave me a lot, especially in the sense of material. I > managed to amass an incredible number of facts, which proved to be an > invaluable creative tool. I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, > criminal investigators, and government clerks. Later, when I began writing > fiction, I found myself always returning to these 'subjects', which were so > close to me, in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life > into perspective. Journalistic work is full of adventure.\\"The Complete Works > of Isaac Babel,\\" page 486. After the completion of Maria in the mid-1930s, Babel allowed the unpublished manuscript to be examined by Gorky, who remained his friend and mentor. Noting the play's implicit rejection of socialist realism, Gorky accused Babel of having a \\"Baudelairian predilection for rotting meat.\\" Gorky further warned his friend that \\"political inferences\\" would be made \\"that will be personally harmful to you.\\"The Complete Works of Isaac Babel, page 754. According to Babel's common law wife, Antonina Pirozhkova, > \\"Once Babel went to the Moscow Art Theater when his play Mariya was being > given its first reading, and when he returned home he told me that all the > actresses had been impatient to find out what the leading female role was > like and who would be cast in it. It turned out that there was no leading > female character present on the stage in this play. Babel thought that the > play had not come off well, but he was always critical of his own > work.\\"Antonina Pirozhkova, At His Side; The Last Years of Isaac Babel, > Steerforth Press, 1996. Page 47. Although intended to be performed by Moscow's Vakhtangov Theatre in 1935, the premiere of Maria was cancelled by the NKVD during rehearsals. Four years later, Isaac Babel was arrested, tortured, and shot as part of Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. His surviving manuscripts were confiscated by the NKVD and destroyed. As a result, Maria was never performed in Russia until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Structure The storyline of Maria is structured in an unconventional, nonlinear fashion. According to a cast member from the American premiere, > \\"The play runs like a film ‚Äî there are so many different locations and > characters that you have to be very attentive. They even had to build a > revolving stage in order to accommodate all of the changing locations in the > story.... The play flows in a very subtle manner.\\"Maria's American Debut Legacy Although it was very popular at Western European colleges during the 1960s, it was not performed in Babel's homeland until 1994. An English translation by Harold Shukman and Michael Glenny was published by Penguin in 1966; a further translation by Peter Constantine appeared in 2002 and was edited by Nathalie Babel Brown. Maria's American premiere, directed by Carl Weber, took place at Stanford University two years later. According to Weber, > \\"The play is very controversial. [It] shows the stories of both sides > clashing with each other during the Russian Civil War ‚Äî the Bolsheviks and > the old society members ‚Äî without making a judgment one way or another. > Babel‚Äôs opinion on either side is very ambiguous, but he does make the > statement that what happened after the Bolshevik Revolution may not have > been the best thing for Russia.\\"Maria's American Debut References External links * Maria's American debut on Stanford Stage (Youtube, in English) * Program for Stanford production, 2004.

He developed an important garden at Myddelton House, his lifelong home at Bulls Cross in Enfield, Middlesex and his name has been preserved in many varieties of plant. Background E. A. Bowles was born at his family's home, Myddelton House (1818), near Enfield. He was of Huguenot descent through his maternal great-grandmother and his father, Henry Carington Bowles Bowles (sic) (1830‚Äì1918), son of Anne Sarah Bowles, who inherited Myddelton House and married Edward Treacher. Their son adopted his mother's surname in 1852 for inheritance purposes and married E.A. Bowles' mother, Cornelia Kingdom (1831‚Äì1911), in 1856, was Chairman of the New River Company, which until 1904 controlled the artificial waterway that flowed past Myddelton, bringing water to London from the River Lea.Miles Hadfield (1960) A History of British Gardening Through his elder brother Henry,Sir Henry Ferryman Bowles, 1st baronet (1858‚Äì1943), Member of Parliament for Enfield 1889‚Äì1906 and 1918‚Äì22. who after 1894 lived at neighbouring Forty Hall, Bowles was the great uncle of Andrew Parker Bowles (born 1939), whose first wife, Camilla Shand, became Duchess of Cornwall on her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales in 2005.Bryan Hewitt (1997) The Crocus King: E. A. Bowles of Myddelton House' by Bryan Hewitt, The Rockingham Press 1997'; genealogical display in Myddelton House museum, 2011 Education and career Described as \\"too delicate for public school\\",Mark Griffiths (2000) A Century in Photographs: Gardening Bowles spent much of his childhood at Myddelton before reading divinity at Jesus College, Cambridge. He had wanted to enter the church, but family circumstances, including the death of a brother and sister from tuberculosis in a three-month period of 1887,Hewitt, op.cit. militated against this; so he remained at Myddelton and, in the words of one historian, \\"devoted himself to social work, painting, and natural history, particularly entomology\\".Hadfield, op.cit. Bowles transformed the garden at Myddelton and, as a keen traveller, especially to Europe and North Africa, brought home with him many specimens of plant. Such was his collecting zeal that, by the turn of the 20th century, he was growing over 130 species of colchicum and crocus. He also took a great interest in hardy cacti and succulents, admiring their \\"strange beauty\\" and protective spines.Ursula Buchan in The Garden, October 2014, page 63 Many of the foreign expeditions were timed to mitigate the symptoms of acute hay fever, with Alpine or other mountainous regions being favoured destinations in late spring. Bowles' gardening mentor was Canon Henry Nicholson Ellacombe (1822‚Äì1916), Rector of Bitton, Gloucestershire, who wrote a number of books about gardening, including plant lore in English literature.Mark Griffiths, .op.cit. Ellacombe's father was the divine and antiquary Henry Thomas Ellacombe, who preceded him as Rector of Bitton. Bowles inherited Myddelton on his father's death in 1918, but initially found this a mixed blessing, writing the following year to his friend and fellow horticulturalist William Robinson that, with a life interest in the property, he was unable to sell and yet found his income insufficient to maintain it to \\"as it used to be kept\\". At the time he was contemplating turning Myddelton into a \\"semi-wild garden\\".Letter to William Robinson (1919): see Liz Taylor, 'Letters to a Horticulturalist', The Garden, September 2014. Bowles had been with Robinson when the latter (1838‚Äì1935) sustained a disabling injury in 1909. At the time Robinson was regarded as the \\"king\\" of wild gardens: Taylor, loc.cit. In 1908 Bowles was elected to the Council of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS),Hadfield, op.cit. whose grounds at Wisley, Surrey, now contain a memorial garden to him. Bowles received the society's highest award, the Victoria Medal of Honour, in 1916 and was a Vice-President from 1926 until his death almost thirty years later. RHS colleagues knew him as \\"Bowley\\".Sally Festing (1991) Gertrude Jekyll =Myddelton House= The gardens at Myddelton House in winter The garden at Myddelton House, which has been subject to considerable renovation in the early 21st century, is open to the public and contains a museum dedicated to Bowles' life and work. Many of the features that he created remain, including the rock garden (though this is now largely wild), the wisteria that he planted across a bridge that once crossed the New River, and his so-called \\"lunatic asylum\\" of horticultural oddities, such as the corkscrew hazel (Corylus avellana 'Contorta'),Griffiths, op.cit.. The corkscrew hazel is also known as \\"Harry Lauder's Walking Stick\\" after the celebrated musical hall artist. There another specimen in the garden at Forty Hall. that he developed after abandoning plans to construct a Japanese garden. The old Enfield market cross was salvaged to become the centrepiece of the rose garden, while two lead ostriches, dating from 1724, that once stood beside the wisteria bridge, have been restored after years of vandalism and are now housed in the museum. On one of the walls overlooking the kitchen garden, Bowles' initials that he carved in 1887 can still be seen. Statuette of a young boy holding apron with puppies (The lake terrace) Two clumps have been maintained of the highly invasive Japanese knot weed, whose architectural qualities Bowles admired. Bowles also grew a gigantic gunnera, which flourished at Myddelton despite its hard water and dry, gravelly soil, and dwarfed a schoolgirl named Miss Malby whom Bowles photographed beside it in 1927.Griffiths, op.cit. More generally, he had an eye for unusual and uncommon plants, one of his favourites being yellowroot (Xanthorhiza simplicissima), which is rarely grown in British gardens, but whose \\"quaint beauty\\" he appreciated.Roy Lancaster in The Garden, volume 120, part 12, page 743 (December 1995). Yellowroot was introduced from North America, where it is also a rare garden plant (and an endangered species in Florida), around the time of the War of Independence. E.H. Wilson included it in his More Aristocrats of the Garden (1923). Gardens currently with large colonies include the Savill Garden at Windsor and Westonbirt in Gloucestershire. Among Bowles' methods of pest control was to go out at night with a torch and a hatpin to eradicate slugs.Alan Titchmarsh in Country Life, 25 July 2012 =Visitors and horticultural contacts= Bowles received many distinguished visitors from the gardening world: for example, the great planting designer Gertrude Jekyll came to Myddelton twice in 1910, while Bowles was a guest at Jekyll's Munstead Wood.Festing, op.cit. An article in the Gardener's Magazine in 1910 observed \\"it would be difficult to imagine anything more delightful, floriculturally speaking, than to spend an hour or so with Mr. Bowles.\\"Quoted in Festing, op.cit. A so-called \\"tulip tea\\" was held annually at Myddelton to celebrate Bowles' birthday in early May. This usually coincided with the flowering of beds along his Tulip Terrace, which, given the tulip's decline in popularity since its mid-Victorian heyday, made him one of what he described in 1914, with reference to fellow devotees, as the \\"noble little band who keep up its cultivation [and] are doing a great work for future gardeners\\".Bowles (1914) My Garden in Spring Bowles was also the frequent recipient of specimens from other plantsmen. For example, in 1921 Sir Frederick Moore, director of the National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin, near Dublin, Ireland, sent him a collection of hellebores that have thrived at Myddelton. These included a variety that became known as 'Bowles' Yellow' (although it appears that differing strains originating from Myddelton may have been distributed under this name, while other named varieties may have been descended from one or more of these).Graham Rice & Elizabeth Strangman (1993) The Gardener's Guide to Growing Hellebores. Rice distinguished between a variant he obtained from Myddelton House (which, for convenience, he described as 'Myddelton Yellow') and one supposedly derived from the plant known as 'Bowles' Yellow' since the 1920s. They may in fact have been different plants: ibid. Two yellow-toned varieties, Helleborus orientalis 'Citron' and H.o. 'Sunny', may also have been descended from the yellow forms bred by Bowles (Diana Baskervyle-Glegg in Country Life, 15 February 2001 at page 50). Stories differ as to why Bowles named a particular snowdrop Galanthus plicatus 'Warham Rectory', but, according to one version, flowers of it were sent to him in 1916 by Charles Tilton Digby, Rector of Warham, Norfolk. Bowles named another galanthus 'Benhall Beauty' after the village near Saxmundham, Suffolk where it was grown by John Gray (died 1952), a noted snowdrop specialist who gave his name to the variety G. 'John Gray'. Another galanthus, 'Mrs Thompson', was named after a lady from Escrick in Yorkshire who sent samples to a meeting of the RHS Scientific Committee that Bowles chaired in 1950.Roy Lancaster in The Garden, February 2012, page 76 Others shared with Bowles information and views about horticulture and botany: in 1929 Frank Anthony Hampton (a physicist who wrote gardening books under the name of Jason Hill) corresponded about some twigs sent to him by Gertrude Jekyll to support the view that the pollen flowers of mistletoe carried a scent that was missing in fertilised ones.Festing, op.cit. =Mentor and talent spotter= Through the RHS, and in other ways, Bowles did much to encourage other gardeners. Among his prot√©g√©es was an Enfield neighbour, Frances Perry (n√©e Everett), who gained particular distinction as a horticultural writer, broadcaster and educationalist.Anna Pavord in The Independent, 15 October 1993 (obituary of Frances Perry), Bowles told Perry, then Frances Everett, that he looked on her as \\"one of my boys\\": quoted ibid. Another, Richard Durant (Dick) Trotter (1887‚Äì1968), who became a leading banker and Treasurer of the RHS, travelled with Bowles to the Alps and Greece in the 1920s.Ursula Buchan (2007) Valerie Finnis & the Golden Age of Gardening. Trotter was Treasurer of the RHS 1929‚Äì32, 1933‚Äì38 and 1943‚Äì48. He became a Director of the National Provincial Bank and later Chairman of the Alliance Assurance Company: ibid.. Bowles often visited Trotter's garden at Leith Vale, Surrey and his daughter Elizabeth Parker-Jervis (1931‚Äì2010), herself a redoubtable gardener, claimed to have been \\"brought up on Bowles's knee\\". Bowles had a good eye for talent: in the early 1930s he became acquainted with William Stearn, then a young assistant in the Cambridge University bookshop Bowes and Bowes, and recommended him to be Librarian of the RHS, a post he held for almost twenty years.Ursula Buchan, op.cit.. Stearn, who had studied in his spare time at the Cambridge Botanic Garden, was publishing botanical papers while still in his teens. He became a distinguished botanical etymologist. Just after the Second World War, Bowles chaired the panel that selected William Gregor MacKenzie (Bill MacKenzie) as curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden. MacKenzie remained at Chelsea until 1973, initially restoring the garden from wartime neglect and then reinvigorating it as a centre for horticulture.Buchan, op.cit. =Publications= Bowles wrote a number of books about horticulture, notably My Garden in Spring, My Garden in Summer and My Garden in Autumn and Winter, all of which were published (1914‚Äì15) around the beginning of the First World War. The preface to the first of these by Bowles' friend Reginald Farrer, with whom he often travelled abroad,Hadfield, op.cit.. Farrer called Bowles \\"Uncle G\\" (Festing, op.cit.), as did Dick Trotter, referred to above. contained some comments about showy rock gardens which were taken as personal criticism by Sir Frank Crisp, the eccentric millionaire owner of Friar Park, Henley-on- Thames,Mojo, November 2011. Friar Park was later owned by George Harrison (1943‚Äì2001) of the Beatles who became a fanatical gardener: ibid.; Pattie Boyd (2007) Wonderful Today. and Ellen Willmott, creator of a steep, rocky garden at Ventimiglia on the Italian Riviera,Willmot had purchased the Villa Boccanegra at Ventimiglia in 1906, the garden occupying a 1,000-foot section of the cliffside down to the sea. She never revisited it after the outbreak of the First World War: Charles Quest-Ritson in Country Life, 26 October 2011. who had known Gertrude Jekyll since 1873Festing, op.cit. and, like Bowles, was a leading figure in the RHS. Farrer, who was widely published and candid about his likes and dislikes,M. Cox in Country Life, 17 October 1925: see Mark Hedges (ed.), The Glory of the Garden: a Horticultural Celebration (Country Life, 2012) was thought to have had in mind in particular Crisp's Alpine garden which contained a miniature version of the MatterhornRichard Bisgrove (2008) William Robinson: Wild Gardener created from 20,000 tons of granite brought from Yorkshire.Boyd, op.cit. This led Willmott to circulate a uncomplimentary pamphlet about Bowles and his garden at the second Chelsea Flower Show in 1914,Hewitt, op.cit. thereby escalating a row which, however, was patched up the following year, when Bowles invited Willmot to Myddelton House. Ellen Willmott and Gertrude Jekyll were the first female recipients of the RHS's Victoria Medal of Honour, instituted in 1897 and, as noted, bestowed on Bowles in 1916. One of Jekyll's biographers wrote that Willmott \\"was in many ways as unusual as Gertrude\\".Festing, op.cit. Bowles' more specialised works included his handbooks on crocuses (1924) and narcissi (1934),Handbook of Narcissus (1934) which contained his own illustrations. Material that he had collected for a monograph on snowdrops and snowflakes was incorporated after his death in a book for the RHS by Sir Frederick Stern (1884‚Äì1967),Stern (1956) Snowdrops and Snowflakes. See Buchan, op.cit. creator of Highdown Gardens in Worthing, West Sussex. Death and legacy Bowles continued to chair committees of the RHS until a few weeks before his death in 1954. His ashes were scattered on the rock garden at Myddelton House.Hadfield, op.cit. Bowles had no family of his own and the house and gardens passed to the University of London.Hadfield, op.cit. They are now owned and managed by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority. The bulk of Bowles' correspondence is held by the RHS's Lindley Library. A charity, known as the E.A. Bowles of Myddelton House Society, seeks to maintain interest in both the man and his work and, since the fiftieth anniversary of his death in 2004, has sponsored a biennial studentship in his name in conjunction with the RHS. At its first annual general meeting in 1993, Andrew Parker-Bowles was elected president of the society, with Frances Perry (who died in October 1993) and Elizabeth Parker- Jervis as vice-presidents. =Named varieties= Bowles gave his name to upwards of forty varieties of plant, and there are others that originated with him. For example, he named a hellebore 'Gerrard Parker' after a local art master,Graham Rice & Elizabeth Strangman (1993) The Gardener's Guide to Growing Hellebores Crocus tommasinianus 'Bobbo' after the boy who first spotted it and Rosmarinus officinalis 'Miss Jessopp's Upright' (Miss Jessopp's Upright Rosemary) after a gardening neighbour, Euphemia Jessopp,Robert Grant in Scotland on Sunday, 3 November 2002 for whom he also named the small white Crocus x jessoppiae in 1924. Erysimum 'Bowles' Mauve' was among \\"200 plants for 200 years\\" chosen by the RHS to mark its bicentenary in 2004The Garden, volume 129, part 2, page 119 (February 2004) and, to coincide with the hundredth anniversary of the Chelsea Flower Show in 2013, was shortlisted (from among introductions between 1973‚Äì83) as one of ten \\"plants of the centenary\\".Chelsea Centenary supplement, The Garden, May 2013. 'Bowles' Mauve' was introduced at Chelsea in 1982 by a team from Kew, although it was already to be found in gardens and its precise origin is unknown: Roy Lancaster on RHS Chelsea Flower Show (BBC 1 TV), 23 May 2013. Other significant introductions included Viola 'Bowles' Black',Griffiths, op.cit. cotton lavender 'Edward Bowles' (Santolina pinnata subsp. neopolitana),Jekka's Complete Herb List (2011) and Bowles' golden sedge (Carex stricta 'Aurea'),Royal Horticultural Society Gardeners' Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers (1989) which he found on Wicken FenCarol Klein in Daily Telegraph, 3 May 2003 and has been described by another doyen of plantsmen, Christopher Lloyd, as \\"a plant to treasure, its colour changing in unexpected ways\\".Christopher Lloyd (2007) Cuttings, page 93 Vita Sackville-West cited the yellow and brown Crocus chrysanthus 'E.A. Bowles' as among the first bulbs to flower in her garden at Sissinghurst in January or early February,Vita Sackville-West in The Observer, 15 February 1953 (reprinted in Sackville-West (1955) In Your Garden Again') while, in the nuttery there, Bowles' golden grass (Milium effusum 'Aureum') is interspersed in spring with wood anemones and white bluebells.Tony Lord (2003) Planting Schemes from Sissinghurst Another spring plant, the slow growing Muscari (grape hyacinth) 'Bowles's Peacock', was commended by Richard Hobbs, holder of the British National Plant Collection of Muscari, as \\"charming [and] small ... but [with] superb peacock-blue flowers, which in a pot are easily admired at close quarters\\".The Garden, March 2012, page 60 The vigorous Galanthus plicatus 'Augustus' was named for Bowles by the plantswoman Amy Doncaster. Some other plants bearing his name have been introduced since his death. An example is Phlomis 'Edward Bowles', launched by Hiller Nursuries in 1967, which apparently derives from seeds from Myddelton.Pat Bourne in Daily Telegraph, 22 July 2010. In February 2011 a single bulb of the pure white snowdrop G. p. 'E A Bowles', discovered at Myddelton in 2002, was sold on the internet auction site eBay for a record price of ¬£357. This surpassed by almost ¬£100 the previous record for a snowdrop bulb, set in 2008.David Wheeler in The Oldie, January 2013  References   Bibliography   Recommended Reading: \\"The Crocus King:E A Bowles of Myddelton House \\"by Bryan Hewitt, with a foreword by Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, gt, gt, nephew of E A Bowles The Rockingham Press. 1997.

The adjacent American Printing Company Mill No. 7 (also known as Fall River Iron Works Mill No.7) was constructed in 1906 for the production of cotton print cloth. Both structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and today contain a variety of small businesses. The site was also photographed and surveyed by Jack E. Boucher in 1968, as part of the Historic American Buildings Survey.HABS listing, Metacomet Mill Historical background American Printing Company Mill No. 7, built 1906 The Metacomet Mill was originally constructed in 1847 by Colonel Richard Borden, a prominent local industrialist who had begun the Fall River Iron Works in 1821. The plans for the mill were brought from Bolton, England by Major Durfee and William Davol, and it was considered a \\"model mill\\" for its time.A Centennial History of Fall River, Mass The mill was constructed of native field stones over the stream of the falling Quequechan River, which powered the machinery of the early mill. It originally had a gable roof and was five and one-half stories tall. The Metacomet Mill is also significant in that it was the first recorded use of cast iron girders and beams for mill construction in the United States. The cast iron beams and girders were an improvement on timber supports, which tended to become soft over time, resulting in a slight sagging in the floors, and upsetting the operation of machinery. The Metacomet Mill was substantially enlarged later in the 19th century, and a steam engine was added to supplement the power of the falls. It later became known as \\"Iron Works\\" Mill No.6. The American Printing Company Mill No.7, constructed of red brick in 1906, just upstream from the Metacomet Mill, on the site of the former Anawan Mill, also originally built by Colonel Richard Borden in 1825. Mill No. 7 was the last expansion of the American Printing Company, once the largest employer in Fall River during the height of its cotton textile industry. It is also known as \\"Iron Works\\" Mill No.7, as this was the name of the cloth-producing division of the same company; a tribute to the company's roots in 1821. Mill No.7 featured a Gothic-style engine house, which can still be seen today, along Anawan Street. The site today Quequechan River falls near the Metacomet Mill, Fall River, Massachusetts Metacomet Mill and American Printing Company Mill Number 7 are the only two mills existing over the falls of the Quequechan River, which once had several mills in the steep stretch between downtown and the waterfront. During the 1960s the mill complex was completely surrounded by the construction of Interstate 195 and the approach ramps to the Braga Bridge. Today, it is still possible to view the falls of the Quequechan River, for which the City of Fall River was named.

He played as a centre forward for clubs Woolwich Arsenal, Everton, Burnley and Wigan Borough. Freeman was one of the most prolific goal-scorers of his time, winning one First Division and two Second Division Golden Boots. He was also capped at the senior level for England. Career =Early days= Freeman was born in Handsworth, Birmingham and attended Gower Street School in Aston, where he started to make a name for himself as a prolific goal-scorer. He ended his schooldays with two games in which he scored seven and nine times respectively. After moving to Gower Street Old Boys at the age of 16, he then moved on to Aston Manor where he was spotted by Aston Villa, for whom he signed professionally in April 1904. At 5 ft 8 in he was not the biggest of forwards and he failed to make an impact at Villa Park. As so he transferred to Woolwich Arsenal in November 1905. =Woolwich Arsenal= Freeman scored on his Arsenal debut on 25 November 1905 away to Nottingham Forest, scoring Arsenal's only goal in a 3‚Äì1 defeat. He also scored a brace in an FA Cup win against Manchester United that saw the club to the semi-final which they lost by 2‚Äì0 to Newcastle United. As so in his first season he scored twelve goals in 21 games for the Gunners. Arsenal finished in seventh place in the 1906‚Äì07 season, with Freeman scoring eight goals in twelve league games. Although Arsenal again reached the FA Cup semi-finals, Freeman made no appearances in cup matches that season. By this time he had competition for the centre-forward's role with Peter Kyle, restricting his appearances; the situation continued the following season, with Freeman making a further 15 league appearances with four goals. With Freeman unable to hold a regular place down, new manager George Morrell, in an effort to alleviate the club's debts, allowed him to join Everton in April 1908. In Freeman's biography in Arsenal Who's Who, it is argued that this was \\"one of the great transfer blunders of those early years\\". In his three seasons at Arsenal, Freeman scored a total of 24 goals in 49 appearances in league and cup matches. =Everton= An Everton director had been sent to watch Freeman play for Arsenal in 1907, and on his return was asked by the board: \\"Did he score any goals?\\" The unnamed director apparently reported back: \\"He scored all four of them, but he did nothing else!\\" Ernest Edwards, the Liverpool Echo journalist, who had christened Anfield's home end The Spion Kop, convinced the Blues that Freeman was worth taking a chance on and the 22-year-old signed for a fee of ¬£350 in time to make his debut at the end of the 1907‚Äì08 season. He made his debut in a goalless draw away to Liverpool on 17 April 1908 and played in the remaining four games of the season, scoring once. He soon formed a useful partnership with his former Arsenal teammate Tim Coleman, who had joined Everton a few weeks earlier. During his first full season with Everton he scored 38 goals from 37 appearances, which made him the First Division's top scorer. With Coleman contributing a further 20 goals, Everton finished in the runners-up position, seven points behind the champions, Newcastle United. In the Autumn of 1908, between 10 October and 12 December, Freeman had a run of 10 successive goal-scoring appearances ‚Äì during which he struck 17 times. These included hat-tricks against Sheffield United and Sunderland. Freeman's total of 38 league goals broke the record for the most Football League goals in a season previously held by Liverpool's Sam Raybould (31 in 1902‚Äì03) and stood until broken by Ted Harper's 43 goals in 1925‚Äì26. Freeman won his first international cap for England in the 1909 British Home Championship match against Wales on 15 March 1909. Freeman scored England's second goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory. He retained his place for the next international against Scotland on 3 April, which England also won 2‚Äì0 (both goals from George Wall) as England claimed the championship title. He also played for the Football League against the Irish League in 1909, scoring four goals. In the 1909‚Äì10 season, Freeman was not able to score so freely with 22 league goals as Everton finished in mid-table. They did, however, have a good run in the FA Cup, with Freeman scoring four goals, including two against Coventry City in Round Four, as Everton reached the semi-final where they were put out 3‚Äì0 by Barnsley after a replay. The following season started poorly for Freeman, and by mid-November he had lost his place in the Everton team to George Beare who had recently arrived from Blackpool. Despite an outstanding goals return ‚Äì 67 goals in 94 appearances ‚Äì Freeman had always struggled to impress the hierarchy at Everton and he was allowed to leave in 1911, aged 26, as the Everton directors believed he was past his best, with his final appearance coming against his former team, Arsenal, on 11 March 1911. =Burnley= Freeman was recruited to Burnley for a fee of ¬£800, by John Haworth who had taken over the managerial reins at Turf Moor the previous September, having been one of the founders of Accrington Stanley. At the time, Burnley were experiencing severe financial difficulties and had spent ten years in the Second Division. However, a good run in the FA Cup had helped to improve the club's finances and Haworth was able to persuade the directors to depart from their policy of only recruiting local players in an effort to alleviate the team's goal scoring problem. He made his Burnley debut at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 15 April 1911. The following season, he began to repay Haworth's faith in him as the goals came on a regular basis; a 2‚Äì1 victory over Wolves on 23 December saw Freeman score his twentieth goal of the season in only the nineteenth game, and he followed this with a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì0 defeat of Glossop North End a week later. By the end of March, Freeman's goals had helped Burnley to the top of the table with a seven-point margin over third placed Derby County with five games to play and promotion seemed secured. The absence, however, of winger Dick Lindley contributed to the club only collecting three more points and Burnley missed out on promotion finishing two points behind second place Chelsea. For Freeman, however, there was the satisfaction of finishing as the league's top scorer with 32 goals from 33 appearances and returning to the England side. He was selected for all three matches in the 1912 British Home Championship, the first of which came against Ireland on 10 February 1912 in which Freeman scored England's fourth goal in a 6‚Äì1 victory (with a hat-trick from Harold Fleming). He scored again in the next match, a 2‚Äì0 victory against Wales on 11 March and retained his place for the final match against Scotland on 23 March which ended 1‚Äì1, thus enabling England and Scotland to share the title. In 1912‚Äì13, Freeman at first struggled to maintain his form of the previous season, but in a run of ten straight League victories between November 1912 and January 1913 Freeman scored fifteen goals, representing an emphatic return to form. Haworth was by now building a team not just to gain promotion but to secure the club's place in the top division and, having already recruited Tommy Boyle from Barnsley the previous year to strengthen the defence, he signed winger Eddie Mosscrop in September 1912, followed by the signing of three players from Gainsborough Trinity in February (following an F.A. Cup tie between the two clubs), including goalkeeper Ronnie Sewell. These players were to form the core of the Burnley side over the next few years and all were future England internationals. By mid-February, Burnley were top of the table and Freeman scored twice to defeat First Division Middlesbrough in the third round of the cup to set up a tie at local rivals Blackburn Rovers, where a single goal from Boyle saw them through to a semi- final against Sunderland. A 0‚Äì0 draw on 29 March at Bramall Lane preceded a replay at St Andrew's which saw Burnley lose 3‚Äì2. The FA Cup run had distracted Burnley from the league, and they had slipped into second place. They were able to hold onto the runners-up position and Freeman was again the league's top scorer with 31 goals from 37 appearances as Burnley eventually secured their return to the top flight after an absence of 13 years, finishing second in the table behind Preston North End. The success of Freeman and Burnley led to calls for him to be selected again for England, but these were ignored by the England selectors who opted for George Elliott and then Harry Hampton at centre-forward, and Freeman's England career ended with three goals in five appearances of which four were won with one draw. In their first season back in the First Division, neither Freeman nor Burnley were able to replicate their form of the previous season, but neither were the club ever in danger of relegation as they finished the League season in twelfth place with Freeman scoring 16 goals from 31 appearances, a strike rate of a goal every other game. In the FA Cup, however, it was a different story as Freeman's two goals in the early rounds helped them reach a Fourth Round tie against Sunderland. After a goalless first match, Burnley won the replay 2‚Äì1 to avenge their defeat in the previous season's semi-final. The semi-final saw them come up against Sheffield United; the first match was again goalless, and in the replay at Goodison Park, Tommy Boyle scored the goal (a long-range effort past the Sheffield keeper) that put Burnley into the FA Cup Final for the first time in their history, where they were to meet Liverpool. The final was played at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre on 25 April, in front of King George V, who was the first reigning monarch to attend a Cup Final. The final itself was something of an anti-climax, after the drama of the early rounds. A fierce shot on 58 minutes by Freeman gave Burnley \\"a narrow victory in an otherwise undistinguished match in which two teams with low positions in the League slogged it out in midfield, neither set of forwards being capable of mounting a sustained attack\\". Despite the lack of quality in the final, Burnley deserved the plaudits having been the first team to overcome five First Division clubs to take the trophy. Freeman started the 1914‚Äì15 season in prolific early season form as he scored ten goals in the first eleven league games. By the end of the year, however, Freeman's goalscoring touch had deserted him and manager John Haworth even tried playing him the wing in an unsuccessful attempt to rekindle some kind of form. A late-season run of good results saw the Clarets claim a final position of fourth in the table in which only three points separated the top seven teams, with Everton claiming the title. By now, league football had been interrupted by the First World War, but Freeman was to return to Turf Moor for two further seasons after the cessation of hostilities. Although only managing 12 goals in the first post- war season, Freeman was still Burnley's top goal-scorer for the season, as Burnley finished as runners-up in the First Division, nine points behind champions West Bromwich Albion. On 21 February 1920,Freeman became the first Burnley player to score 100 League goals, in a 2‚Äì0 win at Derby County. Freeman's final goal for Burnley came on 20 March in a 2‚Äì1 victory against Sunderland. The following season, he played in the first three matches, all of which ended in defeats and he lost his place to Joe Anderson. He then had to sit and watch as none of the next thirty games were lost and his league career at Burnley was over. As a result, he did not receive a Championship medal despite the contributions that he had made to Burnley's success in his time with the club. He made one final appearance as a replacement for Anderson in a 3‚Äì0 FA Cup defeat at Hull City on 19 February 1921, and he joined Wigan Borough at the end of the season. In his ten years with Burnley, he scored a total of 115 goals in 189 appearances, having helped the club achieve top flight promotion and win the only FA Cup in its history. Shortly before he left Turf Moor, a local newspaper published this tribute: =Later career= He spent the 1921‚Äì22 season in the Third Division North with Wigan Borough where his 13 goals from 25 appearances made him the club's top scorer for the season. He subsequently played for Kettering Town and Kidderminster Harriers before retiring from football. Bert Freeman died in August 1955, aged 69. His brother, Walter was also a footballer, playing for Aston Villa, Birmingham and Fulham.

He was a member of the West Cavan Brigade IRA during the Irish War of Independence. Subsequently, he joined the National Army on 10 February 1922 as a Captain during the Irish Civil War. His rank was reduced to 2nd Lieutenant during the army cut-backs in 1924, following the end of the Civil War. He was promoted to Captain in September 1931 and resigned shortly thereafter. He changed profession and became a solicitor. In the early 1930s Cowan had become a supporter of Eoin O'Duffy's Blueshirts, but by 1938 had switched his political outlook and joined the Irish Labour Party. He first stood unsuccessfully for election at the 1937 general election as a Labour Party candidate for the Meath‚ÄìWestmeath constituency. He also stood unsuccessfully at the 1938, 1943 and 1944 general elections in the same constituency. Cowan left the Labour party in 1944, disillusioned with the infighting and turmoil. Initially, he became involved with a hardline Communist group known as (the) \\"Vanguard\\". The group advocated the abolition of private property, the ownership by the workers and labourers of the means of production and the assimilation of Ireland into a Federation of Socialist Republics once World War II had ceased. However, the group was (deliberately) extremely small, owing to Anti-Communist sentiments in Ireland and, with the prospects of growth slim, it was not long before Cowan had moved on from them. In 1946 he joined the newly formed Clann na Poblachta, where he became the party's first treasurer. He was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1948 general election as a Clann na Poblachta Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin North-East constituency. He sided with No√´l Browne over the Mother and Child Scheme and stood again as an independent candidate at the 1951 general election where he retained his seat. He was defeated at the 1954 general election and was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1961 general election. In the 1960 local elections he was returned for LEA No. 1 to Dublin City Council. The last eliminated candidate, Victor Carton, petitioned that High Court that Cowan was ineligible both as an undischarged bankrupt and having been sentenced to two years' hard labour within five years of the election. The petition would have been tried under the Municipal Corporations Act 1882, but in 1961 the High Court struck out the 1882 act as incompatible with the 1937 constitution, so that Cowan kept his seat.

He earned his undergraduate and law degrees from Howard University. He worked in private practice for more than a decade at Houston & Gardner, becoming a name partner in 1980. He was appointed to the bench of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals as an Associate Judge in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush and to the federal bench in 1994 by President Bill Clinton. Early life and education Sullivan was born in Washington, D.C. in 1947 and attended local schools. He graduated from McKinley Technology High School in 1964. In 1968, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Howard University, a historically black university, and in 1971 a Juris Doctor from the Howard University School of Law.  Career  Upon graduation from law school, Sullivan received a Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship. He was assigned to the Neighborhood Legal Services Program in Washington, D.C., where he worked for one year. The following year, he served as a law clerk to Superior Court Judge James A. Washington Jr., a former professor and dean of Howard University School of Law. In 1973, Sullivan joined the law firm of Houston & Gardner, co-founded by Charles Hamilton Houston, who had expanded Howard University Law School as its dean, and led litigation for the NAACP to overturn racially restrictive laws. Sullivan became a partner and was actively engaged in the general practice of law with that firm. In August 1980, his partner, William C. Gardner, was appointed as an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Sullivan was a name partner in the successor firm of Houston, Sullivan & Gardner. He also taught as an adjunct professor at the Howard University School of Law and has served as a member of the visiting faculty at Harvard Law School's Trial Advocacy Workshop. Sullivan was appointed by President Reagan to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on October 3, 1984. On November 25, 1991, Sullivan was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to serve as an Associate Judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. =Federal judicial service= Sullivan was nominated by President Bill Clinton on March 22, 1994, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated by Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 15, 1994, and received his commission on June 16, 1994. =Notable cases= Sullivan presided over a number of habeas corpus petitions in the early 21st century submitted on behalf of men detained by the United States military at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as part of President George W. Bush's response to the 9/11 attacks of terrorism. Sullivan presided over the 2008 trial of U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, who was convicted of seven felony ethics violations in October. During the trial, the judge refused requests by the defense for a mistrial to be declared, after information was revealed that the prosecution had withheld exculpatory Brady material. Eight days after the guilty verdict, Stevens narrowly lost his reelection bid. As more evidence of prosecutorial misconduct became known in early 2009, Judge Sullivan held four prosecutors in civil contempt of court. On April 1, 2009, following a Justice Department probe that found additional evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, the Department of Justice recommended that Stevens' conviction be dismissed. On April 7, 2009, Sullivan set aside the conviction and appointed a lawyer to investigate the prosecution team for criminal contempt. Subsequently, one of the four prosecutors held in contempt committed suicide. Ultimately, Sullivan dismissed the civil contempt charges, and no additional charges were brought against the three surviving prosecutors. In 2014, Sullivan was presiding over a case, Judicial Watch v. IRS, related to an ongoing investigation into the 2013 IRS controversy. There was a fruitless attempt to determine where the deleted emails of former IRS employee Lois Lerner had gone, what damage to her computer hard drive occurred, and what steps the IRS had taken to recover the information contained in the emails and on the hard drive. In 2015, Sullivan presided over a FOIA lawsuit involving the matter of Hillary Clinton's private email use while Secretary of State. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a woman and her child fled domestic abuse in El Salvador to seek asylum in the U.S. However, the mother was removed from her detention facility and likely put on a plane on August 9, 2018, despite Justice Department promises that she and others would not be deported before the judge could rule on their cases. Sullivan demanded, \\"Turn that plane around.\\" He threatened to hold those responsible for the removal in contempt of court, starting with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, if the situation was not rectified. A Department of Homeland Security official stated, \\"We are complying with the court's requests...the plaintiffs will not disembark and will be promptly returned to the United States.\\"Judge threatens to hold Jeff Sessions in contempt Mobile native's Justice Department deported woman, WKRG, Peter Albrecht, August 9, 2018.

Trump, 19-5237, 2020 WL 593891, at *5 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 7, 2020) US v Flynn The case of United States of America v. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, was randomly assigned to District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras. On December 1, 2017, Flynn and special counsel Robert Mueller agreed to a plea bargain in the D.C. court. In the plea bargain, Flynn admitted to one count of lying to the FBI and said he was cooperating with the Mueller investigation. Ross, Brian et al. \\"Flynn has promised special counsel 'full cooperation' in Russia probe: Source\\", ABC News (December 1, 2017). On December 7, Contreras recused himself from the case, which was randomly reassigned to Sullivan. After questioning Flynn about his reasons for pleading guilty, Sullivan accepted Flynn's guilty plea. Sullivan deferred sentencing Flynn several times because prosecutors indicated he was still cooperating with their investigation. In June 2019 Flynn changed attorneys and began to assert that investigators and prosecutors had acted improperly. On December 16, 2019, Sullivan rejected Flynn's claims of entrapment by the FBI and malfeasance by prosecutors, and set sentencing for January 28, 2020. On January 14, 2020, Flynn filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea \\"because of the government‚Äôs bad faith, vindictiveness, and breach of the plea agreement.\\" On January 16, Sullivan postponed Flynn's sentencing date to February 27. On May 7, 2020, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said it would move to drop all charges against Flynn. It was left to Sullivan to determine whether to dismiss the charges and, if so, whether to do it \\"with prejudice\\" to prevent a retrial.U.S. Drops Michael Flynn Case, in Move Backed by Trump, The New York Times, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner, May 8, 2020. Retrieved May 8, 2020. On May 11, 2020, former federal judge and prosecutor John Gleeson co-authored with other former law enforcement officials an op-ed encouraging Judge Sullivan to scrutinize the DOJ's motion. On May 12, Sullivan announced that he would place a hold on the DOJ's move to drop charges against Flynn, and would consider a hearing involving \\"friend of the court\\" (amicus curiae) input from outside parties with interests and perspectives. On May 13, Sullivan appointed Gleeson as amicus to formally oppose the DOJ's attempt to drop charges, and to look into whether Flynn had committed perjury when he twice told the court under oath that he was guilty. Sullivan said \\"at the appropriate time\\" he would set a schedule for outside parties to argue against the DOJ's claims as it moves to drop the charges. On May 19, Flynn's post-conviction attorney filed a writ of mandamus appeal with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking that Sullivan be ordered to drop the charges, challenging his decision to appoint Gleeson, and asking that he be removed from the case.writ of mandamus petition' On May 21, citing US v Fokker Servs, BV, 818 F.3d 733 (DC Cir 2016), the D.C. Circuit ordered Sullivan to respond to the writ of mandamus by June 1, 2020, and invited the government to respond within the same 10-day period.'DC Circuit Court Of Appeals May 21, 2020 Order' On June 1, as part of his response, Sullivan argued that the Fokker decision does not apply because it did not consider a situation where the defendant pleaded guilty twice and the prosecutor changed course; Sullivan moved to dismiss. Oral arguments before a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel were held on June 12, 2020.'Judges appear skeptical of DOJ move to dismiss Flynn case, as his lawyer alleges 'government misconduct'; DC Circuit Oral Argument in Michael Flynn Perjury Dismissal Case, C-Span.

On June 24, 2020, in a 2-1 decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel granted Flynn's petition for writ of mandamus, ordering Judge Sullivan to dismiss the case. \\"In this case, the district court‚Äôs actions will result in specific harms to the exercise of the Executive Branch‚Äôs exclusive prosecutorial power. The contemplated proceedings would likely require the Executive to reveal the internal deliberative process behind its exercise of prosecutorial discretion, interfering with the Article II charging authority.\\" The decision also vacated Judge Sullivan's amicus appointment on mootness grounds. In response to the higher court ruling, Judge Sullivan issued an order canceling the July 16 hearing date, but did not address the DOJ's motion further. Judge Sullivan's options were either to request the full appellate court to review the case, or to grant the DOJ's motion to dismiss the charges in accordance with the writ of mandamus. On July 9, Judge Sullivan asked the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the June 24 decision, saying the panel's decision represented a \\"dramatic break from precedent\\". On July 20, 2020, Flynn filed his response to Judge Sullivan's request for the full court to review the panel decision to order the criminal charges dismissed.

On August 11, the full appeals court heard arguments from the DOJ and from Sullivan's attorney. On August 31, the appeals court declined to order dismissal of Flynn's prosecution. In an en banc hearing, eight of the D.C. Circuit judges ruled in favor of allowing Sullivan to adjudicate the case. Only the two judges who ruled in favor of Flynn in June, ruled against the decision. In their dissent, they reversed their earlier position that the case should not be taken from Sullivan and assigned to another judge.Appeals court deals setback to Flynn‚Äôs attempt to end DOJ case, Politico, Josh Gerstein, August 31, 2020.

Before this \\"widening of the behavioural repertoire\\",S. Conway Morris, 2001 bottom-dwelling animals mainly grazed on the microbial mats that lined the surface, crawling above or burrowing just below them. These microbial mats created a barrier between the water and the sediment underneath, which was less water-logged than modern sea-floors, and almost completely anoxic (lacking in oxygen). As a result, the substrate was inhabited by sulfate-reducing bacteria, whose emissions of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) made the substrate toxic to most other organisms. Around the start of the Cambrian, organisms began to burrow vertically, forming a great diversity of different fossilisable burrow forms as they penetrated the sediment for protection or to feed. These burrowing animals broke down the microbial mats, and thus allowed water and oxygen to penetrate a considerable distance below the surface. This restricted the sulfate-reducing bacteria and their H2S emissions to the deeper layers, making the upper layers of the sea-floor habitable for a much wider range of organisms. The upper level of the sea- floor became wetter and softer as it was constantly churned up by burrowers. Burrowing before the Cambrian An Ediacaran trace fossil, made when an organism burrowed below a microbial mat The traces of organisms moving on and directly underneath the microbial mats that covered the Ediacaran sea floor are preserved from the Ediacaran period, about . The only Ediacaran burrows are horizontal, on or just below the surface, and were made by animals which fed above the surface, but burrowed to hide from predators. If these burrows are biogenic (made by organisms) they imply the presence of motile organisms with heads, which would probably have been bilaterans (bilaterally symmetrical animals). Putative \\"burrows\\" dating as far back as may have been made by animals that fed on the undersides of microbial mats, which would have shielded them from a chemically unpleasant ocean; however, their uneven width and tapering ends make it difficult to believe that they were made by living organisms, and the original author has suggested that the menisci of burst bubbles are more likely to have created the marks he observed. The Ediacaran burrows found so far imply simple behaviour, and the complex, efficient feeding traces common from the start of the Cambrian are absent. Some simple pre-Cambrian horizontal traces could have been produced by large single-celled organisms; equivalent traces are produced by protists today. The early Cambrian diversification of burrow forms From the very start of the Cambrian period (about ) many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as Diplocraterion and Skolithos, and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as Cruziana and Rusophycus. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard (although not necessarily mineralised) exoskeletons. Advantages of burrowing =Feeding= Many organisms burrow to obtain food, either in the form of other burrowing organisms, or organic matter. The remains of planktonic organisms sink to the sea floor, providing a source of nutrition; if these organics are mixed into the sediment they can be fed upon. However, it is possible that before the Cambrian, plankton were too small to sink, so there was no supply of organic carbon to the sea floor. However, it appears that organisms did not feed upon the sediment itself until after the Cambrian. =Anchorage= An advantage to living within the substrate would be protection from being washed away by currents. =Protection= Organisms also burrow to avoid predation. Predatory behaviour first appeared over 1 billion years ago, but predation on large organisms appears to have first become significant shortly before the start of the Cambrian. Precambrian burrows served a protective function, as the animals that made them fed above the surface; they evolved at the same time as other organisms began forming mineralised skeletons. Enabling burrowing Microbial mats formed a blanket, cutting off the underlying sediments from the ocean water above. This meant that the sediments were anoxic, and hydrogen sulfide () was abundant. The free exchange of the pore waters with oxygenated ocean water was essential to make the sediments habitable. This exchange was made possible by the action of minute animals: Too small to produce burrows of their own, this meiofauna inhabited the spaces between sand grains in the microbial mats. Their bioturbation ‚Äì movement that dislodged grains and disturbed the resistant biomats ‚Äì broke the mats up, allowing water and chemicals above and below to mix. Effects of the revolution The Cambrian substrate revolution was a long and patchy process that proceeded at different rates in different locations throughout much of the Cambrian. =Effects on ecosystems= After the agronomic revolution, the microbial mats that had covered the Ediacaran sea floor became increasingly restricted to a limited range of environments: *Very harsh environments, such as hyper-saline lagoons or brackish estuaries, which were uninhabitable for the burrowing organisms that broke up the mats. *Rocky substrates which the burrowers could not penetrate. *The depths of the oceans, where burrowing activity today is at a similar level to that in the shallow coastal seas before the revolution. Ironically, the first burrowers probably fed on the microbial mats, while burrowing underneath them for protection; this burrowing led to the downfall of the mats they were feeding on. Before the revolution, bottom dwelling organisms fell into four categories: *\\"mat encrusters\\", which were permanently attached to the mat; *\\"mat scratchers\\", which grazed the surface of the mat without destroying it; *\\"mat stickers\\", suspension feeders that were partially embedded in the mat; and *\\"undermat miners\\", which burrowed underneath the mat and fed on decomposing mat material. The \\"undermat miners\\" appear to have died out by the middle of the Cambrian period. \\"Mat encrusters\\" and \\"mat stickers\\" either died out or developed more secure anchors that were specialised for soft or hard substrates. \\"Mat scratchers\\" were restricted to rocky substrates and the depths of the oceans, where both they and the mats could survive. Crinoid holdfasts on a hard substrate from the Upper Ordovician of northern Kentucky Early sessile echinoderms were mostly \\"mat stickers\\". The helicoplacoids failed to adapt to the new conditions and died out; the edrioasteroids and eocrinoids survived by developing holdfasts for attachment to hard substrates, and stalks that raised their feeding apparatus above most of the debris that burrowers stirred up in the looser sea-floors. Mobile echinoderms (stylophorans, homosteleans, homoiosteleans, and ctenocystoids) were not significantly affected by the substrate revolution. Early molluscs appear to have grazed on microbial mats, so it is natural to hypothesize that grazing molluscs were also restricted to areas where the mats could survive. The earliest known fossils of monoplacophoran (\\"single-plated\\") molluscs date from the Early Cambrian, where they grazed on microbial mats. Most modern monoplacophorans live on soft substrates in deep parts of the seas, although one genus lives on hard substrates at the edges of continental shelves. Modern monoplacophorans have less diverse shell forms than fossil genera. Unfortunately, the oldest known fossils of polyplacophorans (molluscs with multiple shell plates) are from the Late Cambrian, when the substrate revolution had significantly changed marine environments. Since they are found with stromatolites (stubby pillars built by some types of microbial mat colony), it is thought that polyplacophorans grazed on microbial mats. Modern polyplacophorans mainly graze on mats on rocky coastlines, although a few live in the deep sea. No fossils have been found of aplacophorans (shell-less molluscs), which are generally regarded as the most primitive living molluscs. Some burrow into the sea-floors of deep waters, feeding on micro-organisms and detritus; others live on reefs and eat coral polyps. =Palaeontological significance= The revolution put an end to the conditions which allowed exceptionally preserved fossil beds or lagerst√§tten such as the Burgess Shale to be formed. The direct consumption of carcasses was relatively unimportant in reducing fossilisation, compared to changes in sediments' chemistry, porosity, and microbiology, which made it difficult for the chemical gradients necessary for soft-tissue mineralisation to develop. Just like microbial mats, environments which could produce this mode of fossilisation became increasingly restricted to harsher and deeper areas, where burrowers could not establish a foothold; as time progressed, the extent of burrowing increased sufficiently to effectively make this mode of preservation impossible. Post- Cambrian lagerst√§tten of this nature are typically found in very unusual environments. The rise in burrowing is of further significance, for burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile bottom-dwelling organisms. This furthers palaeontologists' understanding of the early Cambrian, and provides an additional line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact - even if its timing did not coincide directly with the Agronomic revolution. The rise of burrowing represents such a fundamental change to the ecosystem, that the appearance of the complex burrow Treptichnus pedum is used to mark the base of the Cambrian period.though it has since been found in lower, technically \\"Precambrian\\", strata. * =Geochemical significance= The increased level of bioturbation meant that sulfur, which is steadily supplied to the oceanic system from volcanoes and river runoff, was more readily oxidised - rather than being rapidly buried and sitting in its reduced form (sulfide), burrowing organisms continually exposed it to oxygen, allowing it to be oxidised to sulfate. This activity is suggested to account for a sudden rise in sulfate concentration observed near the base of the Cambrian; this can be recorded in the geochemical record both by using isotopic tracers, and by quantifying the abundance of the sulfate mineral gypsum.

He was later a politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1727 to 1734, becoming Governor of Gibraltar in 1730. Early life Sabine was probably the son of Walter Sabine and grandson of Avery Sabine, alderman and mayor of Canterbury, who died in 1648. He joined the army at the time of the Glorious Revolution. In 1690 he married Hester Whitfield, daughter of Henry Whitfield, who, after having three sons who all died young, herself died at the age of 24. Military career Sabine was appointed captain lieutenant to Sir Henry Ingoldsby's regiment of foot on 8 March 1689 and became captain of the Grenadier company before 18 October 1689. He served in Ireland under William III, and was granted estates in county Kildare. On 13 July 1691, he became major of Colonel Charles Herbert's regiment. He took part in William III's campaigns in the Low Countries, during the Nine Years' War, and became lieutenant colonel on 6 July 1695 and fought at the Siege of Namur. Sabine served with the 23rd or Royal Welch Fusiliers in the War of Spanish Succession. He obtained the brevet rank of colonel on 1 January 1703. Under Marlborough he was wounded on 2 July 1704 at the battle of Schellenberg, and on 1 April following became colonel of his regiment. He commanded his Regiment at the Battle of Blenheim.Joseph Sabine at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He took part in the battle of Ramillies, being stationed with the fusiliers on the right of the English line. On 1 January 1707 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. At the Battle of Oudenarde on 11 July 1708 he led the attack on the village of Heynam, and afterwards he took part in the Siege of Lille. On 1 January 1710 he was appointed major-general, and was given command of the Citadel at Ghent where he had to put down a mutiny in 1712. He married as his second wife Margaretta Newsham in 1711. When peace was concluded, Sabine returned with his regiment to England. In 1715 he purchased the estate of Tewin in Hertfordshire, and rebuilt the house in the following year. Then in 1716 he commanded a Brigade sent to confront the Pretender's Army at Perth. Later that year he became Commander of the British Army throughout Scotland. in May 1716. In July, the Duke of Atholl complained of ‚Äòthe conduct of General Sabine and other King‚Äôs officers, in regard to rebel prisoners and ... of the plundering and other impositions made by the troops‚Äô in Perthshire. In 1719 he was appointed Governor of Berwick and of Holy Island. Political career At the 1727 British general election, Sabine was returned on the Government interest as Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon- Tweed. He voted with the Government until he was appointed Governor of Gibraltar in 1730, having been promoted to General. He did not stand at the 1734 British general election. Sabine died at Gibraltar on 24 October 1739. His portrait was painted by Godfrey Kneller in 1711 and engraved by Faber in 1742.

It is described as having a fruity, citrus flavor with a searing heat comparable to the habanero, to which it is related and from which it may have derived. History Originally from the Americas, like all chilli species, the specific variety known as Fatalii was 'discovered' and is thought to have developed in Central Africa. Since commerce between the Americas and Africa has spanned some four centuries or more, this is uncontroversial.  Cultivation  The plants typically grow in height, but may reach or taller under optimal growing conditions, and plant distance should be about the same. The pendant pods get long and about wide. From a pale green, the most common variety matures to a bright yellow. Less common are red, chocolate and white Fataliis. The red version of Fatalii apparently has a somewhat different flavor and shorter, wider pods, maturing from medium green to dark red but the strain is unstable, throwing yellow and orange fruit. The white Fatalii tastes very like the standard yellow version, but lighter and more citrusy, and has similar heat, perhaps a fraction less.  Raw chilli taste When eating a whole white chili and chewing for at least 10 seconds before swallowing (not recommended for untrained tasters) the heat may be first felt aggressively in the back of the throat, up the nose, then eventually moves to the roof of the mouth and finally the tongue where the pain is intense, at which point there can be gustatory sweating and tears from the eyes. Some tasters note the strong, fruity Fatalii flavour, which is quite distinct, as being almost identical to the yellow version. Others find it milder. Hot chili aficionados who have tasted all four colour varieties report the heat increasing from the white, which has pronounced citrus lime and lemon flavours, through yellow, then red, then to the hottest and sweetest being the chocolate or brown Fatalii. The distinctive chinense (species) fruit flavour, also present in Habanero, becomes more prominent in the yellow than the white, and increases and becomes more rounded in the red and the chocolate. The effect of the chili heat also differs in the colour forms. White and yellow have more effect on the back of the throat and are slower to decline than the red and brown, which have more of a searing mouth burn, especially the tongue. The initial taste is of the fruit and sweetness, before the heat starts after about 30 seconds, peaking between two and five minutes when it declines. The heat decline of the red and chocolate falls more quickly than the white and yellow.  Culinary use  The Fatalii is known for its extreme heat and citrus flavor. It can be made into a hot sauce with other citrus flavors including lime and lemon. The heat can be reduced (extended) with oil and nuts. Variations of Fatalii hot sauces often include fruits including pineapple and mango. It can be used fresh diced to add heat and spice to marinades, dressings, barbeque sauces, salsa, and chutney. The Fatalli can be combined with fruit to make jelly and jam. Being thin-walled it is an ideal pepper for drying. It is reported to add a fruity flavor and spice when brewing beer.

In 1898 four more machines were acquired (Nos. 1906‚Äì1909), for the Ammersee Railway and in 1903 another five for the Munich‚ÄìHerrsching railway. On these new engines the coal bunker lay behind the driver's cab, so that the distance between the third coupled axle and the trailing axle was increased by 200 mm and the total length of the locomotives by 500 mm. In addition, the Riggenbach counter-pressure brake from the first series was omitted. The boiler (apart from the location of the steam dome) and the running gear, and hence also the performance, remained unchanged. The Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) had received similar locomotives, the Class T 4.I, that however were somewhat smaller and had smaller driving and carrying wheels. = DRG Class = In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft took over nine of the ten locomotives of the first series and all nine of the second redesignating them as the DRG Class 98.6 with nos. 98 661‚Äì669 and 98 671 and 98 679. The first series was retired by 1933, the second by about 1937. After the Second World War one vehicle went to the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñsterreichische Bundesbahnen or √ñBB) and was in service there until 1958 as √ñBB 891.01.  Augsburg Branch Line  The Augsburg branch line (Augsburger Localbahn or AL) bought three locomotives in 1913 from Krauss, that were the same as the D VIII's of the second series. The locomotives, numbered 1‚Äì3, performed very well on the, in places, very tight curves of the branch line, so that even in 1937 ‚Äì based on drawings almost 40 years old ‚Äì a fourth locomotive of this type was procured, this time from Krauss-Maffei. It was given the railway number 5. Locomotive Nos. 1 and 3 were scrapped in 1957, nos. 2 and 5 were sold in 1956 to the Southern Chemical Factory (S√ºdchemie- Werk) in Kelheim.

Dating from at least the 11th century AD, it is famous for its scenic belvedere, the Terrazzo dell'lnfinito (Terrace of Infinity). Much altered and extended in the early twentieth century by Ernest William Beckett (later Lord Grimthorpe), the villa is today composed of many salvaged architectural elements from other parts of Italy and elsewhere; little of the original structure remains visible. The gardens were redeveloped by Beckett at the same time. The villa is now a hotel and luxury wedding venue, its gardens open to the public. History Terrazzo dell'lnfinito, Villa Cimbrone's belvedere Villa Cimbrone stands on a rocky outcrop known as \\"Cimbronium\\", and it is from this landscape feature that the villa takes its name. The earliest references to the villa date back to the eleventh century AD, when the villa belonged to the Accongiogioco, a noble family. It later passed to the ownership of a wealthy and influential family, the Fusco, who are also recorded in 1291 as owning the local church of S. Angelo de Cimbrone. At a later stage in its history the villa became part of the nearby monastery of Santa Chiara, and during this period of the villa's history the papal arms of Cardinal Della Rovere were placed on the old entrance gate. From the seventeenth century the villa's history is uncertain, but by the second half of the nineteenth century the villa had passed to the Amici family of Atrani. It was visited by the historian Ferdinand Gregorovius, who described it thus in his Siciliana: Wanderings in Naples and Sicily (1861): > Incomparable ... where the most beautiful flowers you can imagine > flourished, coming from numerous plants of the South ... redesigned and > enriched with countless ... ornamental features, small temples, pavilions, > bronze and stone statues. and referring to the belvedere (known as the Terrazzo dell'lnfinito): > While contemplating from those Armida's orchards, among the roses and the > hydrangeas, that magic sea in which the blue colour of a very limpid sky is > reflected, the wish of being able to fly comes out ... Right at the edge of > the crag there was a terrace commanding an enchanting view; it was > surrounded by horrible marble statues which, however, from afar, had a sort > of appeal. =Twentieth century alterations= The Cloister The Temple of Bacchus Ernest Beckett had visited the villa during his travels in Italy and had fallen in love with it. He bought it from the Amici family in 1904, and enlisted the help of Nicola Mansi, a tailor-barber-builder from Ravello whom he had met in England, to help with the restoration and enlargement of the villa and gardens. He embarked on an ambitious programme of works, including the construction of battlements, terraces and cloister in a mixture of mock- Gothic, Moorish, and Venetian architectural styles. The gardens, strung out along the cliff face, were similarly redeveloped. Beckett was reputed to be the father of Violet Trefusis; the connection with Violet brought Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson as visitors, and Vita is said to have given advice about the garden,Ann Lar√•s, √Öke Lindman, Gardens of Italy, 2005, p 88f. though her own gardening ventures at Long Barn still lay some years in the future. Beckett died in London in 1917 and his body was brought to Villa Cimbrone to be buried at the base of the Temple of Bacchus in the gardens; apt lines of Catullus are inscribed on the frieze: After Beckett's death, the villa passed to his son. Beckett's daughter Lucy (Lucille Katherine Beckett, 1884-1979) also lived at the villa, where she was a keen gardener and breeder of roses, including the \\"Rose of Ravello\\" in the thirties. Many famous visitors came to the villa during the Beckett family's ownership. It was a favourite haunt of the Bloomsbury Group, including Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf, E. M. Forster, John Maynard Keynes, and Lytton Strachey. Other visitors included D. H. Lawrence, Vita Sackville-West, Edward James, Diana Mosley, Henry Moore, T. S. Eliot, Jean Piaget, Winston Churchill and the Duke and Duchess of Kent. The actress Greta Garbo and her then-lover, the conductor Leopold Stokowski, stayed at the villa several times in the late 1930s; a visit of 1938 is memorialized on a plaque.Lar√•s, and Lindman 2005. =Today= The villa was sold in 1960 to the Vuilleumier family, who used it first as a private family home, and for the past few years as a hotel. In 1976, the American writer Gore Vidal, who lived in La Rondinaia (a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett) from 1972 to 2004, wrote of Villa Cimbrone: > Twenty-five years ago I was asked by an American magazine what was the most > beautiful place that I had ever seen in all my travels and I said the view > from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the > sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell > one from the other.

Overview Miss Dance of Great Britain is a long running theatre dance competition for girls, established and organised by the International Dance Teachers Association. The national finals are held annually at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool, England. The finals also include the judging of the boys competition, Dance Master UK, and the International Ballet Championships. =Qualifying= Entrants who wish to compete in the national finals of Miss Dance, must first qualify for the competition by winning a regional heat. Heats are held at dance festivals nationwide throughout the year. The majority of these festivals are independently run and must apply to the IDTA in order to stage a heat of Miss Dance. To enter a regional heat, competitors must be aged 16 years or over on 31 May in the year of competition and must be amateur dancers or be in full- time training. Professional dancers are not permitted to enter. In the heats, each competitor performs a three-minute solo dance in a modern theatre or cabaret style. This may include jazz, tap, song, dialogue, instrumentation or comedy, with dance as the dominant discipline. Classical Ballet, character dance or national dance styles are not permitted. The IDTA requests that competitors present a solo that has been specially choreographed for the competition. Should a competitor win their regional heat, they must perform the same solo, without changes, at the national final. To qualify for the national finals, a competitor must win their heat with a score of 85 marks or more, and they then represent that festival at the finals. A runner-up place is also awarded and the runner-up may compete at the national finals if they have scored a qualifying mark and only if the heat winner is unable to compete. It is very common for dancers to compete in numerous regional heats throughout the country in order to qualify for the national finals. =The Finals= The national finals of Miss Dance are organised by the IDTA and are held annually at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool. During the finals, the competitors compete in a series of dance-offs, judged by a panel of specialist adjudicators. This narrows down the number of competitors to a selection of finalists, who then perform again for the judges in the grand final and the winner of the Miss Dance title is awarded. The winner of Miss Dance of Great Britain receives a trophy and a cash prize, with trophies also being awarded for the runner-up and 3rd places. The winner is given the title of Miss Dance of Great Britain, until a new winner is chosen the following year. Being a prestigious competition, the winner of Miss Dance will normally enjoy a number of other benefits including dancing at various IDTA seminars and events, and being invited to perform at the IDTA's annual showcase gala at a major UK theatre. Because it is such a prestigious title the previous winners of miss dance's names will all be published in the most recent programmes. Their names will ascend chronologically.

In 1888‚Äì92, Giacometti and Amiet continued their studies in Paris, where Amiet studied at the Acad√©mie Julian under Adolphe-William Bouguereau, Tony Robert-Fleury and Gabriel Ferrier. Dissatisfied with academic art, Amiet joined the Pont-Aven School in 1892, where he learned from √âmile Bernard, Paul S√©rusier, Roderic O'Conor and Armand S√©guin. In Pont-Aven, he came to prefer the use of pure colour to tonal painting. In 1893, Amiet's lack of funds forced him to return to Switzerland, where he set up a studio in Hellsau. A first exposition at the Kunsthalle Basel in 1894 was generally ill-received. In the 1890s, Amiet continued to collaborate with Giacometti and had only modest commercial success, until he was commissioned in 1898 to paint a portrait of Ferdinand Hodler, whose work would later exert a great influence on Amiet. His fortunes improved greatly in the 1900s, when he began participating in numerous European expositions and competitions, winning a silver medal in the Exposition Universelle for his work Richesse du soir (1899). After his 1898 marriage to Anna Luder von Hellsau (d. 1951), Amiet moved to Oschwand, where his house became a meeting place for artists and writers such as Wilhelm Worringer, Adolf Frey, Hermann Hesse, Arthur Weese, and Samuel Singer, and where he taught students such as Werner Miller, Marta Worringer, Hans Morgenthaler, Hanny Bay, , Albert M√ºller, Josef M√ºller, Walter Sautter, Werner Neuhaus, and Peter Thalmann. In the late 1920s and in the 1930s, Amiet executed numerous wall paintings. A 1931 fire in the M√ºnchner Glaspalast destroyed 50 of his most significant works. Amiet was a member in the Swiss Federal Art Commission (1911‚Äì15 and 1931‚Äì32), a board member of the Gottfried Keller Foundation (1934‚Äì48) and of the Kunstmuseum Bern (1935‚Äì48). He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Berne in 1919. He died in 1961 in Oschwand. Work Amiet created more than 4,000 paintings, of which more than 1,000 are self-portraits.Cuno Amiet: self-portrait, 1922, Museo Cantonale d'Arte, Lugano The great scope of his work of 70 years, and Amiet's predilection for experimentation, make his ≈ìuvre appear disparate at first ‚Äì a constant, though, is the primacy of colour. His numerous landscape paintings depict many winter scenes, gardens and fruit harvests. Ferdinand Hodler remained a constant point of reference, although Amiet's artistic intentions diverged ever further from those of Hodler, whom Amiet could and would not match in his mastery of monumental scale and form. While Amiet took up themes of expressionism, his works retain a sense of harmony of colour grounded in the French tradition. He continued to pursue mainly decorative intentions at the beginning of the 20th century, but his late work of the 1940s and 50s is focused on more abstract concepts of space and light, characterised by dots of colour and a pastel brilliance.

They are only found in two widely separated areas, Southeast Asia extending to Indonesia, and South Africa. In the Paleogene, they were found at least in North America and Europe also, occurring perhaps across the entire Northern Hemisphere. As in other belids, their antennae are straight, not elbowed as in the true weevils (Curculionidae). They are far less characteristic than their presumed closest living relatives, the Aglycyderini. They can be recognized by the sharp-sided rostrum (\\"snout\\"). Also, their eyes are bordered by a wide and ridged groove. Metrioxena shows two sharp ribs on each elytron, which are absent in the other genera. These, by contrast, have their tarsal claws fused together at the base (they are unfused in Metrioxena) and grooves on the pygidium which are absent in Metrioxena. Distribution and ecology The type genus Metrioxena contains twelve described species apart from the fossil ones mentioned below. They are today restricted to parts Southeast Asia, extending into the Indonesian archipelago. Roughly, they occur between Thailand and the Philippines and from Malaysia to the Tanimbar Islands. They have been found on Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi and offshore Ternate but are hitherto unknown from Borneo and the Lesser Sunda Islands where they conceivably might also occur. Considering that in the Paleogene the genus (or very close relatives) were found in North America and Europe, it may well be that the present distribution is a relict of a formerly Holarctic range. The Paleogene was warmer than our time, and the climate in today's temperate latitudes was by then indeed more like that in today's Southeast Asia. Afrocorynus contains presently two described species, which are only known to occur in the mountains and hills that extend on the southern coast of South Africa, between Mosselbay in the west, Grahamstown in the east, and the Karoo inland. Hispodes occurs in similar habitat extending eastwards and inland, with the single described species (H. spicatus) found hitherto only in the Katberg region, and an undescribed species known from the Drakensberg escarpment south of Tzaneen. =Larval host plants= Metrioxena apparently feed only on Arenga sugar palms (Arecaceae). Larvae, though little is known about them, are probably eating the wood of dead or dying trees, while the adults eat pollen. The Paleogene fossil Metrioxena electrica was found in conifer amber from the Baltic region, where palms are known to have grown some 50 million years ago. The South African species seem to be dependent on the Knysna-Amatole montane forests biome. Very little is known about their host plants. The first specimen of Afrocorynus asparagi was found on \\"wild asparagus\\" but this seems a most unlikely host plant for Belidae; in any case it has never again been found on an Asparagus species but only on Putterlickia pyracantha (Celastraceae). Hispodes spicatus has not been recorded from any other plant than Rhoicissus tridentata (Vitaceae). And though the Knysna-Amatole montane forests hold the conifers Podocarpus and African cypress (Widdringtonia), which seem plausible host plants considering what other Belidae feed on, the Rosidae P. pyracantha and R. tridentata actually grown in shrubby habitat interspersed with the actual montane forest. It may be that H. spicatus larvae feed - atypically for the family - on flower buds, as they have not been found in immature fruits which, apart from wood, are the other known food-type of Belidae larvae. More probably, they feed on the decaying wood like most of their relatives. Presumably, the original host plants of belid larvae were conifers, namely Araucariaceae. From there the Metrioxenini shifted to palms. The African lineages might have host-shifted to the Rosidae shrubs directly (from conifers) or indirectly (via palms, which used to occur in their present range but eventually disappeared). This issue could be resolved by checking whether the Pondoland Palm (Jubaeopsis caffra), the only survivor from the original palmtree flora of Southern Africa, is host to a metrioxenine. Systematics and evolution The three currently recognized living genera of Metrioxenini are occasionally assigned to subtribes, that seem almost superfluous, as it seems that the presently monotypic Metrioxenina simply represent a more basal lineage and the Afrocorynina (Afrocorynus and Hispodes) a more advanced one. But the relationship among the genera is not resolved with complete certainty. Indeed, Metrioxena was sometimes placed in the Oxycoryninae and the Afrocorynina elevated to full tribe status, but this seems to be in error. It is possible that Metrioxena iwill eventually be split up into several genera (e.g. Prometrioxena). Hispodes on the other hand is occasionally separated in a subtribe of Hispodini, which Marvaldi and co-writers 2006 find to be an unwarranted arrangement, since it would render all subtribes monotypic and thus redundant. The fossil record shows that the Metrioxenini were well distinct by the mid-Paleogene, about 50 million years ago (mya). The belids as a whole are of Jurassic origin,Ming et al. (2006) and the Metrioxenini must thus have evolved in the Late Cretaceous or perhaps Paleocene, roughly some 100-60 mya. There are three fossil species of Metrioxenini known to date: Paltorhynchus bisulcatus of the Early Eocene Green River Formation and \\"Paltorhynchus\\" narwhal from the latest Eocene or earliest Oligocene of the Florissant Fossil Beds are both from North America. If the latter species actually belongs in the modern genus Metrioxena, since it is the type species of Paltorhynchus, that name would become a junior synonym of Metrioxena and a new genus would have to be established for the more primitive \\"P.\\" bisulcatus. That species might represent another genus of the Metrioxenina or a still more basal member of the tribe. Metrioxena electrica known from Baltic amber and of comparable age to the North American fossils, is sometimes separated in Archimetrioxena.

CVLT, California Verbal Learning Test: Adult Version: Manual. Psychological Corporation. is one of the most widely used neuropsychological tests in North America. As an instrument, it represents a relatively new approach to clinical psychology and the cognitive science of memory. It measures of episodic verbal learning and memory, and demonstrates sensitivity to a range of clinical conditions.Elwood, R. W. (1995). The California Verbal Learning Test: psychometric characteristics and clinical application. Neuropsychology Review, 5(3), 173‚Äì201. The test does this by attempting to link memory deficits with impaired performance on specific tasks. It assesses encoding, recall and recognition in a single modality of item presentation (auditory-verbal). The CVLT is considered to be a more sensitive measure of episodic memory than other verbal learning tests. It was designed to not only measure how much a subject learned, but also reveal strategies employed and the types of errors made. The CVLT indexes free and cued recall, serial position effects (including primacy and recency), semantic clustering, intrusions, interference and recognition. Delis et al. (1994) released the California Verbal Learning Test for Children (CVLT-C). The California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) is an updated version of the original CVLT, which has been standardized and provides normative data.  Measures  CVLT generates a wide variety of measures: * Immediate Recall * Short Delay Free Recall * Short Delay Cued Recall * Long Delay Free Recall * Long Delay Cued Recall * Long Delay Recognition  Administration  The original CVLT was normed on a 'reference sample' of 273 nonclinical subjects.Elwood, R. W. (1995). The California Verbal Learning Test: psychometric characteristics and clinical application. Neuropsychology Review, 5(3), 173-201. The experimenter reads a list of 16 nouns aloud, at one-second intervals, in fixed order, over five learning trials (list A). After each trial, the subject is asked to recall as many words as they can in any order (i.e., free recall). A big feature, compared to other verbal learning tests, is that the words are drawn from four semantic categories (tools, fruits, clothing, spices and herbs), with no consecutive words from the same category. If a subject 'clusters' words from a category together, it is probable that they are using semantic organisation. An interference list (list B) is presented that shares two categories from List A (e.g., fruit and tools) and has two unshared categories (e.g., fish and kitchen utensils). However neither list uses common words for a specific category (e.g., apples used rather than bananas). Free and cued recall of list A are tested immediately (short-delay), and again after 20 minutes (long-delay). In cued recall, the experimenter prompts the subjects with the word category. The CVLT ends with a recognition task, where the experimenter presents the subject with a 44-word list, and the subject must indicate whether it is a target word or a distractor. Some distractors share semantic categories with the target words while others sound alike. The 44-word list is presented like shopping list as it was argued that this is an activity that people face in their everyday activities. Background participant information about age, sex, and ethnicity are recorded for demographic purposes. The words have an average of 2.37 syllables and there are 64% of distractor items on the recognition list.  Analysis  A computer administration and scoring system generates scores for every measure, graphs a learning curve, and provides learning parameters, response errors and interference effects. Raw scores are used for all analyses, ultimately determining how many errors are made in each learning task. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test assesses practice effects and Spearman's rho (p) correlation coefficient is conducted to assess test-retest reliability. Primary learning, recall and recognition measures are recorded as well as the more detailed process measures such as errors, contrast scores, and ratio. It is suggested that a general verbal learning component consistently accounts for about 35-40% of the total variance and consists of total free recall over the five trials of list A, semantic clustering free and cued recall (both short- and long-delays), and recognition hits. A second, \\"response discrimination\\" component has also been found in most studies. It accounts for about 8-10% of the variance with loadings from free and cued recall intrusions and recognition false positives. The remaining components, learning strategy (semantic and serial clustering), serial position (primacy and recency) and proactive effect (List B recall) are inconsistent and account for little additional variance.  Applications  The results can give the experimenter considerable information about personalities, different conditions and learning difficulties. For example, an anxious participant may perform poorly on the first trial but improve as the task is repeated. Adults with limited learning capacity may perform well on early trials but reach a plateau where repeated trials do not reflect improved performance, or have inconsistent recall across trials. This can happen if they try and fail with different strategies of learning. Studies have demonstrated that inconsistent recall across trials characterises patients with amnesia caused by frontal lobe pathology. * Sex: Men show consistently worse recall than women. This is consistent with the hypotheses linking oestrogen and verbal memory performance, and that hippocampal atrophy is found in younger men but not younger women.Kramer, J.

P., Stuss, D. T., & Fansabedian, N. (2003). California Verbal Learning Test: performance by patients with focal frontal and non‚Äêfrontal lesions. Brain, 126(6), 1493‚Äì1503. Patients with frontal injuries learned fewer words, made more intrusion errors and had impaired recognition performance. The test has shown differentiations within the frontal region. Frontal lobe lesions do not cause classic amnesia, but they can disrupt learning and memory. Alexander et al. (2003) compared 33 patients with focal frontal injury, patients with non-frontal injury and normal controls on the CVLT. Patients with frontopolar lesions performed normally, but subgroups with left posterior dorsolateral frontal lesions or posterior medial frontal region had impaired learning and recall. The former group's impairment is secondary to a mild lexical-semantic deficit. ** Alzheimer's disease: Patients with Alzheimer's disease are often administered the CVLT in the early stages of the disease, as it is quite a demanding task. In more advanced patients, it has been considered more desirable to use the CERAD-NAB List task.Simon, E., Leach, L., Winocur, G., & Moscovitch, M. (1994).

The test is used clinically to examine patients with different neuropsychological impairments, but has also helped to understand the properties of the test. For example, immediate recall and long-delayed recall were highly correlated (above r=0.80) for normal patients and those with Huntington's disease, but the variables were only correlated at 0.36 for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The finding suggests that the nature of the association between variables is different for different patient populations and thus the validity is different for different patient groupsMassman, P.

It also provides information for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. It also assessed recall and recognition. The child will receive a list of 15 words on a day (A) and an inference list on the following day (B). The child is tested on A immediately after list B. After a 20-minute delay, a non-verbal test is administered, followed by tests of long-delay free recall and long-delay cued recall. Afterwards a test is administered to assess the recognition of words that were administered the day before. The results produce several different scores including total recall, learning strategy, serial position effect, learning rate, consistency of item recall, proactive and retroactive interference, and retention over long and short delays. Internal consistency and alpha reliabilities for the test are high (usually >0.80).Mottram, L., & Donders, J. (2005).

San Antonio, TX: The Psychological Corporation. is an updated version of the original California Verbal learning Test. The original CVLT was normed on a 'reference sample' of 273 nonclinical subjects. The original test had often been criticised as being biased towards individuals of higher education and functioning, as well as reflecting a narrow range of memory performance. The conclusion that was reached was that it provided valuable qualitative information, but it failed to provide normative dataWoods, S. P., Delis, D. C., Scott, J. C., Kramer, J. H., & Holdnack, J. A. (2006). The California Verbal Learning Test‚Äìsecond edition: test-retest reliability, practice effects, and reliable change indices for the standard and alternate forms. Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 21(5), 413-420. It includes the addition of a forced choice trial to assess level of effort, the inclusion of recall discriminability indices, which takes into account the number of correct words recalled but also take into account words that were not on the original list. The new word list was intended to be easier, with less geographic, cultural and socioeconomic bias. The 'grocery shopping list' has been dropped in favour of an empirically-driven word list composed of words from four unrelated semantic categories. A nine-word short form has also been introduced to improve the utility of the test in assessment of patients with severe cognitive dysfunction. The CVLT-II underwent nationwide standardisation with a final normative reference sample consisting of 1087 individuals in the US. The education level was also included as a stratification variable. Reliability data for the CVLT-II is mostly good, ranging from 0.80-0.96 in a mixed neuro- psychiatric sample. Test-retest reliability was also adequate. Validity data for the CVLT-II builds on the vast existing clinical validity data on the original CVLT. They demonstrate comparable mean scores and standard deviations, and significant correlations between the tests. The great weakness of the CVLT-II is the lack of clinical data for many new indices, particularly the new forced choice discrimination task.

The Danes surrendered her to the Royal Navy in 1807 and she became the 20-gun post ship HMS Little Belt. In a single-ship action in 1811 while the United States of America was at peace with Great Britain, USS President fired on Little Belt, ostensibly believing her to be , which had recently abducted a sailor from USS Spitfire. History is not sure who fired first, both sides claiming the other had fired initially. This action was the eponymous \\"Little Belt affair\\". British captain Arthur Batt Bingham maintained that the Americans fired first and that although his vessel had suffered heavy casualties he had not at any time surrendered. Little Belt was broken up in 1811. Career She was built in 1801 to a design by P.C. Hohlenberg as the 460-ton Danish 22-gun let fregat (light frigate or corvette) Lilleb√¶lt. She was among the vessels that the British seized after the Battle of Copenhagen on 7 September 1807.Paine et al. (1997), p.96. She then sailed in convoy with the to Britain, arriving on 24 October at Woolwich. She was fitted there until 14 May 1809. The Royal Navy commissioned her under the anglicised version of her name and placed under the command of John Crispo. By 1808 she was off the African coast, but later returned to Britain. In May 1809 she recaptured and sent into Portsmouth the Swedish ship Neptunus, which had been taken while sailing from Alicante.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 30 November 2013. Then on 23 June Little Belt sailed for North America. Around this time the Royal Navy rescinded a decision to rename her Espion. On 27 September 1810 had been in pursuit of a French brig when Rhin joined the chase and after two and a half hours captured the quarry off the Lizard. The French vessel was the privateer San Joseph, of Saint Malo, under the command of a Joseph Wittevronghel, a Dane. San Joseph was one year old, about 100 tons burthen (bm), and armed with 14 guns though she was pierced for 16. She had only been out one day when the British captured her and had taken nothing. Little Belt had been in company with Wolverine during the chase. Crispo was promoted to post-captain on 21 October 1810; Bingham succeeded him as commander of the Little Belt in November 1810. Bingham then sailed her to Halifax to operate off the North American coast. By early 1811, Little Belt was in the Caribbean. On 25 March 1811, Little Belt captured the Spanish vessel Empressa. At the time Little Belt was apparently under the command of Thomas Prickett. was either accompanying Little Belt or in sight of the capture and so shared in the prize money. Little Belt sent Empresa, which had been sailing to Africa, into Bermuda, where she arrived about 10 April.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 30 November 2013. Little Belt affair On 19 April Rear-Admiral Herbert Sawyer, based at Bermuda, instructed Bingham to meet Captain Pechell in , who was cruising somewhere along the Atlantic seaboard between Charlestown and New York City. If he was unable to make contact with Pechell, Bingham was to cruise along the coast, protecting British ships and intercepting enemy vessels and eventually return to Halifax. Sawyer warned Bingham to be careful to avoid a clash with the Americans and to stay out of American ports except in the case of dire necessity. In the event, Bingham did not locate Guerriere, and continued to cruise along the coast.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.50-54. On the morning of 10 May, as Little Belt was some 48 miles east of Cape Charles at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, she sighted a strange sail in the distance. Bingham made signal #277, which requested the strange ship, if a British warship, to show her number. The other ship did not reply and Bingham concluded that the mystery ship was a United States Navy frigate. He hoisted his colours and began to round Cape Hatteras. The frigate followed, catching up to Little Belt, and appeared to be trying to maneuver into a position to rake the sloop. Bingham veered three times to foil the American's attempts, while calling for the frigate to identify herself. Each time though the American demanded the same of Bingham. The frigate, actually the 44-gun USS President under Commodore John Rodgers had mistaken Little Belt for another British warship which had recently been observed pressing American sailors. Bingham claimed President then opened fire on Little Belt, although the Americans claimed the same of the British. Regardless, an engagement began, lasting three-quarters of an hour. The British observed that President had a fire onboard as she drew away. President then returned, and asked if Bingham had struck. Bingham replied that he had not, and President again withdrew. Rodgers sent a messenger out to the damaged Little Belt the following morning, lamenting the \\"unfortunate affair\\", and insisting that he would not have fired had Little Belt not fired first. Bingham denied this, and turned down Rodger's offer of putting into an American port for repairs. Little Belt had nine killed outright, and had 23 wounded, including two mortally, who died the day after the battle. She was also badly damaged, with numerous shots between wind and water and with her masts and rigging damaged. Bingham made for Halifax, hampered by a gale on the second day of the voyage which caused leaks. On 23 May met up with Little Belt and the two then proceeded on to Halifax, which they reached on 28 May.James (1837), Vol. 6, pp.7-11. Rodgers claimed that he had mistaken Little Belt for a frigate and was adamant that Bingham had fired first. Bingham maintained that the Americans fired first and that he had not surrendered. The Admiralty expressed their confidence in Bingham; it promoted him to post-captain on 7 February 1812.James (1837), Vol. 6, p.14. The Americans continued to refuse to pay reparations, pointing out that the British had failed to ever make reparations after the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard affair. On 4 August 1811, Little Belt captured the American ship Traveller. Traveller had sailed from Bordeaux with a cargo of brandy, quicksilver, silks, etc. She arrived at Portsmouth on 22 March.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 30 November 2013. Fate Little Belt was paid off later that year. She was sold at Deptford in November. She was broken up at Battersea, London in February 1819.

Overview Dance Master UK was established in the late 1990s by the International Dance Teachers Association, as the male equivalent of their long running competition Miss Dance of Great Britain. Dance Master UK is a theatre dance competition for boys held annually in the UK with a national final held at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool, England. The finals also include the judging of Miss Dance of Great Britain, and the International Ballet Championships. =Qualifying= Entrants who wish to compete in the national finals of Dance Master, must first qualify for the competition by winning a regional heat. Heats are held at dance festivals nationwide throughout the year. The majority of these festivals are independently run and must apply to the IDTA in order to stage a heat of Dance Master. To enter a regional heat, competitors must be aged 16 years or over on the day of the competition and must be amateur dancers or be in full-time training. Professional dancers are not permitted to enter. In the heats, each competitor performs a three-minute solo dance in a modern theatre or cabaret style. This may include jazz, tap, song, dialogue, instrumentation or comedy, with dance as the dominant discipline. Classical Ballet, character dance or national dance styles are not permitted. The IDTA requests that competitors present a solo that has been specially choreographed for the competition. Should a competitor win their regional heat, they must perform the same solo, without changes, at the national final. To qualify for the national finals, a competitor must win their heat with a score of 85 marks or more, and they then represent that festival at the finals. A runner-up place is also awarded and the runner-up may compete at the national finals if they have scored a qualifying mark and only if the heat winner is unable to compete. It is very common for dancers to compete in numerous regional heats throughout the country in order to qualify for the national finals. =The Finals= The national finals of Dance Master are organised by the IDTA and are held annually at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool. During the finals, the competitors compete in a series of dance- offs, judged by a panel of specialist adjudicators. This narrows down the number of competitors to a selection of 7 finalists. The finalists then perform again for the judges in the grand final and the winner of the Dance Master title is awarded. The winner of Dance Master UK receives a trophy and a cash prize, with trophies also being awarded for the runner-up and 3rd places. The winner holds the title for one year, until a new winner is chosen the following year. The title holder may compete to retain the title, but do not automatically qualify for a place at the national finals. Being a prestigious competition, the winner of Dance Master will normally enjoy a number of other benefits including dancing at various IDTA seminars and events, and being invited to perform at the IDTA's annual showcase gala at a major UK theatre.

It is considered an important document, which identified the Catholic Church with the Body of Christ. A later Council document Lumen gentium stated that the Church subsists in the Body of Christ, raising questions as to the difference between is and subsists in. Pope Paul called the Church founded by Jesus Christ as a loving mother of all men.Ecclesiam suam, 1 In light of the ongoing Vatican Council he did not want to offer new insights or doctrinal definitions. He asked for a deeper self- knowledge, renewal and dialogue.Ecclesiam suam, 6-12 He also realized that the Church itself was engulfed and shaken by a tidal wave of change, and was deeply affected by the climate of the world.Ecclesiam suam, 26. He quotes the encyclical Mystici corporis of Pope Pius XII, as a key document: Consider, then, this splendid utterance of Our predecessor: * \\"The doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ, which is the Church, a doctrine revealed originally from the lips of the Redeemer Himself, and making manifest the inestimable boon of our most intimate union with so august a Head, has a surpassing splendor which commends it to the meditation of all who are moved by the divine Spirit, and with the light which it sheds on their minds, is a powerful stimulus to the salutary conduct which it enjoins.\\" Ecclesiam suam, 30 Paul VI considers Mystici Corporis, the doctrine of the Church as Mystical Body of Christ, timely and urgent and relevant to the needs of the Church in his day. A richer understanding of the Mystical Body, will result in a better view of its theological and spiritual significance. This statement was important, when the Council defined the Church to subsist in the Body of Christ, rather than to be the Body of Christ, as Pius XII and all Popes before him had taught. A potential reversal of a vital teaching of the reigning Pope Paul VI, would have surely been noted inside and outside the Church at the time. Therefore, the phrase \\"subsists in\\" of Vatican II, is interpreted as not to undermine the identity of the \\"Church of Christ\\" and the \\"Catholic Church\\". John XXIII argued this point, when he opened Vatican II, \\"The Council ‚Ä¶ wishes to transmit Catholic doctrine, whole and entire, without alteration or deviation.\\" Pope Paul VI, who in Ecclesiam suam had supported the interpretation of Pius XII, claimed also total identity of the old with the new: \\"There is no better comment to make than to say that this promulgation really changes nothing of the traditional doctrine. ::What Christ willed, we also will. ::What was, still is. ::What the Church has taught down through the centuries, we also teach.\\" (Speech at the promulgation of the Constitution on the Church and the Decrees on the Eastern Churches and Ecumenism) In Ecclesiam suam, Paul VI invited separated Churches to unity, stating that the continued papacy is essential for any unity, because without it, in the words of Jerome: \\"There would be as many schisms in the Church as there are priests.\\" Ecclesiam suam, 114 In this encyclical, Paul VI attempted to present the Marian teachings of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation. Ecclesiam suam called the Virgin Mary the ideal of Christian perfection. Pope Paul VI regarded ‚Äúdevotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel.‚Äù Ecclesiam suam, 58  Notes  Category:Papal encyclicals Category:Catholic ecclesiology Category:Documents of Pope Paul VI Category:1964 in Christianity Category:1964 documents Category:August 1964 events ","title":"Ecclesiam suam"},{"id":"18177589","title":"Mark Mu√±oz"},{"id":"18177626","text":"Kyoritsu Kodo at Kyoritsu Women's University. is a private women's college in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan, established in 1949.

The Tsang (17th century) and Dalai Lama (Ganden Podrang) law codes distinguished three social divisions: high, medium and low, each in turn was divided into three classes, to give nine classes in all. Social status was a formal classification, mostly hereditary and had legal consequences: for example the compensation to be paid for the killing of a member of these classes varied from 5 (for the lowest) to 200 'sung' for the second highest, the members of the noble families. Nobles, government officials and monks of pure conduct were in the high division, only ‚Äì probably ‚Äì the Dalai Lama was in the very highest class. The middle division contained a large portion of the population and ranged from minor government officials, to taxpayer and landholding peasants, to landless peasants. Movement between classes was possible in the middle division.Goldstein 1986 The lower division contained ragyabpa ('untouchables') of different types: e.g. blacksmiths and butchers. The very lowest class contained executioners, and (in the Tsang code) bachelors and hermaphrodites.French p. 114 Anthropologists have presented different taxonomies for the middle social division, in part because they studied specific regions of Tibet and the terms were not universal.Goldstein (May 1971) p.524Samuel, Geoffrey (Feb., 1982) Tibet as a Stateless Society and Some Islamic Parallels The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 41, No. 2, pp. 215‚Äì229Goldstein (1971) pp.64‚Äì65Childs (2003) pp.441‚Äì442 Both Melvyn Goldstein and Geoff Childs however classified the population into three main types:Goldstein (1971) pp.65‚Äì66Childs (2003) pp.427‚Äì428 * taxpayer families (tre-ba or khral-pa) * householders (du-jong or dud-chung-ba) * landless peasants (mi-bo) In the middle group, the taxpaying families could be quite wealthy.Goldstein (1971) p.67 Depending upon the district, each category had different responsibilities in terms of tax and labor.Laird (2006) p. 319 Membership to each of these classes was primarily hereditary; the linkage between subjects and their estate and overlord was similarly transmitted through parallel descent. The taxpayer class, although numerically smallest among the three subclasses, occupied a superior position in terms of political and economic status. The question of whether serfdom prevailed in traditional Tibetan society is controversial; argues for a moderate position, recognizing that serfdom existed but was not universal in U-Tsang; a better description of the traditional Tibetan social class system, at least in Central Tibet, would be a caste system, rather than a comparison to European feudalism. The Higher Division The highest of the high class was empty, or only contained possibly the Dalai Lama =The Nobility= The middle class of the high division ‚Äì the highest attainable in practice ‚Äì was headed by the hereditary nobility. Yabshi were thought to be descendants of the Dalai Lamas, depon were descendants of the ancient royal families, midak were on a slightly lower level.French p. 113 There were \\"a small group of about 30 higher status families\\" and \\"120 to 170 lower or 'common' aristocratic families\\".Goldstein 1989, p. 6 =High Government and Monk Officials= High government officials were appointed from the aristocracy. Monk officials were usually drawn from Lhasa middle classes, the families of existing monk officials, or were the second sons of the aristocracy. They were usually monks in name only, one night spent in a monastery being sufficient to qualify as a monk for this purpose.Goldstein 1989, p. 6-9 The Middle Division =Taxpayer families= The treba (also tralpa or khral-pa) taxpayers lived in \\"corporate family units\\" that hereditarily owned estates leased from their district authority, complete with land titles. In Goldstein's review of the Gyantse district he found that a taxpayer family typically owned from to of land each. Their primary civil responsibility was to pay taxes (tre-ba and khral-pa means \\"taxpayer\\"), and to supply corv√©e services that included both human and animal labor to their district authority. They had a comfortable standard of living. They also frequently practiced polyandry in marriage and other practices to maintain a single marriage per generation and avoid parceling land holdings. =Human lease peasants= Human lease peasants (mi-bo) did not have heritable rights to land. They were still obligated to their 'owning' estate under their status as mi-ser. In contrast with the taxpayer families and householders, they had the freedom to go wherever they wanted and could engage in trade or crafts.Goldstein 1987 When farming, they might lease land from taxpayer families and as payment take on work for those families. Like the householders the landless peasants also used resources in their own individual capacity which were non-heritable. The relative freedom of the mi-bo status was usually purchased by an annual fee to the estate to which the mi-bo belonged. The fee could be raised if the mi-bo prospered, and the lord could still exact special corv√©e labor, e.g. for a special event. The status could be revoked at the will of the estate owner. The offspring of the mi-bo did not automatically inherit the status of 'mi-bo', they did inherit the status of 'mi-ser', and could be indentured to service in their earlier teens, or would have to pay their own mi-bo fee. =Householders= The householder class (du-jung, dud- chung-ba duiqoin, duiqion, d√ºchung, dudchhung, duigoin or dujung) comprised peasants who held only small plots of land that were legally and literally \\"individual\\" possessions. This was different from the taxpayer families who owned land as a familial corporation. Land inheritance rules for the householders were quite different from taxpayer family rules, in that there was no certainty as to whether a plot of land would be inherited by his son. The district authority ‚Äî either governmental, monastic, or aristocratic ‚Äî was the ultimate landowner and decided inheritance. Compared to the taxpayer families the householders, however, had lighter tax obligations and only human labor corv√©e obligations to their district authorities. These obligations, unlike the taxpayer family obligations, fell only on the individual and not on his family. The Lower Division =Ragyabpa ‚Äì Untouchables= The ragyabpa or untouchable caste were the lowest level, and they performed the 'unclean' work. This included fishermen, butchers, executioners, corpse disposers, blacksmiths, goldsmiths and prostitutes. Ragyabpa were also divided into three divisions: for instance a goldsmith was in the highest untouchable class, and was not regarded as being as defiled as an executioner, who was in the lowest. They were regarded as both polluted and polluting, membership of the caste was hereditary, and escape from the untouchable status was not possible.French ps. 111‚Äì112 =Nangzan ‚Äì Household servants= According to Chinese government sources, Nangzan (also nangzen, nangzan, nangsen) were hereditary household servants comprising 5% of the population.Learn ChineseTibet's Material Wealth =Slavery= According to American sinologist A. Tom Grunfeld there were a few slaves in Tibet. Grunfeld quotes Sir Charles Bell, a British colonial official in the Chumbi Valley in the early 19th century and a Tibet scholar who wrote of slaves in the form of small children being stolen or bought from their parents, too poor to support them, to be brought up and kept or sold as slaves.Grunfeld, The Making of Modern Tibet (1996) pg. 15. These children came mostly from south-eastern Tibet and the territories of the tribes that dwelt between Tibet and Assam.Charles Bell, Tibet Past and Present, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1992, 376 pages, pp. xviii and 78‚Äì79: \\"Slavery was not unknown in the Chumbi Valley during our occupation, but proximity to British India had greatly lessened the numbers of the slaves, so that only a dozen or two remained. Across the frontier in Bhutan there were a great many. / Slaves were sometimes stolen, when small children, from their parents. Or the father and mother being too poor to support their child, would sell it to a man, who paid them sho-ring, 'price of mother's milk', brought up the child and kept it, or sold it, as a slave. These children come mostly from south-eastern Tibet and the territories of the wild tribes who dwell between Tibet and Assam. / Two slaves whom I saw both appeared to have come from this tribal territory. They had been stolen from their parents when five years old, and sold in Lhasa for about seven pounds each. [...] / Slaves received food and clothing from their masters on the same scale as servants, but no pay. [...] / The slavery in the Chumpi valley was of a very mild type. If a slave was not well treated, it was easy for him to escape into Sikkim and British India.\\" Grunfeld omits Bell's elaboration that in 1905, there were \\"a dozen or two\\" of these, and that it was \\"a very mild form of slavery\\". According to exile Tibetan writer Jamyang Norbu, later accounts from Westerners who visited Tibet and even long-term foreign residents such as Heinrich Harrer, Peter Aufschnaiter, Hugh Richardson and David Macdonald make no mention of any such practice, which suggests that the 13th Dalai Lama must have eliminated this practice altogether in his reforms.

It originated in the 18th century with the work of Jean Astruc, who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of classical antiquity (in particular, Homer's Iliad) to his own investigation into the sources of the Book of Genesis. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as \\"the higher criticism\\", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text and also the religious history of ancient Israel.  Principles  In general, the closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened. In the Bible where a variety of earlier sources have been quoted, the historian seeks to identify and date those sources used by biblical writers as the first step in evaluating their historical reliability. In other cases, Bible scholars use the way a text is written (changes in style, vocabulary, repetitions, and the like) to determine what sources may have been used by a biblical author. With some reasonable guesswork it is possible to deduce sources not identified as such (e.g., genealogies). Some inter-biblical sources can be determined by virtue of the fact that the source is still extant, for example, where the Books of Chronicles quotes or retells the accounts of the books of Samuel and Kings.  Tanakh  Source criticism has been applied to several parts of the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament). = Documentary hypothesis = The documentary hypothesis considers the sources for the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible), claiming that it derives from four separate sources: the Yahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, and Priestly: * The Jahwist (J) source is characterized by the use of the name YHWH, has a human-like God, and is especially concerned with the kingdom of Judah. It is thought to have been written c. 950 BCE. * The Elohist (E) source is characterized with God being called Elohim, and deals more with the kingdom of Israel. It is thought to have been written c. 850 BCE. * The Deuteronomic (D) source is characterized by a sermon like style mostly concerned with law. It is thought to have been written c. 721‚Äì621 BCE. * The Priestly (P) is characterized by a formal style that is mostly concerned with priestly matters. It is thought to have been written c. 550 BCE. For example, of the two creation stories at the start of Genesis, the first is ascribed to P, while the second (the creation of Adam and Eve in chapter 2) is ascribed to J. While the documentary hypothesis has widespread support among biblical scholars, other hypotheses such as the \\"fragmentary\\" and \\"supplementary\\" have also been proposed. = Other cases = The writers of the Tanakh sometimes mention sources they use. These include Acts of Solomon (1 Kings 11:41), Chronicles of the Kings of Judah (1 Kings 14:29 and in a number of other places), Chronicles of the Kings of Israel (1 Kings 14:19 and in a number of other places), the Book of Jashar (Josh 10:12‚Äì14, 2 Sam 1:18‚Äì27, and possibly to be restored via textual criticism to 1 Kings 8:12), and Book of the Wars of the Lord (Num 21:14). A more complicated and speculative form of source criticism results from critical evaluation of style, vocabulary, reduplication, and discrepancies. An example of this kind of source criticism is found in the book of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah (typically treated by biblical scholars as one book) where scholars identify four types of source material: letters to and from Persian officials, lists of things, the Ezra memoir (where Ezra speaks in first person), and the Nehemiah memoir (where Nehemiah speaks in first person). It is thus deduced that the writer of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah had access to these four kinds of source material in putting together his book. Source criticism also leads many scholars towards redaction of the book of Isaiah from original multiple authorship. New Testament Source criticism is the search for the original sources which lie behind a given biblical text. It can be traced back to the 17th-century French priest Richard Simon, and its most influential product is Julius Wellhausen's Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels (1878), whose \\"insight and clarity of expression have left their mark indelibly on modern biblical studies\\".Antony F. Campbell, SJ, \\"Preparatory Issues in Approaching Biblical Texts,\\" in The Hebrew Bible in Modern Study, p.6. Campbell renames source criticism as \\"origin criticism\\". An example of source criticism is the study of the Synoptic problem. Critics noticed that the three Synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke, were very similar, indeed, at times identical. The dominant theory to account for the duplication is called the two-source hypothesis. This suggests that Mark was the first gospel to be written, and that it was probably based on a combination of early oral and written material. Matthew and Luke were written at a later time, and relied primarily on two different sources: Mark and a written collection of Jesus's sayings, which has been given the name Q by scholars. This latter document has now been lost, but at least some of its material can be deduced indirectly, namely through the material that is common in Matthew and Luke but absent in Mark. In addition to Mark and Q, the writers of Matthew and Luke made some use of additional sources, which would account for the material that is unique to each of them. There is general consensus among New Testament scholars that the Mark used a variety of sources, most of them written, and that the authors of Matthew and Luke were dependent on some version of Mark plus a lost collection of \\"sayings\\" called the Q Document. There is less of a consensus that the writers of the Gospel of John may have used a hypothetical Signs Gospel.

He is also a recipient of the prestigious Ivor Novello award for songwriting. Hawes is known for his work with the Spice Girls, Five, Hear'Say, Sugababes, Mutya Buena, Monrose, Aaron Carter, No Angels, Cinema Bizarre, Aggro Santos, Jimmy Blue and Stefanie Heinzmann. Hawes is currently CEO / partner of Zebra1. Early life Hawes was born in Windlesham, Surrey in 1965. Brought up on a heavy dose of The Beatles and The Four Tops supplied by his mother, Hawes soon became switched on to pop music. Learning guitar at the age of 13 Hawes combined his already noticed talent for poetry with his newfound musicality and started writing songs. Career =Songwriting and production= From the mid-1980s and through to the mid-1990s, Hawes toured extensively in bands and had a single release on MCA records with alternative rock band Fra. The single failed to surface but the writing talents of Hawes came to the attention of Chris Herbert and Bob Herbert, father and son management team Safe Management who invited him to write for their artists. Safe had been responsible for the development of Bros and went on to put together The Spice Girls for whom Hawes penned three songs including \\"Sugar and Spice\\" the song which inspired Hawes to suggest the name \\"The Spice Girls\\". His involvement on the project led Hawes into a publishing deal with BMG and a period of writing which included the song \\"Satisfied\\" which featured on the 3.5 million selling debut album of boyband Five. The song also appeared on the US single release of \\"Slam Dunk Da Funk\\" which was a top ten billboard hit. Hawes's association with Safe Management led to an introduction to and subsequently long term writing and production partnership with Pete Kirtley. Together they formed Jiant in 1999 and quickly made their mark with a release on Aaron Carters 3 million selling album Aaron's Party. This was followed by two songs being recorded by Boyzone star Stephen Gately. In 2001 Hawes and Kirtley penned a song which was in the final for \\"A Song for Europe\\" and resulted in the signing of artist Anniq to Telstar Records. Telstar went bust before the release of \\"Skin Deep\\" but the song went on to be featured in a worldwide ad campaign for Lacoste. 2001 also saw the release of the Hawes/Kirtley/Clarkson written \\"Pure and Simple\\" by Popstars winners Hear'Say which Jiant produced for Polydor. The song found its place in the Guinness Book of Records that year as the fastest selling debut single of all time. It went on to sell 1.3 million copies and Hawes and his co writers each received an Ivor Novello for their work. Jiant scored a second number one with Hear'Say's \\"Show me the way\\", a co production with Stargate. A third number one came with No Angel (It's All in Your Mind) released by German garland No Angels. Hawes went on to work with Mis-Teeq, S Club 7 and Gareth Gates as well as having notable releases with the Sugababes and Mutya Buena. In 2006 Hawes scored a fourth number one with \\"Shame\\" released by German band Monrose and went on to write and produce songs for their album Temptation and subsequent albums Strictly Physical and Ladylike. The Jiant partnership of Hawes and Kirtley ended in 2007 and Hawes went on to form Zebra1 with songwriter and producer Obi Mhondera. The Zebra1 partnership saw Hawes writing and producing for Joana Zimmer, most notably the Hawes/Bachman written song \\"What is the Good in Goodbye\\". Further releases with Cinema Bizarre, Monrose, Jimmy Blue, Tata Young, Stefanie Heinzmann and Aggro Santos cemented the Hawes/Mhondera writing and production partnership which continues to present. =Publishing company= In 2011, Zebra1 set up a music publishing company in partnership with Bucks Music. The company Zebra1/Bucks Music Publishing have since signed writer/producer Willie Weeks, writer Harry Brooks and The White Collar Criminals, a prolific South African based team responsible for the music for many major films and TV adverts. Zebra1 currently develop many new writers, producers and artists as well as continuing to write and produce songs for many major artists.

He has produced over 150 records worldwide with sales exceeding 12 million, including seven number-one hit singles worldwide, tracks on seven number-one albums, eight UK top-ten hits and thirty-five top-forty hits in Europe. He has written and/or produced for artists such as the Sugababes, Hear'Say, Armin Van Buuren, Ti√´sto, Kim Wilde, Mutya Buena, Boyzone, Newton Faulkner, Alexander O'Neal, Peter Andre, Lee Ryan, Heather Small and Ray Lewis of The Drifters. His production collaborations include Ryan Tedder, Guy Chambers and Stargate. Early life and career Peter Edward Kirtley was born in Cuckfield, Sussex, England, but moved to Surrey at a young age. The younger of two children, his father, Al Kirtley, was a semi-professional musician who had at one time been a member of Zoot Money's Big Roll Band and later of Trendsetters Limited, and under contract to Parlophone Records. At the age of 11 he joined a band with Matt Goss, Luke Goss and Craig Logan who later formed the British band Bros. Kirtley was a keen amateur actor while at school, but at the age of 16 chose music as a career and became a professional drummer. For four years he was a member of The Blue, a band managed by Bob Herbert and his son Chris, the original managers of the Spice Girls. The Blue's only single, \\"Don't Leave Me Standing in the Pouring Rain\\", was released in 1992, but failed to enter the chart. Songwriting and record production Although Kirtley had written songs from an early age his successful writing and production career effectively began with music for television commercials, including commissions by Saatchi and Saatchi. These were followed by tracks on a number of international albums, including the 1998 album, \\"Privacy\\", by Ophelie Winter. In 1999 he teamed up with Tim Hawes to form the writing and production team Jiant and, in the following year, they secured a track on Aaron Carter's three million selling double multi-platinum album Aaron's Party (Come Get It), two tracks on Boyzone member Stephen Gately's solo project, and a track on the as well as song placements with acts in Japan, France, Denmark and South Africa. In early 2001 Jiant reached the final of A Song for Europe, but this was almost immediately overshadowed by the release of \\"Pure and Simple\\", co- written with Alison Clarkson and recorded by Hear'Say, the winners of the ITV talent show, Popstars. \\"Pure and Simple\\" was at the time the fastest selling debut single of all time in the UK,Guinness World Records British Hit Singles 15th Edition selling just under 550,000 copies in the first week. In total more than 1.2 million copies were sold, and it was one of the few singles to achieve double platinum status in that decade. In 2002, Kirtley and his co- writers received an Ivor Novello Award for the best selling UK single of 2001. On 7 May 2012, BBC Radio 1 featured the official top 150 biggest selling singles of the 21st century and placed \\"Pure and Simple\\" at number 17. Kirtley continued to enjoy chart success, achieving his second number one single in the UK with the Jiant/Stargate co-production of Hear'Say's, \\"The Way to Your Love\\". His third number one single was \\"No Angel (It's All in Your Mind)\\", recorded by the German band No Angels. Kirtley's fourth number one, \\"Shame\\", the debut single of Monrose, became the fastest-selling German CD single of 2006, and the biggest-downloaded song since the introduction of the legal digital download charts in Germany in 2004. Subsequent success included songs on Sugababes number one album Taller in More Ways, Mutya Buena's debut solo album Real Girl, which reached the UK top ten chart, America's Got Talent winner Bianca Ryan's self-titled debut album, plus the Armin van Buuren single \\"This World is Watching Me\\". For a number of years Kirtley worked closely with the German TV series of Popstars and produced more than 50 records for the winning acts from the show, including 35 tracks with girlband Monrose and other Popstars winners such as Queensberry, Room 2012 and Some & Any. Kirtley also worked with the German acts Linda Teodosiu, Zascha Moktan and Joana Zimmer. In 2005 Kirtley established Stunt with Molly Smitten-Downes, Simon Wills and Dave Valler and was associated with the project until 2010. In 2010, Kirtley joined with BMG UK, a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, to form TaPe Music Publishing. Kim Wilde's album, Come Out and Play, also featured Kirtley's work and reached the top 10 in Germany. In 2012, one of Kirtley's songs was featured on Koda Kumi's tenth studio album, Japonesque (\\"No Man's Land\\"), which reached number one in Japan. In 2018 Kirtley's production of a solo version by Stephen Gately of Dream, was included by Boyzone in their album Thank You & Goodnight with Gately's vocals being incorporated in the album version. In 2011,Kirtley joined with Craig Logan, former manager of Pink and ex-Managing Director of the RCA Label Group to work on his first TV format. They entered into a commercial agreement with FremantleMedia in July 2012. Kirtley was the producer of \\"The School that Rocks\\", a documentary broadcast on BBC Three television in March 2014. Kirtley is a member of the Executive Committee of the charity Rugby for Heroes, and co-wrote and produced \\"With Pride\\", their official anthem for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

It was the ninth fort on Hadrian's Wall, between Vercovicium (Housesteads) to the east and Magnis (Carvoran) to the west. Its purpose was to guard the Caw Gap, where the Haltwhistle Burn crosses the Wall. The B6318 Military Road passes about half a mile to the south of the fort. Description It is believed that the fort was completed in the year 128 AD. Unlike other wall forts that project beyond the Wall, all of Aesica is south of the Wall. The Wall at this point is narrow gauge, but stands next to foundations that were prepared for the broad wall. There was speculation as to why the foundations for the broad wall had not been used to support the wall at this point. In 1939 it was found that Milecastle 43 had already been built in preparation for the broad wall, and it is thought that it was the presence of this milecastle that prevented the north wall of the fort being built on the original foundations. It appears that the milecastle was demolished once the fort had been completed. The east gate and east wall cannot now be traced. The fort was an oblong, measuring north to south by east to west, occupying a comparatively small area of . The north-east corner of the fort is now occupied by farm buildings, built over the route of the Wall. The fort had only three main gates; south, east and west, with double portals with towers. At some time the west gate was completely blocked up. There were towers at each corner of the fort. The Military Way entered by the east gate and left by the west gate. A branch road from the Stanegate entered by the south gate. The Vallum passed some short distance south of the fort, and was crossed by a road leading from the south gate to the Stanegate. A vicus lay to the south and east of the fort, and several tombstones have been found there. The fort was supplied by water from an aqueduct, which wound six miles (10 km) from the head of the Haltwhistle Burn, north of the Wall. Garrison South Gate of Aesica, with a Roman altar at centre behind the path The 2nd-century garrison was the Sixth Cohort of Nervians, followed by the Sixth Cohort of Raetians. The 3rd-century garrison was the Second Cohort of Asturians with a detachment of Raeti Gaeseti. Excavations Excavations were carried out in 1894, during which the ramparts were cleared. The west tower of the south gate was found to contain a hoard of jewellery, which included an enamelled brooch shaped as a hare, a gilded bronze brooch described as a masterpiece of Celtic art, a silver collar with a pendant, a gold ring and a bronze ring with a Gnostic gem. During this excavation the headquarters building (principia) was partially uncovered, together with its vaulted underground strong room. A barrack block was also found to the south-west of the principia. In 1897 a bathhouse was discovered, to the south, east of the branch road to the Stanegate. It includes a dressing room, latrine, cold room with cold bath, dry-heat room, warm steamy room and hot steamy room. References * J.

Nicknamed \\"Asian Rocket\\", he won the scoring title with 31 goals in the 2005-2006 regular season for Asia League Ice Hockey. Song was the first Korean player to do so. Song spent his entire professional career in Asia League Ice Hockey. Song was originally drafted by 'Dong-Won Dreams' (the club operation folded in 1998 from IMF Asia crises) 1st overall. He won the Rookie of the year trophy, Best6, 10-10 club. After the Dong-Won Dreams closed their operation, he signed with Anyang Halla in 2003, where he played 3 seasons from 2003 to 2006 before taking a leave of absence from hockey to serve his 2-year mandatory service in the South Korean military. Song returned to hockey in 2008 to play for Anyang Halla for another 3 seasons. Song played a lone season for the Japanese team Nikko Icebucks in 2011-12 before playing his final 4 seasons for Japanese team High1 from 2012 through 2016.

His judgement of the place was that it was a \\"terrible spot\\". However, undaunted, Captain David Brodie spent ¬£8 to cut the famous 330 steps. His confidence was rewarded in 1814 with the harbour supporting 14 herring boats. Whaligoe steps The cliffs and harbour at Whaligoe. Descending the Whaligoe Steps. The Whaligoe Steps is a man-made stairway of 365 steps that descend to what was a naturally formed harbour between two sea cliffs - once a landing place for fishing boats. The steps are located just south of the town of Wick in Caithness on Scotland's most northeasterly coast. They date originally from the mid-18th century and were once used by fisherwomen to haul up the creels of herring landed at the harbour beneath. Crews of women, some in their early seventies, would gut the fish -- Herring, cod, Haddock, or Ling -- and would carry them up the steps in baskets to be taken on foot to be sold in Wick, some 7 to 8 miles away. Barrels made in the cooperage at the top of the cliffs were taken down for salted herring to be stored in then taken away by schooner. Although a popular attraction today, 'Whaligoe Steps' is notoriously difficult to find as the steps are not signposted on the main road. Sea birds such as oystercatchers and terns nest in the cliffsides and circle on the wind down to the water. A sea cave provides another opportunity for exploration. The steps were repaired early in the 19th century and again very recently. The late Etta Juhle cleared about 30 tons of rubble by herself in 1975 after a landslip and David Nicolson of Ulbster has worked continuously on the steps with local historian Iain Sutherland and many other volunteers since 1998, repairing the barking kettles, quarrying stone, manually carrying it up or down the cliffs and grass-cutting about every three weeks during the summer season. 'Whaligoe Steps' has won the Shell Best of Britain award twice. In 1808, seven boats worked Whaligoe. By 1826 their number had risen to twenty four, but thereafter declined rapidly.

It is located just east of Wagon Mound, New Mexico, a village named after the butte. The butte is a designated National Historic Landmark, along with Santa Clara Canyon, a site just northwest of the village where travelers on the trail frequently camped and took on water. and Description and history Wagon Mound is a roughly lozenge-shaped mesa with its highest point at about . New Mexico State Road 120 runs eastward from the village of Wagon Mound to the north of the mesa, while New Mexico State Road 271 runs southeastearly from the village to its south and west. The village is located directly west of the mesa, with two small mesas, known as the Pilot Knobs, to its west. Wagon Mound is readily visible from the Rabbit Ears, the major landmark further east on the trail. Wagon Mound was an important landmark on the Cimarron Cutoff branch of the Santa Fe Trail for several reasons. First, it was the last major landmark before reaching Santa Fe, signalling the approaching end of the journey to westbound travelers. Second, the Santa Clara Canyon, located about to the northwest, had a spring that was a reliable source of water in the desert environment. It also served as a cautionary point, because the topography of Santa Clara Canyon made groups camping their vulnerable to attacks by hostile Native Americans, with one notably large attack occurring in 1850. The route was heavily used between about 1822 and the American Civil War. Usage declined with the advent of the railroad (which followed the Santa Fe Trail route in this area) in the 1870s.

It is an autonomous state university in Indonesia. University of Brawijaya is recognized as one of the elite campuses in Indonesia and consistently ranked 5th in national level by official release from Kemenristekdikti along with University of Indonesia (UI), Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), Gadjah Mada University (UGM), and Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). In International level, University of Brawijaya ranked 51st in Asia and 400th Worldwide, thus made University of Brawijaya as one of few Indonesian universities which indexed by QS World University Rankings. University of Brawijaya has 55,469 students, ranging from the vocational program, Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs program, Doctoral degree program, and Medical Specialist program in 18 faculties and 221 departments. University of Brawijaya has four campuses, two of them located in Malang at Veteran and Dieng. Then the rest are in Kediri and Jakarta. The main campus is located in the western part of Malang City with the total area of 60 hectares. It's very strategic location and has great infrastructure. The campus has pleasant climate with many trees and cool air. Overall, Brawijaya possessed 9,813,664 m2 or 981 hectares and its endowment fund reached 5.12 trillion Rupiah (US$). University of Brawijaya considered as the second biggest and wealthiest university in the country, after University of Indonesia (UI). History The name of Brawijaya was granted by the president of the Republic of Indonesia through a wire sent on 11 July 1961. This name is derived from the title of kings of Majapahit, a great kingdom in Indonesia from the twelfth to fifteenth century. The University of Brawijaya transformed into a state university on 5 January 1963, following a presidential decree issued earlier in the same year. This date was later promulgated as University of Brawijaya's anniversary (especially called Dies Natalies among Indonesian academic society members). Before its transformation into a state university in 1967, University of Brawijaya had started its operation in 1957 in Malang, as a branch of the University of Sawerigading Makassar. In those days, this Malang branch had two faculties: Law and Economics. Then, on 1 July 1960, its name was changed to the Municipal University of Malang. Under the new name, two more faculties were established a few months later: Administration Sciences and Agriculture. At the time of its transformation into a state university, University of Brawijaya had five faculties: Law, Economics, State Governance and Trade Management (an extension of the Faculty of Trade Administration now called the Faculty of Administrative Science), Agriculture, and Veterinary and Animal Husbandry. In 1973, the Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Husbandry was then divided into the Faculty of Animal Husbandry and the Faculty of Veterinary, which were under Airlangga University. The Faculty of Engineering was established in 1963 based on a decree form the Ministry of Universities and Education Science in the same year. In 1982, due to a change in University of Brawijaya's organizational structure, the Faculty of Fishery became a separate faculty (since 1977, it had been under the Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Fishery, which was later called the Faculty of Animal Husbandry). Before this date, the Faculty of Fishery had operated since 1963, in Probolinggo, a town about three hours to the northeast from Malang, as a department under University of Brawijaya's Faculty of Veterinary and Agriculture of University of Brawijaya. The Faculty of Medicine has officially been under University of Brawijaya since 1974. Since its establishment, it had been under the Foundation of Higher Education of East Java. The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was inaugurated following a decree from the Ministry of Education and Culture dated October 21, 1993. The University of Brawijaya added one more faculty: the Faculty of Agricultural Technology, which was upgraded from the Department of Agricultural Technology, which had been under the Faculty of Agriculture. The hymn of University of Brawijaya was composed by a student of the Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Husbandry called Yanardhana in 1963, while the Mars of University of Brawijaya was composed by Lilik Sugiarto in 1996. Both songs are still frequently sung.

They are small- to large-sized, deep-bodied fish characterised by a certain gill raker and jaw morphology, often appearing very similar to jacks in the genus Caranx. They inhabit the subtropical and tropical regions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, often occupying coastal areas, including reefs, bays, and estuaries, rarely venturing far offshore. They are all predatory fishes, taking a variety of smaller fishes, crustaceans and cephalopods as prey. The genus was first erected in 1851 by Pieter Bleeker for an unknown taxon and currently contains 20 species. Many make up significant proportions of various fisheries, although a number of ciguatera cases have been attributed to them. Taxonomy The genus Carangoides is one of 31 genera in the jack and horse mackerel family, the Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. A number of recent phylogenetic studies on the family has placed Carangoides in the subfamily Caranginae (or tribe Carangini), being most closely related to the genera Alectis, Atropus, Selene, and Uraspis. Carangoides was created by Pieter Bleeker in 1851 to accommodate a species of carangid fish, although the species he created the genus for is unknown. To rectify this, Caranx praeustus was selected to be the type species of the genus. Carangid classification was initially very difficult, with many genera and species described, many of which were synonymous. Later reviews of the family eventually placed 21 species into Carangoides, leaving a number of genera synonymous with it. Carangoides takes priority over these other genera because its type species, Caranx praeustus, was described by an unknown author before the other species and genera were erected. The species of the genus are often referred to as jacks or trevallies, and sometimes more specifically as 'island jacks'. The name Carangoides is derived from the French carangue, meaning 'fish of the Caribbean'. Species The currently recognized species in this genus are: * Carangoides armatus (R√ºppell, 1830) (longfin trevally) * Carangoides bajad (Forssk√•l, 1775) (orange-spotted trevally) * Carangoides bartholomaei (G. Cuvier, 1833) (yellow jack) * Carangoides chrysophrys (G. Cuvier, 1833) (longnose trevally) * Carangoides ciliarius (R√ºppell, 1830) (likely C. armatus) * Carangoides coeruleopinnatus (R√ºppell, 1830) (coastal trevally) * Carangoides dinema Bleeker, 1851 (shadow trevally) * Carangoides equula (Temminck & Schlegel, 1844) (whitefin trevally) * Carangoides ferdau (Forssk√•l, 1775) (blue trevally) * Carangoides fulvoguttatus (Forssk√•l, 1775) (goldspotted trevally) * Carangoides gymnostethus (G. Cuvier, 1833) (bludger) Blue trevally, C. ferdau * Carangoides hedlandensis (Whitley, 1934) (bumpnose trevally) * Carangoides humerosus (McCulloch, 1915) (duskyshoulder trevally) * Carangoides malabaricus (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) (Malabar trevally) * Carangoides oblongus (G. Cuvier, 1833) (coachwhip trevally) * Carangoides orthogrammus (D. S. Jordan & C. H. Gilbert, 1882) (island trevally) * Carangoides otrynter (D. S. Jordan & C. H.

Bennett ], 1830) (brownback trevally) * Carangoides talamparoides Bleeker, 1852 (imposter trevally) Description In their general morphology, the species of Carangoides are very similar to a number of other carangid genera, especially Caranx. They grow to a range of sizes, most attaining a length less than , but with the largest fish of the genus reaching at least 1 m and over 65 kg in weight. They have a relatively deep, compressed body, with the dorsal profile usually far more convex than the ventral, with a tapering posterior. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of spines, and the second of one or two spines followed by a number of soft rays. The anal fin has detached spines preceding a long soft ray section headed by up to two spines. The caudal fin is large and forked and the pectoral fin is large, usually longer than the head. All species have scutes on the posterior section of their lateral lines. The genus is defined as having gill rakers of normal length and shape, with a total number of gill rakers between 21 and 37 on the first gill arch. Both upper and lower jaws have a band of teeth present and the breast is naked ventrally to completely scaled. The species are often dull in coloration, mostly being silver, getting darker dorsally and lighter ventrally. Often, they have green or blue tinges to their bodies, but fade rapidly after death. A few, such as the orange- spotted trevally, have far more brilliant coloration, incorporating bright orange and yellow spotting. The fins are usually hyaline to grey, and occasionally blue or yellow. Distribution and habitat The Carangoides species are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical oceans of the world, occupying the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. They occur on the coastlines of countries in this range, although are most prolific in the Indo- Pacific region, having high species densities around Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and northern Australia. Most species are coastal in nature, inhabiting continental shelf marine environments including reefs, bays, sandflats, lagoons, and even estuaries. Biology and fisheries An angler's catch of yellow jack, Carangoides bartholomaei The Carangoides species are mostly schooling in nature, becoming more solitary with age. They are all predatory, taking a variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Like all of the Carangidae, they are oviparous, do not guard their eggs, and (if known) display differing reproductive traits and timing between species. All of the species are of minor to significant importance to fisheries, with some also being of interest to recreational fishermen. Like all jacks and trevallies, they can be caught on a variety of baits and lures, and with some members reaching 1 m in length, are considered formidable game fish. They are generally considered to be excellent to fair table fare, although a number of ciguatera poisonings have been linked to the species of this genus. As with all tropical fish, consuming smaller fish carries a lesser risk of being affected by the disease, with larger fish having accumulated more of the toxin.

He was an adherent of the Italian-based art movement known as \\"Purismo\\" and specialized in historical scenes.  Biography  He was born in Madrid. The second son of a minor official, he began his education in a private school operated by the Escolapios. He was orphaned as a teenager and enrolled in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he studied under Federico de Madrazo in 1851.Museo del Prado: Brief biography. Rosales accompanied some friends to Rome in 1857, without a fellowship or other financial support, until he received a special stipend from the government to continue his studies in 1861. He joined a group of Spanish painters who gathered in the Antico Caff√® Greco, which included Jos√© Casado del Alisal, Di√≥scoro Puebla and Mari√† Fortuny. There he began to associate with followers of the Nazarene movement, but soon abandoned his interest in them and produced his first important work \\"Tob√≠as y el angel\\". Do√±a Isabel the Catholic Dictating Her Will (1864) However, he continued to be interested in developing a more realistic style, which was achieved in his best known work \\"Do√±a Isabel la Cat√≥lica dictando su testamento\\". He took it to the International Exposition (1867) in Paris and later returned to Rome, where he sent a telegram to his friends Mart√≠n Rico and Raimundo de Madrazo telling them that the painting had been an outstanding success, taking the First Gold Medal for work by a foreigner. He was also named a Chevalier in the Legion d'Honneur.Colleciones Art√≠sticas: Brief biography. =Final years= He married his cousin Maximina in 1868. They had two children, one of whom, Eloisa, died in infancy and was memorialized in his painting \\"Primeros pasos\\" (First Steps). Rosales was in poor health himself, having had tuberculosis for many years, and made frequent visits to Panticosa in the Pyrenees, where the water was famous for its curative properties.EcuRed: Brief biography. In 1869, he left Rome for good and opened a studio in Madrid. The harsh criticism he received for his work \\"La Muerte de Lucrecia\\" (1871) left him discouraged and he never painted another large-scale canvas. The following year, hoping to find a climate that would more amenable to his health, he moved to Murcia. Upon the declaration of the First Spanish Republic, he was offered positions at the Museo del Prado, which he rejected, and at the new , which he accepted but never filled, due to his worsening condition. He died shortly thereafter, in Madrid. In 1922, Madrid honored him with a memorial statue, sculpted by Mateo Inurria and placed on a street named after him, the Paseo del Pintor Rosales.

It runs between Wah Fu (South) and Central, via Pok Fu Lam Road and Sai Ying Pun. History The route was first started by The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels in the 1920s between Blake Pier in Central and the University of Hong Kong by way of Sai Ying Pun, with no route number. On 11 June 1933 CMB took over the route as part of the Hong Kong Island bus service franchise, and given the number 4. In the next year, the Central terminus was moved to the piers of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry. On 1 April 1935 circular arrangement was implemented, running in anti-clockwise direction, taking Bonham Road and Caine Road for Central bound. On 14 June 1937 service was extended to Queen Mary Hospital, and the circular arrangement was cancelled. No service was provided during Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong. Service was resumed on 16 April 1946 between Central Ferry Piers and Queen Mary Hospital, with initially only two buses running and a frequency of one hour per bus, to be increased gradually. On 3 October 1968 the route was further extended to Wah Fu Estate with the completion of the estate's first phase. Since transportation was inconvenient for the estate, route 4 became the major means of transportation for the residents. As the population of Wah Fu increased, an express service was implemented in 1971, which faced delays caused congestion problems along Des Voeux Road West. On 1 May 1972 the express service was rerouted to serve Caine Road and Bonham Road in Mid-levels to bypass the congestion, seeing full daytime service and becoming a normal route, denoted by red text on yellow background. On 1 January 1975 the express service was renumbered 40. On 11 September 1972 the Central terminus moved to a bus terminus opposite to Hang Seng Bank headquarters, on 5 December 1994 to Harbourview Street, and on 17 March 1995 to the new ferry piers. On 1 September 1998 the route was taken over by New World First Bus as part of the franchise handover. Air-conditioning of the route started on 11 July 1999 and completed in 2000. The route has seen a drop of patronage since the 1990s with Citybus taking over some of the Wah Fu routes and having lower fares than route 4. On 19 December 2004 the route became a circular route, and ceased to serve Hong Kong Station and the ferry piers. Current route Route 4 currently operates via the following locations:-Official route information of route 4 on Citybus/NWFB Website * Wah Fu Estate * Queen Mary Hospital * The University of Hong Kong * MTR HKU Station * Sai Ying Pun * Sheung Wan * Central (Connaught Road Central) Between 07:10 and 20:30 on Sundays and public holidays, journeys operating from Wah Fu (South) will call at additional stops at the Central Ferry Piers and Central (Exchange Square) Bus Terminus. During the morning peak of Mondays to Saturdays, three departures would operate from Tin Wan Estate, resuming the routeing of normal departures at Wah Fu (South) after serving Wah Kwai Estate. = Express service = On Mondays to Saturdays, there is an express service which roughly runs on the same route and labelled with 4X, which skips Sai Ying Pun on its outbound journey, and call at additional stops at the Central Ferry Piers and Central (Exchange Square) Bus Terminus. It also skips Sheung Wan and most of Sai Ying Pun on its return journey in morning peak hours.

Kuch is the Persian (and Gileki) for migration, and Kuch-e EsfahƒÅn means The EsfahƒÅn Migration.

He is generally considered the most outstanding member in the da Camino family. Biography He was born in the family castle in Credazzo (or Padua), the second child of Biaquino II da Camino and India da Camposampiero. When his father died in 1274, he became the sole heir of the family's lands. He had already been member of the City Council of Treviso and, in 1266, had received the seignory of Feltre and Belluno from the local bishop, which Gherardo was to hold until his death. A guelph exponent, in 1278 he signed an alliance with Padua, Cremona, Brescia, Parma, Modena and Ferrara against the Ghibelline Verona. In the 1280s, he decided to try to conquer Treviso, which was then in peace after the decline of the da Romano family. On November 15, after a city fight arranged by Gherardo, the Ghibellines (including the Castelli family) were expelled from Treviso; he was then elected capitano generale, with total power over the city's statutes. Gherardo's first move was to attack the Castelli's castles of Asolo, Cornuda and Monleopardo, and to destroy their city residence by treason. Once in command of Treviso, Gherardo rewarded his supporters, in particular by giving back Camino and Oderzo to his relatives Tolberto III and Biaquino VI da Camino. When the cession was declared illegal by the commune, the latter called in the Republic of Venice by ceasing them Motta di Livenza (1291): this was the first mainland possession of the Serenissima. Gherardo was a tyrannic but efficient administrator in Treviso, and increased its economic importance. He was also a patron of feasts and arts, housing in his courts numerous cultural figures, such as Dante Alighieri and Ferrarino da Ferrara. His rule in Treviso was substantially peaceful, but he had to face an increasing number of plots, the last, in 1305, set up by his son Rizzardo, who had then a total control of Treviso due to Gherardo's declining health. Gherardo da Camino died in 1306 and was buried at Treviso in the Franciscan church of St. Francis, which he had contributed to build.

She researched in haematology and radiation pathology. From 1945 to 1967, she served as Principal of Somerville College, Oxford. Early life Born in Clifton, Bristol, she was the eldest of four children of William Wyamar Vaughan (a maternal first cousin of Virginia Woolf and later headmaster of Rugby) and Margaret \\"Madge\\" Symonds, daughter of John Addington Symonds. At the time of her birth he was an assistant master at Clifton College. She was educated at home, and later at North Foreland Lodge and Somerville College, Oxford, where she studied medicine under Charles Sherrington and J. B. S. Haldane. She did her clinical training at University College Hospital, London, where she worked in London's slums and saw firsthand the effects of poverty on health. Later she received a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation to study at Harvard University. Career As a woman doctor, Vaughan had difficulties gaining access to patients and experimented on pigeons. Woolf described her as 'an attractive woman; competent, disinterested, taking blood tests all day to solve abstract problems'. She suffered from prejudice for her research. As a young pathologist at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital in 1938 she initiated creation of national blood banks in London, setting one up with Federico Duran-Jorda. The modified milk bottle for blood collection and storage was named \\"MRC bottle\\" or \\"Janet Vaughan\\". In 1945 she was sent to Belgium by the Medical Research Council to research starvation, and then into Germany; at war's end she was working in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and significantly improved the strategy to feed people suffering from extreme starvation. Vaughan's research included blood disease, blood transfusion, the treatment of starvation, and the effect of radioactivity on the bone and bone marrow. Her 1934 book, The Anaemias, was one of the first specialised treatments of blood diseases. After the war, she became known for her work on the effects of plutonium. From 1945 until her retirement in 1967, while working as a researcher at the Churchill Hospital, she was Principal of Somerville College. She was Principal while Shirley Catlin (later Shirley Williams, Baroness Williams of Crosby) and Margaret Roberts (who would later become the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) studied there. She also served on the Royal Commission on Equal Pay, as a founder trustee of the Nuffield Foundation, and for one year as chairman of the Oxford Regional Hospital Board. Honours Vaughan was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1957 New Year Honours. Oxford University awarded her an honorary DCL in 1967.

The aircraft featured unusual twin horizontal tail structures supported by three vertical tail surfaces. Construction and finishing methods involved using sheet metal screws which ultimately led to the abandoning of the project. Side view Design and development The original design by Socrates H. Capelis was issued U. S. patent #1,745,600 in 1930. The patent comprised a modified application with a half-span dorsal wing mounted rearward on top of the cabin and two additional engines mounted on the wings. The project was funded by local Greek restaurateurs as a promotional aircraft; it was constructed with help from University of California students.Gunston 1994, p. 70. A less radical design by Dr. John E. Younger featured all-metal construction; the aircraft was built as an all-metal, low-wing, retractable gear, twin engine transport with a triple vertical tail supporting a dual (biplane arrangement) horizontal stabilizer. The wing used a large box-spar construction with corrugated skin panels. The partly retracting landing gear extended automatically when the throttle was closed.Raymond, John and Fred Freeman. \\"The Cape Capelis. XC-12 Safety Airplane.\\" Skyways, October 1995. Following a 1938 incident, the XC-12 was modified at Glendale, California: The forward slanting eight-piece windshield was modified to a four piece that slanted rearward, and the passenger windows were squared off to look more like a Douglas DC-3. Operational history On April 15, 1938, the XC-12 suffered minor damage from a forced landing after running out of fuel while flying over Fresno, California. The main wing spar construction was bolted together, and many of the metal skin panels were attached with P-K sheet metal screws rather than with permanent rivets. These tended to vibrate loose, requiring tightening or replacing every few flights, constituting a safety hazard that would later ground the aircraft. With promotional tours abandoned after the 1938 crash, the aircraft's flying career was over. The aircraft was purchased by RKO in March 1939, after which the studio's insurance company permanently grounded the aircraft. Used as a full-size prop, the transport appeared only in ground roles in RKO's feature films made during World War II; flying sequences used a scale XC-12 shooting miniature. The aircraft became a RKO back lot relic, falling into worse repair during the 1940s until it was completely scrapped some time around 1950. The XC-12 miniature continued to be used in later feature films.Farmer 1984, p. 40. The aircraft was featured as a prop in Five Came Back (1939), The Flying Tigers (1942),Hughes 2012, p. 44. and Immortal Sergeant (1943). In RKO's Dick Tracy's Dilemma (1947) the XC-12 was shown somewhat dismantled, and in Daredevils of the Clouds (1948), after which it was apparently scrapped.Farmer 1984, p. 40.

Early life Gabriel James Rains was born in June 1803 in New Bern, North Carolina, to cabinetmaker Gabriel Manigault Rains and Ester Ambrose. His younger brother, George Washington Rains, was also a brigadier general in the Georgia Militia, and the two were known as \\"the Bomb Brothers\\" for their creation and use of land mines, torpedoes, booby traps, and other explosives. Rains graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1827, 13th in his class. Among his classmates were Leonidas Polk, Napoleon Bonaparte Buford, and Philip St. George Cooke. Military career Early photo in US Army uniform Upon graduation, Rains was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry. Rains served in the Seminole Wars and was promoted to captain on December 25, 1837, and brevetted major on April 28, 1840, for his service against the Seminoles near Fort King, Florida, where he routed a superior force, and was twice severely wounded. One of his wounds was considered mortal, and several obituary notices of him were published, however he survived the wounds. Rains took part in the Mexican War and was engaged in the defense of Fort Brown in May 1846. When General Pedro de Ampudia demanded the surrender of the fort, Rains cast the deciding vote against surrender in a council of officers. Following the Battle of Resaca de la Palma he was ordered to the United States on recruiting duty, and organized a large part of the recruits for General Winfield Scott's campaign. Rains was promoted to major of regulars on March 9, 1851, and from 1853 until the Civil War he served on the Pacific Coast, where he took part in the Indian Wars. In 1855 he was brevetted to brigadier general of Washington Territory volunteers. Rain was the commanding officer of Fort Humboldt from 1856 through 1860. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of regulars on June 5, 1860, but resigned his commission on July 31, 1861, and joined the Confederate States Army, in which he was commissioned a brigadier general and got command of a brigade in the Richmond area. Civil War Rains was wounded during the Battle of Seven Pines, and was singled out by Maj. Gen. Daniel Harvey Hill for a successful flanking maneuver that turned the tide of battle in favor of the Confederates. Rains, who turned 59 a few days after the battle, was one of the oldest officers in the Confederate army, and it was decided to reassign him to a less physically demanding job. After recovering from his wounds, he was then placed in command of the conscription and torpedo bureaus at Richmond. He organized the system of torpedoes and mines that protected the harbors of Charleston, Savannah, Mobile and other port cities, and invented an early land mine that was successfully used in battle. =Land mines= The development of the first modern mechanically fused high explosive anti-personnel land mines was attributed to Rains during the Battle of Yorktown in 1862.The Origins of Military Mines, Major Zach C. Schneck, Engineer Bulletin July 1998Union casualties from a buried mine were from a rebel who had killed and wounded men and horses and a civilian {Battles and Leaders of the Civil War Vol 2. p. 201}; the mortally wounded civilian was D.B. Lathrop of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps; The Zach Telegraph During the Civil War in the United States ..., Volume 1. p. 145 (As a Captain, Rains had earlier employed explosive booby traps during the Seminole Wars in Florida in 1840.HISTORICAL USES OF anti-personnel LANDMINES: IMPACT ON LAND FORCE OPERATIONS , Roger L. Roy and Shaye K. Friesen, Department of National Defense, Canada, October 1999) Both mechanically and electrically fused \\"land torpedoes\\" were employed, although by the end of the war, mechanical fuses had been found to be generally more reliable. Many of these designs were improvised in the field, especially from explosive shells, but by the end of the Civil War, nearly 2,000 standard pattern \\"Rains mines\\" had been deployed. Post-War and death Following the end of the war, Rains worked as a chemist in Augusta, Georgia, but later moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he worked as a civilian clerk in the US Army Quartermaster Department. He died in Aiken, South Carolina, on August 6, 1881, and was buried in St. Thaddeus Cemetery.

Plot Elwin 'Bix' Bixby (James Cagney) is an unemployed Broadway musical director who agrees to stage the annual 100th Night show at West Point . He is offered the job by producer Harry Eberhart (Roland Winters), with whom he has had a rocky relationship over the years. Eberhart has an underhanded goal in mind: He wants to get his talented nephew Tom Fletcher (Gordon MacRae) out of the Corps of Cadets and turn him into a Broadway star. Bix, who is broke or nearly, agrees to arrange this in return for a cut of Fletcher's future earnings. He and his loyal assistant and girlfriend, Eve Dillon (Virginia Mayo), travel to West Point to turn the annual 100th Night Show written by Tom and his friend Hal Courtland (Gene Nelson) from amateur hour into a Broadway-level production. Bix quickly runs afoul of the Military Academy's rules and customs, cold-cocking Bull Gilbert (Alan Hale Jr.), the cadet who is playing the Princess in the show, after Bull mouths off during rehearsal. The Commandant of Cadets wants to throw him off the Academy grounds, but the cadets in the 100th Night Show, led by Tom, persuade the Commandant to extend to Bixby a privilege seldom offered to outsiders: to live as one of them, a temporary plebe in the Corps of Cadets. The Com is dubious; he's seen Bixby's wartime record, an equal amount of appalling breaches of discipline (including selling a B-17 to an Arab sheik, and going AWOL from a rest camp to fight the Germans with the French Resistance) and incredible acts of valor that garnered Bix the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, two Purple Hearts, and the French Medaille Militaire, a medal seldom awarded to foreigners. In pursuit of the goal of getting Tom Fletcher out of the Army, Bix persuades his protege Jan Wilson (Doris Day), a chorus girl he discovered and turned into a movie star, to come to a \\"hop\\" (dance) thrown by the cast of the 100th Night Show as Tom's date. She finds herself very taken with Cadet Fletcher, and takes on the role of the Princess in the show (courtesy of Bix persuading the Commandant to break tradition and allow a woman to play a female role, West Point at the time being an all-male school; he later persuades the Commandant to allow Eve to play in the show as well). The two of them fall in love, but there are the problems of Tom's military obligation and Jan's Hollywood contracts to be resolved. Tom goes off the deep end and submits his resignation from the Military Academy. Bix, Bull Gilbert, and Hal, the lead dancer of the 100th Nigh Show, go AWOL, follow Tom to New York where he has gone to be with Jan, and bring him back to West Point. But before they return to the Academy, Jan says no to Tom's proposal, realizing how important it is to him that he graduate and be commissioned. Tom is devastated. Wise in the ways of military bureaucracy, Bixby succeeds in intercepting and destroying Tom's resignation letter before official notice can be taken of it, but Tom, Bull, and Hal are arrested on their return to the Academy by order of the Commandant and are confined to quarters except when on duty or in class. The show is threatened with cancellation. The cadets in the show and Bix use their influence to arrange a meeting with the French Premier, visiting the United States on a diplomatic mission. Because of a West Point custom that a visiting dignitary can \\"request amnesty,\\" the forgiving of all disciplinary offenses for the Corps of Cadets, he is the one man in the country who can insure that the 100th Night Show goes on. Bixby shows the Premier his Medaille Militaire, and the Premier rearranges his schedule to visit the Military Academy, requesting that the Superintendent grant the cadets amnesty at a military parade in his honor. The Superintendent does so, and the show will go on. Eberhart comes to West Point to see the show, presuming that he will be bringing his nephew home with him to become a Broadway star. Deciding that her love for Tom is more important than her career, Jan comes north in time to take Bull Gilbert's place as the Princess (much to Bull's relief) for the \\"Flirtation Rock\\" number and the two reconcile, with their marriage on graduation implied. Eberhart, the Broadway producer, comes backstage to find out from Bix when he can take Fletcher back to New York to start his career. When Bixby tells him that Tom is going to become a second lieutenant and not an actor, Eberhart swears that he will see to it Bix never works in show business again. With nothing to lose, Bix takes a swing at the producer, who ducks. The punch connects with Hal, knocking him out and injuring his leg so he can't go on. Bix goes on with Eve for the specialty dance number \\"It Could Only Happen In Brooklyn.\\" Before the Finale, Tom calls Bix out onto the stage and informs him that instead of the book and libretto going into the Academy archives never to be seen again, they are being given to him to turn into a Broadway show. The cadet cast, Bix, Eve, Tom, and Jan then do the Finale, a reprise of the major numbers of the show, and the curtain falls.

History ;Mining The building originally included crushers, separators and a network of conveyor belts to process the potash. The building has approximately of interior space on two floors and is said to be one of the largest still existing wood structural spaces in an industrial building on the West Coast. The foundation and interior walls of the first floor were built with reinforced concrete, and the entire upper section is made of wood. Due to advances in methods for separating potash, the plant was used for that purpose for only a short time, and there is some indication that the facility never went into full production. ;Other uses In 1920, the building was offered for sale at $200,000 to become part of a proposed submarine naval base at the Los Angeles Harbor. The building was converted to use as a saw mill and warehouse during the 1920s and 1930s.

Background and early career Vaughan was the second son of the 3rd Viscount Lisburne. He began his military career as an officer in the 9th Marines, being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1746; but he transferred to the 10th Dragoons as a cornet in 1748, being promoted to lieutenant in 1751, captain-lieutenant in 1754 and Major in 1759. In 1760 he became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the 94th Foot, and held the same rank in the 16th Foot from 1762. He served in both Germany and North America during the Seven Years' War, leading a division of grenadiers with great distinction at the capture of Martinique. In 1772 he was promoted to colonel, and from 1775 until his death was Colonel of the 46th Foot. Member of Parliament He entered the British Parliament in 1774 as member for Berwick- upon-Tweed, holding the seat for the remaining twenty years of his life. From 1776 to 1783 he was also a member of the Irish Parliament and represented St Johnstown (County Longford). He was appointed Governor of Fort William in 1779 and then in 1780 Governor of Berwick, also holding this post until his death, although it did not interfere with his active military career. He was a reliable supporter of the government when in the House of Commons, but of course could not attend while he was absent on active service: at the 1780 election the government's election managers considered trying to replace him temporarily as Berwick's MP by someone who would be able to attend and vote, but the borough's patrons would have none of it and he was returned unopposed. American War of Independence Following the outbreak of the American War of Independence Vaughan returned to North America as a Major-General, serving from 1776 until 1779. He led the grenadiers at the Battle of Long Island, and was wounded in the thigh; he commanded a column in the Battle of Short Hills, New Jersey, in July 1777, and he commanded a column during the successful assault on Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery, where his horse was killed under him.

Later in the year he was accused of embezzling the property confiscated at St Eustatius, and was forced to defend himself against Burke's attack in Parliament, stating that he had not profited by a shilling and had always acted in the national interest rather than his own. He was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1782. Later life 1792 he was knighted as a Knight of the Bath (KB). In 1795 he was appointed once more to command in the Leeward Islands, but died later the same year at Martinique.

The two reunite with Sammi Cheng who appeared in Infernal Affairs, and its third instalment. The film was shot under a budget of HK$30 million.bc magazine, hong kong =Development= The original storyline for Lady Cop & Papa Crook centred on two strong male characters. The idea took shape while Alan Mak was talking to police officer-friends and randomly asked whether or not they would be prepared to investigate a kidnapping of a gangster's son. Mak was told of a proper procedure: ‚ÄúIf [one of your family members] is kidnapped, the first thing the police do is to blockade your home. The immediate image I had was a group of gangsters and police officers being trapped in the same place. A lot of interesting things could happen.\\" The idea led to a script, but when the script was finally completed, Mak felt uncomfortable with the concept of another male buddy film. Chong and Mak decided that the film would center on a female police officer, and immediately thought of Sammi Cheng being cast in the lead role. The directors both felt that Cheng was a role model among women. Chong had thought about casting Eason Chan, while attending one of his concerts in 2006.ÈôàÂ•ïËøÖË∞à„ÄäÂ§ßÊêúÊü•„ÄãÔºöËøô‰∏™Â§ß‰Ω¨ÊØîÊàëÈÖ∑(Âõæ)_ÂΩ±Èü≥Â®±‰πê_Êñ∞Êµ™ÁΩë During filming, the two directors taught Chan to use a method of acting similar to that of Tony Leung Chiu-Wai.

Her works are the subject of Jane Gilmore Rushing: A West Texas Writer and Her Work, a book by Lou Halsell Rodenberger, former professor of English at McMurry University in Abilene. Biography Rushing grew up in Pyron, a West Texas farming community now recognizable only by a cemetery and railroad sign. From childhood, she wanted to be a writer. In seven novels published between 1963 and 1984, she built her stories around themes that few West Texas writers had dared to tackle. Most of her work centers on cotton farms and early ranches in a land she calls the ‚Äútoo-late frontier‚Äù. Her plots explore such sensitive topics as an affair between a mulatto girl and a West Texas cowboy and the painful recognition in an early-nineteenth-century community that one of their own is capable of child and wife abuse. Lou Halsell Rodenberger explores Rushing‚Äôs life and discusses in depth her novels and memoir. She finds that although Rushing considered herself a regional writer, her fiction transcends region in illuminating what has motivated and sustained the western frontier‚Äôs settlers and their descendants. In addition to her novels, Rushing co-authored with Kline A. Nall a history of Texas Tech University. Her final book, Starting from Pyron, explores the history and people of the community she grew up in and that inspired her writing. Rushing, who had lived in Lubbock for most of her career, died of cancer in 1997, at the age of seventy-one. She was survived by her husband Jay (since deceased) and her son, James Arthur, Jr., a German Language professor at Rutgers University. Books * Walnut Grove. Doubleday, New York (1964).

He was represented wearing an open princiary crown, and dressed with a mantle (long up to the ankles) with ermine collar. In the right hand the Domnitor had a mace (sometimes a sword), and in the left hand a globus cruciger. The Rulers that followed him, both Wallachians and Moldavians, wore a similar mantle, called in . The Phanariotes wore a mantle called in . The Romanian Rulers from the 19th century reintroduce the mantle as symbol of authority, but unlike the Mircea the Elder's ceremonial dress, these had a long tail. The cyphers used by the Domnitori where formed by their initials. The signs where printed on small seals and on other objects. After 1834, the cyphers appear mostly on the flags (the battle/war flags).Mihail Sturdza had an M, Alexandru Ghica an A, Barbu ≈ûtirbei a B, Alexandru Ioan Cuza an A superimposed iver an I (see the coat of arms proposal from 1863)  Royal crowns   References  Category:Regalia of Romania ","title":"Symbols of Romanian Royalty"},{"id":"18178517","text":"Li Lin or Lin Li may refer to: People surnamed Li *Li Lin (prince) (ÊùéÁíò, died 757), prince of the Tang dynasty *Li Lin (Tang chancellor) (ÊùéÈ∫ü, 694‚Äì759), chancellor of the Tang dynasty *Li Lin (physicist) (ÊùéÊûó; 1923‚Äì2003), Chinese physicist *Li Lin (biochemist) (ÊùéÊûó; born 1961), Chinese biochemist *Lin Li (engineer) (ÊùéÊûó), Chinese-British laser engineer People surnamed Lin *Lin Li (swimmer) (ÊûóËéâ, born 1970), Chinese swimmer *Carrie Lam (actress) or Lin Li (ÊûóËéâ, born 1980), Hong Kong actress *Lin Li (gymnast) (Êûó‰∏Ω, born 1986), Chinese gymnast *Lin Li (volleyball) (ÊûóËéâ, born 1992), Chinese volleyball player See also *Lilin (disambiguation) *Linli (disambiguation) ","title":"Li Lin"},{"id":"18178524","text":"Bruce A.

Devised by Royal Navy Captain Edward Terrell, the bomb was fitted with solid-fuel rockets to accelerate its descent, giving it an impact speed of ‚Äî substantially beyond the free-fall impact velocity of the 5 tonne Tallboy \\"earthquake\\" bomb for comparable purposes. The Disney could penetrate of solid concrete before detonating. The name is attributed to a propaganda film, Victory Through Air Power, produced by the Walt Disney Studios, that provided the inspiration for the design. The Disney bomb saw limited use by the United States Army Air Forces in Europe from February to April 1945. Although technically successful, it initially was insufficiently accurate for attacking bunker targets. It was deployed late in the war and had little effect on the Allied bombing campaign against Germany. Background During the Second World War, Barnes Wallis developed two large \\"earthquake\\" bombs for the Royal Air Force: the five-tonne Tallboy and the ten-tonne Grand Slam, for use against targets too heavily protected to be affected by conventional high explosive bombs. These enormous weapons were designed to strike close by their target, to penetrate deeply into the earth, and to cause major structural damage by the shock waves transmitted through the ground.After sliding into the soil or rock beneath or around the target, the energy of detonation is transferred into the structure or creates a camouflet (cavern or crater) into which the target would fall. In practice, they proved capable of penetrating a significant thickness of concrete if they scored a direct hit, despite not being designed for that purpose by Wallis, who had to work within the accuracy limitations of current bombsights and the resulting low accuracy of the bombings.The Royal Air Force introduced into operational service in 1943 an improved precision bombsight: the Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight. 617 Squadron achieved a precision of at the V1 Weapon launch site at Abbeville on 16/17 December 1943. Bomber Command Diary December 1943 The Disney bomb, by contrast, was designed from the start to penetrate the thick concrete roofs of fortified bunkers. Whereas the earthquake bomb's target was the bunker itself, the Disney bomb's target was the bunker's contents. To this end, the warhead was composed of an unusually thick steel shell containing a comparatively small amount of explosive.The Disney's explosive charge was 11% of the weight of the bomb. Around 50% of the weight of conventional bombs is explosive (see General-purpose bomb) It was much slimmer than was usual for aircraft-dropped bombs, and a cluster of booster rockets accelerated the weapon as it fell. These features accord with Newton's approximation for impact depth and the empirical design equation known as Young's equation that states that the deepest target penetration is achieved by a projectile that is dense, long and thin (i.e. has a large sectional density), and strikes with a high velocity. Description The CP/RAThe Disney bomb was officially codenamed the 4500-lb CP/RA bomb (Project Ruby 1946, p. 1). CP/RA stands for Concrete Piercing/Rocket Assisted. Disney bombs were long and weighed . The diameter of the body of the bomb was , while the diameter at the tail was . They were composed of three sections. The forward section was the warhead‚Äîan explosive charge of of shellite, contained within an armour-piercing casing of thick steel and fitted with two British No.58 MK I tail Pistol fuzes at the base (i.e. furthest from the nose).The No.58 MK I tail Pistol that also equipped the Tallboy bombs were manufactured by Midgley Harmer Limited (London). The second section was made up of nineteen rocket motors from the 3-inch Rocket Projectile ‚Äì essentially metal tubes filled with cordite. In the third rear section, a tail cone contained the circuit that ignited the rockets. This was powered by a small generator with a vane spun by the airstream going past the falling bomb. Rocket ignition was controlled either by a time-delay switch, or a barometric switch.Switch activated by changes in atmospheric pressure. Also known as \\"baroswitch\\". See Applications of pressure sensors. There were six small fins at the rear of the bomb for stabilisation. The bomb was suspended from the aircraft by two weight-bearing lugs. Three arming wires also connected the bomb and the aircraft; as the bomb dropped, a brief tug from the wires would arm the warhead fuzes and the rocket-ignition circuit, and unlock the electrical generator, allowing it to spin freely. For accuracy, the bombs had to be dropped precisely from a pre- determined height, usually . They would free-fall for around 30 seconds until, at , the rockets were ignited, causing the tail section to be expelled. The rocket burn lasted for three seconds and added to the bomb's speed, giving a final impact speed of , equivalent to or approximately Mach 1.29.Other sources mention a striking speed of . (, ) Post-war tests demonstrated the bombs were able to penetrate a thick concrete roof, with the predicted (but untested) ability to penetrate of concrete. Development and testing A rocket‚Äìbomb destroys a U-boat pen in the Disney animated film Victory Through Air Power (1943) According to an anecdote, the idea arose after a group of Royal Navy officers saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power,A film adaptation of the book Victory Through Air Power by the air warfare advocate Alexander de Seversky and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it.Strategic attacks against German shipping, warships and ports were carried out by RAF Coastal Command. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked. The Disney Bomb was devised by a British naval officer, Captain Edward Terrell of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, who served in the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. Before the war, he had been a lawyer and the Recorder of Newbury. However, he was also an enthusiastic inventor and had filed several patents pre-war, including ones for a vegetable peeling knife and a bottle for fountain pen ink. The Disney bomb on the cover of Terrell's book Admiralty Brief: The Story of Inventions that Contributed to Victory in The Battle of the Atlantic (1958) The bomb's development began in September 1943. Although there was support for the idea at the highest levels within the Admiralty, production of the weapon would have to come under the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP). The Road Research LaboratoryThe RRL had aided the development of Barnes Wallis' bouncing bomb. provided theoretical formula for penetration from US data on the performance of shells against reinforced concrete, and the Chief Engineer of Armament Development at Fort Halstead prepared a preliminary design to present to the MAP. In the face of opposition, the First Sea Lord prepared a memorandum for the Anti-U-Boat Committee, of which Churchill was the Chairman. Terrell visited Churchill's scientific adviser Lord Cherwell to convince him that it was feasible technically. Due to the Prime Minister's absence through illness, it was not until January 1944 that Churchill expressed a desire that the bomb should be considered by the committee. Due to the number of departments involved there were meetings involving large numbers of technicians and scientists to confirm the technical feasibility. Terrell received support through the Air Technical Section of the USAAC, and was able to show the Admiralty a mockup under the wing of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. The Air Ministry was still opposed to its development on several technical grounds, and it took a meeting of the War Cabinet in May, which Terrell attended, to decide in its favour, giving it \\"P plus\\" priority. As a side effect the meeting focused attention on the issue of the U-boat shelters, and the RAF were directed to make attacks on them, dropping 26 Tallboys in August that year. American ground crew loading a Disney bomb onto a B-17 bomber Despite being a British weapon, Disneys were used only by the United States Army Air Force, with the bombs becoming a joint project between the American Eighth Air Force and the British Royal Navy; they were never used by RAF Bomber Command.The reason for this is unclear. In the Avro Lancaster, the RAF had a bomber with a large enough bomb bay and sufficient lift. Several sources (; ) cite unspecified technical reasons that prevented the use of British aircraft. Terrell states that the B-17 was the only aircraft capable of bearing the weight \\"under its wings\\" (Admiralty Brief p.201). Flight makes references to the German Rocket-Propelled Bomb PC 1000 Rs. ( The 92nd Bombardment Group was initially tasked with their use. The bombs were also dropped by the 305th Bombardment Group and 306th Bombardment Group. The 94th Bombardment Group prepared to use the bombs, but flew no operations with them before the war in Europe ended. The B-17 Flying Fortresses operated by these units carried the bombs in pairs; one was slung under each wing, as they were too long to be carried in the B-17's bomb bay. The Disneys were carried from the same external mounting used for the Aeronca GB-1 glide bomb. Cameras were also fitted to the aircraft so the bombs' trajectory and effect could be recorded. Testing of the Disney bombs began in early 1945. Bombs were initially dropped on a bombing range near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and calibrate bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably from that of a free‚Äìfalling bomb. Test drops were then conducted on the Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the Blockhaus d'√âperlecques), a huge German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground. Combat Four Disneys leave rocket trails as they accelerate towards Schnellbootbunker BY (SBB2), IJmuiden, Netherlands, 1945. Still taken from a US Army film The first Disney attack was against the port of IJmuiden, Netherlands. This was the site of two separate fortified pens used by the German navy to house their Schnellboote (fast torpedo boats, known to the Allies as \\"E-boats\\") and Biber midget submarines. The older structure, codename Schnellbootbunker AY (SBB1), was protected by a thick concrete roof. The newer one, codename Schnellbootbunker BY (SBB2), had of concrete, with a further layer separated by an air‚Äìgap.Only SBB2 has remained until today (). The E-boats laid up in the shelters during the day, safe from air‚Äìattack, and put to sea under cover of night to attack Allied shipping. The pens were priority targets as the torpedo boats they protected were a considerable threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces in western Europe. Since August 1944, the two bunkers had been attacked four times by No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the RAF, with a total of 53 of the five‚Äìton, Tallboy earthquake bombs. There had been numerous other attacks from bombers carrying smaller, conventional bombs. Nine aircraft of the 92nd Bomb Group, carrying 18 Disneys, attacked Schnellbootbunker BY (SBB2) on 10 February 1945. Royal Navy intelligence learned the concrete had been penetrated, but the pens had been empty at the time of the attack. The 92nd therefore carried out an attack on the SBB1 pen, again with nine aircraft, on 14 March. US Army newsreel, reporting on the first Disney attack on IJmuiden On 30 March 36 aircraft from the US Eighth Air Force, including 12 from the 92nd Bomb Group, attacked the Valentin submarine pens, a massive, bomb‚Äìhardened concrete shelter under construction at the small port of Farge, near Bremen in Germany (location: ) with Disney bombs. The shelter was nearing completion and was to be a factory for the assembly of Type XXI U-boats. Construction had been under way since 1943, using the forced labour of 10,000 concentration‚Äìcamp prisoners, prisoners‚Äìof‚Äìwar and foreign civilians (Fremdarbeiter) who suffered a high death rate because of the horrific conditions they worked under. Valentin's -thick roof had already been damaged by two 10-ton Grand Slam bombs dropped by the RAF three days earlier, on 27 March. During the Eighth Air Force attack more than sixty Disneys were launched, but only one hit the target, with little effect, although installations around the bunker received considerable damage. After the bombing the Germans made limited attempts to carry out repairs before abandoning the complex; the area was captured by the British Army four weeks later. On 4 April 1945, 24 B-17s attacked fortified targets in Hamburg. The target was obscured by cloud so radar guidance was used to launch the bombs. A further mission in May 1945 was cancelled. A total of 158 bombs were dropped before the end of the war. No aircraft or aircrew were lost during the four Disney combat missions. Post-war development West-East and South-North cross-sections of roof penetration by a Project Ruby Disney strike on the Valentin bunker In June 1945 the Air Council wrote to the Lords of the Admiralty expressing \\"their appreciation\\" of the work that had been done on the \\"rocket bomb\\". The RAF initiated bombing tests of the Disney in June 1945, using the Watten bunker as a target. The actual bombing was carried by the US 8th Air Force on behalf of the RAF. However, Watten proved too small to be a satisfactory target, and the French objected to continued bombing of their territory in peace-time. Further testing took place as part of Project Ruby. This was a 1946 joint Anglo-American programme to test a range of concrete penetrating bombs against a wartime German bunker on the small island of Heligoland and the Valentin submarine pens. Bombs tested included the Tallboy and the Grand Slam (both British and US-made versions), the American Amazon and M103 SAP bombs, and the Disney. The bombs dropped on Valentin were inert, as the objective was not to observe the effects of bomb explosions, but rather to test concrete penetration and the strength of the bomb casings. Also, with the restoration of peace, the safety of civilians living around Valentin had become a consideration. Heligoland was uninhabited at the time as its small population had been evacuated during the war. It was the site of a U-boat pen with a thick roof. This was used to test bombs loaded with explosive but with inert detonators, to make sure the explosives used would not themselves detonate immediately upon impact with the target, before penetrating it. This peace-time testing of the bomb was far more extensive than could be carried out prior to its wartime deployment. A total of 76 Disneys were dropped on Heligoland, loaded with a variety of explosive charges, composed of shellite, RDX, TNT or Picratol. Thirty-four Disneys were dropped on Valentin, 12 with the rockets inactivated and 22 with the rockets firing. A further four had been previously dropped on a bomb range at Orford Ness to test their accuracy, and to make sure none would land outside the safety exclusion zone that was set up around Valentin during the trials. The penetration performance ( of concrete) of the Disney was found to be satisfactory, with a predicted maximum penetration of . One of the bombs penetrated both Valentin's concrete roof, and its thick concrete floor, coming to rest completely buried in the sand under structure's foundations. However, there were problems with the bombs. The reliability of the rocket booster ignition was considered unsatisfactory, with a failure rate of around 37% during the trials. Also, some bombs broke up on impact with the target due to flaws in the steel casing, and bombs struck at an angle, increasing the effective thickness of concrete they had to penetrate. Furthermore, it was noted that the warhead of the bomb was comparatively small, so a very large bunker complex such as Valentin would have required many penetrating hits to be sure of destroying all the contents. In comparison, the effective concrete penetration of the Tallboy and Grand Slams was similar to the Disney (around ). Although these bombs directly penetrated only around of concrete, the remaining thickness was blown in by the detonation of the bombs' enormous explosive charge. The roof of Valentin had been penetrated by two Grand Slams before the war ended but, as there was no detonation inside the bunker, there was little damage to the complex aside from the large holes in the roof; post-war examination revealed installations inside the bunker remained comparatively unscathed. The conclusion of Project Ruby was that none of the bombs tested was completely suitable, and the development of a new concrete‚Äìpenetrating bomb was recommended. The Disney's rocket-assist was viewed as a worthwhile feature that should be incorporated into any new bomb designs because target penetration increases with strike velocity, although penetration increases only marginally from drop altitudes higher than . On 27 January 2009 the body of an inactive Disney bomb, with its explosive charge, was extracted from the roof of Watten bunker (by now a private museum), where it had embedded itself during one of the 1945 test- drops. The bomb was transferred to the ammunition depot at La Geule d'Ours, two kilometres from the centre of Vimy, where recovered chemical ammunition and equipment from the First World War is processed.

TCU is the only evangelical university fully accredited by Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).  History  = Tokyo = TCU's history spans 125 years of Japan's 140-year Protestant history. The university emerged from a merger of three Christian schools. The oldest, founded in 1881 in Yokohama, focused on women's education at a time when Japan offered women few opportunities for higher education. In 1949 Tokyo Christian Theological Seminary came into existence, and 1950 saw the establishment of the Japan Domei Institute. The Domei Institute later offered both a three- and a four- year course, achieving accreditation as a junior college. These three schools merged in 1979, with the goal of upgrading the junior college into a university while maintaining the seminary as a distinct graduate program with its own identity. = Chiba = In 1989, the merged school moved to its present location in Chiba New Town, a part of the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. Having achieved the approval of the Japanese Ministry of Education, the transition from the junior college to the university took place between 1990 and 1993. The university admitted its first group of students in 1990, when the junior college graduated its final class. In 1993, the university gained full recognition from the Japanese Ministry of Education, and it continues in this status until today.  English-degree Program  In the twenty-first century, the university admitted its first group of international students under the \\"Asian Christian Theological Studies Program for English Speakers\\" (ACTS-ES), a 4-year international program offering a Bachelor of Arts in Theology. This English-degree program integrates the liberal arts with Bible studies and theology, academic preparation with practical experience, the English language with Japanese studies, and the world's cultures with Japan and Asia. ACTS-ES came to existence during the leadership of Stephen T. Franklin, a Christian theologian and philosopher, who was elected as President of Tokyo Christian University in 1998 and re-elected for a second term in 2002. He stepped down from this post in March 2006. Since stepping down as president, Franklin has been contributing to the advancement of higher education in Japan and the United States as Professor of Theology and Philosophy at Tokyo Christian University and Olivet Nazarene University. The course has been very successful, and has attracted students from North America, Europe, and Africa, though it was originally designed for students from Asia.  Student Life  = Campus Life = Tokyo Christian University rests in a park-like setting and green-zone city near Narita International Airport and downtown Tokyo. TCU's campus is located in Inzai-shi, a city located in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Inzai is located in the important area of northern Chiba Prefecture connecting Tokyo and Narita. The campus is situated at a neighborhood with broad streets, safe sidewalks, green parks, and close to private houses and apartments. It has convenient train access to the rest of the Tokyo area, including Narita International Airport and Tokyo‚Äôs central business sectors, such as Asakusa and Ginza. Besides Tone River that flows in the north, Teganuma Lake that lies in the north-west, Imba Lake that lies in the south-east of the city, the city is also surrounded by natural environment such as natural forest. The development of the Chiba New Town project and the Hokus≈ç Line considerably boosted the development of Inzai from the mid-1980s. Inzai was elevated to city status on April 1, 1996. On March 23, 2010, Inzai absorbed the villages of Inba and Motono (both from Inba District) to create the new and expanded city of Inzai. The main shopping centers in Inzai are: Jusco Chiba New Town, AEON Chiba New Town Shopping Center, Joyful Honda Chiba New Town, Costco. = Spiritual Life = International students and Japanese students are not segregated, but live together in on-campus dorms. On campus, students are required to attend chapel four days a week for half an hour Tuesday through Friday. There are also early morning prayer meetings, Wednesday evening prayer groups, a summer evangelism trip, international missions lectures, and many other practical spiritual opportunities. In order to graduate, ACTS-ES students must intern at one or multiple churches for the duration of their degree. In Japan, most schools require the students to help clean and maintain the campus facilities. TCU has incorporated that Japanese tradition into its educational practice. All students, in the spirit of Christian concern for each other, share in maintaining the dorms and take turns washing dishes in the cafeteria. Students also take a central role in school events by participating in committees. Each student is required to join one committee. The current committees for ACTS Students include Student Council, Zion Festival, Spring Retreat, Prayer Meeting, and Summer Missions. There are many on-campus opportunities to participate in music groups, choir, clubs (called ‚Äúcircles‚Äù), concerts, intramural athletic events, exercise, or prayer groups. = Dormitory Life = In principle, all TCU students must live in the school‚Äôs dormitories. With less than 200 students, TCU‚Äôs dorms are close-knit families with internal responsibilities and events. The dormitories are managed by the Student Affairs Department and by the students themselves on the basis of the ‚ÄúTokyo Christian University Dormitory Bylaws.‚Äù TCU runs four dormitories: The Men‚Äôs Dorm, the Women‚Äôs Dorm, the Zion Dorm, and the Family Dorm. The Men‚Äôs and Woman‚Äôs Dorms are three story buildings with a capacity of approximately 100 students each. Each dorm room accommodates two students and is equipped with individual study desks and chairs, bunk-beds, individual chest-of-drawers, and book shelves. All rooms are air-conditioned. Each dorm has a lounge and bathing facilities (both shower and Japanese style ‚Äúofuro‚Äù), and each of the three floors in both dormitories has prayer rooms, bathrooms, and a laundry room equipped with washing machines and dryers. Zion Dorm is a suite-style dormitory and has space for 32 students. Each suite has facilities for four persons. Each person has a private bedroom/study room. TCU also runs a Family Dorm. The apartments in the family dorm come in three sizes, each with a different rental fee. The tuition is the same for all TCU students, whether living in one of the single‚Äôs dorms or in the family dorm. However the fees for room and board and certain utilities are quite different for family dorm.

King Louie, born Louis Paul Bankston) is an American rock and roll musician from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Associated early on with garage punk, he abandoned the genre in 1998 and has focused on Louisiana swamp pop, boogie woogie, boogie rock and power pop. He is best known for his work in the Royal Pendletons, The Persuaders, The Exploding Hearts, and The King Louie One Man Band. Bankston has toured Europe and the United States since the very early 1990s. He has released 53 records in the vinyl format. Louis currently plays music based out of Oakland, California, and lives in a suburb of New Orleans. Bankston has lived in New Orleans, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee. History =Royal Pendletons= King Louie helped found the Royal Pendletons in 1991 along with Michael Hurtt on guitar/vocals, J. Matthew Uhlman on guitar/vocals, and G. Thomas Oliver on organ. The band achieved in the pre-internet years what is now known as a \\" Buzz Band \\" status today. Not concentrating on the studio or recording side of their set the band has little to show for their efforts. The RP's were known to have over 100 songs and usually played from open to close at New Orleans venues Checkpoint Charlie's, Benny's and Barristers (Memphis). The Royal Pendletons put out their first 7\\" on Goner Records in 1995, and in 1998 put out a full-length LP on Sympathy for the Record Industry with producer Alex Chilton entitled Oh Yeah, Baby. =Terry and Louie= Terry and Louie is a return to Louie's Exploding Hearts writing and playing with bandmate Terry.

It is Louis' only current project of new music. =The Persuaders = King Louie Bankston formed the garage rock band, The Persuaders in 1996, along with Jason Panzer on guitar, and Shaggy on drums.

The band recorded an album's worth of material after only one practice session in 1998, releasing a self-titled LP in 2001. the members returned to their respective solo commitments. Eric and Louie have been positive about trying to re-issue the out-of-print LP. =The Exploding Hearts= In 2000, Louie moved to Portland, Oregon. In 2001 he joined The Exploding Hearts, where he co-wrote and played keyboards on their only LP, Guitar Romantic. After 11 months with the group, Louie declined to move into a management/lead role. Plans were in the works to continue as a writer only. After a show in San Francisco, the band's van overturned on the way home in the early hours of April 20, 2003. Three members of the group were killed, thus ending any future works. =King Louie and the Loose Diamonds= Formed in 2003 as Rat Tail. In 2007, Empty Records released Memphis Treet by King Louie and the Loose Diamonds.

In the King Louie One Man Band, Louie sings, plays drums, guitar, cowbell, and harmonica. The King Louie One Man Band has released several 7\\" records on various labels, and put out a full-length LP on Goner in 2004. =King Louie's Missing Monuments= In 2009, King Louie along with longtime friend and collaborator, revered lead guitarist Julien Fried formerly of Seattle, recruited drummer Aaron Hill and Bassist Bennette Bartley to form the power pop group King Louie's Missing Monuments.

Early life Dal Prato was born in Imola, Italy. Here he studied under Lorenzo Gibelli and made his debut at sixteen years of age in 1777 at Fano. In 1779 he was invited to sing for the Russian Crown Prince (who became Tsar Paul I) in Stuttgart. During his time in Germany he was discovered by one of Paul's \\"talent scouts\\" and immediately engaged to work in Munich. Dal Prato was a full-time professional singer during the years 1780 to 1805. He was very popular, handsome, and considered to be good-natured with everyone; his singing style was renowned for its high quality but his acting was thought to be of an average standard. His favourite role was that of the serious lover in comic operas, which he supposedly enjoyed immensely because it allowed him to flaunt his lyrical talents without requiring any great acting skills.Heriot, Angus. The Castrati in Opera. London: Secker & Warburg, 1956, pp. 121‚Äì122. Criticism In 1781, 24 years old, he was called upon to perform the role of Idamante in Mozart's Idomeneo re di Creta at Munich, although after his first collaboration Mozart was not impressed by dal Prato. From the letters which Mozart wrote to his father up to 1780, it appears that all his dealings with castrati had been difficult. Mozart stated Manzuoli was brilliant but stubborn, Rauzzini was immature and unpredictable, Tenducci was a renowned libertine, but he had a naturally charming voice and seemed a natural for the role. Mozart had been commissioned to write Idomeneo for the carnival of 1781 and the role of Idamante was to be given to a castrato. Mozart had a very poor opinion of dal Prato, and he was to be primo uomo in name only. He did not consider him worthy of such an important role. After Idomeneo, dal Prato remained in Munich for 25 years and established himself as a famous primo uomo, despite Mozart's criticism. Mozart repeatedly referred to dal Prato very sarcastically in his letters to his father as il nostro molto amato castrato Dal Prato (our much-loved castrato dal Prato) and in late 1780 describes him as \\"shoddy\\".Anderson, Emily. The Letters of Mozart and his Family. London, [1938], 3rd edition 1985. In another letter he insists that dal Prato ha cantato in modo vergognoso (sang in a shameful way), and even considered calling the castrato Ceccarelli, whom Mozart despised, from Salzburg to take over as Idamante. Mozart did not think dal Prato would be able to finish rehearsals, let alone perform. He describes dal Prato as \\"rotten through and through\\", and says that he has \\"no notion how to sing a cadenza effectively\\", adding that \\"I have to teach him everything, as though he had started yesterday.\\" The singing of the recitatives was ruined by the tenor Anton Raaff (in the title role) and by dal Prato, and he said they were the worst actors he had ever come across. Mozart wrote the quartet Andr√≤ ramingo e solo to start with Idamante, but the style was completely new and nothing like it had ever been seen in opera seria. None of the singers were up to the task and they all reacted against it. Mozart wrote to his father in the depths of despair, blaming the worst reaction on dal Prato. He said dal Prato's voice would not be so bad if it came out from somewhere other than his mouth. He was completely unable to intone the quartet, Mozart said, had no method, and \\"sang like a young boy auditioning for a part in the chapel choir\\". Mozart must have been fond of this quartet because he arranged for a private recital two and a half years later, with himself singing the role of Idamante (in a transcription for tenor). He burst into tears and had to run out of the room, and not even his wife Constanze could talk him into coming back. Dal Prato sang the part and was awarded a pension by the Elector Karl Theodor, which he received until his death at Munich in 1828.

The add-on was developed by San Francisco-based company Foxmarks (later renamed Xmarks) which was founded in 2006 by Mitch Kapor and was acquired by LastPass in December 2010. LastPass announced on March 30, 2018, that the Xmarks service would be shut down on May 1, 2018. Overview The Xmarks bookmark synchronizer was an extension for Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Apple Safari (on OS X 10.5 and 10.6) that synchronized bookmarks between computers. It could also synchronize passwords, open tabs, and browsing history (Firefox only). Opera support has not been directly implemented as of 2015 but the Chrome extension is available in Opera via a workaround. As of April 2009 it was one of the most popular Firefox add-ons, attaining over 150,000 downloads per week and almost 15 million total downloads.Xmarks (formerly Foxmarks) stats on addons.mozilla.org Company history In March 2009, Foxmarks was relaunched under a new name and service called Xmarks. Xmarks included many new features like suggested tagging bookmarks. On September 27, 2010 it was announced that due to the company's current financial projections resulting from its purely voluntary- donations funding-basis, in January 2011, Xmarks would be entirely discontinuing its service. On September 30, Xmarks CEO, James Joaquin, noted that he had been \\"pleasantly surprised by the volume of interest\\" that has been expressed since his initial \\"closing-announcement\\". This interest has been shown by both potential buyers of the company, and by those who have thus far pledged to subscribe to the service at the site's \\"pledge page\\". At their donations page, Xmarks attempted to acquire pledges from 100,000 of their users to pay $10‚Äì20 per year for a proposed \\"premium Xmarks service\\" which launched on December 9, 2010. To the date October 7, 2010, Xmarks investors had invested $9 million into the Xmarks project, but with a return on this investment not yet clearly in sight, unless sufficient pledges are received by October 15, 2010, apparently these initial investment funds are reaching an end-point. On December 2, 2010, the password-management service LastPass acquired Xmarks. Since this acquisition the program has been minimally updated, primarily fixing bugs, and has not had a single new feature added. On October 9, 2015, LastPass was acquired by LogMeIn, Inc. for $125 million. After the acquisition, LastPass stated that they plan to continue to support Xmarks. On March 30, 2018, in an email to users, LastPass announced that the Xmarks service would be shut down on May 1, 2018.

He appeared in 36 games over five seasons in Major League Baseball without earning a win. He had eight losses. Reynolds was born in Glendale, California, but grew up in East Texas, and graduated from John Tyler High School in Tyler, Texas. After attending Paris Junior College in Paris, Texas, Reynolds was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 38th round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft. He dominated Rookie ball, going 9‚Äì3 with a 2.13 earned run average for the Pioneer League's Treasure Valley Cubs to earn a promotion all the way to double A in 1967. He went 13‚Äì2 with a 2.19 ERA with the double A San Antonio Missions in 1968, and earned his first call to the major leagues that August. He appeared in seven games for the Cubs, and had a 6.75 ERA. His one loss was his only start against the San Francisco Giants on August 27. For the most part, Reynolds spent all of 1969 assigned to Tacoma, making only two starts for the Cubs in the second game of doubleheaders on June 15 & 22\\\\. The Cubs won, and Reynolds left with a lead in his June 15 start against the Cincinnati Reds, however, after giving up a lead off home run to opposing pitcher Jim Maloney to start the fifth, followed by a hard single back to the mound by Pete Rose, Reynolds was pulled, and was ineligible for the decision. Reynolds was 0‚Äì2 with a 6.60 ERA for the Cubs in 1970 when he was dealt to the California Angels for Juan Pizarro. He spent the rest of the season assigned to the Angels' Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders, where he went 7‚Äì3 with a 2.62 ERA. On May 26, 1972, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for outfielder Curt Motton.

Sir Robert Southwell PRS (31 December 1635 ‚Äì 11 September 1702) was a diplomat. He was Secretary of State for Ireland and President of the Royal Society from 1690. Background and education Robert Southwell was born near Kinsale in County Cork on 31 December 1635 to Robert Southwell (1608-1677) and his wife Helena, daughter of Major Robert Gore, of Shereton, Wiltshire. The family had settled in Ireland a couple of generations earlier, and his father had become a customs official at Kinsale in 1631. Like other Munster planters, he was threatened by the Irish Rebellion of 1641. During the Civil War, he followed the Royalist cause, placing him in a weak position. This may be why his son was sent to Christchurch, Hampshire in 1650, before graduating to Queen's College, Oxford, from which he graduated BA in 1655. Between 1659 and 1661, he travelled in Europe meeting some of the leading intellectuals of his time. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1662. Public office On his return to Ireland, his father wanted him to find employment that would keep him in Ireland. He obtained the post of secretary to the Commission of Prizes in 1664. Soon after, he married Elizabeth Dering (1649‚Äì1682), daughter of Sir Edward Dering, 2nd Baronet, by whom his son Edward Southwell was born. Her marriage portion of ¬£1500 enabled him to buy one of the four clerkships of the Privy Council. His linguistic abilities suited him for diplomatic service. He was appointed in November 1665 as an emissary to Portugal, being knighted before he left. There he assisted in securing the peace between Spain and Portugal, which was achieved in February 1668. He returned to England, but was sent back to Portugal, staying for over another year. In October 1671, he was dispatched to Brussels as ambassador. On his return, he was elected to the English Parliament for Penryn in 1673. He also took up again the post of secretary to the Commission of Prizes, which he had resigned in 1667 and became his father's deputy as Vice-Admiral of Munster. He also became a Commissioner of Excise in 1671. Southwell was embarrassed by the Popish Plot, being forced to testify at the trial of Edward Colman that Titus Oates, whom he detested, was telling the truth about the evidence had given at a crucial Council meeting, and sold his clerkship of the Privy Council in 1679. However, he remained in favour, being appointed in spring 1680 as an envoy to the Elector of Brandenburg, with the object of constructing an alliance against France. This took him to the courts of the Prince of Orange and the Duke of Brunswick‚ÄìL√ºneburg, but the project was no longer what Charles II wanted. In 1685, he was elected to Parliament again, this time for Lostwithiel. However, he was out of office in this period, having lost his Excise place in 1681. After the Glorious Revolution After the accession of William and Mary II of England, Southwell accompanied William to Ireland, as his principal secretary, after the deposed James II had landed at Kinsale in his attempt to recover his kingdom. He was in Ireland from June to October 1690. In December he was elected as President of the Royal Society, a post to which he was re- elected annually until 1695. He also held office as a Customs Commissioner from 1689 until 1697. He died at his estate King's Weston House near Bristol, on 11 September 1702 and was buried nearby in Henbury church in Gloucestershire. Though he remained living in England Southwell remembered his Irish roots by founding almshouses in Kinsale. Family Southwell married, on 26 January 1664, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Edward Dering of Surrenden-Dering in Kent. Their children were: Rupert, born on 21 May 1670, and died on 8 May 1678; Edward Southwell, his heir; and four daughters‚ÄîHelena, Elizabeth, Mary, and Catherine.

Phase III development in paediatric patients with hyperphosphataemia associated with chronic kidney disease was underway in the UK and Germany. However, the company discontinued the development. In addition, the phase II development in type-2 diabetes mellitus and phase I development in hyperphosphataemia, in Japan, was also discontinued by the company. Phase III development for hyperphosphataemia was previously underway in the US. However, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma discontinued development in this market. Colestilan was also investigated in phase III trials in Europe and Asia for hypercholesterolaemia. However, as of March 2015, no recent reports of development have been identified for the drug in this indication Clinical use Colestilan is used for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia (too high phosphate concentrations in the blood serum) in patients undergoing dialysis, including peritoneal dialysis. Contraindications Colestilan is contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction.  Interactions  The substance can inhibit the resorption of other drugs, as well as fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and folate, from the gut. Resulting lower blood levels can be clinically problematic with immunosuppressant and antiepileptic drugs. Adverse effects Adverse effects include gastrointestinal problems such as constipation, as well as vitamin and calcium deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency sometimes causes gastrointestinal bleeding. Chemistry and mechanism of action Colestilan is a cross-linked copolymer of 2-methylimidazole and epichlorohydrin and works as an anion exchanger resin with affinity to phosphate, bile acid anions and urate. It binds these anions in the gut and removes them from the enterohepatic circulation. Colestilan is not absorbed from the gut, but is excreted together with the bound anions. 2-methyl-1H-imidazole (left) and epichlorohydrin (right)  Notes and references  Category:Phosphate binders Category:Bile acid sequestrants ","title":"Colestilan"},{"id":"18179071","text":"Westinghouse \\"time capsule\\" (1939) George Edward Pendray (May 19, 1901 - September 15, 1987) was an American public relations counselor, author, foundation executive, and an early advocate of rockets and spaceflight. He was associated with Robert H. Goddard and helped organize the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He conceived the idea of a \\"time capsule\\" sealed container to preserve current everyday items for future historians and implemented his concept at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Pendray co-founded the American Interplanetary Society. Early life Pendray was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to John Hall Pendray and his wife, Louisa Wolfe. He grew up in Niobrara County, Wyoming and attended the University of Wyoming, graduating in 1924.Who Was Who in America, Vol 9 He then went to Columbia University, where he received his Master of Arts degree in 1925. Two years later, he married Leatrice M. Gregory. They had three daughters: Guenever, Elaine, and Lynette. Middle life Pendray became an editor at the New York Herald-Tribune after completing his graduate work at Columbia University. He remained at the Tribune for seven years. A science fiction enthusiast, he worked as a science editor for Literary Digest from 1932 to 1936. He was next hired at Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company as assistant to the president. One of his responsibilities was public relations in advance of the 1939 New York World's Fair. Pendray created what he called a \\"time capsule\\", to preserve everyday items in a sealed container for future historians. He also created the word \\"laundromat\\" (for any self-service laundry facility) for Westinghouse. Career Pendray's primary employment was in public relations; however, he always was interested in rocketry. He was an early experimenter with liquid propulsion rockets. Pendray was a contemporary of the rocket expert Robert H. Goddard. Pendray and his associates worked on the beginnings of rocket development and technology, which led to his co-founding of the American Interplanetary Society (which was renamed the American Rocket Society) in 1934. This organization is now the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), and awards the \\"G. Edward Pendray Award\\" in recognition of his achievements. Later life Pendray helped develop the Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Center at the California Institute of Technology and the Guggenheim Laboratories at Princeton University. He also assisted in developing the Guggenheim Institute of Flight Structures at Columbia University. In 1958 he was a consultant to the Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration of the United States House of Representatives. Pendray helped in the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Personal life Leatrice May Gregory (1905-1971), Pendray's first wife, was born in Colorado City, Texas, and graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1927, where she met Pendray. She was a syndicated newspaper columnist, from 1929 to 1944, and a partner with her husband in a public relations firm, Pendray & Company, from 1945 to 1970.

After its inception, the Trio quickly gained notoriety for its highly charged and refined performances which often defied the standard conceptions of the classical guitar repertoire. As the group‚Äôs musical director and arranger, Patterson earned exceptional praise for his innovative programming and his \\"ingenious transcriptions of solo piano, chamber, and orchestra works\\" (Guitar Player magazine). The ensemble had no first, second or third guitarists, but rather, a fluid exchange of leading and supporting roles, tailored to each player‚Äôs style. This flexibility allowed for individual freedom of expression, resulting in the exceptional dynamism that characterized the Trio‚Äôs acclaimed performances. Between 1988 and 1997, the members of the Trio included David Patterson, Thomas Noren, and Dean Harada. Harada left the group and was replaced by Thomas Rohde in the spring of 1997. After 15 years of success, the Trio members disbanded in 2003 to pursue individual projects.  Performances  The group performed worldwide in diverse venues including: Boston‚Äôs Jordan Hall, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Taipei‚Äôs National Theater, Rio de Janeiro, Lincoln Center, the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater at Columbia University, Five Spot jazz club, CBGB's gallery, and the 92nd Street Y in New York. The Trio frequently appeared on national radio as part of the NPR series \\"Performance Today\\" and \\"All Things Considered\\", \\"Around New York\\" (WNYC), and the Young Artist Showcase on WQXR. They also appeared on television and radio throughout Asia and South America.  Commissions and recordings  In addition to performing original arrangements, the New World Guitar Trio had a history of commissioning new works. In 1996, the group premiered Oceana under the direction of Helmuth Rilling, a commission from Osvaldo Golijov by the Oregon Bach Festival and written for vocalist Lucianna Souza and the Trio. Other premieres included Dana Brayton‚Äôs The Preacher (2000), David Leisner‚Äôs Roaming (1994), Claudio Ragazzi‚Äôs Exiled in Buenos Aires (1997), Fernando Brand√£o‚Äôs Prociss√£o (1999), and Chiel Meijering‚Äôs Who‚Äôs Hot and Who‚Äôs Not, premiered in 1997 with the Boston Modern Orchestra Project.

It was one of the highest profile casualties of the rise and fall of internet companies during the internet boom at the beginning of the 21st century falling from a value of ¬£2.5 billion in 2000 to ¬£5 million in 2002. History The origins of Scoot began in March 1993 when businessman Nigel Robertson bought the freephone number 0800 192 192 from British Telecommunications for an estimated value of just ¬£100. Robertson had spotted the potential of acquiring a freephone number similar to BT's own directory enquiries number of 192. BT spent three years trying to recover the number in legal battles but were finally forced to admit defeat in May 1996. Robertson and his business partner Jonathan Bushby renamed their company (then known as Timeload) as FreePages and set itself up as a rival directory enquiries service a few months later. In February 1996 the firm was listed on the AIM stock market following a reverse takeover of Blagg plc. In 1998 Robertson stepped down as CEO of FreePages and sold out of the company, leaving it under the direction of Robert Bonnier, a Dutch financier who had joined FreePages in February 1995. Bonnier renamed the company Scoot, and the firm began to aggressively promote itself with television advertising in the UK and a link-up with French media giant Vivendi to promote itself in Europe. In June 2000 it purchased classified advertising newspaper Loot for ¬£189.9m. However, the company failed to reach its hoped-for user numbers and ran out of cash. Following heavy losses in the first half of 2001, Bonnier quit as chief executive in June 2001. The European side of the business was bought out by Vivendi, its major shareholder, and in August 2001 the company was forced to sell Loot, its only profit-making business, to Daily Mail and General Trust for ¬£45m in order to raise money to keep going. In June 2002 the company, which had told its creditors it would run out of money by the end of the month, sold the bulk of its UK business to BT for ¬£5 million - just two years previously the company had been valued at over ¬£2.5 billion. The remainder of the business reverted to its original name of Timeload, but less than a year later it was acquired by the Coe Group, a video surveillance company. In 2005, Enable Media Ltd acquired a 20-year licence from BT to operate Scoot, with its 2,500 local advertisers, for a rumoured ¬£10m. BT maintains an economic interest, based upon future revenues.

They include the movement of electricity in bulk (formally called \\"transmission\\") and the delivery of electricity to individual customers (\\"distribution\\"). In the beginning, the two terms were used interchangeably. Early transmission series. Prior to electricity, various systems had been used for transmission of power across large distances. Chief among them were telodynamic (cable in motion), pneumatic (pressurized air), and hydraulic (pressurized fluid) transmission. Cable cars were the most frequent example of telodynamic transmission, whose lines could extend for several miles for a single section. Pneumatic transmission was used for city power transmission systems in Paris, Birmingham, Rixdorf, Offenbach, Dresden and Buenos Aires at the beginning of the twentieth century. Cities in the 19th century also used hydraulic transmission using high pressure water mains to deliver power to factory motors. London's system delivered 7000 hp ( 5 megawatts) over a network of pipes carrying water at 800 psi. These systems were replaced by cheaper and more versatile electrical systems, but by the end of the 19th century, city planners and financiers were well aware of the benefits, economics, and process of establishing power transmission systems. In the early days of electric power usage, widespread transmission of electric power had two obstacles. First, devices requiring different voltages required specialized generators with their own separate lines. Street lights, electric motors in factories, power for streetcars and lights in homes are examples of the diversity of devices with voltages requiring separate systems. Secondly, generators had to be relatively near their loads (a mile or less for low voltage devices). It was known that longer distance transmission was possible the higher the voltage was raised, so both problems could be solved if transforming voltages from a single universal power line could be done efficiently. Specialized systems Streetcars created enormous demand for early electricity. This Siemens Tram from 1884 required 500 V direct current, which was typical. Much of early electricity was direct current, which could not easily be increased or decreased in voltage either for long-distance transmission or for sharing a common line to be used with multiple types of electric devices. Companies simply ran different lines for the different classes of loads their inventions required. For example, Charles Brush's New York arc lamp systems required up to 10 kV for many lamps in a series circuit, Edison's incandescent lights used 110 V, streetcars built by Siemens or Sprague required large motors in the 500 volt range, whereas industrial motors in factories used still other voltages. Due to this specialization of lines, and because transmission was so inefficient, it seemed at the time that the industry would develop into what is now known as a distributed generation system with large numbers of small generators located near their loads. Early high voltage exterior lighting High voltage was of interest to early researchers working on the problem of transmission over distance. They knew from elementary electricity principle that the same amount of power could be transferred on a cable by doubling the voltage and halving the current. Due to Joule's Law, they also knew that the power lost from heat in a wire is proportional to the square of the current traveling on it, regardless the voltage, and so by doubling the voltage, the same cable would be capable of transmitting the same amount of power four times the distance. At the Paris Exposition of 1878, electric arc lighting had been installed along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera, using electric Yablochkov arc lamps, powered by Z√©nobe Gramme alternating current dynamos. Yablochkov candles required high voltage, and it was not long before experimenters reported that the arc lamps could be powered on a circuit. Within a decade scores of cities would have lighting systems using a central power plant that provided electricity to multiple customers via electrical transmission lines. These systems were in direct competition with the dominant gaslight utilities of the period. Brush Electric Company's central power plant dynamos powered arc lamps for public lighting in New York. Beginning operation in December 1880 at 133 West Twenty-Fifth Street, it powered a long circuit. The idea of investing in a central plant and a network to deliver energy produced to customers who pay a recurring fee for service was familiar business model for investors: it was identical to the lucrative gaslight business, or the hydraulic and pneumatic power transmission systems. The only difference was the commodity being delivered was electricity, not gas, and the \\"pipes\\" used for delivering were more flexible. The California Electric Company (now PG&E;) in San Francisco in 1879 used two direct current generators from Charles Brush's company to supply multiple customers with power for their arc lamps. This San Francisco system was the first case of a utility selling electricity from a central plant to multiple customers via transmission lines. CEC soon opened a second plant with 4 additional generators. Service charges for light from sundown to midnight was $10 per lamp per week. Grand Rapids Electric Light & Power Company, established in March 1880 by William T. Powers and others, began operation of the world's first commercial central station hydroelectric power plant, Saturday, July 24, 1880, getting power from Wolverine Chair and Furniture Company's water turbine. It operated a 16-light Brush electric dynamo lighting several storefronts in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is the earliest predecessor of Consumers Energy of Jackson, Michigan. In December 1880, Brush Electric Company set up a central station to supply a length of Broadway with arc lighting. By the end of 1881, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Montreal, Buffalo, San Francisco, Cleveland and other cities had Brush arc lamp systems, producing public light well into the 20th century. By 1893 there were 1500 arc lamps illuminating New York streets. Direct current lighting Extremely bright arc lights were too bright, and with the high voltages and sparking/fire hazard, too dangerous to use indoors.The First Form of Electric Light History of the Carbon Arc Lamp (1800 ‚Äì 1980s) In 1878 inventor Thomas Edison saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems.Howard B. Rockman, Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists, John Wiley ‚Äì 2004, page 131 After devising a commercially viable incandescent light bulb in 1879, Edison went on to develop the first large scale investor-owned electric illumination \\"utility\\" in lower Manhattan, eventually serving one square mile with 6 \\"jumbo dynamos\\" housed at Pearl Street Station.Ahmad Faruqui, Kelly Eakin, Pricing in Competitive Electricity Markets, Springer Science & Business Media ‚Äì 2000, page 67 When service began in September 1882, there were 85 customers with 400 light bulbs. Each dynamo produced 100 kW‚Äîenough for 1200 incandescent lights, and transmission was at 110 V via underground conduits. The system cost $300,000 to build with installation of the of underground conduits one of the most expensive parts of the project. Operating expenses exceeded income in the first two years and fire destroyed the plant in 1890. Further, Edison had a three wire system so that either 110 V or 220 V could be supplied to power some motors. Availability of large-scale generation Availability of large amounts of power from diverse locations would become possible after Charles Parsons' production of turbogenerators beginning 1889. Turbogenerator output quickly jumped from 100 kW to 25 megawatts in two decades. Prior to efficient turbogenerators, hydroelectric projects were a significant source of large amounts of power requiring transmission infrastructure. Transformers and alternating current When George Westinghouse became interested in electricity, he quickly and correctly concluded that Edison's low voltages were too inefficient to be scaled up for transmission needed for large systems. He further understood that long-distance transmission needed high voltage and that inexpensive conversion technology only existed for alternating current. Transformers would play the decisive role in the victory of alternating current over direct current for transmission and distribution systems. In 1876, Pavel Yablochkov patented his mechanism of using induction coils to serve as a step up transformer prior to the Paris Exposition demonstrating his arc lamps. In 1881, Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs developed a more efficient device which they dubbed the secondary generator, namely an early step down transformer whose ratio could be adjusted by configuring the connections between a series of wired bobbins around a spindle, from which an iron core could be added or removed as necessary to vary the power output. The device was subject to various critisims and was occasionally misunderstood as only providing a 1:1 turn ratio.Thomas Parke Hughes, Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880‚Äì1930, p.89, (1993) The first demonstrative long-distance (34 km, 21 mi) AC line was built for the 1884 International Exhibition of Turin, Italy. It was powered by a 2-kV, 130-Hz Siemens & Halske alternator and featured several Gaulard secondary generators with their primary windings connected in series, which fed incandescent lamps. The system proved the feasibility of AC electric power transmission over long distances. After this success, between 1884 and 1885, Hungarian engineers Zipernowsky, Bl√°thy, and D√©ri from the Ganz company in Budapest created the efficient \\"Z.B.D.\\" closed-core coils, as well as the modern electric distribution system. The three had discovered that all former coreless or open-core devices were incapable of regulating voltage, and were therefore impractical. Their joint patent described two versions of a design with no poles: the \\"closed-core transformer\\" and the \\"shell-core transformer\\".Patent No. US352105, U.S. Patent Office, 1886-11-02, retrieved 2009-07-08 Ott√≥ Bl√°thy suggested the use of closed-cores, K√°roly Zipernowsky the use of shunt connections, and Miksa D√©ri performed the experiments. Smil, Vaclav, Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867‚Äî1914 and Their Lasting Impact, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 71. In the closed-core transformer the iron core is a closed ring around which the two coils are wound. In the shell type transformer, the windings are passed through the core. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings travels almost entirely within the iron core, with no intentional path through air. The core consists of iron strands or sheets. These revolutionary design elements would finally make it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.Bl√°thy, Ott√≥ Titusz, Hungarian Patent Office. Zipernowsky, Bl√°thy and D√©ri also discovered the transformer formula, Vs/Vp = Ns/Np. Electrical and electronic systems the world over rely on the principles of the original Ganz transformers. The inventors are also credited with the first use of the word \\"transformer\\" to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current.Nagy, √Årp√°d Zolt√°n, \\"Lecture to Mark the 100th Anniversary of the Discovery of the Electron in 1897\\" (preliminary text), Budapest 1996-10-11, retrieved 2009-07-09. A very first operative AC line was put into service in 1885 in via dei Cerchi, Rome, Italy, for public lighting. It was powered by two Siemens & Halske alternators rated 30 hp (22 kW), 2 kV at 120 Hz and used 200 series-connected Gaulard 2-kV/20-V step-down transformers provided with a closed magnetic circuit, one for each lamp. Few months later it was followed by the first British AC system, which was put into service at the Grosvenor Gallery, London. It also featured Siemens alternators and 2.4-kV/100-V step-down transformers, one per user, with shunt- connected primaries. The concept that is the basis of modern transmission using inexpensive step up and step down transformers was first implemented by Westinghouse, William Stanley, Jr. and Franklin Leonard Pope in 1886 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, resorting also to European technology.http://edisontechcenter.org ‚Äì Great Barrington 1886 The first practical AC power delivery systemThomas Parke Hughes, Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880‚Äì1930, p.103, (1993) In 1888 Westinghouse also licensed Nikola Tesla's induction motor which they would eventually develop into a usable (2-phase) AC motor. The modern 3-phase system was developed by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Allgemeine Elektricit√§ts- Gesellschaft and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown in Europe, starting in 1889. The International Electro-Technical Exhibition of 1891, in Frankfurt, Germany, featured the long-distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current. It was held between 16 May and 19 October on the disused site of the three former ‚ÄúWestbahnh√∂fe‚Äù (Western Railway Stations) in Frankfurt am Main. The exhibition featured the first long-distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current, which was generated 175 km away at Lauffen am Neckar. It successfully operated motors and lights at the fair. When the exhibition closed, the power station at Lauffen continued in operation, providing electricity for the administrative capital, Heilbronn, making it the first place to be equipped with three-phase AC power. Many corporate technical representatives (including E.W. Rice of Thomson-Houston Electric Company (what became General Electric)) attended.The Schenectady Museum, Schenectady, New York. The technical advisers and representatives were impressed. As a result of the successful field trial, three-phase current, as far as Germany was concerned, became the most economical means of transmitting electrical energy. The simplicity of polyphase generators and motors meant that besides their efficiency they could be manufactured cheaply, compactly and would require little attention to maintain. Simple economics would drive the expensive, bulky and mechanically complex DC dynamos to their ultimate extinction. As it turned out, the deciding factor in the war of the currents was the availability of low cost step up and step down transformers that meant that all customers regardless of their specialized voltage requirements could be served at minimal cost of conversion. This \\"universal system\\" is today regarded as one of the most influential innovations for the use of electricity. High voltage direct current transmission The case for alternating current was not clear at the turn of the century and high voltage direct current transmission systems were successfully installed without the benefit of transformers. Rene Thury, who had spent six months at Edison's Menlo Park facility, understood his problem with transmission and was convinced that moving electricity over great distances was possible using direct current. He was familiar with the work of Marcel Deprez, who did early work on high voltage transmission after being inspired by the capability of arc lamp generators to support lights over great distances. Deprez avoided transformers by placing generators and loads in series as arc lamp systems of Charles F. Brush did. Thury developed this idea into the first commercial system for high-voltage DC transmission. Like Brush's dynamos, current is kept constant, and when increasing load demands more pressure, voltage is increased. The Thury System was successfully used on several DC transmission projects from Hydro generators. The first in 1885 was a low voltage system in B√∂zingen, and the first high voltage system went into service in 1889 in Genoa, Italy, by the Acquedotto de Ferrari-Galliera company. This system transmitted 630 kW at 14 kV DC over a circuit 120 km long.ACW's Insulator Info ‚Äì Book Reference Info ‚Äì History of Electrical Systems and Cables The largest Thury System was the Lyon Moutiers project that was 230 km in length, eventually delivering 20 megawatts, at 125 kV. Victory for AC Ultimately, the versatility of the Thury system was hampered by the fragility of series distribution, and the lack of a reliable DC conversion technology that would not show up until the 1940s with improvements in mercury arc valves. The AC \\"universal system\\" won by force of numbers, proliferating systems with transformers both to couple generators to high-voltage transmission lines, and to connect transmission to local distribution circuits. By a suitable choice of utility frequency, both lighting and motor loads could be served. Rotary converters and later mercury-arc valves and other rectifier equipment allowed DC load to be served by local conversion where needed. Even generating stations and loads using different frequencies could also be interconnected using rotary converters. By using common generating plants for every type of load, important economies of scale were achieved, lower overall capital investment was required, load factor on each plant was increased allowing for higher efficiency, allowing for a lower cost of energy to the consumer and increased overall use of electric power. By allowing multiple generating plants to be interconnected over a wide area, electricity production cost was reduced. The most efficient available plants could be used to supply the varying loads during the day. Reliability was improved and capital investment cost was reduced, since stand-by generating capacity could be shared over many more customers and a wider geographic area. Remote and low-cost sources of energy, such as hydroelectric power or mine-mouth coal, could be exploited to lower energy production cost.Thomas P. Hughes, Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society 1880‚Äì1930, The Johns Hopkins University Press,Baltimore 1983 The first transmission of three-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in 1891 during the international electricity exhibition in Frankfurt. A 15 kV transmission line connected Lauffen on the Neckar and Frankfurt am Main, apart.Kiessling F, Nefzger P, Nolasco JF, Kaintzyk U (2003) Overhead power lines. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, p. 5 Willamette Falls to Niagara Falls In 1882, the German Miesbach‚ÄìMunich Power Transmission used 2kV DC over . In 1889, the first long-distance transmission of DC electricity in the United States was switched on at Willamette Falls Station, in Oregon City, Oregon. In 1890, a flood destroyed the power station. This unfortunate event paved the way for the first long-distance transmission of AC electricity in the world when Willamette Falls Electric company installed experimental AC generators from Westinghouse in 1890. That same year, the Niagara Falls Power Company (NFPC) and its subsidiary Cataract Company formed the International Niagara Commission composed of experts, to analyze proposals to harness Niagara Falls to generate electricity. The commission was led by Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and included Eleuth√®re Mascart from France, William Unwin from England, Coleman Sellers from the US, and Th√©odore Turrettini from Switzerland. It was backed by entrepreneurs such as J. P. Morgan, Lord Rothschild, and John Jacob Astor IV. Among 19 proposals, they even briefly considered compressed air as a power transmission medium, but preferred electricity. They could not decide which method would be best overall. By 1893 the Niagara Falls Power Company had rejected the remaining proposals from a half dozen companies and awarded the generating contract to Westinghouse with further transmission lines and transformer contracts awarded to General Electric. Work began in 1893 on the Niagara Falls generation project: 5,000 horsepower (3,700 kW) was to be generated and transmitted as alternating current, at a frequency of 25 Hz to minimize impedance losses in transmission (changed to 60 Hz in the 1950s). Some doubted that the system would generate enough electricity to power industry in Buffalo, New York. The inventor Nikola Tesla was sure it would work, saying that Niagara Falls could power the entire eastern United States. None of the previous polyphase alternating current transmission demonstration projects were on the scale of power available from Niagara. The first large scale hydroelectric generators in the USA were installed in 1895 at Niagara Falls and provided electricity to Buffalo, New York, via power transmission lines. A statue of Nikola Tesla stands today at Goat Island, Niagara Falls, New York, in tribute to his contributions. Westinghouse also had to develop a system based on rotary converters to allow them to supply all the needed power standards including single phase and polyphase AC and DC for street cars and factory motors. Westinghouse's initial customer for the hydroelectric generators at the Edward Dean Adams Station at Niagara in 1895 were the plants of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company which needed large quantities of cheap electricity for smelting aluminum. On November 16, 1896, electrical power transmitted to Buffalo began powering its street cars. The generating plants were built by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The scale of the project had General Electric also contributing, building transmission lines and equipment.Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair - A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2009, page 274 That same year Westinghouse and General Electric signed a patent sharing agreement, ending some 300 lawsuits the companies were involved in over their competing electrical patents, and giving them monopolistic control over the US electric power industry for years to come.Skrabec, Quentin R. (2007). George Westinghouse: Gentle Genius. New York: Algora Publishing, page 190 Initially transmission lines were supported by porcelain pin-and-sleeve insulators similar to those used for telegraphs and telephone lines. However, these had a practical limit of 40 kV. In 1907, the invention of the disc insulator by Harold W. Buck of the Niagara Falls Power Corporation and Edward M. Hewlett of General Electric allowed practical insulators of any length to be constructed for higher voltages. Early 20th century The first 110 kV transmission line in Europe was built around 1912 between Lauchhammer and Riesa, German Empire. Original pole. Voltages used for electric power transmission increased throughout the 20th century. The first \\"high voltage\\" AC power station, rated 4-MW 10-kV 85-Hz, was put into service in 1889 by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti at Deptford, London. The first electric power transmission line in North America operated at 4000 V. It went online on June 3, 1889, with the lines between the generating station at Willamette Falls in Oregon City, Oregon, and Chapman Square in downtown Portland, Oregon stretching about 13 miles. By 1914 fifty-five transmission systems operating at more than 70,000 V were in service, and the highest voltage then used was 150 kV.Bureau of Census data reprinted in Hughes, pp. 282‚Äì283 The first three-phase alternating current power transmission at 110 kV took place in 1907 between Croton and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Voltages of 100 kV and more were not established technology until around 5 years later, with for example the first 110 kV line in Europe between Lauchhammer and Riesa, Germany, in 1912. In the early 1920s the Pit River ‚Äì Cottonwood ‚Äì Vaca-Dixon line was built for 220 kV transporting power from hydroelectric plants in the Sierra Nevada to the San Francisco Bay Area, at the same time the Big Creek ‚Äì Los Angeles lines were upgraded to the same voltage. Both of those systems entered commercial service in 1923. On April 17, 1929 the first 220 kV line in Germany was completed, running from Brauweiler near Cologne, over Kelsterbach near Frankfurt, Rheinau near Mannheim, Ludwigsburg‚ÄìHoheneck near Austria. This line comprises the North- South interconnect, at the time one of the world's largest power systems. The masts of this line were designed for eventual upgrade to 380 kV. However the first transmission at 380 kV in Germany was on October 5, 1957 between the substations in Rommerskirchen and Ludwigsburg‚ÄìHoheneck. The world's first 380 kV power line was built in Sweden, the 952 km Harspr√•nget ‚Äì Hallsberg line in 1952. In 1965, the first extra-high-voltage transmission at 735 kV took place on a Hydro-Qu√©bec transmission line. In 1982 the first transmission at 1200 kV was in the Soviet Union. The rapid industrialization in the 20th century made electrical transmission lines and grids a critical part of the economic infrastructure in most industrialized nations. Interconnection of local generation plants and small distribution networks was greatly spurred by the requirements of World War I, where large electrical generating plants were built by governments to provide power to munitions factories; later these plants were connected to supply civil load through long-distance transmission.Hughes, pp. 293‚Äì295 Small municipal electrical utilities did not necessarily desire to reduce the cost of each unit of electricity sold; to some extent, especially during the period 1880‚Äì1890, electrical lighting was considered a luxury product and electric power was not substituted for steam power. Engineers such as Samuel Insull in the United States and Sebastian Z. De Ferranti in the United Kingdom were instrumental in overcoming technical, economic, regulatory and political difficulties in development of long- distance electric power transmission. By introduction of electric power transmission networks, in the city of London the cost of a kilowatt-hour was reduced to one-third in a ten-year period.Hughes pp. ? In 1926 electrical networks in the United Kingdom began to be interconnected in the National Grid, initially operating at 132 kV. Power electronics Power electronics is the application of solid-state electronics to the control and conversion of electric power. Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier. Invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902, it was used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid-controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Uno Lamm developed a mercury valve with grading electrodes making them suitable for high voltage direct current power transmission. In 1933 selenium rectifiers were invented. Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field-effect transistor in 1926, but it was not possible to actually construct a working device at that time. In 1947, the bipolar point- contact transistor was invented by Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen under the direction of William Shockley at Bell Labs. In 1948, Shockley's invention of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) improved the stability and performance of transistors, and reduced costs. By the 1950s, higher power semiconductor diodes became available and started replacing vacuum tubes. In 1956, the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) was introduced by General Electric, greatly increasing the range of power electronics applications. A breakthrough in power electronics came with the invention of the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. Generations of MOSFET transistors enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors. In 1969, Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET, which would later be known as the VMOS (V-groove MOSFET). The power MOSFET has since become the most common power device in the world, due to its low gate drive power, fast switching speed, easy advanced paralleling capability, wide bandwidth, ruggedness, easy drive, simple biasing, ease of application, and ease of repair.

Traditional In Western societies of the 19th and early 20th centuries, a hat tip was a common non-verbal greeting between friends or acquaintances while walking or meeting at a social gathering. Typically, two men (female hat tipping was rare) would lift or tip their hats to each other, rather than exchange words of greeting. Where the ritual was used to emphasize social distance, the subordinate was obliged to make the more elaborate gesture, for example fully removing his hat while the superior merely touched his. The military hand salute is thought to have originated as a stylized hat tip; while the civilian may return a salute via a hat tip.Oretha D. Swartz, Service Etiquett (1988) p. 473 In its modern use, the hat tip has been replaced by the nod as a manner of respect. If one man gives another the nod, he should return in kind with either the casual nod up or the formal nod down. Erving Goffman emphasized the role of hat-tipping as a means of closing encounters between male and female, and restoring both parties thereby to a state of civil inattention.Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (1972) p. 121 He also suggested that the hat tip was used for greeting a stranger, whereas the equivalent greeting for an acquaintance was the bow.Goffman, p. 121n In Desmond Morris's terms, the hat tip is a modification of a (symbolic) submissive posture‚Äîlowering the body height by removing the hatDesmond Morris, The Naked Ape Trilogy (1994) p. 110‚Äîa \\"token token\\".Desmond Morris, Manwatching (1987) p. 144 Metaphor In 1929, syndicated cartoonist Jimmy Hatlo started thanking readers who suggested a funny idea for a strip with the phrase \\"Thanx and a tip of the Hatlo hat to [name]\\" at the bottom of his comic strip panel They'll Do It Every Time. He continued drawing the hat tip box in the strip until his death in 1963. In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the government banned hat tipping toward Jews and other courtesies that became popular as protests against the occupation by Nazi Germany. In the 2000s, the term \\"hat tip\\" (often abbreviated to \\"HT\\", \\"H/T\\" or \\"h/t\\") rose to prominence in the blogosphere to acknowledge someone who has made a significant contribution toward an effort, or someone who drew attention to something new or interesting. It is considered good netiquette when sharing a link or news item to give a hat tip to the person from whom you learned of the item. The on-line versions of the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times regularly give hat tips to users who bring ideas for articles to their attention.

Traditionally included in the family Sterculiaceae, it is included in the expanded Malvaceae in the APG and most subsequent systematics. Description Trochetia parviflora is a much-branched low shrub which can reach a height up to four metres. The bark has a lepidote brown pubescence which is much thinner than in Trochetia uniflora and Trochetia triflora. On the branches fruits are placed in a group of three. The oblong and entire leaves have a length between 2.5 and 3.8 centimetres. The leaf base is rather rounded. The upperside of the leaf is obtused and scabrous, the underside is thinly scurfy. Status In the past Trochetia parviflora was known from the forest at Montagne-Ory. After botanist Philip Burnard Ayres collected the last known specimens in 1863 it was long regarded as lost until 76 individuals were rediscovered in April 2001 by the Mauritian botanists Vincent Florens and Jean-Claude Sevathian, from the Mauritius Herbarium, on a rocky slope of the Corps de Garde six kilometres apart from the type locality. It was assumed that this species has reduced its original range due to competition with invasive alien plants and seed predation by invasive monkeys and rats. Today the biggest threats are wildfire and landslides.  References  *J.G. Baker: Flora of Mauritius and the Seychelles: A Description of the Flowering Plants. Asian Educational Services, 1999.

The screenplay was adapted from a 2001 Spanish thriller film, Intacto. The leading roles were played by Mithun Chakraborty, debutant Shruti Haasan, Imran Khan and Sanjay Dutt; the other significant parts, and fellow members of the gang were played by Danny Denzongpa, Ravi Kishan and Chitrashi Rawat. The camera of the film was handled by Santosh Thundiyil, whilst composer duo Salim‚ÄìSulaiman recorded the musical score. The film released to Indian audiences on 24 July 2009.  Plot  Luck is the story of gambling kingpin Karim Musa (Sanjay Dutt), who is a very lucky person seeing the story of his life. He remained the sole survivor when a mosque collapsed in Maharashtra when he was just a child of nine months and was amongst very few survivors of another incident at the age of 12. When he was 14, he challenged three friends to jump from a four-storied building and remained alive, though with some injuries, and won. He started gambling at 19 and since then tried out his luck in different places of the world and became known as Musa Bhai. To him gambling and drug smuggling have become old ways to get money, his latest interest is investment on people's luck. Ram Mehra (Imran Khan) the banker, is abducted by Lakhan Tamang (Danny Denzongpa), but instead of taking, he gives Ram hundred thousand rupees and explains that Ram is very lucky as Tamang bought lottery tickets for two years without any success until he took tickets from Ram both of which won him two hundred thousand rupees. He then offers Ram 200 million rupees for which Ram has to gamble with him for 20 days. After Ram agrees, Musa Bhai and Tamang create a game, getting people with luck to play, and the luckiest ones win them money. Later, along with Ram, Tamang hires Major Lucky (Mithun Chakrabarty), who is a soldier as lucky once as he fought in battles and faced numerous bullets yet none that could kill him. He is in need of money for the operation of his wife Sheila (Roopa Ganguly). Tamang then visits Pakistan where he discovers Shortcut (Chitrashi Rawat), a 16-year-old girl, who is also known to be lucky as any camel she rides wins the race and observes her winning one despite her camel's half-broken leg. Tamang pays four lakh rupees to \\"export\\" her to South Africa. Tamang then invites the sole-criminal, Raghav Raghuvaran (Ravi Kishan) to the game. Raghav was put in Tihar Jail for raping many women, and also killing them, but when he was hanged, he survived, and since the Indian law doesn't allow one person to be hanged twice, he is freed from Tihar Jail. All competitors arrive in Cape Town. There, Ram meets a girl (Shruti Haasan), whose name is later revealed to be Ayesha and Tamang says she took part in the game once before. In their first game, all competitors shoot the person to their right at the same time with a pistol. Some pistols have a bullet, some don‚Äôt and all the unlucky ones die, and the lucky ones survive. Later that night, while everyone is eating at a dining table, Ram and Major Jabbar Pratap befriend each other and Raghav goes to Ayesha's room, and starts flirting with her, though Ayesha pays no attention and leaves. The second game is where all of the contestants take parachutes and jump off from a helicopter. Some parachutes open while others don't. Among the unlucky is Ayesha whose parachute doesn't open but she is saved by Ram (whose parachute opens) since he has developed a liking towards her, and afterwards, they start getting closer. In the third game, everyone is left in a hollow tank with one of everyone's hand locked with handcuffs and in front of them are 300 keys and one each will open the handcuffs and added to their trouble are the sharks that swim around them as they start opening the handcuffs as the tank sinks. Ram, Ayesha, Raghav and Major Pratap survive but Shortcut is attacked by a shark. The shark bites her leg off, and Ram jumps into the water, and saves the wounded Shortcut (who is then taken to the hospital). Later on, it is revealed that due to her leg, Shortcut will not be taking part in any of the games any more. Before the fourth and final game, Raghav tries to rape and kill Ayesha, but the latter is saved by Ram who fights Raghav. Ayesha then runs away to Musa and Tamang, where it is revealed that Ayesha is dead and it is Natasha (her twin-sister) playing, taking Ayesha's character whilst seeking revenge on Musa, for her sister's death. But Musa finds out about this, and uses her for the final game. In the final game, Ram, on whom the bid is the highest ever, has to save Natasha before the train she's tied to hits an oil tanker while Major Singh will help him and Raghav will shoot at Ram and the other survivors try to stop Ram. On the train, Ram starts to fight Raghav, but once Raghav is knocked out on the floor, Ram goes to save Natasha, but Raghav gets up, then interrupted by Major Singh, who to save Natasha and Ram, jumps onto Raghav. However, Raghav pushes Major Singh down to the back of the train, which later explodes. Raghav then goes to Ram, who is currently untying Natasha's hands, though Raghav attacks Ram from the back, but when the oil tank reaches right in front of the train, Ram and Natasha jump off, and Raghav dies. When Ram and Natasha realise what has happened, before they lose hope, Major Singh is seen on the floor getting up, who explains that he jumped off the train a second before his side of the train exploded. The three survivors are then approached by Musa and Tamang, who claim that they won the game and claim two hundred million rupees each. In the climax, Ram stakes his reward and challenges Musa to a game where two pistols are dug in coal the train's carrying and one has to find one and shoot the other. Musa finds both but hands one to Ram and both shoot at the same time and hit each other, Ram is shot at the place of his heart and Musa survives as he is hit at his shoulder. Though, it is shown that Ram's heart is at his right side (dextrocardia), very rare for a human, rather than left and he survives and wins back his reward. Later, Shortcut's leg is fixed by a prosthesis, Major Singh saves his wife and maintains his title \\"Lucky Major Jawar Pratap Singh\\" and Ram frees him and his mother off the debts and marries Natasha.

As the name suggests, this is a practice whereby the last verse of a hymn tune will be accompanied on the organ with an alternative harmony supporting the melody, which remains unchanged. If the congregation is led by a choir, then the choir will usually sing in unison during the last verse, as opposed to in parts (usually SATB) for the other verses, and the trebles (boy sopranos) or sopranos (or occasionally tenors) may sing a descant. The purpose of last verse harmonisation is to add interest, variation and excitement to a hymn tune. Organists recommend it as a technique which encourages the congregation to sing. More experienced organists with a greater understanding of harmony will usually improvise the last verse, whereas beginners are likely to use harmonisations that have either been included in the hymnal, or published in a collection of harmonisations. When a descant is sung, the organist must either keep to the original harmony, or use an alternative one that has been written specifically for use in conjunction with the descant, as the melody of the descant may not sound right with other harmonies. Characteristics Usually the organ accompaniment to the last verse of a hymn tune will be heavier (in musical terms) than the standard harmony. Typically it will include lower or more profound bass notes, which will almost certainly be played on the pedalboard, and more frequent use of secondary dominants, particularly over chromatic movement in the bass. Often there are more notes in each chord‚Äîoften five or more as opposed to four or fewer in the SATB arrangement. Occasionally the harmony will differ entirely from the standard arrangement in places, giving the melody completely different effect. A notable example is the harmonisation of the seventh verse of the famous hymn tune \\"Adeste Fideles\\", as published in Carols for Choirs by Sir David Willcocks. This opens with the organ playing the melody in unison at three pitches (each an octave apart; the lowest played on the pedalboard), which is another popular technique of last verse harmonisation. Performance Experienced organists will usually vary their use of stops throughout a hymn tune, but most change them for the last verse. They will usually pull out stops that emphasise the bassline, or that are particularly loud, rich or harsh sounding. If the organ has a tuba stop, then this will often be used with the pedalboard, as it provides the loudest bass notes on the organ, and reeds are also useful (if available). Sometimes hymnals and other compilations of tunes (such as Carols for Choirs) that publish last verse harmonisations will indicate suitable stops to be pulled out for them, but organists are generally assumed to know the instrument well enough to discern for themselves which stops to use. The popular expression \\"pull out all the stops\\" originates from organ music (especially hymn accompaniment), and this technique is indeed occasionally used, the effect being known as the Full Organ. However, in practice, it is unusual for all stops on a pipe organ to be drawn together (except on smaller instruments) as some stops (generically called 'celestes') are tuned slightly sharp or flat, and will not complement the 'Full Organ'. Furthermore, the quietest stops will be inaudible if drawn but will still use wind from the reservoir, increasing the risk of an anticlimax inducing drop in the overall wind pressure (and therefore the sounding pitch of the instrument).

As general music, tabanka characterizes by having an allegro, a binary compass, and traditionally being melodic only. In its traditional form, its structure song-responst, in which a singer mainly chants a verse that are repeated in unison by other singers. It is rhythmically done with drums and other instruments including whistlers and conches. Rhythmically there are four variants of tabanca including tabancas of V√°rzea, Achada Grande, Achada de Santo Ant√≥nio (three neighborhoods of the city of Praia) and Ch√£ de Tanque in Santa Catarina Tabanka today have been composed in other forms by recent composers and musicians. History Museu da Tabanka in Assomada The word \\"tabanka\\" existed in Portuguese texts in around the 16th century. The word was likely originated from some of the African languages, mainly the westernmost part of West Africa, that time, it was used to build and design fortifications by Portuguese navigators in the coast of Guinea (now roughly Guinea-Bissau) in the Guinea-Bissau Creole, the word \\"tabanka\\" or \\"tabanca\\" means \\"locality\\" or \\"neighbourhood\\", in Cape Verde, it achieved a different significance. The origin of tabanka is unknown, Semedo and Turano,Semedo and Turano, p. 153 one of the hypotheses for the rise of tabanka into the definition in the 18th century. Although tabanka was hostile by the Administration (due to the uprising by the slaves) and the church (not very \\"catholic\\") in the early years. In 1896, tabanka became prohibited in Praia by the colonial governor Serpa Pinto. Performance was banned in urban centers and the genre was slowly disappearing. The ban lasted until Cape Verdean independence. Along with funan√° and batuque, tabanka was a symbol for the struggle for Cape Verdean independence. Afterwards there were attempts to revive several Cape Verdean music styles. It did not met the success of the revival of funan√° in the 1980s or batuque in the start of this century. Significance With a cultural manifecation, tabanca goes much beyond as a simple music genre. There are also a number of other activities which it is associated. Although it also exists on the island of Maio, a tabanka more popular than the Santiago one. Its tabanka festivities mainly starts on May 3, and are held on the holy days from May to July. Second Pedro CardosoCardoso, P. Folclore Caboverdiano, 1933 , the tabanka is also an association of mutual aid. That association gives with a certain quote. The association helps in costs. The Museu da Tabanka (Tabanka Museum) in Assomada in the middle of Santiago Island features about its music style. Another Museu da Tabanka is located in the tabanka commonplace of Ch√£o de Tanque.

They do everything together, including swimming in a local creek. However, they cannot do the same in the town pool because blacks are not allowed to use the public swimming pool. Joe is then told that a law has been passed that blacks can do everything that whites can do. He is really excited because this means that he can go to the town pool tomorrow with John Henry. The boys are more excited than ever but when they arrive at the town pool the following day, they are shocked to find that the town pool has been closed. The pool has been filled with black sticky tar as the white people in their community chose to close down the entire pool instead of facing the prospect of sharing it with their black neighbors. While the laws of the nation of changed, it becomes clear to the boys that attitudes and ideas about race will take longer to evolve. The boys are disappointed but the book ends with a glimmer of hope as the two friends are able to enter a grocery store together that was previously for whites only.

The cause is unknown. In 2015 a study came to the conclusion that: \\"Canine epileptoid cramping syndrome in Border Terrier's is a gluten- sensitive movement disorder triggered and perpetuated by gluten and thus responsive to a gluten-free diet.\\" Symptoms CECS can first occur at any age between a few months and 7 years. Symptoms include: * cramping (often followed by exaggerated stretching) * staggering * trembling * dizziness * unusually slow or methodical walking * borborygmus and/or intestinal cramping * muscle contractions Dogs typically remain alert and responsive during episodes that can last from a few seconds to several minutes. In some dogs, one or two episodes are seen followed by long-term or permanent remission. In others, episodes may be frequent or progressive in frequency and duration. Cause As of 2008, the mode of inheritance has not been determined.CECS History Diagnosis The neurological symptoms CECS are of a paroxysmal dyskinesia, which is a type of movement disorder. This type of movement disorder can be difficult to differentiate from epilepsy, with the main difference being that, unlike during an epileptic seizure, there is no impairment of the consciousness during an episode of CECS. Between episodes of CECS, the dog has normal movement. Treatment Gluten free diet is an effective treatment for CECS. Other diets and some drugs might also help with some of the symptoms. =Drugs= Diazepam and Clorazepate Dipotassium have been used successfully to alleviate cramping in some cases, but have also failed to help in other cases. Scopolamine (Buscopan) rectal suppositories or injections and Gaviscon have been used to alleviate intestinal symptoms.CECS Treatment/Control =Diet= Some owners have had varying levels of success with dietary changes. In most cases, a gluten-free and/or raw diet is recommended, while some recommend avoiding dairy, eggs, soy, beef, corn, rice, and artificial flavours and colours. Other owners report success with commercial hypoallergenic formula feeds. History In 1994 an later on Diana Plange, a German veterinarian and Border Terrier Breeder (Malepartus) received several phone calls from anxious Border Terrier owners whose dogs Ms. Plange had bred. They were observing epileptic-like problems in their dogs. However, many of the presentations did not fit the classic form of epilepsy. So after taking a further health survey, she decided to give up on her own breeding program and started working to find the cause of this condition, which was epileptoid in character. Ms. Plange arranged to have more than 100 Border Terriers examined thoroughly in her own surgery as well as in specialists' clinics. Many of the affected dogs showed abnormal liver function which resulted in much of the early focus implicating hepatic disorders as the cause of the newly discovered disease. However, after the number of symptomatic dogs with apparently normal livers increased, the concentration shifted to diet in early 1999, as through thorough investigation she found that the symptoms were responding to a nutritional change. It soon became clear that the condition must have a genetic (hereditary) background. Ms. Plange wrote some articles discussing this disorder which were placed on her web site and published in different European dog magazines, as well as some veterinary magazines. As a result, there were more responses from Border Terrier owners and some veterinarians who felt their dogs were exhibiting these symptoms, not only from Germany and other parts of Europe, but from all over the world as well. Samples of liver tissues, blood and urine were sent to several laboratories including the U.S. Thereupon, a worldwide cooperation among interested scientist started, and quite a number of people were involved. It was Erica Jabroer-ter L√º√ºn from the Netherlands who stepped in at an early stage of Mrs. Plange\`s investigations and in an enormous effort not only built up what can easily be recognized as the best Border Terrier database worldwide, but together with Mrs. Plange, coordinated research at several European universities. Ms. Plange came to the U.S. Border Terrier list in early 1999 inquiring about the BT's in America and asking if any dogs had unusual epileptic-like symptoms, because a number of suspected carriers were imported from GB to the USA. Ms. Kris Blake contacted Ms. Plange and found that the symptoms of her dog ‚ÄòBreaker‚Äô were identical to those of the dogs in Germany and that his pedigree contained dogs who also suffered from the disorder. Then, with Kris Blake struggling with this unusual medical problem in her dog, the problem became recognized in the United States, too. In 1996, Joke Miedema, a Dutch Border Terrier owner, acquired a puppy named Roughmoor Blue Spike (known as Spike). About a year later, the dog began exhibiting strange symptoms, starting with apparent absentness and occasional staggering. In 2000, Spike began exhibiting more severe symptoms including cramping and epileptic-like fits; tests performed at Utrecht University in 2002 were Prof Rothuizen already had examined Border Terriers from Germany, determined that the dog did not have epilepsy. By the end of 2001, Spike was having 2‚Äì3 epileptoid episodes per week. Owners of cramping dogs began to connect via Internet groups, including a support group started by Miedema; the condition came to be known in NL as \\"Spike's Disease.\\" In science it is customary for the person who first described a condition to also give it a name. So in the spring of 2003 Diana Plange decided to give the condition a descriptive name: Canine Epileptoid Cramping Syndrome.

He is remembered chiefly for his command of HMS Little Belt, when the Little Belt affair occurred, just prior to the War of 1812. Family and early life Bingham was born in 1784, the second son of the Ven. William Bingham, D.D. (1743‚Äì1819), vicar of Great Gaddesden (1777) and rector of Hemel Hempstead (1778) ‚Äì later archdeacon of London (1789‚Äì1813) and chaplain to George III (1792); and his wife Agnata (aka Agnes), daughter of Liebert D√∂rrien, a merchant of Fenchurch Street, London and of West Ham, Essex.Burke's DictionaryBurke, Sir Bernard: A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Colonial Gentry (in 2 volumes), Vol I, London: Harrison & Sons, 59 Pall Mall, 1891, p. 9Barker, G.

The Record of Old Westminsters, London: Chiswick Press, 1928, p. 90National Archives: Will of Libert Dorrien, Merchant of Fenchurch Street, City of London 3 November 1753 PROB 11/804 Arthur entered the Navy, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 1 May 1804. By early 1809 he was first lieutenant aboard HMS Nereide, then on the Cape of Good Hope Station under Captain Robert Corbett.Marshall's Naval Biography Lieutenant of the Nereide Nereide sailed from Simon's Bay on 1 May and cruised off the French possessions of Mauritius and R√©union. In August Corbett began an attack on Sainte-Rose on the eastern side of R√©union, using grapeshot to fire on two batteries overlooking the harbour. The sloop HMS Sapphire, under the command of Acting-Captain Bertie Cornelius Cator, came alongside and fired a broadside, silencing the enemy guns. Bingham then led a party of men from Nereide onto the shore, narrowly avoiding being killed by a piece of shot that killed the marine next to him. He and his men captured the French governor, spiked the six French cannon, burnt their carriages and blew up a store of rockets. He then laid a train of powder to blow up over 100 barrels of gunpowder contained in a bomb- proof magazine, but it exploded sooner than expected. Bingham was blown 'a considerable distance', and suffered some wounds and burns. Corbett made a list of demands from the French for re-provisioning, and then took off the enemy's guns and sank them in deep water. After the successful conclusion of the operation Corbett wrote reports praising Cator and Bingham. Bingham was again in action off R√©union, when Nereide was part of Josias Rowley's fleet to retake the French islands. Bingham led the action to capture the French frigate Caroline, and later presented her commander's sword to Corbett. His talent noticed, Bingham was given command of HMS Caledon at the end of 1809 and sailed her to England. Commander of Little Belt By November 1810 Bingham was given the command of the 20-gun sixth-rate sloop Little Belt, and sailed to Halifax, and later to the Caribbean. On 19 April 1811 he was ordered by Rear-Admiral Herbert Sawyer to deliver instructions to Captain Samuel Pechell of HMS Guerriere, then somewhere off the North American coast. If unable to locate Pechell, Bingham was ordered to cruise off the coast, protecting British trade until his supplies were exhausted, at which point he was to put into Halifax and await further orders. He was warned > You are to be particularly careful, not to give any just cause of offence to > the government or the subjects of the United States of America... Bingham duly sailed from Bermuda, but being unable to locate the Guerriere, commenced cruising off the coast. =The Little Belt affair= On the morning of 10 May, as Little Belt was some 48 miles east of Cape Charles at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, a strange sail was sighted in the distance. Bingham made signal 275 (calling on a strange ship, if a British warship, to show her number). The other ship did not reply, and Bingham concluded that the mystery ship was a frigate of the United States Navy. He hoisted his colours and began to round Cape Hatteras.Ships of the Old Navy The frigate followed, closing Little Belt, and appeared to be trying to manoeuvre into a position to rake the smaller British ship. Bingham wore ship three times to foil the American's attempts, while calling for the frigate to identify herself. Each time though the American demanded the same of Bingham. The frigate, actually the 44-gun USS President under Commodore John Rodgers, then, according to Bingham, opened fire on the Little Belt. Bingham returned fire and an engagement began, lasting three-quarters of an hour. The President was observed to have a fire onboard and drew away. The 'Little Belt affair'. HMS Little Belt and USS President exchange fire The President then returned, and asked if Bingham had struck. Bingham replied that he had not, and the President again withdrew. A messenger was sent out to the damaged Little Belt by Rodgers the following morning, lamenting the 'unfortunate affair', and insisting that he would not have attacked, had Little Belt not fired first. Bingham denied this, and turned down Rodgers' offer of putting into an American port for repairs, instead making for Halifax, hampered by a gale on the second day of the voyage which caused leaks in the already-damaged ship. Little Belt had nine killed outright, and had 23 wounded, some mortally. Two died the day after the battle. Rodgers claimed that the British ship had been mistaken for a larger frigate, and continued to claim that Bingham had fired first. Bingham wrote in his report > \\"a boat accordingly came, with an officer, and a message from Commodore > Rodgers, of the President, United States frigate, to say, that he lamented > much the unfortunate affair (as he termed it) that had happened, and that > had he known our force was so inferior, he should not have fired at me. I > asked his motive for having fired at all; his reply was, that we fired the > first gun at him, which was positively not the case...[it is not] probable > that a sloop of war, within pistol-shot of a large 44-gun frigate, should > commence hostilities. The Little Belt was later paid off and sold. The Admiralty refused to try Bingham by court-martial, and the matter was never successfully concluded, both governments supporting their respective captains' version of events. Bingham was promoted to post captain on 7 February 1812. Later life In 1812 the Duke of Clarence (the future King William IV) arranged for Bingham to be esquire to the proxy at the installation of Richard Goodwin Keats to the Order of the Bath. Bingham continued in the Navy, being appointed to command HMS Myrtle on 18 November 1813, followed by being made flag captain to Rear- Admiral Robert Otway aboard HMS Dover on 25 September 1819. He was appointed to HMS Thetis on 9 November 1826. He drowned in 1830. On 20 August 1830, the Thetis was anchored off Puna Island (Ecuador). Captain Bingham chose to go ashore to Guayaquil. During transit, the barge was swamped resulting in the deaths of the ship's chaplain and Captain Bingham. Family Bingham had married Emily Kingsman on 11 March 1813, and the couple had four sons and daughter. Two, Arthur Maunsel Bingham and Thomas Henry Bingham also had naval careers, whilst the third son, William Poulet Bingham became a lieutenant- colonel of the 64th Regiment. The fourth son was Francis Robert Bertie Bingham, and the daughter was Emily Agnata Harriet Bingham.

Career Clarke started working in the music industry by cutting dub plates.Larkin, Colin (1998), The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, . He made his debut as a producer in 1972, with U-Roy's \\"The Higher The Mountain\\".Thompson, Dave (2002), Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, . He established himself as the top producer of deejays in the early 1970s with albums such as Big Youth's Screaming Target, and I-Roy's Presenting I Roy, both regarded as among the best deejay albums ever produced.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004), The Rough Guide to Reggae, Rough Guides, . Through the 1970s and early 1980s he worked with artists such as Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Augustus Pablo, Leroy Smart, and The Mighty Diamonds, including on the latter's influential \\"Pass the Kouchie\\" in 1981. Much of Clarke's output was released on his own Gussy and Puppy labels. In the late 1980s, Clarke adapted to the new dancehall style of reggae, but stood out from other producers by attempting to produce glossier recordings with greater potential to cross over internationally. In 1987, while he was still recording at Music Mountain and Dynamic Sounds studio, the first record to bear hints of this newly embraced digital sound came from the release of The Mighty Diamonds' The Real Enemy. \\"Gang War\\", the first single off the album, released on his Music Works label, showcased this new digi-roots style, incorporating keyboard and computer programming driven riddims, compared to the known traditional roots reggae sound with players of live instruments recording in the studio. This release stood out as the first transitional record for Clarke and his production blending old-school roots reggae with digital riddims. In 1988 he launched his Music Works studio, equipped and ready to fully adopt the digital reggae era, successfully as a producer returned with hit records and singles for many Jamaican and UK artists. By mid-year, the first full-length albums to showcase this style were released ‚Äî The Mighty Diamonds' Get Ready and Gregory Isaacs' Red Rose For Gregory. The latter of the two included the successful \\"Rumours\\", the biggest hit on the island during the summer of 1988. J.C Lodge's \\"Telephone Love\\", using the same \\"Rumours\\" riddim, was the biggest reggae hit of the same year in the United States. This hit single led to Clarke producing a full-length album for Lodge in 1990 titled Selfish Lover, which saw her team up with Shabba Ranks on the duet \\"Hardcore Loving\\", and later again with Shabba Ranks on \\"Telephone Love Deh Pond Mi Mind\\" on his album Rappin' With The Ladies. In 1989 Clarke reunited two of the most influential reggae artists, Dennis Brown and Gregory Isaacs, to record a full- length studio album titled No Contest, which included \\"Big All Around\\", and followed it with similar \\"pairings\\" involving Home T, Cocoa Tea & Shabba Ranks. Clarke produced the digi-roots album Legit for Freddie McGregor, Dennis Brown and Cocoa Tea, which was released several years later. He also produced UK artist Deborahe Glasgow's self-titled album, which included \\"Champion Lover\\", which later formed the basis for Shabba Ranks' \\"Mr. Loverman\\". UK artist Maxi Priest's \\"Just A Little Bit Longer\\" became an international hit, as was Shabba Ranks & Krystal's \\"Twice My Age\\". Many of Clarke's releases were issued on his own record labels Anchor and Music Works, as well on the Greensleeves, VP, Pow Wow and Shanachie labels. In the mid-1990s, he predominantly released albums on the Gone Clear Distribution label for newcomer artists such as Daddy Rings, Sasha, Dean Fraser, and with The Mighty Diamonds (Stand Up). Some of Clarke's mid- to late '90s releases were still licensed to record labels such as Ambassador Music, Greensleeves and VP Records. Soon after his final produced full-length album for the late Dennis Brown, titled Stone Cold World in 1999 for VP Records, Clarke's productions quietened, with the occasional one-off single or re-issue compilation formats of previously released material re-sequenced and repackaged. Into the late 1990s Clarke working with artists such as Tiger, Lady G, Papa San, Cocoa Tea, Freddie McGregor, Maxi Priest, Aswad and Courtney Pine. In 2006, Clarke produced the one-riddim compilation album Consuming Fire for VP Records' Riddim Driven series. The same year saw him as co-producer for Rihanna's \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" from her Girl Like Me album.

The book explores the themes of sexual passion and of lust, sometimes unbridled and morbid. The novel was published in 1955, a year after the author's death. Its publication was authorized in a note that Brancati penned two days before his passing, in which he explained that the planned two final chapters of the novel had not been written.

Also known as Great Seneca Highway, the highway runs from MD 28 in Rockville north to Middlebrook Road in Germantown. MD 119 is a four- to six-lane divided highway that connects several residential and commercial neighborhoods in Rockville, Gaithersburg, and Germantown. Great Seneca Highway was planned by Montgomery County in the late 1960s as a local relief route for traffic on parallel Interstate 270 (I-270) between the three communities. By the early 1980s, the highway had become controversial because it was proposed to pass through Seneca Creek State Park. A coalition of civic and environmental groups unsuccessfully pursued litigation to stop the highway. The National Park Service refused permission for the county to build the highway in 1985 but reversed itself two years later, by which time the first segment of the highway in Germantown was nearing completion. The Rockville-Gaithersburg section was completed in 1989 and the controversial segment through the state park was finished in 1990. Almost all of Great Seneca Highway became MD 119 in 1999. Route description View north along MD 119 in Gaithersburg MD 119 begins at an intersection with MD 28 (Key West Avenue) in an unincorporated area west of the city of Rockville. Great Seneca Highway continues south as a county highway to Darnestown Road and provides access to Shady Grove Adventist Hospital, the Universities at Shady Grove, and the Montgomery County campus of Johns Hopkins University. MD 119 heads northwest as a four-lane divided highway. The highway crosses over Shady Branch twice around its intersection with Sam Eig Highway, a county highway that connects MD 119 with I-370, I-270, MD 200, and the Shady Grove station along Washington Metro's Red Line. At the county highway, MD 119 enters the city of Gaithersburg and temporarily expands to six lanes until its intersection with Muddy Branch Road. The highway crosses Muddy Branch and passes along the edge of the New Urbanist community of Kentlands before intersecting MD 124 (Quince Orchard Road). MD 119 leaves the city of Gaithersburg and passes through Seneca Creek State Park. The highway does not provide access to the state park; the only park road the highway meets, Deer Ridge Road, passes over the state highway. Within the park, MD 119 crosses Long Draught Branch and Great Seneca Creek. On the western edge of the park, the state highway passes a Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission water treatment facility and enters the unincorporated suburb of Germantown. MD 119 curves north as it intersects Richter Farm Road and passes Northwest High School. The highway crosses Gunners Branch and intersects MD 117 (Clopper Road). MD 119 curves northeast to cross CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision, which carries MARC's Brunswick Line. The highway curves back north and intersects Wisteria Drive before reaching its northern terminus at Middlebrook Road next to Seneca Valley High School. Middlebrook Road is a county highway that provides access to MD 118 and the Germantown MARC station to the west and I-270 and MD 355 to the east. MD 119 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. History Great Seneca Highway was proposed by Montgomery County in the late 1960s to relieve congestion along the I-270 corridor and provide a crucial link between Germantown and Rockville. By the early 1980s, a coalition of civic and environmental groups came together to oppose construction of Great Seneca Highway through Seneca Creek State Park, which was part of a nature preserve along the corridor of Great Seneca Creek. Montgomery County approved the route through the park on its master plan in 1976. Despite less disruptive alternate routes being identified, the county chose to advance the routing that would be most disruptive to the state park when it put together the project's environmental impact statement in 1983. The civic and environmental groups filed a lawsuit aiming to block construction of the highway in 1984. The groups achieved a victory in July 1985 when the National Park Service rejected Montgomery County's proposed routing for the highway in favor of widening existing routes through the nature preserve. However, in June 1987, the National Park Service reversed its ruling after Montgomery County agreed to build noise barriers and wildlife crossings and purchase land to compensate for the woods lost to construction of the highway. By this time, parts of the highway were under construction in Rockville and Germantown. The first segment of the highway, from Middlebrook Road south to MD 117, opened in August 1987. The second segment to open was from Darnestown Road, then part of MD 28, north to MD 124; this southern segment was open by April 1989. The coalition of civic and environmental groups filed another lawsuit in March 1988 seeking to block construction of the middle segment from MD 124 to MD 117, but the lawsuit was dismissed on appeal in April 1989. Montgomery County began construction on the middle section in 1988 while the lawsuit was working its way through the courts because they were confident of prevailing. Great Seneca Highway fully opened when the middle section was completed in June 1990. In 1999, Great Seneca Highway north of MD 28 was designated MD 119 as part of a state-county maintenance swap in which 22 state highways were transferred to Montgomery County maintenance.

Usually, this proposal takes the form of an independent Scottish republic, but it is also occasionally found in discussions of changing the system of government of the United Kingdom as a whole in such a manner as to include an elected official as head of state.  History  Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun is one of the most prominent pre-Union advocates of a Scottish republic, based on agrarian and patriarchal principles. He was a major inspiration to Scottish Enlightenment philosopher Adam Ferguson, whose republican ideals were penned down in An Essay on the History of Civil Society (1767). One of the foremost documentations of modern Scottish republicanism is the Declaration of Calton Hill, proclaimed on 9 October 2004, the same day that queen Elizabeth II opened the new Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood. In the run-up to the 2014 independence referendum, the Radical Independence Campaign advocated an independent Scottish republic with an elected head of state, instead of the continued union of crowns established with the English monarchy, predating the Acts of Union.  Republicanism within the independence movement  Many people who advocate Scotland becoming a republic do so through their support for Scottish independence. This would entail Scotland becoming independent from the United Kingdom and instead of continuing the Union of Crowns that predate the political union, a republic would be formed, with an elected president assuming the role of the deposited monarch. Most of the major political parties and organisations that advocate Scottish independence also advocate Scotland becoming an independent republic. These include: * Scottish Green Party * Scottish Socialist Party * Scottish Republican Socialist Movement * Solidarity * Radical Independence Campaign * RISE Scotland's largest pro-independence party, the Scottish National Party, favours retaining the UK monarchy in an independent Scotland, although the party has a number of republican members, including Roseanna Cunningham, Christine Grahame, Chris Stephens and Rob Gibson.  British republicanism  Another concept for Scotland becoming a republic is through reform of the United Kingdom's constitutional status from a constitutional monarchy to a republican constitution. There is not an explicit link with British unionism, as this tends to advocate the Union of Crowns. This is a form of British republicanism which is supported by English politicians such as Dennis Skinner and Jeremy Corbyn, and advocacy groups such as Republic. There is not mainstream support for this concept in any Scottish political parties, and remains a personal position, unlike support for an independent Scottish republic which does have party support. Adam Tomkins is an example of a republican who supports a reformed Britain without monarchy, however his opinion shifted after being elected for the Scottish Conservative & Unionist Party who are ardent supporters of the monarchy.

It originally aired on May 19, 2008. Plot Ted is having trouble getting a cab, but when he finally gets one, the cab is hit by a car speeding through an intersection. The entire gang, except Barney, rush to the hospital and are relieved (yet shocked) to find that he is perfectly fine. Ted reveals that he and Stella had gotten into a fight after she invited him to her sister's wedding in six months and he broke up with her, realizing that they could be moving too fast. When the accident occurred, Ted had seen all the things that he loved, allowing him to re-examine his relationship with Stella and realizing that he wants her back. Stella arrives in the hospital and reveals she has forgiven Ted. However, when she learns Ted thought they had broken up while she thought they had gotten into a small fight, Stella becomes upset and explicitly breaks up with him. Lily calls Barney to tell him about Ted's accident, but he hangs up before she can tell him that Ted is fine, seemingly not caring. However, it is revealed Barney skipped an important business meeting and ran all the way to the hospital. He ends up getting hit by a bus and breaks nearly all the bones in his body. Touched that Barney was so concerned about him, Ted and Barney finally declare themselves as bros once more. While Marshall and Lily joke about what Barney must have seen when he was hit by the bus, Barney stares longingly at Robin implying that he loves her. Meanwhile, Marshall attributes Ted and Barney surviving their respective accidents as miracles, a notion Robin dismisses as she does not believe in miracles. Marshall begins to relate a series of anecdotes where he believed a miracle had occurred. The stories involve a pencil falling from the ceiling and bouncing into Barney's nose, Marshall successfully smuggling drugs from Amsterdam to the United States due to the customs officer changing shifts, and Marshall losing his job because of head lice he had gotten from Lily's kindergarten class shortly before Marshall's boss was arrested. Robin dismisses all of Marshall's perceived miracles and reveals why she does not believe in them. When she was a child and her dog was dying, her parents and the veterinarian supposedly saved her dog with a special operation. Marshall declares it to be a miracle until Robin reveals that though her dog lived, her dog had \\"turned into\\" a turtle. After the nurse tells Ted he can leave, he rushes out to meet Stella, who is at Kiddy Fun Land with her daughter. He gives Stella a small orange kangaroo stuffed animal and explains that he tried to get the fake diamond ring but after ten minutes of trying couldn't. Stella is confused why he would need a diamond ring, and Ted proposes to her.

He was also employed in Carre√±o's workshops. His style was influenced by Antonio de Pereda, Carre√±o and Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo.Alonso E. P√©rez S√°nchez: Pintura barroca en Espa√±a 1600-1750.

He was active in Burgos, Valladolid and Valencia, as well as Madrid. His works ranged from altarpieces to small devotional paintings. His final work was a \\"Last Supper\\" for the refectory of the Order of Augustinian Recollects, which is known only from a print by Jos√© del Castillo, made in 1778. It was looted during the Peninsular War, and passed through several hands before disappearing during the Spanish Civil War.

Woods (October 22, 1916 - February 20, 1988)STLtoday - St. Louis Post-Dispatch Archives was an American sportscaster, best known for his play- by-play work on Major League Baseball broadcasts. Biography =Early life= Woods was born in Kansas City, Missouri. When only four years old, he became the mascot for the Triple-A baseball Kansas City Blues; and when only eight, the team's batboy and reader of scores on local radio. https://books.google.com/books?id=Uzh6vqrdzMIC&pg;=PA180&lpg;=PA180&dq;=Jim+Woods+sports+at+the+university+of+illinois&source;=web&ots;=kEH- FtlXoT&sig;=OPaP4Yxiq7hItu6Cbwikz8wZqig&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=4&ct;=result#PPA181,M1 He attended the University of Missouri for a year before taking a job at KGLO in Mason City, Iowa. In 1939, he replaced Ronald Reagan as the Iowa Hawkeyes football announcer. Woods joined the Navy in 1942, where he spent four years as a Chief Petty Officer on the Navy War Bond circuit, working with stars such as Farley Granger, Dennis Day and Victor Mature. After the war he joined WTAD radio in Quincy, Illinois, where he spent two years before moving to Atlanta as an announcer for the Triple-A Atlanta Crackers, replacing Ernie Harwell. =Broadcasting career= New York Yankees, New York Giants and NBC In 1953, Woods was hired to call New York Yankees games alongside Mel Allen and Joe E. Brown. He was fired after the 1956 season when sponsor Ballantine Beer wanted to make room for former Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto. Yankee general manager George Weiss was opposed to this, and told Woods apologetically it was the only time he had had to fire someone for no reason at all. In 1957, Woods called both New York Giants games with Russ Hodges and the NBC Game of the Week with Lindsey Nelson and Leo Durocher. The Giants moved to San Francisco after the season without Woods; Giants owner Horace Stoneham wanted someone who knew the Bay Area to work alongside Hodges. This marked the second time within a period of two years in which Woods was dismissed by a club for different reasons that had nothing to do with any fault of his own. Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals In 1958, Woods moved to Pittsburgh as Bob Prince's sidekick on Pirates games, where he achieved his greatest fame. Woods picked up his nickname of \\"Possum\\" while with the Yankees. He had a slight overbite and close-cropped gray hair. When he walked into the clubhouse fresh from a haircut, Enos Slaughter sized him up and said, \\"I've seen better heads on a possum.\\" Woods did not mind the name, and Prince would frequently refer to him as \\"Possum\\" or \\"Poss\\" on the air. Woods loved his time in Pittsburgh, and especially liked working with Prince; but rightsholder KDKA was notorious for low pay and unwilling to give him a raise, and he eventually accepted a better offer in St. Louis, where Harry Caray had been abruptly fired after the 1969 season. Jack Buck moved into Caray's No. 1 slot, and Woods took over Buck's spot as No. 2 announcer. He always preferred the subsidiary role because he did not like to do the public relations work that came with being the primary announcer. However, Woods and Buck did not get along, and Woods left the Cardinals after the 1971 season. Later career Woods moved on to the Oakland Athletics, where he called games for the eventual world champions in 1972 and 1973. However, A's owner Charlie Finley wanted his broadcasters to be unabashed \\"homers.\\" Finley didn't think Woods rooted hard enough for the A's from the broadcast booth, and fired him after only two years. A few months later, he was hired by the Boston Red Sox as Ned Martin's assistant. On the same day Woods signed his contract with the Red Sox, Finley had second thoughts and asked him to come back to Oakland, but Woods turned him down. Woods and Martin worked together from 1974 through 1978. By his own admission, Woods toned down his style considerably from his days in Pittsburgh, believing that Red Sox fans preferred their announcers to be more restrained. Despite their popularity, both were fired by the team's flagship radio station, WITS, in the aftermath of Boston's playoff defeat at the hands of Bucky Dent and the Yankees in 1978 for not cooperating fully with the team's radio sponsors. Martin remained in Boston, moving over to the TV side of Red Sox broadcasts. Although he left Martin, Boston and the Red Sox behind, Woods also switched to television, moving to USA Network. His final play-by-play announcing stint was for The USA Thursday Game of the Week. Woods would remain with USA until Eddie Doucette replaced him in 1982. =Death= Woods died at 71 in Seminole, Florida.

He also pioneered Policy Consultation and chaired a government think tank. Early life Ma Hong took part in Ximenghui in 1936, an organization of resistance against the Japanese. The following year he was involved in the organization of the General Trade Union of Tongpu Railroad, and in that same year joined the Communist Party of China. In 1938 he went to Yan'an, then the Communist capital, and won Chen Yun's (Minister of Organization) favour. As a result, he was admitted into the CPC's Central School. After graduation in 1941 Ma Hong was assigned to be a researcher in the CPC's Central Research Institute, laying the foundations of his later economic knowledge. He was transferred the CPC's Northeast Bureau to be the director of the Policy Research Office in 1949. Through investigation Ma Hong wrote \\"The Structure and Policy of the Northeastern Economy\\", and divided it into five sectors. This method was long employed by the Chinese Government. In 1952 Ma Hong was promoted to the post of General Secretary of the National Planning Committee of the Central Government. During the Gao-Rau Incident, Ma Hong was purged and demoted. He came to work in the National Economic Committee and was involved in the drafting of the \\"70 Industrial Regulations\\", which helped China recover from the Great Leap Forward. After co-composing the regulations Ma Hong wrote the \\"Management of Chinese Manufacturing Enterprises\\", which became the compass of industrial management at that time. Later years In 1978 Ma Hong's career rebounded and he founded the Industrial Economic Institute, becoming its director. He then became the president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Deputy General Secretary of the State Consul of the People's Republic of China. In 1984, at his suggestion, \\"the notion of a socialistic commercial economy was written into the CPC's list of doctrines.\\" Ma Hong founded the State Council Development Research Centre, the first of its kind. Late in his career he warned the government of impending inflation, but the government chose to ignore his advice to its detriment. Ma Hong has published more than 10 books in Chinese; New Strategy of Chinese Economic Development has been translated and edited by Fengbo Zhang and was published in Japan in 1985. His writings have been widely publicized, and in 2005 he won the Outstanding Economist Prize. On October 28, 2007, he died of Parkinson's disease.

Subsequently, the trademark has been expanded to include not just the proprietary DC 15 V connector but also the AC 120 V 60 Hz in-seat power (and video entertainment) systems. American Airlines uses EmPower 120 V AC outlets (standard 2 prong plus ground) on their newer 737s. Many laptops will not function properly at 75 W. The new 111101 astronicsaes.com AC 60 Hz EmPower system provides more power than the DC system. 111101 astronicsaes.com The AC EmPower system converts aircraft AC 400 Hz or wild frequency power to standard AC 60 Hz to prevent additional stresses in laptop chargers already stressed by reduced cooling at altitude. Note that laptops on this system will still charge batteries. Modern laptop batteries, however include a temperature sensor that should compensate for the reduced cooling at altitude. This new system accepts various national power plugs and most laptop chargers will function properly at AC 110 V 60 Hz even if sold in AC 230 V 50 Hz markets. Apple offered an EmPower Magsafe power adapter for their MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air lines of notebooks, and also included a cigarette lighter socket adapter. However, this system would only run the computer without charging the computer's battery, and Apple warned users to never plug this device into a car's cigarette lighter outlet. Accessed 2015-11-10. This product was later discontinued. Even though EmPower adapters are rated at 15 volts instead of 12 volts like cigar lighter receptacles, most accessories made for the so-called \\"12-volt outlets\\" have enough voltage tolerance to allow for a voltage as high as 15 without step down DC-to-DC converter.
