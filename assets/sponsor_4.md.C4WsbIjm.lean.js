It seeks to explain the importance of United Kingdom‚ÄìUnited States relations to Canada's security, and even survival, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The triangle in question was Canada, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. This triangle was invisible to Americans or Britons, for whom Canada was a side issue at best, but it was vital to Canada. Canada was intimately involved with both countries, and needed good relations between them for its own security. The primary concern of Canadian governments was to avoid a repetition of the American invasions of 1775 and 1812-1815, when Canada had been used as the battlefield where American and British differences were settled. Culturally and philosophically, most Canadians of the era (especially the ethnically British majority) identified with Britain and the British Empire and distrusted the United States, but at the same time many Canadians were eager to trade with the large, growing, and nearby market in the United States.  Overview  Canada's interest in Anglo-American relations began as early as the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, when Canada was still a disunited collection of British colonies. The short era of increased trade with the US that the treaty created (lasting to 1866) deeply influenced Canadian trade policy and attitudes towards the US for years to come, encouraging the free traders. But the treaty's cancellation by the Americans also raised suspicions in Canada. Of even more serious concern were the repeated war scares between Britain and the northern, Union government in the American Civil War, which threatened Canada with another invasion over the Trent Affair, the Alabama Incident, and so on. After Canada federated and became a self-governing dominion in 1867, Canada's new federal government became part of Anglo-American relations. At the Washington conference of 1871 which discussed all issues of Anglo-American relations, Canada's prime minister, John A. Macdonald took part as part of the British delegation. This was the beginning of a kind of triangle diplomacy lasted in various forms for decades. Canadian Prime Minister Borden sought to create an Anglo-American alliance during the Paris peace talks of 1919, and pushed Britain to renounce its alliance with Japan and instead come to an agreement with the US during the 1920s. Canada also hoped to become part of the inner circle of allied decision making during the Second World War, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King hosted Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in Quebec City for that reason.

His large size, strong hindquarters, and racing record earned him the name \\"California Wonder.\\" Background In the 1870s, when Joseph Cairn Simpson (founder of California's first all-sports newspaper, Breeder and Sportsman) migrated west, he brought horses with him. One was the filly Marian. To finance his newspaper, he sold Marian to Theodore Winters, who owned California's best stallion, Norfolk, by America's greatest sire, Lexington. Norfolk retired undefeated. Winters bought him for $15,001, one dollar more than the amount paid for Lexington himself. With the purchase of Marian, Winters now owned a top stallion and a top broodmare. Marian, mated to Norfolk, both living at either Winters' second stud farm, the Rancho Del Rio near Sacramento on the banks of the Sacramento River or on his Yolo County, California, spread, produced numerous outstanding runners: Duchess of Norfolk, Prince of Norfolk, The Czar, El Rio Rey, Rey Del Rey, and Emperor of Norfolk. (After Norfolk retired, Marian produced another star: Yo Tambien, by turf champion Joe Hooker.) It is generally agreed that Emperor of Norfolk was the most important horse born in California until Swaps came along 67 years later. Racing career Winters sold Marian's yearling foal to \\"Lucky\\" Baldwin for $2,525. Baldwin raced the colt 18 times at the age of two, which was a normal schedule for the time. During one eight-day span, Emperor of Norfolk won three races in Chicago, Illinois. At Saratoga, New York, in August, he won four more races. Then he went to Jerome Park Racetrack, where he took two races in four days. He also placed in the Prospect Cap and came third in the Quickstep Stakes. At three, Emperor of Norfolk started eleven times, winning 9 races, 8 of them consecutively. He placed in one race and showed in another. Of the nine starts he won, two were the prestigious Brooklyn Stakes (now called the Dwyer Stakes) and the American Derby under the great African American jockey Isaac Burns Murphy. Emperor of Norfolk won at distances of between five and nine furlongs, and earned, for the time, a huge sum of money. He retired lame after his last win in the Sheridan Stakes (the injury occurring during an exercise run), and Baldwin shipped him back to Rancho Santa Anita to begin his stud career. At stud Emperor of Norfolk was great a sire as his own sire, Norfolk, producing stake winner after stake winner, but his best son (who possessed a confusion of names until sent to England) was Americus. Americus won many stakes races, but it was as a sire that he made his name, primarily through his daughter Americus Girl. Out of Americus Girl came the \\"flying filly,\\" Mumtaz Mahal, and through her Mahmoud, Nasrullah, Royal Charger, and Tudor Minstrel. Many of today's horse racing greats go back to Emperor of Norfolk through Mumtaz Mahal via Americus. Death Emperor of Norfolk died at age 22 on December 15, 1907, the day after Baldwin opened his Santa Anita race track. When word spread that he was dying, many horsemen came to the Baldwin stable to mourn his passing. Emperor of Norfolk was buried at the stable under a large Maltese cross, Baldwin's racing symbol. Later, Baldwin's three other American Derby winners, Volante, Silver Cloud, and Rey El Santa Anita, joined him. All four horses were later transferred to the paddock garden of the modern Santa Anita Park. Emperor of Norfolk was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1988.

He made his name in small ship actions, especially fighting French frigates, of which he captured three. In his later career Barlow served as comptroller of the Navy and was influential at the Admiralty right up to his death. Although born to a middle-class family, Barlow and his siblings made names for themselves and two of Barlow's daughters married into the naval aristocracy. His grandson, Robert Barlow, was a first-class cricketer and army officer. Early career Robert Barlow was born in 1757 in Covent Garden to wealthy mercer William Barlow and his wife Hilaire. The couple had numerous children, including Robert's elder brother George Hilario Barlow who later became Governor-General of India. Robert joined the Navy as a teenager and was promoted lieutenant in 1778, serving on in the American Revolutionary War. In her, Barlow participated in the capture of the French frigate Minerve and also was part of the fleet which relieved the Great Siege of Gibraltar. After the peace in 1783, Barlow married Elizabeth Garrett of Worting, Hampshire. The couple had a close relationship and numerous children. Between 1786 and 1789, Lieutenant Barlow commanded the revenue cutter . He was promotted to Commander and transferred to the brig on the same service in November 1790. French Revolutionary Wars On 2 January 1793, Barlow took Childers into Brest to reconnoitre the port due to the growing hostility between Britain and the First French Republic. Tensions had been mounting for months since the French Revolution and the opening of the French Revolutionary Wars the previous year between France, Prussia, Austria and Sardinia but Britain and France were not yet at war when Barlow entered Brest. Within minutes of his arrival, one of the formidable forts overlooking the harbour mouth opened fire on his diminutive craft with 48 lb shot. One of the first balls fired struck a gun on Childers deck and split the cannon in two. Barlow beat a hasty retreat without suffering any casualties and reported the attack to his superiors. One month later Britain and France were at war; in his excursion to Brest, Barlow had received the first shots of a 23-year conflict. Two weeks after war was declared, Barlow secured an early victory with seizure of the privateer Patriote off Gravelines. This was the first naval engagement of the wars and his success secured Barlow a promotion to post captain in the frigate HMS Pegasus. Pegasus was attached to the Channel Fleet under Lord Howe and acted as a repeating ship for the admiral's signals. Barlow was still in this position at the battle of the Glorious First of June, when he relayed Howe's orders to the rest of the fleet. Despite a mixed reaction from many of Howe's captains the battle was a success and Barlow was upgraded to the frigate HMS Aquilon as a reward for his service. In 1795, Barlow moved to the new frigate HMS Phoebe and in her captured the French frigate N√©r√©ide in December 1797. Four years later in the Straits of Gibraltar, Barlow repeated the feat by capturing the French frigate Africaine, which was transporting French soldiers to Egypt and had over 400 aboard, at the Action of 19 February 1801. In a close contest, Phoebe forced her opponent to surrender and caused over 300 casualties to Africaine for just 13 of her own. For this second victory, Barlow was knighted and given command of the ship of the line HMS Triumph in the Mediterranean until 1804. Napoleonic Wars The Napoleonic wars were a less active period for Barlow, who served as Lord Keith's flag captain for a time and then as deputy controller of the navy before moving as superintendent of Chatham Dockyard in 1808. During this period he showed great skill as an administrator and improved services where ever he was stationed. Barlow continued on shore service until 1823, when he was retired as a rear-admiral. He had been made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath three years before. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January, 1819. Barlow enjoyed a lengthy retirement in Canterbury and in 1840 was restored to naval service in order to receive a belated promotion to full admiral and advancement to Knight Grand Cross. He died at the archbishop's palace in Canterbury in May 1843. His wife had predeceased him by 26 years, but two of his daughters had married well, wedding George Byng, 6th Viscount Torrington and William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson.Barlow, Sir Robert, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J.

The type species is Pyrops candelaria. In the genus Pyrops the names of the species follow the rules of the ICZN; that is, since the name of the genus is masculine in gender, the adjectival species epithets in the genus would be given in their masculine form (e.g., ochracea would become ochraceus; candelaria is a noun, however, and does not change to candelarius), though numerous authors have consistently (and incorrectly) treated them as feminine.Porion & Nagai. 1996. Fulgoridae 2. Illustrated Catalogue of the Asian and Australian Fauna. Under the present rules, generic names ending in -ops must be treated as masculine regardless of the original usage (ICZN Chapter 7, Article 30.1.4.3).http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ A molecular phylogenetic study suggests that Pyrops is a sister of the genus Saiva and together form tribe Pyropsini. Ecology Like many other plant-sap sucking insects, Pyrops species exude honeydew. This honeydew is sometimes gathered by other animals in trophobiotic associations. Pyrops whiteheadi and P. intricatus are known to be attended by Dorylaea sp. cockroaches in Southeast Asia. Pyrops whiteheadi has also been seen tended by a gecko, Gehyra mutilata.

It was first performed by the Com√©die Italienne in 1779. Les Deux Billets is the first of a trilogy of plays called \\"The Arlequinades\\" that tell the story of Arlequin, his wife Argentine, and later, their children. The other two plays in the series are Le Bon M√©nage and Le Bon P√®re. Plot summary The play opens with Arlequin reading a love letter from the wealthy Argentine. In spite of the fact that Argentine loves him, Arlequin wishes that they were equally rich or poor so that she might be certain that he loves her for herself and not her money. Arlequin regularly plays the lottery, and his rival Scapin arrives with the day's lottery numbers. Arlequin has won. Scapin gives Arlequin false directions to the lottery headquarters and attempts to steal the ticket from Arlequin's pocket; however, instead of grabbing the ticket, he grabs Argentine's love letter. Trying to profit from the situation, Scapin goes to Argentine and shows her the love letter, saying that Arlequin gave it to another woman. Argentine believes this, and when Arlequin comes back from his unsuccessful trip to the lottery, Argentine is angry and says she will marry the man who is holding her love letter. Scapin produces the love letter, and Arlequin is devastated. Afterwards, Scapin tells Arlequin that Argentine gave him the love letter. Arlequin, desperate, agrees to trade the lottery ticket for the love letter. Scapin does, assuming that Argentine will not listen to Arlequin. However, when she discovers that Arlequin traded the lottery ticket for her love letter, Argentine realizes the true value of Arlequin's love. When Scapin returns, Argentine pretends to be jealous and asks him to reveal the note that he has in his pocket. Scapin pulls out the lottery ticket, and Argentine snatches it. Argentine and Arlequin are now together and very wealthy.

He joined the Metropolitan Police in 1956, becoming a detective sergeant at New Scotland Yard. In 1969, after having been a police officer for 15 years, Symonds was one of three officers charged with corruption following a newspaper investigation into bribery at Scotland Yard.

In Morocco, Symonds served as a mercenary, making use of his police and military expertise to train African troops to use the 25-pounder howitzer, an artillery piece that was, by that time, obsolete by British Army standards and had been sold off as surplus to several African countries. It was at this point that Symonds was recruited by the KGB.BBC: \\"The Spying Game\\", first broadcast on BBC2, 19 September 1999. Between 1972 and 1980, he was a KGB agent employed as a \\"Romeo spy\\" with the codename SKOT.

Symonds revealed himself as a spy to the police and security services in the 1980s, and appeared on the front page of the Daily Express (1985) and in the News on Sunday (1987), but was dismissed as \\"a fantasist\\". It was only with the defection of Major Vasili Mitrokhin in 1992 and the subsequent publication of the Mitrokhin Archive in 1999, in which Symonds was named as a spy for the Soviet Union, that his claim gained credence. Symonds was never prosecuted for any offence related to espionage or spying, and was never interviewed by MI5 or the Secret Intelligence Service. It was confirmed that Symonds was not being prosecuted because he had been offered immunity by the Director of Public Prosecutions office in 1984 in connection with a criminal inquiry. This was granted in relation to police corruption inquiries, stated by Symonds to be Operation Countryman. The publication of Mitrokhin's material launched a parliamentary inquiry by the Intelligence and Security Committee. Its report when published referred to the lack of interest shown by the security services in Symonds' case: > The Committee believes that it was a serious failure of the Security Service > not to refer Mr Symonds' case to the Law Officers in mid 1993. We are > concerned that it took over 9 months to consult the Law Officers after he > was identified in the draft book. We believe that the Service could have > interviewed Mr Symonds, at least for the intelligence and historical record. Romeo Spy: the movie Prodigy Pictures were for some time in the pre- production stage of making a movie based on the autobiography of John Symonds. A script had been completed, and Daniel Craig and Jude Law were being considered to play the lead role. However, as of September 2013 the movie appeared to be no longer under development.

At a length of , it was the shortest operating common carrier railroad in the state. Later (from 1902 until January 15, 1982), the Ludington & Northern Railway Company, at , stripped the Paw Paw of its title as \\"shortest Michigan Railroad\\". The Michigan Central Railroad had originally planned to reach the coast of Lake Michigan at St. Joseph, but these plans changed and the company built to New Buffalo instead. This meant that instead of passing through Paw Paw, the line passed through Lawton, some four miles (6 km) to the south. A group of local businessmen incorporated the Paw Paw Railroad on April 25, 1857, to construct a railway line from Paw Paw to Lawton, where it would join the Michigan Central. An initial attempt, which aimed east of Lawton, resulted in the partial creation of a grade but no track was laid. The so-called \\"calico grade\\" was later developed, briefly, by the Kalamazoo, Lake Shore & Chicago. A second attempt, in 1867, led to the completion in September of that year of a line between Paw Paw and Lawton, which was opened for public use. This constituted the total physical extent of the Paw Paw.Rowland (1912), 111; Meints (1992), 124; Meints (2005). The line was originally built as , but in 1875 the Paw Paw's original owners were bought out by the owners of the Toledo and South Haven Railroad (T&SH;), a narrow gauge line which ran west from Paw Paw to Lawrence. The two companies remained separate, but in 1877 the Paw Paw's line was converted to gauge to permit joint operations.Hilton (1990), 427. On March 7, 1887 the Paw Paw merged with the T&SH; and ceased to exist as an independent company. Throughout its history, the Paw Paw was specifically exempt from those sections of Michigan's railroad law which regulated rates and fares.Michigan Railroad Commission (1888), v; Michigan Legislature (1877), 954. In 1898 the South Haven & Eastern (successor to the T&SH;) converted the T&SH;'s lines, including the Paw Paw-Lawton segment, back to . In 1903 it passed along with the SH&E; to the Pere Marquette Railway, which finally abandoned the line in 1941.Meints (2005).

Naval trawlers were widely used during the First and Second World Wars. Fishing trawlers were particularly suited for many naval requirements because they were robust boats designed to work heavy trawls in all types of weather and had large clear working decks. One could create a mine sweeper simply by replacing the trawl with a mine sweep. Adding depth charge racks on the deck, ASDIC below, and a or gun in the bow equipped the trawler for anti-submarine duties. History Armed trawlers were also used to defend fishing groups from enemy aircraft or submarines. The smallest civilian trawlers were converted to danlayers. Modern day Some nations still use armed trawlers today for fisheries protection and patrol. The Indian Navy used naval trawlers for patrol duties during its involvement in the Sri Lankan civil war. North Korea has been notoriously known for its use of armed trawlers as spy ships. The Battle of Amami-≈åshima was an incident in which the Japanese sank a North Korean naval trawler after a six-hour battle. Somali pirates have also commandeered trawlers and armed them for attacking freighters off the Horn of Africa. The action of 18 March 2006 is one example of pirate use of a naval trawler. The pirates used naval trawlers again at the action of 30 March 2010 and the action of 1 April 2010. One naval trawler was sunk and another was captured by the Seychelles Coast Guard and a US Navy frigate. Trawler classes   Portuguese class  Type 139 Around the world=Belgium= In the aftermath of the First World War, the Belgian Corps de Marine purchased several British war surplus naval trawlers. They were operational during the Battle of Belgium (1940) and one of them, , evacuated a large quantity of the National Bank's gold reserves to Britain shortly before Belgium's surrender. =Brazil= As with Portugal, the British Royal Navy had a number of trawler-type warships on order from Brazilian shipyards. With the declaration of war by Brazil against Germany in 1942 these vessels were transferred to the Brazilian Navy for anti-submarine and escort duties.Conway p417 =France= The French Navy also made use of trawlers requisitioned from civilian use during wartime. In the Second World War 480 trawler type vessels were in service as auxiliary mine-sweepers and a further sixty as auxiliary patrol vessels.Conway p279 =Germany= During the Second World War the Kriegsmarine operated trawlers as Vorpostenboot (outpost boats) and as weather ships; the was an example. It also used a large number of Kriegsfischkutter, trawlers built after the 24m long model \\"G\\" of the scientifically developed fishing cutter models (seven \\"Reichsfischkutter\\"-models A to- G), redesigned for naval uses such as anti- submarine warfare, but intended for conversion to fishing vessel after the war. The weather trawler programme was a major disaster for the German war effort; it has even been suggested that it was one of the major contributors to Germany's defeat. The British Royal Navy monitored and pursued them relentlessly, capturing or sinking many. The reason was not just the strategic importance of weather data, but that the trawlers were carrying Enigma encryption machines and information, which when captured helped the British to crack the Enigma code, enabling them to read Germany's secret communications; the Germans had not understood how their weather missions compromised Enigma, but they did discontinue the use of weather trawlers as they were too vulnerable. =India= The Royal Indian Navy operated trawlers mostly for coastal defence; more than fifty s were ordered, but only twenty-two were completed with four more being destroyed before completion due to their shipyards being overrun by the Japanese in Burma. The remaining twenty-five were cancelled. They were used for coastal anti-submarine patrols and mine- sweeping duties. =Japan= Japanese armed trawler seen through the periscope of USS Albacore, Nov. 17, 1944 As the Second World War progressed, Japan commandeered some fishing vessels for use as picket boats. To augment these, and to replace losses, the Imperial Japanese Navy also ordered a group of 280 picket boats, built on trawler lines but to Navy specifications. This was the No.1 class auxiliary patrol boat, though eventually only twenty-seven were completed. =New Zealand= Main article, Minesweepers of the Royal New Zealand Navy. During World War II the Royal New Zealand Navy operated thirty- five minesweepers, including twenty purpose-built naval trawlers (thirteen Castle class, three Bird class four Isles class), five converted fishing trawlers, and ten converted merchant vessels. =Norway= Norway had a large fishing and whaling fleet industry. For the Second World War the Royal Norwegian Navy made use of six converted whalers and twenty-two other fishing vessels as minesweepers and a further ten as patrol craft.Conway p381 The Royal Norwegian Navy also made use of a captured German naval trawler, taken as prize in April 1940 and put into service as . After the occupation of Norway the Free Norwegian forces made use of fishing vessels for their clandestine Shetland bus operations in support of the Norwegian resistance. =Portugal= Though Portugal was neutral throughout the Second World War, a number of steel and wooden-hulled vessels were built to trawler design for the Royal Navy. These s were delivered in 1942, but further construction was halted after protests from Nazi Germany. Later, as Portugal became more closely involved with the western allies, Britain transferred a number of s to the Portuguese Navy as anti-submarine vessels.Conway p67 =Romania= Romania acquired three German KFK naval trawlers in 1943.Cornel I. Scafe»ô, Armata Rom√¢nƒÉ 1941-1945, RAI Publishing, 1996, p. 174. =United Kingdom= During the First World War, the Royal Navy operated 627 \\"Admiralty Trawlers\\" which had been purpose-built, purchased from foreign countries, or acquired as prizes. A further 1,456 trawlers were hired and operated, together with many other kinds of small vessel, by the Auxiliary Patrol. Trawlers were mainly employed in minesweeping, anti-submarine patrols and as boom defence vessels. Of the hired trawlers, 266 were lost while on active service. Before and during the Second World War, the Royal Navy ordered many naval trawlers to Admiralty specifications. Shipyards such as Smiths Dock Company that were used to building fishing trawlers could easily switch to constructing naval versions. As a bonus, the Admiralty could sell these trawlers to commercial fishing interests when the wars ended. Still, many were sunk during the war, such as and . In 1940, Lieutenant Richard Stannard was in command of the naval trawler when he won the Victoria Cross for his actions from 28 April to 2 May 1940 at Namsos, Norway. HMT Arab survived 31 bombing attacks in five days. During the 1982 Falklands War the Royal Navy hired a flotilla of five trawlers from Kingston-upon-Hull, which were hastily converted to minesweepers, as the Ton-class minesweepers then in service were unsuitable for the long voyage and heavy seas of the South Atlantic. Although employed with the Task Force on various other auxiliary duties, after the Argentine surrender the trawlers were able to sweep ten naval mines which had been successfully laid in Port Stanley harbour; eleven others had failed to deploy or had broken adrift. =United States= The US Navy generally favoured custom-built warships to civilian conversions, but in the first months of World War II the acute shortage of vessels for coastal defence and anti-submarine work led to the formation of a mosquito fleet. Twenty steel-hulled trawlers and more than forty wooden-hulled trawlers were commissioned as auxiliary minesweepers. (AM designation). These however were confined to coastal waters and not rated for offensive or convoy escort duties. A further seventy tuna clippers were called up as minesweepers (Amc designation), ten as harbour patrol craft (YP) and fifty as coastal transports (APC).Conway p152 The United States Coast Guard requisitioned ten Boston fishing trawlers for the Greenland Patrol.

Technical description and variation  Z. carniolica. It is hardly possible to give a general description of the colour and pattern of the 20 odd forms which are being united under this species. The antenna is strong, being enlarged to a stout club; collar and edge of thorax mostly with whitish hairs; legs black-blue, yellow beneath. Forewing metallic black-green, densely scaled, fringes light reddish yellow; 6 spots, the 6 halfmoon-shaped , parallel with the distal margin, its normal colour in exceptional specimens absent, but then always recognizable by the scaling having a different gloss. The species is distributed throughout Central and South Europe, as well as North Africa and Western Asia, extending to Turkestan and the Altai. \\"To enumerate all transitions and aberrations would fatigue even the most patient,\\" says Ochsenheimer; we also shall therefore only characterize the forms which alone till now have received names.

While married to Elizabeth Lanxade, his name was also linked to Madame Chinon, whose excessive gambling habits, indulged by Blanc, were widely believed by some observers to be substantially at the origins of the accusations of mismanagement which eventually led to Prince Louis' intervention and termination of his position at Monte Carlo Casino. In the closing years of Blanc's life, up to his death in 1927, he suffered severely from paralysis, said to have been derived mainly from the reported stresses of his experience of dealing with the Monaco authorities.

Early life and education Praeger was born in Holywood, County Down, Ireland on 17 April 1867. Her parents were Willem Emil Praeger and Marie Ferrar Patterson. Her father, immigrated to Belfast from Holland to work with his uncle in the family linen company, which was established in 1860. Praeger had five brothers, the eldest of whom was the naturalist Robert Lloyd Praeger. Praeger received her primary school education at the day school run by the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian minister, Rev Charles McElester. Praeger would later teach at this school. She attended Sullivan Upper School, the Belfast School of Art and the Slade School of Art in London. At the Belfast School of Art, Praeger studied under the painter George Trobridge, and became a member of the Rambler's Sketching Club in 1886. In 1888, she enrolled in the Slade School, studying under Alphonse Legros. Whilst there she became friends with fellow sculptor, Ellen Mary Rope. From 1892 to 1893, Praeger travelled to Paris to study, having been encouraged to do so by Legros and Rope. Career Following her time in Paris, Praeger returned to Holywood and established a studio. Having rented a number of studios in Belfast, in 1914 she built St Brigid's Studio on Hibernia Street, which she worked from until her death. Praeger completed her first large commission in 1907, a memorial to T. Hamilton for Queen's University Belfast. Praeger wrote and illustrated children's books, as well as providing botanical illustrations for her brother's work. However she is best known for her sculptures, working primarily in plaster but also marble, terracotta and stone. Her more well known pieces depict children in what is sometimes described as a sentimental style. Her sculptures include: * \\"The Philosopher\\" (which was shown at the Royal Academy) is now in Colorado Springs, Colorado * \\"Johnny The Jig\\" is in Holywood (between the maypole and the Priory) * \\"Fionnuala the Daughter of Lir\\" is at the Causeway School, near Bushmills (1911‚Äì17) * Founders of Riddell Hall, Queen's University (1926) * Lord Edward Carson Memorial, Belfast Cathedral (1938) She also modelled figures for such diverse bodies as the Northern Bank, the Carnegie Library on the Falls Road (Belfast) and at St Anne's Church of Ireland Cathedral (Belfast). She was President of the then Ulster Academy (became the Royal Ulster Academy later). Awards and legacy She became an Honorary Academician of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1927, received an honorary MA from Queen's University in 1938, and in 1939 was awarded the MBE. She died at Rock Cottage on 16 April 1954, and was buried in the Priory Cemetery. Praeger's work in included in the collections of the Ulster Museum and the National Gallery of Ireland, and some private collections around the world.

It includes both terrestrial and climbing species, some with leaves and some leafless, but all with large, often colourful flowers on tall flowering stems. It is the only genus of its alliance, Dipodium. Description Orchids in the genus Dipodium are perennial, terrestrial herbs or climbers/epiphytes. Many species, particularly in eastern Australia are leafless mycoheterotrophs. Others have medium-sized to very large leaves that are parallel-veined and have entire margins. The flowers are arranged in a raceme with very few or up to fifty large, often colourful flowers. These may be fragrant or odourless, are white, pink, purple, yellow or green, often with spots or blotches. The sepals and petals are free from and similar to each other. The labellum projects forwards and has three lobes with a central band of colourful hairs. Each flower has two pollinia that are supported on two stipes. Dehiscent capsules, produced after flowering, hold the seed which is released when the capsule splits longitudinally along six seams. Between 30 and 500 seeds are produced per capsule. Taxonomy The genus was formally described in 1810 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The name Dipodium is derived the Greek words di (two) and podia (little feet), a reference to the two stipes supporting the pollinia. Two flowering scapes of a leafless species in south-eastern Australia Distribution and habitat Hyacinth orchids are found in Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, New Guinea and Australia where eleven species are endemic. They occur in a range of habitats from coastal lowlands to ranges and tablelands. Ecology It is thought that the flowers attract native bees and wasps through floral mimicry. Uses An infusion of the leaves of Dipodium pandanum is traditionally drunk in Bouganville to help relieve respiratory infections. =Use in horticulture= Leafless hyacinth orchids are impossible to grow in cultivation but D. pandanum is easy to grow in warm climates.

It is typically found in xeric habitats, and populations have recently decreased. It also exhibits M√ºllerian mimicry with other species, like Amata phegea.  Description  Z. ephialtes typically fly during the day. Adult butterfly flight is often characterized as slow. As characteristic of Zygaenidae moths, they have prominent spots on their wings, which alerts predators that they contain toxins. Technical description and variation Z. ephialtes L. (= falcatae Boisd.) (5 i, k). Forewing with 6 spots; the basal pair red, the others white; hindwing with a white dot. Abdomen with red belt. From South Germany and Switzerland, eastwards to Greece and South Siberia. ‚Äî medusa Pall. [ now Z. ephialtes ssp. medusa Pallas, 1771] (5 k) is the form without the 6. spot: being especially frequent in the eastern districts of the area. ‚Äî In the west of the area, especially in Northern Italy, South Germany, Austria, and also in some of the Balcan States, there occur two forms which are marked like ephialtes resp. medusa, but have the 2 basal spots of the forewing and the abdominal belt deep yellow instead of red; these forms are coronillae Esp.[ now Z. ephialtes ssp. coronillae [Denis & Schifferm√ºller] ], (6a) with 6 spots, and trigonellae Esp. [ now Z. ephialtes ssp. coronillae [Denis & Schifferm√ºller], 1775 ] (6a) with 5 spots. ‚Äî Likewise in Austria there occur, often together with other forms at the same places, two varieties in which the spots of the forewing as well as the whole hindwing except the black margin are yellow; these are icterica Led. [now Z. ephialtes ssp. coronillae [Denis & Schifferm√ºller], 1775 ] (6 a) with 6 spots, and aeacus Esp. [now Z. ephialtes ssp. coronillae [Denis & Schifferm√ºller], 1775 ] (6 b) with 5 spots on the forewing. Sometimes the yellow colour has a strong reddish tint; such forms are named by Hirschke princi (6b), if there are 6 spots, and aurantiaca if there are 5. ‚Äî Also red forms are found which are similar in appearance to red-belted filipendulae resp trifolii ab. orobi , being also the most northern forms. They are peucedani Esp. [ now Z. ephialtes ssp. peucedani Esper, 1780] (= hippocrepidis H.-Sch.; aeacus Hubn.) (6b) with 6 spots, and athamanthae Esp.[ now Z. ephialtes ssp. athamanthae Esper, 1789] (= veronicae Bkh.) (6c) with 5. The red colour of the hindwing of these forms may more and more be replaced by the black marginal guenneri. band, being finally represented only by a red central spot. These forms are ab. guenneri Hirschke [ now Z. ephialtes ssp. coronillae [Denis & Schifferm√ºller], 1775] , if there are 6 spots, and ab. metzgeri Hirschke [ now Z. ephialtes ssp. coronillae [Denis & Schifferm√ºller], 1775], if there are 5. ‚Äî We have further to mention a group of aberrations in which the hindwing bears two small spots instead of a single white or red one. This modification is known of nearly all the above-mentioned forms and has received special names. Thus, ephialtes with 2 white spots to the hindwing bears the name sophiae Favre, the corresponding form of medusa being aemilii Favre, while coronillae with 2 spots is bahri Hirschke and the corresponding trigonellae- form wutzdorffi Hirschke. ‚Äî Larva yellow or green, reddish yellow at the sides, with pale belts; a dorsal stripe and subdorsal rows of spots black; above the legs rows of black dots ; on the whole similar to the larva of filipendulae ; in May adult on Vetch, Trefoil, Thyme, Eryngium, Plantago, etc., the black pupa in a white-yellow silky cocoon. The imagines fly in July in meadows, venturing even into gardens; they are especially often found resting on the heads of thistles standing near the edges of woods and on fallow ground, sometimes one finds only one form at a certain place, sometimes several forms fly about at the same time in one field, copulating together, the offspring, however, not having mixed or transitional characters. Occasionally specimens of this species have been met with which were in copula with individuals of entirely different species. Seitz, A., 1913, in Seitz, Gross-Schmett. Erde 6: 22.,The Macrolepidoptera of the Palearctic Fauna 2. Volume: The Palearctic Bombyces & Sphinges. pdf Range This family of moths is spread throughout most of Europe, ranging from Spain to the Ural Mountains. It is not found in the British Isles, northern Europe, or certain islands in the Mediterranean. Habitat A study was done by Jakub Horak that focused on populations in the Czech Republic. Many previously unknown habitat preferences of Z. ephialtes were found. This species cannot survive in forested areas or areas with a closed canopy. Z. ephialtes prefer xeric conditions, and were rarely found in more humid areas. The two times they were found in non-exeric areas, the areas were previously xeric sites that were abandoned. The xeric areas that were studied also had many species that are specifically associated with xeric environments, referred to as xeric specialists. Some of these species include Phengaris arion, Psophus stridulus, Polyommatus coridon, Polyommatus daphnis, Plebjus argus, and Zygaena carniolica. This study showed that Z. ephialtes is an important part of xeric habitats. Behavior= Migration = Because of the slower nature of the adult butterflies' movement, a typical butterfly's range was thought to be on the smaller side. However, after observing populations in the Czech Republic, it was found that this species was found during quick flying events over longer distances. Life cycle= Eggs = The eggs are pale yellow. They are laid in a single layer and in many batches. = Caterpillars = Caterpillars appear yellow with small black portions. = Pupae = Pupae appear brown and are typically found on the stems of grasses. = Adults = Z. ephialtes are one of the largest species of burnet moths. Their flight has been described as slow and undulating.  Host plants  There are many host plants for Z. ephialtes. The most common are Coronilla emerus, Coronilla varia, Securigera varia (purple crown vetch) and Hippocrepis comosa (horseshoe vetch). Another species that has been observed less frequently is Hippocrepis emerus (scorpion senna).  Mimicry  Amata phegea is another spotted moth species that looks similar to Z. ephialtes. Because Z. ephialtes is unpalatable to other species, A. phegea takes advantage of this. Z. ephialtes is hyper-polymorphic, with two main forms- peucedanoid or ephialtoid. The peucedanoid form consists of a colored forewing and hindwing with spots. The ephialtoid form consists of all the forewing spots being white except the two basal spots, and the hindwings being black with a white spot. Either of these forms can be red or yellow. The yellow form has been found to be more advantageous than the red one.

However, with the decline in these environments, the species is also vanishing from many of these regions. Because of changing environments, these butterflies are required to travel longer than normal distances to find suitable habitats. Populations are declining. Some sources say that this species is critically endangered. Recently there has been some human involvement with the species by protecting some xeric sites that the butterflies inhabit.

Their relationship is a complicated, multi-layered one that not only encompasses the tensions brought about by their investigations of difficult or high-profile murder cases but also from subtle interpersonal elements as well. DS Havers often clashes with DI Lynley not only because he is her superior officer, but because of her quick temper, which has caused her demotion to detective constable (or DC) and earned her the reputation of being difficult. Their relationship underscores contemporary issues of gender and class. Lynley, the handsome and urbane Eighth Earl of Asherton, has a gilded existence as a member of the nobility, whereas the working class, unattractive and socially inept Havers finds life a struggle. Helping her aging parents is a particular grind. Initially Havers despises all Lynley stands for but she grudgingly comes to accept his innate, bemused decency while recognizing his faults. Eleven of George's Lynley novels have been adapted for television by the BBC as The Inspector Lynley Mysteries. Havers is portrayed by Scottish actress Sharon Small; Nathaniel Parker plays Lynley.

Louis Giddings, the pioneering archaeologist of the area.answers.com summary of \\"The archeology of Cape Denbigh\\" by J L Giddings, 1948 ASIN B0007DLAA4 It is significant as the type site of the Norton culture, representative of human occupation c. 500BCE-500CE, first described by Giddings in 1964. It is also significant for the Cape Denbigh Flint Complex, which lay underneath the Norton materials, and provides evidence of some of the earliest human activity in the region. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Description The Iyatayet Site is located on both sides of Iyatayet Creek, near its mouth on the northwest side of Cape Denbigh, a peninsular projection into Norton Bay, on the central-west coast of Alaska. The site has a complex series of depositions, which begin with a Nukleet (Thule) tradition settlement, identified by a series of depressions. Beneath this layer Giddings found a house pit which had been dug into older cultural materials. Both the house pit and the older materials became the type site for the Norton tradition, which lasted roughly from 1000 BC to 800 AD, and the site also has some elements of the older Arctic small tool tradition. Organic finds in these layers were relatively sparse, including ivory barbed weapon heads, toggling harpoon heads, and fragmentary tool blades. Decorative ivory finds included a doll figure. Stone artifacts were more numerous, with evidence of toolmaking (debitage) as well as projectile heads and stone knives. Pottery was also found, which was largely utilitarian and unornamented. Giddings interpreted the house site to be a winter accommodation, with its occupants engaged in seal hunting and fishing, with some efforts at caribou hunting as well. The site was examined by Giddings in 1948, but not formally written up by him until the 1960s; he referred to it as the \\"Denbigh Flint Complex\\".

It was released in the United States by TriStar Pictures on October 24, 2008. Plot Psychotherapist Claire Summers counsels five survivors of a recent plane crash: passengers Dean, Norman, Shannon, Eric, and flight attendant Janice. Eric, however, seems unusually upbeat after the tragedy. Claire meets with Mr. Arkin, an airline official, to confirm which parts of the survivors' differing recollections about the crash are accurate. Arkin claims pilot error caused the crash. Claire is asked to speak with Eric while he is getting examined at the hospital. She notices Eric's attraction to her, but is suspicious when he reveals personal information about her. When Dean misses the next session, Norman believes the airline is targeting the surviving passengers to cover up the airline having a history of negligent mechanical failures. The passengers had originally remembered nothing odd happening before the crash, but they start to remember an engine exploding. Later, Claire is conflicted between her role as counselor and growing personal feelings for Eric. A kindly neighbor urges her to take a chance with him. At the following session, Norman is absent, leaving only Janice and Shannon. Mr. Arkin warns Claire against feeding the airline coverup theory to the remaining survivors. Claire later spends time with Eric on his boat and reciprocates his romantic feelings. Claire has left several unanswered voice mail messages for her estranged sister, Emma, indicating she wants to reconcile. She goes to Emma's house, but no one seems to be home. Claire then meets another crash survivor and takes him to see Mr. Arkin. The man angrily blames Arkin for the crash, which he denies. The man suddenly disappears, confusing Claire. Eric notices a dog staring at him from outside, and recognizes the dog as a pet that had died when he was younger. He then returns to the crash site and experiences frightening memories. Meanwhile, Shannon is the only one at the next session. Eric arrives and Claire takes him and Shannon to her apartment. Eric believes he died in the crash. To prove it, he claims he jumped in front of a train and survived uninjured; he tells Claire to leave him alone. When Shannon disappears, a neighbor says she left with a man and woman. Claire goes to her supervisor who is convinced she has latched onto the conspiracy theory. At Emma's house, Claire sees Mr. Arkin, who says pilot error caused the crash. Arkin departs but leaves his briefcase behind. Claire becomes hysterical after finding a ledger inside listing all the passengers, including her, who died in the crash. Mr. Arkin was the pilot. Claire finds Eric on his boat. He explains that he withheld telling her that they and the other passengers died in the crash because everyone had to discover it individually. Deceased people and even pets from their pasts (unrecognized by the recently deceased) helped them to understand and accept death. The people Claire spoke to (including her aunt, the kindly neighbor) were dead friends or relatives. She and Eric sail from the harbor to cross over to heaven. A flashback shows Claire and Eric in adjacent seats on the plane, along with the other passengers and crew. During the flight, Claire and Eric develop an attraction. When the plane depressurizes, Eric assures her they will be alright just before the screen fades to white. The film ends with the landlord letting Emma and her husband into Claire's apartment. Emma finds a note Claire was planning to send to make peace with her.

GlaxoSmithKline, its successor company, used the Allen and Hanburys name for the specialist respiratory division until beginning to phase it out in 2013. History The business was founded in 1715 in Old Plough Court, Lombard Street, London, by Silvanus Bevan, a Welshman, apothecary and a Quaker. Bevan and his brother, Timothy, who became his partner and later succeeded him, were known for their just dealings and the integrity and quality of their drugs. The company grew into a respected pharmaceutical centre and had established a strong reputation with American doctors by the late 18th century. The West Indies was also an important destination for their products. William Allen, FRS, also a Quaker, and a well known scientist, joined the firm in 1792 and rose quickly to become the dominant personality. His second wife was a member of the Hanbury family ‚Äì who had produced several learned scientists. On Allen's death, the Hanbury family assumed control of the company. Tin for \\"Allenburys\\" blackcurrant pastillesDaniel Hanbury, FRS a pharmacologist, and also a partner, was instrumental in making the name of Allen and Hanburys still more well known due to his correspondence with scientists all over the world. Growth of the company was continuous, but it was in the second part of the 19th century that developments on a large scale took place. Factories were built at Ware, Hertfordshire, and Bethnal Green in East London. The factory at Ware specialised in infants' foods, dietetic products, medicated pastilles, malt preparations as well as galenical preparations, beginning production in 1892. The brands included Allenburys N¬∫1 and N¬∫2 foods (essentially milk foods for babies up to six months), and Allenburys N¬∫ 3 (malted farinaceous food, six months and older). Allenburys Diet was a \\"stimulating beverage\\" for invalids, convalescents and the aged. Allenburys Rusks were a suitable first solid food for infants. Allenburys claimed to be pioneers in Great Britain in the production of pastilles, and thus the Ware factory also produced Allenburys Glycerine and Black Currant Pastilles, amongst another 80 different kinds of medicated and crystallised pastilles. Later design of tin for \\"Allenburys\\" blackcurrant pastillesMalt preparations and malt extract were also made at Ware, including \\"Byno\\" preparations, malt extract with cod liver oil. Some appeared under the name of Allenburys Bynol, Torch, Brand Malt and Oil, often specially packed for chemists and other dealers bearing their own name and address. Allen and Hanburys was one of the first manufacturers of cod liver oil in Great Britain, and owned factories in the Lofoten Islands (Norway) as well as at Hull and Aberdeen taking cod directly from the North Sea. The Bethnal Green factory carried much of the administrative and scientific side of the business, which included research, analytical control, chemistry, pharmacy and pharmacology. In this plant, galenical preparations, pills, tablets, capsules and other classes of pharmaceutical and medical goods were prepared. The Bethnal Green plant also produced surgical instruments, mainly in stainless steel, and included \\"Barts\\" operating tables. Another product was the Cromwell House Super Sensitive Baby Scale (weighing scales made from cast iron) designed for accurately weighing babies during test feeding or research. The company had overseas branches in Lindsay, Ontario, Durban, India, Shanghai, Australia and Buenos Aires, and agencies in many other countries. The company address was for many years at 37 Lombard Street, London EC. Allen & Hanburys launched the first selective Œ≤2-receptor agonist, Ventolin (i.e. salbutamol), in 1968. The drug was an instant success, and has been used to treat asthma ever since. Calendar blotter advertising The \\"Allenburys\\" milk foods, from London 1905.

This clumping erect perennial grass is native to North America, where it is widespread across most of Canada and along the western United States into California. It is a plant of the plains as well as forested, mountainous, alpine environments. Danthonia intermedia in mountain meadow at The bunchgrass reaches about half a meter in height at maximum. Its leaves are short and mostly basal. Each inflorescence is a narrow cluster of up to about ten spikelets, each spikelet holding 3 to 6 florets. The flowers are cleistogamous, meaning they remain closed and pollinate themselves. This grass also sometimes undergoes apomixis, reproduction without fertilization. This independence of the need for pollination between individuals is one reason why this grass is so widespread and able to tolerate a variety of climates. This is a desirable grass for grazing land because it begins growing earlier in the spring than most other grasses, and it tolerates heavy grazing better than some other grasses because of its basal meristem, that is, new growth occurs low on the grass instead of on the tip where it can be chewed off. This grass is an indicator of ecological climax in many ecosystems.

It is a diurnal moth characterized by a black body, light colored legs, and red spots on its wings. The caterpillars are a yellow-green color and usually molt out of dormancy in late February to early March. The larvae feed on plants from the family Fabaceae until they enter their pupal stage and mature into adults in May to early June. For mating, Zygaenidae exhibit a dual- partner finding strategy, where females use pheromones while assuming a calling position, and males exhibit a patrolling behavior where they utilize both vision and the olfactory receptors in their antennae to locate a potential mate. Although regionally endangered as their population is declining, Z. loti is found all across Europe, inhabiting areas rich in their desired food plants: lime-rich, and characterized by a hot and dry climate. The decreases in their population are likely due to factors such as habitat loss and fragmentation brought on by commercial agriculture and urbanization, as well as global climate change. There are few conservation programs currently focusing on Zygaena loti.

This moth in particular displays a sexual dimorphism, in which the wings of females are scaled much lighter than their male conspecifics and they possess a double white ruff. Frontwings are grayish-blue in the males, yellow-gray in the females, with six red spots which partly flow together. The kidney-shaped spot at the tip of the forewings consists in fact of the fifth and sixth spots, which have grown together. The hindwings are red and have a black border.Lepiforum.de This species is rather similar to Zygaena exulans, Zygaena filipendulae and Zygaena lonicerae. The caterpillars can reach a length of about . They are olive-green or yellow-green, with two yellow and two black dots on each segment and short white hairs.  Life cycle  The life cycle of Zygaena loti has not been well observed, but from the available literature the following likely life cycle can be constructed. The moth is characterized as an early burnet with caterpillars molting out of diapause in late February to early March. The caterpillars hide during the day in moss layers or herbage containing small, short plants less than 6 cm tall. There they also construct or spin their cocoons (oval-shaped, dull dirty whitish color) to enter their pupal stage. later mature into adult moths in May to early June. As adults, their flight time is somewhere from late May to early August depending on eclosion. Since they are diurnal, they only fly during the day. After mating, females will lay their eggs on larval food plants, such as the ones listed below, and the resulting larvae will feed from approximately August to early May, overwintering once and sometimes twice in their larval diapaused state. = Food resources = For larvae, there are some contrasting findings, but all observed food plants that Z. loti caterpillars have been found on are from the family Fabaceae, such as Hippocrepis comosa, Lotus corniculatus, Securigera varia, and Onobrychis vicilfolia. For adult moths, even less has been recorded about their diets. Males may nectar on milkworts and thyme, while females may nectar on the flowers of the plants they ate in their larval stage (those listed above).  Reproduction  While there is not much evidence pertaining to Zygaena loti's reproductive strategies in particular, there have been studies involving that species and other Zygaenidae that have looked at the mating routine of the family as a whole. Zygaenidae exhibit a dual partner-finding strategy, which is typical for most moths. That essentially means that both the females and the males are involved in the process of finding a mate. Females possess pheromone glands in their ovipositor, which is positioned at the tip of their abdomen. From those glands, they release a certain pheromone meant to attract their male conspecifics. There is evidence pointing towards females not using pheromones in the morning hours of the day, but more research is needed to confirm that as fact. Females also exhibit a calling behavior. This involves the females in a calling position where the region containing the sex pheromone gland is left exposed, allowing for the release of the pheromone. In Zygaenidae, most female moths will call for five to ten hours a day until they have found a mate. For males, they exhibit what is called patrolling behavior, a behavior observed to only occur in the morning. In the morning, when the males are patrolling, they detect females via vision at long distances, but in the afternoon, they use the olfactory receptors on the ends of their antennae which are sensitive to the pheromones of their female conspecifics. Males may also release their own pheromones when in close proximity to a potential mate, but once again, more research is needed. Once mating has occurred, females will lay their eggs on larval foodplants, usually Fabaceaes. Studies have shown that a specific microclimate may be vital to the females when deciding where to lay their eggs, but as far as most research has shown, females lay their eggs in bare soil around herbage vital to the larvae's diet. In the close range phase of courtship, while the role of pheromones is not well known, it has been determined that visual cues from both the male and the female are important. Experts acknowledge the gap in literature and need for more research on the mating activity of Zygaenidae and have expressed the importance of studying the chemical communication of diurnal butterflies and moths for natural resource management when dealing with invasive species and conservation efforts of endangered species. Pheromones have been used many times to study Lepidopteran species and can be used to monitor and study rare Zygaenids such as the Zygaena loti.  Geographic range and habitat  The geographic distribution of Zygaena loti is well documented, but not uniform across research studies. Some documentation cites Zygaena loti to be mainly in western Scotland and solely confined to the Isles Mull and Ulva. The research that claims this however is only looks at the subspecies scotica. The animals in the family Zygaenidae are actually widespread across the European continent. More specifically, Zygaena loti is found in most of Europe, except Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Fennoscandia, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia.Fauna Europaea This species has been spotted in Spain on the Iberian peninsula, across central and southern Europe, and to Siberia. While it is not very common in northern Europe, there is an isolated population in Scotland. They used to be widely distributed, creating a network of interconnected communities, but due to habitat loss as a likely result of an increase use of land for agriculture, most Z. loti and Zygaenidae populations have become fragmented and isolated from each other. The isolation that these moths are subjected to has led to high levels of genetic differentiation between populations. The current status of the moth's total distribution range since the 1970s is declining. Although fairly widespread, Z. loti can only survive in a restricted range of habitats, making them a good indicator for environmental change, a factor that many conservationists have focused on. This moth is usually restricted to xerothermic environments, meaning it thrives in a hot and dry climate. They also greatly prefer lime-rich conditions. Such suitable habitats may include flowering meadows, clearings, subalpine or rocky slopes, scrubland, forest edges, limestone background, or dry grassland, usually at an elevation up to above sea level.Funet - Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms For Zygaenidae in general, the Alps and Pyrenees are considered to be biodiversity hotspots.  Conservation status and efforts  Zygaena loti is not endangered and is considered a common burnet moth. Regionally, however, this species of Zygaenidae is decreasing due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Such habitat loss is likely because of an increase in large-scale agriculture and urbanization. Being that Z. loti require a certain climate (dry and hot) and have certain conditions for their chosen habitat (lime-rich and herb-rich), human intervention in acceptable habitats has led to the further isolation and fragmentation of this moth species, causing a decrease in their distribution range; however, Z. loti continue to survive in fragmented habitats with reduced gene flow. That reduced gene flow causes a decrease in genetic diversities but an increase in genetic differentiation between populations and an increase in inbreeding as well. While loss of suitable land is a big factor to consider, there is also the matter of global climate change and global warming, which has caused an observed latidinal shift in many Lepitopteran species, although there is no current studies on how climate change and global warming has affected Z. loti. With habitat loss and climate change working together and against the isolated moth populations, research has suggested that Zygaena loti's regional endangerment is not due to habitat loss, but due to genetic distortion resulting from too rapid habitat change, meaning that Z. loti may not be able to evolve at the appropriate pace needed for its survival. There has been a lot of studies dedicated to the conservation of this family of moths and one of the recommendations that sticks out that most in increasing habitat connectivity between populations to increase gene flow and save Zygaena loti from possible extinction. The majority of the research literature on Zygaena loti is based on conservation efforts that may be useful in helping the isolated moth species. As mentioned previously, many studies recommend that the only way to save Z. loti is to reconnect the fragmented habitats and populations of the moth to increase gene flow between populations, restoring the once large, interconnected network of Zygaenidae and its high genetic diversity. A smaller study focused more on the idea of restoring suitable habitats by reducing agricultural use of mineral fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides, which was hypothesized to be one of the factors causing the decline of Z. loti and a decrease in food plant availability. That same study also recommended that work needed to be done to maintain current suitable habitats by preventing the overgrowth of those xerothermic clearings and grasslands. One way to accomplish that is mowing. Research has shown that the effects of manual mowing can be positive. By using butterflies and moths as a rapidly responding indicator of its effects, manual mowing was shown to increase species richness and composition in the habitats where it was implicated, quickly leading to a habitat with a high conservation value. In a study on the effects of reintroduced manual mowing, it was concluded that mowing may present a great resource and tool for increasing the abundance of Lepitopteran species and promoting potentially endangered species such as Zygaena loti. There are relatively few current, ongoing conservation programs geared towards saving Zygaena loti from extinction, but there are two worth mentioning. The Moths Count Project/The National Moth Recording Scheme is run in the United Kingdom and has the simple goal of recording all observed moth species as a way to spread knowledge and promote the conservation of the recorded species. Then there is the Scotland Rural Development Programme, which aims, among other priorities, to protect and improve the environment through certain conservation efforts and to address climate change in rural Scotland. This program's conservation schemes are a model for the assessment of worldwide biodiversity conservation programs. It is important to set clear objectives and assess the cost-effectiveness of a program against those objectives. While there is some conservation programs out there, experts acknowledge that there are large gaps in the research literature on Zygaena loti and other species that prevents much to be done to prevent possible extinction. More research is needed on Z. loti.

Tomkis was the son of a Staffordshire clergyman. He matriculated in Trinity College, Cambridge in 1597. Tomkis earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1600, and his Master of Arts degree in 1604; he became a minor fellow of Trinity College in 1602, and a major fellow in 1604.} He remained at the college until 1610, when he moved to Wolverhampton and set up a successful legal practice. His college called him back five years later, to prepare an entertainment of King James I. Tomkis is credited with two academic plays of the early seventeenth century: Lingua (published 1607) and Albumazar (published 1615). He is also regarded as a likely author of Pathomachia (published 1630). Tomkis represented an important break in the academic drama of the two universities: he wrote in English rather than the traditional Latin. The accessibility of his works facilitated their popularity: Lingua was printed in six editions between 1607 and 1657, while Albumazar went through five editions between 1615 and 1668.E. K.

The Right Reverend Alfred Magill Randolph, first bishop of the Diocese of Southern Virginia, preached the first sermon in the new church building. The Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin was one of the Church's most notable rectors as he accepted a call to Bruton Parish from Saint John's in 1903 and went on to play the instrumental roles in enlisting the Rockefeller aid for the restoration of Williamsburg. The pulpit, dating to 1828 was a gift from Bruton Parish. The brass eagle lectern is a memorial to Dr. Duncan Brown, first superintendent of schools from the city of Petersburg. The organ fa√ßade is from the Hook and Hastings organ which was used until the 1950s. The Reverend Churchill Gibson was called as rector three separate times and a marble tablet dedicated to his service at Saint John's marks the entrance to the Good Shepherd Chapel. A marble tablet on the east wall is a memorial to the young men and women who served in World War II. The baptismal font, a memorial gift by the congregation to a senior warden and lay leader who had devoted thirty faithful years to that service, has been used to baptize hundreds down through the year, including Joseph Cotten. The Good Shepherd Chapel is a permanent memorial to the Good Shepherd Chapel which stood at the corner of Washington Street and Crater Road until a storm imposed irreparable damage. The Adoring Angels windows were salvaged and installed over the chapel altar at Saint John's. The bishop's chair was also brought to Saint John's. Good Shepherd was originally built as a memorial to David Brydon Tennant, a prominent Petersburg tobacconist, by his wife. The original cornerstone stands in the garden of Saint John's today.

He played college football at Ohio State University. Early years Martin attended McKinley High School, where he was a two-way player. As a senior, he started at fullback and outside linebacker, tallying 59 carries for 368 yards (6.2-yard avg), 5 touchdowns, 59 tackles and 5 sacks. He also helped his team achieve a 14-0 record and the Ohio Big School State Championship. College career Martin accepted a football scholarship from Ohio State University, where he became a dominant blocker at fullback. He started 6 games as a sophomore, blocking for Michael Wiley. Against the University of Michigan, he had a career-high 35 rushing yards, that included a 21-yard run and a one-yard touchdown. As a junior, he was the regular starter at fullback, blocking for Derek Combs and helping the team post a total of 2,199 rushing yards. As a senior he was a team co-captain, blocking for Jonathan Wells, while registering 22 carries for 86 yards, 13 receptions for 120 yards and 2 touchdowns. He finished his career with 61 carries for 226 yards (4.0 avg) and 4 rushing touchdowns in 47 games (29 starts). He also had 22 receptions for 211 yards (9.6 avg) and 2 receiving touchdowns.

As a rookie, he suffered a right ACL tear during the first contact drill in training camp on July 29 and was placed on the injured reserve list on August 27. In 2001, he played in 14 games mainly on the special teams units and as a backup to Richie Anderson. He had his first career start in the thirteenth game against the Philadelphia Eagles, helping the team rush for a total of 150 yards. The next game against the Washington Redskins, he returned to a reserve role, but still contributed to Troy Hambrick rushing for 189 yards, which at the time was the third best single-game performance in franchise history. It has been speculated that he was never the same player following his injury and was eventually waived on September 5, 2004, when the team opted to keep Darian Barnes in his place. =Miami Dolphins= On September 6, 2004, the Miami Dolphins claimed him off waivers.

He worked under three political systems in his 30 year career as one of the most gifted and successful criminologists in the German Reich. Among other things, he worked on the cases of Fritz Haarmann and Peter K√ºrten.  Biography  In his childhood, he lived with his parents in a staff housing of the correctional facility in Berlin-Pl√∂tzensee. He graduated from high school on September 13, 1898, and entered the faculty of law of the Frederick William University on October 18, 1901. In the years in between one can assume that he served in the military (which he noted as profession on subscription to the university). On July 12, 1905, he left the university without a degree, shortly before the end of the semester on August 15. The reason was his career in the police - he had entered the police service in 1904 and passed the examination to criminal police officer on May 30, 1905. Two days later he started as detective assistant and he was promoted to criminal detective on August 1. When Gennat entered the criminal police, there was no separate homicide division. It was only on August 25, 1902 that an on-call homicide service was created. That had not even changed when the Berlin police was reorganized on June 1, 1925. Only on the basis of Gennat's efforts was a homicide squad created. This event made possible his promotion to lieutenant inspector (at the age of 45). He had been passed over for promotion beforehand owing to his massive criticism of the conditions in the criminal department. After creation of the Zentrale Mordinspektion (central homicide inspection) the division achieved enormous success under Gennat's leadership. In 1931, the homicide inspection was solving 108 of 114 crimes making for 94.7 percent (compared to 85 to 95 percent in today's homicide inspection work). Gennat himself worked on solving 298 homicide cases. His department was organized as one standing inspection team with two backup teams. The active team had one senior and one junior homicide inspector accompanied by 4 to 10 criminal police officers, a stenotypist and a dog handler. The backup teams had a senior and junior homicide inspector (bound in a so-called \\"Mord-Ehe\\" / homicide marriage) plus 2 to 3 police officers and a stenotypist. The composition of the active team changed every four weeks to ensure that each officer gained enough experience. Gennat reorganized much of the structure of how to investigate homicide. He developed most of the scheme that is known today as profiling. His work is documented in articles for the public like the 1930 publication \\"Die D√ºsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen\\" about Peter K√ºrten, where Gennat coined the term \\"Serienm√∂rder\\" (serial killer). During the Third Reich, he was able to continue his work despite keeping a distance from the Nazi Party. Based on his success, he was even promoted to department director in 1934 and vice director of the Berlin police in 1935. He married criminal inspector Elfriede Dinger shortly before his death on August 20, 1939 (he had cancer but his sudden death makes a stroke more likely). In culture Ernst Gennat inspired the fictional character inspector Karl Lohmann who appeared first in Fritz Lang's M (1931) and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1932). German actor Udo Samel plays Gennat in the second and third seasons of the TV show Babylon Berlin.  Literature  * Karl Berg: Der Sadist, Der Fall Peter K√ºrten.

History  The regime was established in 1975, after Portuguese Angola, an autonomous State, was granted independence from Portugal through the Alvor Agreement. The situation in Portugal's other former large African autonomous State, the People's Republic of Mozambique, was similar. The newly-founded nation had friendly relations with the Soviet Union, Cuba, and the People's Republic of Mozambique. The country was governed by the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which was responsible for the transition into a Marxist-Leninist one-party state. The group was backed by both Cuba and the Soviet Union, as well as from the Warsaw Pact countries. The Angolan government managed its oil windfall effectively. The trade balance remained profitable and external debt was kept within reasonable limits. In 1985, debt service amounted to $324 million, or about 15% of exports.Fernando Andresen Guimar√°es, The Origins of the Angolan Civil War : Foreign Intervention and Domestic Political Conflict, Basingstoke & Londres, Houndsmills, 1998. A major effort was made in the field of adult education and literacy, particularly in urban centres. In 1986, the number of primary school students exceeded one and a half million, and nearly half a million adults learned to read and write. The language of instruction remained mainly Portuguese, but experiments were tried to introduce the study of local African languages from the first years of schooling. Relations between the churches and the ruling party remained relatively calm. An opposing group, known as the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas Savimbi, sparked a civil war with the MPLA, with the backing from both apartheid South Africa and the United States, establishing the Democratic People's Republic of Angola in opposition to the People's Republic of Angola. The United States did everything they could in order to prevent the spread of communism in Africa and this is the largest example. This civil war represented one of the most violent proxy conflicts of the Cold War, resulting in 1.4-1.5 million deaths in the years spanning from 1975 to 2001, and causing the internal displacement of more than 4 million people. In January 1984, an agreement was negotiated. South Africa obtained from Angola a promise to withdraw its support for the SWAPO (Namibian independence movement established in Angola since 1975) in exchange for the evacuation of South African troops from Angola. Despite this agreement, South Africa, under the pretext of pursuing SWAPO guerrillas, conducted large-scale operations on Angolan soil whenever UNITA was under attack by Angolan government forces. In parallel, South Africa organised attacks in Angola. In May 1985, an Angolan patrol intercepted a South African special forces unit in Malongo that was about to sabotage oil installations. The United States provided Stinger surface-to-air missiles to rebels through the Kamina base in southern Zaire, a base that the United States considered permanently reactivating. US assistance also included anti-tank weapons to enable UNITA to better resist the Luanda Army's increasingly threatening offensives against areas still under its control in the east and south-east of the country. In the 1980s, South Africa continued to support UNITA, and the Luanda government lost hope of a military victory in the short term. In 1988, the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, where Cuban-backed MPLA forces defeated South African air superiority, marked a decisive turning point for the region: Namibia's independence, the inexorable decline of the segregationist regime. This led the President of the African National Congress, Jacob Zuma, who was invited to the 20th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Cuito on 23 March 2008, to say that \\"the contribution of the MPLA and the Angolan people to the struggle for the abolition of apartheid in South Africa is second to none in any country on the continent\\".https://jacqver.pagesperso- orange.fr/texte/apresguerreetornoirenangola.htm In 1991, the MPLA and UNITA signed the peace agreement known as the Bicesse Accords, which allowed for multiparty elections in Angola. In 1992, the People's Republic of Angola was constitutionally succeeded by the Republic of Angola and elections were held. However, the peace agreement did not last, as Savimbi rejected the election results and fighting resumed across the country until his death in 2002.

It was his first professional sale, written when he was twenty-two years old. It became the title piece in Matheson's first short story collection in 1954.\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, August 1954, p.95 Plot summary The story is written in the form of an internal \\"diary\\" in broken English kept by what the reader presumes is a deformed child (gender unspecified) chained in the basement by its violently abusive parents (the story makes it clear that the man and woman who have imprisoned the child are its biological parents when the child recalls the man commenting about how, in stark contrast to the child, \\"Mother [is] so pretty and me decent[-looking] enough.\\"). The child-narrator can sometimes pull its chain from the wall and observe the outside world through the basement window. On one occasion it even manages to sneak upstairs, although it has difficulty because its body drips green fluid that causes its feet to stick to the stairs. It eavesdrops on a dinner party but is discovered by its parents, returned to the basement, and violently beaten. On another occasion it climbs to a small window and observes a little girl (possibly its \\"normal\\" sister, who is apparently unaware of the chained child's existence), playing with other little girls and boys, whom the narrator, having no concept of ordinary childhood, can only describe as \\"little mothers\\" and \\"little fathers\\". One of the boys sees the child at the window, and it is again beaten as a result. In a final incident, the girl brings her pet cat (which the chained child can only describe as a creature with \\"pointy ears\\") into the basement. The chained child hides from them in a coal bin, but when the cat discovers the child and hisses at it, the child crushes the cat to death. The story ends with the child-narrator, again being beaten, knocking a stick from its father's hands, which sends the suddenly frightened man fleeing upstairs. The child resolves that if its parents abuse it again, it will turn violent, as it had once before, noting that it ran along the walls and hung down \\"with all [its] legs\\", revealing that the child is far more deformed than the reader may have presumed, and in fact an actual \\"monster\\". Reception \\"Born of Man and Woman\\" was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. In 2001, it was a finalist for the Retro-Hugo Award for Best Short Story for 1951.1951 Retro-Hugo Awards , at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved August 11, 2018 Sequel A sequel to the story, \\"She Screech Like Me\\" by Michael A. Arnzen, was published in 2009. In this story the parents have been killed by the child, and its sister, who is not upset, hides the child from the world. The children's maternal grandmother arrives at the home and delights in the child, but shows an aversion to the normal daughter. The grandmother locks the daughter in the cellar, telling the child that she is not \\"like us\\" and then teaches the child (who is implied to be female) its name.Arnzen, Michael A. \\"She Screech Like Me.\\" He Is Legend: An Anthology Celebrating Richard Matheson.

Dual-phase steel (DP steel) is a high-strength steel that has a ferritic‚Äìmartensitic microstructure. DP steels are produced from low or medium carbon steels that are quenched from a temperature above A1 but below A3 determined from continuous cooling transformation diagram. This results in a microstructure consisting of a soft ferrite matrix containing islands of martensite as the secondary phase (martensite increases the tensile strength). Therefore, the overall behaviour of DP steels is governed by the volume fraction, morphology (size, aspect ratio, interconnectivity, etc.), the grain size and the carbon content.. For achieving these microstructures, DP steels typically contain 0.06‚Äì0.15 wt.% C and 1.5-3% Mn (the former strengthens the martensite, and the latter causes solid solution strengthening in ferrite, while both stabilize the austenite), Cr & Mo (to retard pearlite or bainite formation), Si (to promote ferrite transformation), V and Nb (for precipitation strengthening and microstructure refinement).. The desire to produce high strength steels with formability greater than microalloyed steel led the development of DP steels in the 1970s... DP steels have high ultimate tensile strength (UTS, enabled by the martensite) combined with low initial yielding stress (provided by the ferrite phase), high early-stage strain hardening and macroscopically homogeneous plastic flow (enabled through the absence of L√ºders effects). These features render DP steels ideal materials for automotive-related sheet forming operations. The steel melt is produced in an oxygen top blowing process in the converter, and undergoes an alloy treatment in the secondary metallurgy phase. The product is aluminium-killed steel, with high tensile strength achieved by the composition with manganese, chromium and silicon. Their advantages are as follows:. *Low yield strength *Low yield to tensile strength ratio (yield strength / tensile strength = 0.5) *High initial strain hardening rates *Good uniform elongation *A high strain rate sensitivity (the faster it is crushed the more energy it absorbs) *Good fatigue resistance Due to these properties DP steels are often used for automotive body panels, wheels, and bumpers.

The castle was in the medieval town, overlooking a ford over the River Mersey. It was first documented in 1173, but the next mention of it is in 1535 when it was in ruins. What remained of the castle was demolished in 1775. Location Stockport Castle was an urban castle in the town of Stockport. The medieval town was on the south side of a valley at the confluence of the rivers Goyt and Tame, where they form the River Mersey. The site of the castle is a sandstone spur, overlooking a ford ().

History The first mention of Stockport Castle comes from 1173, when Geoffrey de Costentyn held it against Henry II during the barons' rebellion of 1173‚Äì1174. There is a local tradition that Geoffrey de Constentyn was the son of Henry II, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany; in fact, Geoffrey de Constentyn was a local lord who not only owned the manor of Stockport, but land in Staffordshire and Ireland. The bailey would originally have been defended by a wooden palisade and earthworks; these were replaced by stone walls at the beginning of the 13th century. Two fragments of the wall survive. Dent suggests that the castle began to decline in the 14th century when the Warren family became Lords of the Manor of Stockport; Stockport was not the only manor that the family owned, and they favoured the manor of Poynton over that of Stockport. The castle falling out of use mirrors a trend with the other castles in the Greater Manchester area; by the 13th century, apart from Dunham Castle, there was no indication of activity in castles in Greater Manchester. According to antiquarian John Leland, the castle lay in ruins by 1535. At this stage, the gaol was still present and a market was held in the castle's bailey. The castle grounds had been divided and rented out by the Lord of the Manor. The ruins were levelled in 1775 by Sir George Warren, the lord of the manor, and a cotton mill built on the site. In 1974, excavations of the motte were carried out to establish how long the castle had been occupied. Layout A motte- and-bailey castle was a common type of fortification in medieval England. It consisted of a usually artificial mound surmounted by a tower or keep, with a large defended enclosed area next to the mound and was usually used for storage and barracks. Stockport Castle's motte was where Castle Yard is today, although it was previously called Castle Hill, influencing the name of the area. The bailey was situated south-east of the motte. The castle was probably similar in size and shape to castles such as Launceston in Cornwall and Pontefract in West Yorkshire. The keep surmounting the motte was irregularly shaped, and according to plans drawn in 1775 by the Reverend John Watson, a local antiquarian, measured . No trace of the keep remains from the levelling of the area in 1775 and 1853.

Nicole Josy (born 21 October 1946 as Nicole Van Palm, Wemmel) and Hugo Sigal (born 10 November 1947 as Hugo Verbraeken, Leopoldstad/L√©opoldville (now Kinshasa) met in 1970. They became romantically involved and formed a singing duet. In 1971, they entered into the national final for the Eurovision Song Contest. They won the Belgian final with \\"Goeiemorgen, morgen\\" (\\"Good morning, morning\\" in Dutch). Prior to their departure to Dublin for the international competition, Nicole fell ill with jaundice and the duo were unable to attend. They were replaced in their absence by Jacques Raymond and Lily Castel. Jacques and Lily finished in 14th place from a field of 18 contestants. On 1 December 1971, Nicole & Hugo got married at Wemmel. Two years later they succeeded in participating in the Eurovision Song Contest finals when \\"Baby, Baby\\" won the Belgian national pre- selection. The song became a hit in the Flanders region of Belgium, but it was not a success in the rest of Europe. At the Eurovision Song Contest (held in Luxembourg on 7 April 1973) they finished in last place. Their performance was memorable, however, because of their purple flared jump suits and also their dance routine. In the World Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, their fortunes improved: They came second with the song \\"With the Summer\\" in 1974. They also received the Outstanding Composition Award at the same festival. During the 1970s, they toured extensively internationally. In 1984, they accepted an offer to entertain on cruise ships, sailing around the world in the process. On 20 October 1990 they were awarded with a medal by the Belgian Authors Society SABAM for their contributions to the Flemish entertainment industry. In 2004, they tried again, after 29 years, at the Eurovision Song Contest. They entered the Flemish pre-selections, with \\"Love is all Around\\". They placed second in the first round, but scored lowly with the jury, so failed to make it to the final round. In 2005, they appeared on Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest, the 50th anniversary show of the Eurovision Song Contest. They appeared in all of the compilation videos and finally appeared on stage in the 1973 costumes. They then sang a shortened version of \\"Baby, Baby\\". Nicole & Hugo are still recording and bringing out new CDs on a regular basis. They also made guest appearances in television series, such as F.C. De Kampioenen. In 2008 the couple released their latest album Eeuwig Geluk including the hit singles \\"Pastorale\\", \\"Ol√© Ola\\" and others. Most of the lyrics have been written by singer/songwriter Hans Lambrechts.

Early life Charlie Barr was born in Gourock, Scotland in 1864 and first apprenticed as a grocer before working as a commercial fisherman. In 1884, he took a job with his older brother John, delivering a sailing yacht, Clara, to America. Clara's racing success was such that in 1887, John was selected to skipper the Scottish challenger, Thistle, the representative of the Royal Clyde Yacht Club; Charlie served as a member of the crew. Thistle was soundly defeated by Volunteer. In the process, however, the brothers Barr were introduced to Nathanael Herreshoff, and Charlie Barr's yachting career was launched. Charlie Barr would sail Herreshoff designs for much of the rest of his professional sailing life. America's Cup success Captain Charles Barr was skipper of the yacht Columbia in 1899 and defeated Sir Thomas Lipton's Shamrock. Two years later, in 1901, Charlie Barr was again at the helm against a Lipton sponsored yacht, Shamrock II, a Watson-designed cutter. In 1903, Barr was the captain of the winning yacht Reliance, one of the most famous racing yachts to be designed by Nathanael Herreshoff. Barr was inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 1993 and into the National Sailing Hall of Fame at San Diego yacht club, Point Loma, California, on 23 October 2011. Atlantic record He is best known for setting the record for the fastest crossing by a sailing yacht of the Atlantic Ocean on the schooner Atlantic in the 1905 Kaiser's Cup Transatlantic Race. Barr made his crossing in 12 days, 4 hours, 1 minute, 19 seconds, an outright racing record that stood 75 years until Eric Tabarly's 1980 crossing on his aluminium trimaran Paul Ricard. Barr's monohull record stood for nearly 100 years until beaten in 1997 by the yacht Nicorette completing the crossing in 11 days 13 hours 22 minutes. Barr died whilst visiting Southampton, England on 24 January 1911; he is buried in Southampton Old Cemetery. Barr was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011.

The crew is shocked to discover a Rockwellian small town, eerily similar to those they left on Earth. The strangely familiar people in the town believe it is 1926. Crew members soon discover old friends and deceased relatives in the town. Those who had been ordered to stay behind and guard the rocket abandon their posts in order to join the reunions and festivities. Members of the crew split up to spend the night in the homes of their lost comrades and relatives. The ship's captain remains skeptical, and realizes in the middle of the night that the entire situation may have been contrived by telepathic aliens to lower the Earthmen's guards.

Fire The Ellis Hotel (previously The Winecoff) is best known for a fire that occurred there on December 7, 1946, in which 119 people died. It remains the deadliest hotel fire in U.S. history, and prompted many changes in building codes. Guests at the hotel that night included teenagers attending a Hi-Y and Tri-Hi-Y Youth-in-Government conference (Youth Assembly) sponsored by the State YMCA of Georgia, Christmas shoppers, and people in town to see Song of the South.

Over a ten-year period of time she underwent seven surgeries and lost a leg. Under these circumstances, she still worked until her retirement. Reopenings Ellis Hotel In April 1951, the hotel reopened as the Peachtree Hotel on Peachtree, and was now equipped with both fire alarms and automated sprinkler systems. In 1967, it was donated to the Georgia Baptist Convention for housing the elderly, and then repeatedly sold to a series of potential developers. The gutted lobby served as a souvenir shop during the 1996 Summer Olympics. After over two decades of vacancy, a $23 million renovation project began in April 2006.

Properties A consequence of (W, M, M‚àí) being a semi-s-cobordism is that the kernel of the derived homomorphism on fundamental groups K = \\\\ker(\\\\pi_1(M^{-}) \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\pi_1(W)) is perfect. A corollary of this is that \\\\pi_1(M^{-}) solves the group extension problem 1 \\\\rightarrow K \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi_1(M^{-}) \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi_1(M) \\\\rightarrow 1. The solutions to the group extension problem for proscribed quotient group \\\\pi_1(M) and kernel group K are classified up to congruence (see Homology by MacLane, e.g.), so there are restrictions on which n-manifolds can be the right-hand boundary of a semi-s-cobordism with proscribed left-hand boundary M and superperfect kernel group K. Relationship with Plus cobordisms Note that if (W, M, M‚àí) is a semi-s- cobordism, then (W, M‚àí, M) is a Plus cobordism. (This justifies the use of M‚àí for the right-hand boundary of a semi-s-cobordism, a play on the traditional use of M+ for the right-hand boundary of a Plus cobordism.) Thus, a semi-s- cobordism may be thought of as an inverse to Quillen's Plus construction in the manifold category. Note that (M‚àí)+ must be diffeomorphic (respectively, piecewise-linearly (PL) homeomorphic) to M but there may be a variety of choices for (M+)‚àí for a given closed smooth (respectively, PL) manifold M.

Angola and Vietnam have steadfast partners as both transitioned from Cold War-era foreign policies of international communism to pro-Western pragmatism following the fall of the Soviet Union.  Early ties  In February 1974, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLFSV) commended the 1961 attack on Cassanje, the first battle of Angola's war of independence. In January 1975, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªç, the leader of NLFSV, gave his \\"warmest greetings\\" to the leaders of the (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)) following the signing of the Alvor Accords.

Vietnam War The Vietnam War tempered foreign involvement in Angola's civil war as neither the Soviet Union nor the United States wanted to be drawn into an internal conflict of highly debatable importance in terms of winning the Cold War. CBS Newscaster Walter Cronkite spread this message in his broadcasts to \\"try to play our small part in preventing that mistake this time.\\" The Politburo engaged in heated debate over the extent to which the Soviet Union would support a continued offensive by the MPLA in February 1976. Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Premier Alexei Kosygin led a faction favoring less support for the MPLA and greater emphasis on preserving d√©tente with the West. Leonid Brezhnev, the then head of the Soviet Union, won out against the dissident faction and the Soviet alliance with the MPLA continued even as Neto publicly reaffirmed its policy of non-alignment at the 15th anniversary of the First Revolt. China and Russia Angola's continued support for the Vietnamese Communists in the face of foreign opposition hurt their relations with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Agostinho Neto, the President of Angola from 1975 to 1979, condemned the Chinese invasion of Vietnam in February 1979. Neto, distrustful of the Soviet leadership after an attempt on his life, stood with Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Havana when he called Angola, Cuba, and Vietnam the ‚Äúmain anti-imperialist core‚Äù in July 1976. Visits and treaties Angolan President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos visited Vietnam in April 1987, Secretary of State Paulo Jorge visited in 1979, Foreign Minister Jo√£o Bernardo de Miranda visited in May 2004, and Chairman of the National Assembly Roberto de Almeida visited Vietnam in October 2004.

Early life Reeves was born in London on 29 May 1893 and was the first of two sons of Arthur Robert Reeves (born 1855) and Clarissa Mary Kynaston (b. 1864). His brother was John Edward. He was married to the Australian Jewish stage actress Paula Sabina. They had two children, Thomas and Suzanne. Career Philip Arthur Reeves, professionally known as P. Kynaston Reeves or Kynaston Reeves, took his mother's maiden name as a middle name when commencing his film career with a small part in the 1931 film Many Waters, before dispensing with the prefixed initial. He believed that having a name that reminded directors of the famous actor Edward Kynaston would help him to get work. In 1932, he progressed to a supporting role, playing an editor called Bob Mitchell alongside Ivor Novello and Jack Hawkins in The Lodger (renamed The Phantom Fiend in 1935). After playing the Reverend Edmund Ovington opposite Otto Kruger in the 1938 film, Housemaster, Reeves developed a speciality for portraying authority figures, such as judges, doctors, professors and clergymen. Television was to provide a valuable source of income. In 1950, Reeves was invited to voice the character of Mr Growser in a BBC Television children's show, The Cruise of The Toytown Belle. This led to further work for the children's department at the BBC, namely in adaptations of Shakespeare's The Tempest (as Alonso, King of Naples) and Philip Wade's Jenny Meade (as Mr Steele), both produced in 1951. Reeves was then offered one of his most notable acting parts on television, namely that of Henry Quelch, form master to the 'Fat Owl of the Remove', Billy Bunter, in the long-running television series Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School. He recorded six episodes in 1952, after which fellow actors Raf De La Torre, John Woodnutt and Jack Melford began sharing the portrayal of this supporting character. Making just a single episode in 1954 (\\"Bunter Won't Go\\"), Reeves then returned to reprise the performance for two more episodes in 1956, and a further four in 1957, following which he gave up the role. This did not end his involvement with BBC productions however, and in 1958 he appeared in the six-part project Leave It To Todhunter (based on the 1937 book \\"Trial and Error\\" by Anthony Berkeley), playing Ambrose Chitterwick in an episode called \\"In Search Of A Corpse\\". In 1959 he played the Duke of Omnium in all six episodes of another series from the BBC, The Eustace Diamonds, adapted from the novel by Anthony Trollope about the London society scandal caused in the 19th century when a diamond necklace goes missing. In 1962, he starred as Thomas Crawford in the Broadway play The Affair. In a rare outing for ABC television, he took the part of Major General Goddard in a 1966 episode of The Avengers TV series, entitled \\"What the Butler Saw\\" and starring Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, but would go on to play an entirely different character called Dickens in the 1968 screening of \\"Legacy Of Death\\", by which time Linda Thorson was portraying John Steed's female sidekick. Reeves also appeared in seven of 26 episodes of the classic BBC television series The Forsyte Saga, broadcast in early 1967, playing Nicholas Forsyte. He could be seen throughout the 1960s in a variety of other popular productions, such as the police serial No Hiding Place, drama anthologies Armchair Theatre and The Wednesday Play and as \\"The Minister\\" in an episode of Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner television series. Reeves' film career continued in parallel with his small screen contributions, and in 1941 he had portrayed Lord Stanley to John Gielgud's Disraeli in the biographical treatment The Prime Minister. In 1948 he played Dr Chawner in the Peter Ustinov tour de force Vice Versa (Ustinov having written, co-produced and directed it), and in the same year he appeared as the Lord Chief Justice of the High Court in The Winslow Boy, which starred Robert Donat. In 1950 he revisited the subject of Disraeli in the film The Mudlark, when he took the part of General Sir Henry Ponsonby in the story of a street urchin (or \\"mudlark\\") who is found in Windsor Castle attempting to talk to Queen Victoria. This time, Disraeli is played by Alec Guinness. In 1957, he took the role of Professor Walgate in the science fiction B film Fiend Without a Face, whose hero was played by Marshall Thompson, and whose plot had Canada attacked by mutated caterpillar-like creatures made of human spines and brains. During a period of steady cinematic work, he also found time to portray a \\"testy old millionaire\\" in Carry On Regardless in 1961. A year before his death in 1971, he made both his final television appearance and his last film. In a dramatic enactment during an edition of the BBC arts magazine Omnibus, he took the part of French painter Renoir in a piece entitled \\"A Requiem for Modigliani\\", describing the final part of the Italian artist's life, and his love affairs. And in the cinema, he fulfilled a small role in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, the 1970 film which starred Robert Stephens and Genevi√®ve Page. Death Reeves died of cerebral thrombosis in Lewisham, London, at the age of 78.

Publication Lingua was entered into the Stationers' Register on 23 February 1607 (new style), and was published later that year in a quarto printed by George Eld for the bookseller Simon Waterson.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 497. The play proved to have unusual long-term popularity for an academic work, and was reprinted in 1610, 1617, 1622, 1632, and 1657. Its use of English rather than the more normal Latin gave Lingua a wider accessibility to a general audience than academic dramas of its era usually had. In 1613 Lingua was translated into a German version titled Speculum Aestheticum, by Johannes Rhenanus; a Dutch translation followed in 1648, by Lambert van den Bosch.Morris P. Tilley, \\"The Comedy Lingua and Sir John Davies's Nosce Teipsum\\", Modern Language Notes Vol. 44 No. 1 (January 1929), p. 36 n. 1. Date The date of the play's stage premiere is uncertain. The play's text itself contains a reference to the year 1602: \\"About the year 1602 many used this skew kind of language\\" (Act III, scene v). Some scholars have supported this date by noting apparent contemporary references and allusions; the personification of \\"Queen Psyche\\" (IV, vii), for example, is the type of compliment to Queen Elizabeth common during her reign, and is logical in play written prior to her 1603 death. Other commentators have demurred, however; apparent allusions to Shakespeare's Macbeth suggest a date closer to the 1607 publication to some critics.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 498. Authorship The early editions of Lingua were all printed with no attribution of authorship. A manuscript list of books and papers from the hand of Sir John Harington assigns the play to Tomkis; and the play's resemblances with Tomkis's Albumazar have persuaded scholars that Harington's attribution of Lingua to Tomkis is correct. Sources Tomkis borrowed and adapted his main plot from the classical myth of the Judgement of Paris; but particular features of his work depend upon more contemporaneous influences, including Spenser's The Faerie Queene,Tilley, \\"The Comedy Lingua and The Faerie Queene\\", MLN Vol. 42 No. 3 (March 1927), pp. 150-7. Du Bartas' La Sepmaine,Tilley, \\"The Comedy Lingua and Du Bartas' La Sepmaine\\", MLN Vol. 42 No. 5 (May 1927), pp. 293-9. and Sir John Davies's Nosce Teipsum.Tilley, MLN Vol. 44 No. 1, pp. 36-9. Oliver Cromwell? A reference to Lingua from 1663 states that Oliver Cromwell played a part in an early production of the play. If this tradition has any validity, it may involve the entertainment that Cromwell's uncle, Sir Oliver Cromwell, provided for King James I at Hinchingbrooke in late April 1603. If Lingua was staged for the king at that time and place (which is uncertain), the future Protector and regicide, then four years old, may have filled the role of Small Beer in IV,v. Costumes The 1607 quarto of Lingua is very unusual in that it provides highly detailed and specific descriptions of the costumes worn by the actors: * Auditus wears \\"a garland of bays intermingled with red and white roses upon a false hair, a cloth of silver mantle upon a pair of stain bases, wrought sleeves, buskins, gloves, &c.;\\" * Visus, like the other Senses, is also furnished with a garland of bays and red and white roses; he wears \\"a light coloured taffeta mantle striped with silver, and fringed upon green silk bases, buskins, &c.;\\" he also carries a fan of peacock feathers. His companion Colour is \\"clad in changeable silk, with a rainbow out of a cloud on her head....\\" And the rest of the play's figures are similarly, gaudily accoutered.Frederick Kiefer, \\"A Dumb Show of the Senses in Timon of Athens\\", in: In the Company of Shakespeare: Essays on English Renaissance Literature in Honor of G. Blakemore Evans, Thomas Mosian and Douglas Bruster, eds.; Madison, New Jersey, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002; pp. 146-7. Such detailed descriptions are often found in the published texts of masques from the Stuart era, but not in play texts. The costumes of Lingua may give a rare indication of the range of costumes used in the plays of the era (though generalizing from one academic play to the popular drama of the London theatres requires caution). The allegory As its title and subtitle indicate, the play portrays Lingua, the personification of language, asserting her importance against the traditional personifications of the senses. (Auditus is hearing, Visus is sight; Olfactus, Gustus, and Tactus round out the five.) This allegorical treatment of the five senses reaches far back into the literature and drama of the Middle Ages -- though Tomkis departs from the Medieval tradition by depicting the five senses as male rather than female figures. (The change allows Tomkis to cast the play's conflict in an anti-feminist, battle-of-the-sexes context.) As noted above, the play's plot derives from the story of the Judgement of Paris: like Eris among the Olympian gods, Lingua inspires dissension and competition among the five senses by offering a prize for the worthiest of them. She leaves a golden crown and a royal robe in a grove in \\"Microcosmus\\", with this inscription: :::He of the five that proves himself the best, :::Shall have his temples with this coronet blest. The five quarrel over who should receive the gifts; they go so far as to prepare for physical combat, though \\"Communis Sensus\\", the viceregent of Queen Psyche, forestalls that extremity. Like Paris, he presides over the competition, eventually awarding the crown to Visus and the robe to Tactus; the other three receive consolation prizes of offices under Psyche. Lingua's claim to be the sixth sense is rejected -- though with a qualification: it is allowed that woman have six senses, the sixth being \\"the sense of speaking.\\" Madame Lingua is not willing to accept this status of being \\"half a sense.\\" At a celebratory banquet she serves the senses drugged wine, which deranges them; but further disruption is suppressed by the charm of Somnus. Lingua talks in her sleep and confesses her plot; she is imprisoned so that she cannot \\"wag abroad.\\" The play features a range of other personifications -- Terra, Comedus, Phantastes, Lumen (light), Coelum (the sky), and others -- even Tobacco, \\"the king of Trinidado\\" who has \\"conquered all Europe.\\" The classical deities Ceres and Bacchus also appear. Medieval allegory was a dying form in Tomkis's era, though it still appeared on occasion; Phineas Fletcher's The Purple Island (1633) is one late example. Tomkis's play has been praised for the excellence of its style; \\"Tomkis proves himself a master of polished and flexible dialogue...The wit is sparkling and unforced\\", delivered \\"with scholarly grace.\\"F. S. Boas, \\"University Plays\\", in: The Cambridge History of English Literature, Vol. 6, edited by Adolphus William Ward; Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1910; pp. 355-6. The play's comedy often provides a burlesque of famous plays of its era, mocking the heroic speeches of The Spanish Tragedy and offering apparent Shakespearean allusions.

History  The Justanids appear as kings of Daylam at the end of the 8th century. Their centre was in the Rudbar of Alamut, running into the valley of the Shahrood. Two centuries later, this had become the main centre of the historical Nizari Ismailis or Assassins (Hashshashin), as they are known in the west. They appear in Islamic history as part of what Vladimir Minorsky has called \\"the Iranian intermezzo\\". This refers to a period in which indigenous Daylamite and Kurdish principalities took power in northwest Persia after two to three centuries of Arab rule. The Daylamite upsurge eventually culminated in the Buyid dynasty. After Marzuban ibn Justan converted to Islam in 805, the ancient family of Justans became connected to the Zaydi Alids of the Daylam region. The Justanids adopted the Zaydi form of Shi'ism. In the 10th century, they were eclipsed by the Daylamite dynasty of Sallarids in Tarom (modern Iranian province of Zanjan). Nevertheless, the Justanids were tied by marriage with the Sallarids and preserved their seat of Rudbar in the highlands of Daylam. They also became allies with the Buyids. In the 11th century, they may have recognized the suzerainty of the Ghaznavids. Later, they recognized the suzerainty of the Seljuqs, but, shortly after, they fade from history.

It was set to premiere on January 7, 2008, between \\"The Story of Thugnificent\\" and \\"Attack of the Killer Kung-Fu Wolf Bitch\\", but did not air in the United States until May 29, 2020. In Canada, the episode was aired on March 16, 2008, on the network Teletoon, with a disclaimer stating that \\"the views in this program do not reflect that of Teletoon Canada or its parent companies\\". The episode also aired globally elsewhere, and appeared on Netflix streaming in Canada, as well as on HBO Max in the United States shortly before its TV premiere. According to Aaron McGruder on an introduction video for the episode found on the DVD set, this episode was originally set to be titled \\"BET Sucks\\". Plot At the headquarters of BET, fictional president Debra Leevil (a parody of BET Holdings CEO Debra L. Lee with a personality resembling Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers films) presides over a board meeting to discuss the network's strategy for destroying black people. The issue of Huey Freeman is brought up, as he is shown on CNN giving a press conference stating that he is on a hunger strike and that he will not eat until there is a public apology for creating BET, the network is shut down, and all the executive board members commit seppuku. Huey joins forces with the charismatic Rev. Rollo Goodlove (voiced by rapper/singer Cee-Lo), who adds a flashy image to the fight against BET by lobbying for a boycott of the network. Huey initially believes this to be a good idea, as a concert organized by Goodlove (and featuring his band) draws widespread attention and sparks a widespread boycott. However, Huey gradually discovers that Goodlove is primarily interested in drawing media attention to himself through shameless merchandising, self-promotion, and outrageous behavior. Goodlove justifies his tactics by explaining that in order to reach the black community, he has to present its members with something they can relate to. Leevil and the BET board eventually see a news broadcast in which Uncle Ruckus expresses his support of BET and its ability to ruin the minds of young black people. Taking inspiration from his words, they offer Goodlove a sitcom on the network; he accepts, betraying Huey and causing the boycott to fall apart. Huey ends his hunger strike and asks Granddad, \\"What do you do when you can't do nothing, but there's nothing you can do?\\" \\"You do what you can,\\" Granddad says. Airing and BET There have been rumors that this and a second episode (\\"The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\\") were initially banned from airing in the U.S. due to threatened litigation from BET. The episodes are said to specifically attack Reggie Hudlin, BET's president of entertainment from 2005 to 2008, and Debra L. Lee, president and chief executive officer of BET Holdings (parent company of BET). Lee is portrayed as Deborah Leevil, a parody of the character Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies, and Hudlin is portrayed as Wedgie Rudlin, a \\"culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his Ivy League education.\\" However, a Cartoon Network representative stated that BET had not contacted Cartoon Network regarding the episodes.Brodesser-Akner, Claude. \\"Net-Bashing 'Boondocks' Banned.\\" Advertising Age, February 4, 2008.

He became the school's second head basketball coach in 1922, replacing William H. Spaulding who served as basketball coach from 1913 to 1922. Read remained as the head basketball coach at Western State until 1949. Read has been credited with introducing the fast break to basketball during the 1929-1930 season. (Others credit Frank Keaney with the innovation.) He later recalled that the slow pace of the game made it difficult to attract fans when he learned of the popularity of the fast-paced game of hockey in Detroit. \\"I made revisions in drills for faster ball handling and footwork. Then I changed from the zone defense to an advancing, interchanging, intercepting pattern of playing all over the floor. It was hard for the players to switch, but the new style was effective and popular from the start.\\" In the team's first year using the fast break approach, Read's team compiled a perfect 17-0 record. Read also served for many years as an official of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC). He was elected president in March 1948 and serve in that position until March 1949. He previously served for many years as a member of the NABC rules committee. He was chairman of the rules committee in 1937, 1938, and 1944, chairman of the research committee in 1943, and at other times secretary-treasurer and vice president.

Alpaca fiber is naturally water-repellent and fire resistant.\\"Alpaca.\\" 22 April 2008. HowStuffWorks.com. 19 July 2009. Huacaya, an alpaca that grows soft spongy fiber, has natural crimp, thus making a naturally elastic yarn well-suited for knitting. Suri has no crimp and thus is a better fit for woven goods. The designer Armani has used Suri alpaca to fashion men's and women's suits. Alpaca fleece is made into various products, from very simple and inexpensive garments made by the indigenous communities to sophisticated, industrially made and expensive products such as suits. In the United States, groups of smaller alpaca breeders have banded together to create \\"fiber co-ops,\\" to make the manufacture of alpaca fiber products less expensive. The preparing, carding, spinning, weaving and finishing process of alpaca is very similar to the process used for wool. Alpacas=Types= Suri alpaca There are two types of alpaca: Huacaya (which produce a dense, soft, crimpy sheep-like fiber), and the Suri (with silky pencil-like locks, resembling dreadlocks but without matted fibers). Suris, prized for their longer and silkier fibers, are estimated to make up 19‚Äì20% of the North American alpaca population. Since its import into the United States, the number of Suri alpacas has grown substantially and become more color diverse. The Suri is thought to be rarer, most likely because the breed was reserved for royalty during Incan times. Suris are often said to be less cold hardy than Huacaya, but both breeds are successfully raised in more extreme climates. They were developed in South America. =History= Alpacas have been bred in Pre-Columbian, South America for over 5,000 of years. Domesticated from the Vicu√±as by the ancient tribes of the Andean highlands of Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Northwest of Argentina. According to archaeological studies alpaca fiber was similar in quality to the wild Vicu√±a prior to the Spanish Conquests in the 1500s. Two-thousand-year-old Paracas textiles are thought to include alpaca fiber.Paracas Textiles, British Museum, accessed 27 September 2010 Also known as \\"The Fiber of the Gods\\", Alpaca was used to make clothing for royalty. In recent years, alpacas have also been exported to other countries. In countries such as the US, Australia and New Zealand, breeders shear their animals annually, weigh the fleeces and test them for fineness. With the resulting knowledge, they are able to breed heavier-fleeced animals with finer fiber. Fleece weights vary, with the top stud males reaching annual shear weights up to total fleece and good quality fleece. The discrepancy in weight is because an alpaca has guard hair, which is often removed before spinning.  Alpaca fiber = Production = Alpacas are shorn once a year in spring. After shearing, the fleece is roughly cleaned and sorted according to color. The dried wool is then carded; in this process, the loose alpaca fibers are aligned into a strain of Alpaca fleece with a carding machine's help. Like sheep, alpacas have thicker awn hairs. These long straight hairs located between the undercoat ensure that the fine coat does not become matted. Therefore alpacas should not be brushed; this would destroy their undercoat structure. The awn hairs are much coarser than the fine undercoat, and you can card them easily, but you can also sort them out and only use the fine hairs of the undercoat, the final result is the so- called baby alpaca. After carding, the strains are ready to be spun into yarn with a spinning wheel. Finally, the wool should be washed to remove impurities. Alpaca wool contains almost no wool grease (lanolin), making it easy to clean. The wool is then ready for sale as knitting wool or further processing. = History of the Alpaca fiber industry = The Amerindians of Peru used this fiber in the manufacture of many styles of fabrics for thousands of years before its introduction into Europe as a commercial product. The alpaca was a crucial component of ancient life in the Andes, as it provided not only warm clothing, but also meat. Incan culture involved the alpaca, as well as llamas and guanacos, in ritual sacrifice. Methods of killing the beasts varied based on the god receiving the sacrifice, the festival during which it took place, and even the color of the animal's fur. One method involved slitting open the animal's left side and reaching inside the chest cavity to remove the heart. The first European importations of alpaca fiber were into Spain. Spain transferred that fiber to Germany and France. Apparently, alpaca yarn was spun in England for the first time about the year 1808, but the fiber was condemned as an unworkable material. In 1830, Benjamin Outram, of Greetland, near Halifax, appears to have reattempted spinning it, and again it was condemned. These two attempts failed due to the style of fabric into which the yarn was woven‚Äîa type of camlet. With the introduction of cotton warps into Bradford trade about 1836, the true qualities of alpaca could be assessed as it was developed into fabric. It is not known where the cotton warp and mohair or alpaca weft plain-cloth came from, but it was this simple and ingenious structure which enabled Titus Salt, then a young Bradford manufacturer, to use alpaca successfully. Bradford is still the great spinning and manufacturing center for alpaca. Large quantities of yarns and cloths are exported annually to the European continent and the US, although the quantities vary with the fashions in vogue. The typical \\"alpaca fabric\\" is a very characteristic \\"dress fabric.\\"\\"Alpaca\\". The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 11th ed. 1911. A pair of Huacaya alpacas near an Inca burial site in Peru Due to the successful manufacture of various alpaca cloths by Sir Titus Salt and other Bradford manufacturers, a great demand for alpaca wool arose, which could not be met by the native product. Apparently, the number of alpacas available never increased appreciably. Unsuccessful attempts were made to acclimatize alpaca in England, on the European continent and in Australia, and even to cross English breeds of sheep with alpaca. There is a cross between alpaca and llama‚Äîa true hybrid in every sense‚Äîproducing a material placed upon the Liverpool market under the name \\"Huarizo\\". Crosses between the alpaca and vicu√±a have not proved satisfactory, as the crosses that have produced offspring have a very short fleece, more characteristic of the vicu√±a. Current attempts to cross these two breeds are underway at farms in the US. Alpacas are now being bred in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Germany and numerous other places. In recent years, interest in alpaca fiber clothing has surged, perhaps partly because alpaca ranching has a reasonably low impact on the environment. Individual U.S. farms are producing finished alpaca products like hats, mitts, scarves, socks, insoles, footwarmers, sweaters, jackets, as well as almost any other product. Outdoor sports enthusiasts claim that its lighter weight and better warmth provides them more comfort in colder weather. Using an alpaca and wool blend such as merino is common to the alpaca fiber industry to reduce price, however no additional materials need to be added to improve processing or the qualities of the final product. Alpaca improves any other textile it is blended with, however 100% alpaca garments can be made without the addition of other materials, which creates a long lasting and very luxurious product. In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so as to raise the profile of alpaca and other natural fibers. Fiber structure Alpaca fiber is similar in structure to sheep wool fiber. The fiber softness comes from having a different smoother scale surface than sheep wool. American breeders have enhanced the softness by selecting for finer fiber diameter fiber, similar to merino wool. Fiber diameter is a highly inherited trait in both alpaca and sheep. The difference in the individual fiber scales compared to sheep wool also creates the glossy shine which is prized in alpaca. Alpaca fibers have a higher tensile strength than wool fibers. In processing, slivers lack fiber cohesion and single alpaca rovings lack strength. Blend these together and the durability is increased several times over. More twisting is necessary, especially in Suri, and this can reduce a yarn's softness.The Quality and Processing Performance of Alpaca Fibres Australian Government RIRDC 2003 The alpaca has a very fine and light fleece. It does not retain water, is a thermal insulator even when wet and can resist solar radiation effectively. These characteristics guarantee the animals a permanent and appropriate coat to protect against extreme changes of temperature.http://www.aia.org.pe/aia.html?32 > This fiber offers the same protection to humans. = Medullation = Medullated fibers are fibers with a central core, which may be continuous, interrupted, or fragmented. Here, the cortical cells that make up the walls of the fiber, are wrapped around a medulla, or core, that is made up of another type of cell (called medullary cells). Later, these cells may contract or disappear, forming air pockets which assist insulation.J. Villarroel, presumably A study of alpaca fibre, University of N.S.W., 1959, as cited in Crying over spilt onions? (Published in Australian Alpacas, Autumn, 2004) Medullation can be an objectionable trait. Medullated fibers can take less dye, standing out in the finished garment, and are weaker. The proportion of medullated fibers is higher in the coarser, unwanted guard hairs: there is less or no medullation in the finer, lower micrometer fibers.Fiber Characteristics of U.S. Huacaya Alpacas by Angus McColl, Yocom-McColl Testing Laboratories, Inc., Chris Lupton, Texas A&M; University System, and Bob Stobart, University of Wyoming 2004 These undesirable fibers are easy to see and give a garment a hairy appearance. Quality alpaca products should be free from these medullated fibers. Quality Good quality alpaca fiber is approximately 18 to 25 Œºm in diameter. While breeders report fiber can sell for US$2 to $4 per ounce, the world wholesale price for processed, spun alpaca \\"tops\\" is only between about $10 to $24/kg (according to quality), i.e. about $0.28 to $0.68 per oz. Finer fleeces, ones with a smaller diameter, are preferred, and thus are more expensive. As an alpaca gets older, the diameter of the fibers gets thicker, between and per year. This is sometimes caused by overfeeding; as excess nutrients are converted to (thicker) fiber rather than to fat. Elite alpaca breeders in the United States are attempting to breed animals with fleece that does not degrade in quality as the animals age. They are looking for lingering fineness (fiber diameters remaining under 20 Œºm) for aging animals. It is believed this lingering fineness is heritable and thus can be improved over time. As with all fleece-producing animals, quality varies from animal to animal, and some alpacas produce fiber which is less than ideal. Fiber and conformation are the two most important factors in determining an alpaca's value. Alpacas come in 22 natural colors, with more than 300 shades from a true-blue black through browns-black, browns, fawns, white, silver-greys, and rose-greys. However, white is predominant, because of selective breeding: the white fiber can be dyed in the largest ranges of colors. In South America, the preference is for white, as they generally have better fleece than the darker- colored animals. The demand for darker fiber have sprung up in the United States and elsewhere, though, to reintroduce the colors, but the quality of the darker fiber has decreased slightly. Breeders have been diligently working on breeding dark animals with exceptional fiber, and much progress has been made over the last few years. Dyeing Before dyeing, the alpaca fiber must go through other stages: # Selection of wool, according to color, size and quality of fiber # \\"Escarminado\\", removal of grass, dirt, thorns, and other impurities # Washing, to remove dirt - alpaca contains no grease or lanolin found in wool which requires harsh chemical scouring. # Spinning Once the fiber is clean, it is possible to begin the process of dyeing. Alpaca dyes beautifully with synthetic or natural dyes. To dye 1 kg of alpaca wool with cochinilla (natural RED dye), #Boil 5 liters of water in an aluminum can with 100 g of cochinilla for an hour. #Sift and put the fiber in the water. #Boil again for an hour and add 50 lemons cut in halves. #Then take out the wool and hang for drying. Note: For dyeing with another natural dye (native plants), add 2 kg of the products to the water and boil. Uses Alpaca fiber is used for many purposes, including making clothing such as bedding, hats, mitts, scarves, gloves, and jumpers. Rugs and toys can also be made from alpaca fiber. Sweaters are most common.

The track was established in 1953 and in 1955 was the location that Adios Harry ran his \\"Miracle Mile\\". As tastes changed and competition increased, its attendance and revenues decreased. It has added simulcast harness racing, video gaming, and entertainment, in addition to building a 173-suite hotel. History The harness racing track was opened in 1953 near Syracuse, New York, and operated successfully for many years as it quickly attained status as one of the most popular harness tracks in the country. In 1955, Adios Harry ran a \\"miracle mile\\" in 1:55, a record that stood for 18 years. As tastes changed in the late 20th century, and there was increased competition from the Meadowlands Racetrack and others who paid larger purses. At the same time, the state authorized forms of gambling to raise money. Beginning in the 1980s, Native American tribes began to establish bingo halls on their reservations and later, gaming casinos to generate revenues. By 2001, the track faced closure due to regulatory issues. By 2001, prior to the addition of the casino, attendance declined to less than 1,000 from a peak of 4,000 plus in the 1960s and 1970s. From a one-time high of 162 race dates, Vernon Downs hosts only 70 as of the 2018 season, its 65th. Tax debts and other financial issues made it likely that the casino would shut down in 2002 despite legalization of the video slot machines which were legalized in New York following the success of Native American casinos, and as an attempt to stimulate New York's economy after September 11. After receiving a new license, Vernon Downs added simulcast harness racing, on which bets could be placed, and video gaming. This also allowed for an increase in the purse size paid to racers, although attendance was still low. Vernon Downs owner Jeff Gural cites the addition of VLTs as what saved racing. Some, like Vernon Downs, also began to host entertainment acts, particularly rock musichowever in recent years the entertainment and promotion have dwindled to zero. The owners of the track built an associated hotel for visitors to the facility. While the horse racing season runs April - November, the racino elements are open year-round. =Tax Situation= In the 21st century, owners appealed for lower taxes in order to make their operations viable. They complain of having to compete with the Turning Stone Casino and Resort of the Oneida Indian Nation, which does not have to collect state taxes on its sovereign land. The Nation does pay a portion of its revenues to the state under a gaming compact, essentially in lieu of taxes, as well as making donations and contributions to regional communities. On February 11, 2008, the racino/casino closed down after the New York State Assembly's Racing and Wagering Committee failed to pass a bill that would allow Vernon Downs and other racinos in New York pay less in taxes to the state. Legislation was quickly passed, and the ownership reopened the casino three days later. In 2017, Vernon Downs faced further financial issues still due to the tax difference between the casinos on Native American lands, and the opening of three additional \\"Las Vegas style\\" casinos: Del Lago Resort & Casino near Waterloo; Rivers Casino & Resort in Schenectady; and Tioga Downs in Nichols. The start of the track season was delayed when owner Jeff Gural again cited competition from Turning Stone and Yellow Brick Road Casino in Chittenango and there were plans to close the facilities in the fall of 2017. However tax legislation that enabled a change in the fees the racino paid to the state and Tioga Downs' acquiring a full gaming license in 2016 both helped Vernon Downs as Tioga is owned by the same parent company. Despite citing plans to cut the number of slot machines by about 150, the racino still operated more than 750 as of April 2018. The track was the site of many of the annual K-Rockathon concerts. It has hosted many large-venue acts such as Phish. It has a 173-suite hotel and fine dining restaurant. The hotel remains open at present.

White published an article elevating A. kadabba to species level on the basis of newly discovered teeth from Ethiopia. These teeth show \\"primitive morphology and wear pattern\\" which demonstrate that A. kadabba is a distinct species from A. ramidus. The specific name comes from the Afar word for \\"basal family ancestor\\". Taxonomy Fossil remains were first described in 2001 by Ethiopian paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie based on bones collected from five localities in the Middle Awash, Ethiopia. Haile-Selassie initially classified them as Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba, with kadabba deriving from the Afar language meaning \\"basal family ancestor.\\" In 2004, he, along with Japanese paleoanthropologist Gen Suwa and American paleoanthropologist Tim D. White, elevated it to species level as A. kadabba based on apparently primitive features compared to A. ramidus. A. kadabba is considered to have been the direct ancestor of A. ramidus, making Ardipithecus a chronospecies. Along with elevating it to species level, they suggested that Ardipithecus, Sahelanthropus, and Orrorin could potentially belong to the same genus. In 2008, American paleoanthropologists Bernard Wood and Nicholas Lonerga said that the larger ape-like canines of A. kadabba cast doubt on its assignment to the human line, but the position of Ardipithecus near humans has been reaffirmed by the discoverers and colleagues. They see a lineage of apes whose teeth continually reduce in size: A. kadabba‚ÄìA. ramidus‚ÄìAustralopithecus anamensis‚ÄìAu africanus, though they are unsure if Ardipithecus were the ancestors to these Australopithecus species, or were only closely related. Evolutionary tree according to a 2019 study: Description A. kadabba is known from 19 specimens which reveal elements of the teeth, jaw, feet, and hands and arms. The holotype specimen, ALA-VP-2/10, is a right jaw fragment with a third molar and five tooth or root fragments. This correction of the initial allocation of the fossil record was based on the argument that Ardipithecus kadabba had more \\"primitive\\" features than other Ardipithecus fossils. Ardipithecus kadabba thus also has a greater similarity with the genera Sahelanthropus and Orrorin. These statements were based on additional bone finds that came to light in November 2002 and were dated at 5.8 to 5.6 million years. At the same time, it was emphasized that evidence could be found of a reduced \\"honing\\" complex, traces on the teeth that arise when the canines rub against each other when biting, constantly sharpening their peaks, which has been found in all older finds. The loss of this feature in the successor species of Ardipithecus ramidus has been used for the allocation of discoveries in that line of development of great apes that led to the australopithecines and the genus Homo. Paleoecology The first description suggested that Ardipithecus kadabba lived in a habitat that consisted of forests, wooded savannas, and open water areas, as had been described for Sahelanthropus.Giday WoldeGabriel et al.: Geology and palaeontology of the Late Miocene Middle Awash valley, Afar rift, Ethiopia.

A. ramidus, unlike modern hominids, has adaptations for both walking on two legs (bipedality) and life in the trees (arboreality). However, it would not have been as efficient at bipedality as humans, nor at arboreality as non-human great apes. Its discovery, along with Miocene apes, has reworked academic understanding of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor from appearing much like modern day chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas to being a creature without a modern anatomical cognate. The facial anatomy suggests that A. ramidus males were less aggressive than those of modern chimps, which is correlated to increased parental care and monogamy in primates. It has also been suggested that it was among the earliest of human ancestors to use some proto-language, possibly capable of vocalizing at the same level as a human infant. A. ramidus appears to have inhabited woodland and bushland corridors between savannas, and was a generalized omnivore. Taxonomy Map showing discovery locations of various australopithecines The first remains were described in 1994 by American anthropologist Tim D. White, Japanese paleoanthropologist Gen Suwa, and Ethiopian paleontologist Berhane Asfaw. The holotype specimen, ARA-VP-6/1, comprised an associated set of 10 teeth; and there were 16 other paratypes identified, preserving also skull and arm fragments. These were unearthed in the 4.4 million year (Ma) deposits of the Afar region in Aramis, Ethiopia from 1992 to 1993, making them the oldest hominin remains at the time, surpassing Australopithecus afarensis. They initially classified it as Australopithecus ramidus, the species name deriving from the Afar language ramid \\"root\\". In 1995, they made a corrigendum recommending it be split off into a separate genus, Ardipithecus; the name stems from Afar ardi \\"ground\\" or \\"floor\\". The 4.4 million year old female ARA-VP 6/500 (\\"Ardi\\") is the most complete specimen. Fossils from at least nine A. ramidus individuals at As Duma, Gona Western Margin, Afar, were unearthed from 1993‚Äì2003. The fossils were dated to between 4.32 and 4.51 million years ago. In 2001, 6.5‚Äì5.5 million year old fossils from the Middle Awash were classified as a subspecies of A. ramidus by Ethiopian paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie. In 2004, Haile- Selassie, Suwa, and White split it off into its own species, A. kadabba. A. kadabba is considered to have been the direct ancestor of A. ramidus, making Ardipithecus a chronospecies. The exact affinities of Ardipithecus have been debated. White, in 1994, considered A. ramidus to have been more closely related to humans than chimps, though noting it to be the most ape-like fossil hominin to date. In 2001, French paleontologist Brigitte Senut and colleagues aligned it more closely to chimps, but this has been refuted. In 2009, White and colleagues reaffirmed the position of Ardipithecus as more closely related to modern humans based on dental similarity, a short base of the skull, and adaptations to bipedality. In 2011, primatologist Esteban Sarmiento said that there is not enough evidence to assign Ardipithecus to Hominini (comprising both humans and chimps), but its closer affinities to humans have been reaffirmed in following years. White and colleagues consider it to have been closely related to or the ancestor of the temporally close Australopithecus anamensis, which was the ancestor to Au. afarensis. Before the discovery of Ardipithecus and other pre-Australopithecus hominins, it was assumed that the chimpanzee‚Äìhuman last common ancestor and preceding apes appeared much like modern day chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas, which would have meant these three changed very little over millions of years. Their discovery led to the postulation that modern great apes, much like humans, evolved several specialized adaptations to their environment (have highly derived morphologies), and their ancestors were comparatively poorly adapted to suspensory behavior or knuckle walking, and did not have such a specialized diet. Also, the origins of bipedality were thought to have occurred due to a switch from a forest to a savanna environment, but the presence of bipedal pre-Australopithecus hominins in woodlands has called this into question, though they inhabited wooded corridors near or between savannas. It is also possible that Ardipithecus and pre-Australopithecus were random offshoots of the hominin line. Description Reconstruction of Ardipithecus skeleton Assuming subsistence was primarily sourced from climbing in trees, A. ramidus may not have exceeded . \\"Ardi,\\" a larger female specimen, was estimated to have stood and weighed based on comparisons with large-bodied female apes. Unlike the later Australopithecus but much like chimps and humans, males and females were about the same size. A. ramidus had a small brain, measuring . This is slightly smaller than a modern bonobo or chimp brain, but much smaller than the brain of Australopithecus‚Äìabout ‚Äìand roughly 20% the size of the modern human brain. Like chimps, the A. ramidus face was much more pronounced (prognathic) than modern humans. The size of the upper canine tooth in A. ramidus males was not distinctly different from that of females (only 12% larger), in contrast to the sexual dimorphism observed in chimps where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canines than females. A. ramidus feet are better suited for walking than chimps. However, like non-human great apes, but unlike all previously recognized human ancestors, it had a grasping big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees (an arboreal lifestyle), though it was likely not as specialized for grasping as it is in modern great apes. Its tibial and tarsal lengths indicate a leaping ability similar to bonobos. It lacks any characters suggestive of specialized suspension, vertical climbing, or knuckle walking; and it seems to have used a method of locomotion unlike any modern great ape, which combined arboreal palm walking clambering and a form of bipedality more primitive than Australopithecus. The discovery of such unspecialized locomotion led American anthropologist Owen Lovejoy and colleagues to postulate that the chimpanzee‚Äìhuman last common ancestor used a similar method of locomotion. The upper pelvis (distance from the sacrum to the hip joint) is shorter than in any known ape. It is inferred to have had a long lumbar vertebral series, and lordosis (human curvature of the spine), which are adaptations for bipedality. However, the legs were not completely aligned with the torso (were anterolaterally displaced), and Ardipithecus may have relied more on its quadriceps than hamstrings which is more effective for climbing than walking. However, it lacked foot arches and had to adopt a flat- footed stance. These would have made it less efficient at walking and running than Australopithecus and Homo. It may not have employed a bipedal gait for very long time intervals. It may have predominantly used palm walking on the ground, Nonetheless, A. ramidus still had specialized adaptations for bipedality, such as a robust fibularis longus muscle used in pushing the foot off the ground while walking (plantarflexion), the big toe (though still capable of grasping) was used for pushing off, and the legs were aligned directly over the ankles instead of bowing out like in non-human great apes. Paleobiology Chimp skull (note the large canines and elongated face) The reduced canine size and reduced skull robustness in A. ramidus males (about the same size in males and females) is typically correlated with reduced male‚Äìmale conflict, increased parental investment, and monogamy. Because of this, it is assumed that A. ramidus lived in a society similar to bonobos and ateline monkeys due to a process of self domestication (becoming more and more docile which allows for a more gracile build). Because a similar process is thought to have occurred with the comparatively docile bonobos from more aggressive chimps, A. ramidus society may have seen an increase in maternal care and female mate selection compared to its ancestors. Alternatively, it is possible that increased male size is a derived trait instead of basal (it evolved later rather than earlier), and is a specialized adaptation in modern great apes as a response to a different and more physically exerting lifestyle in males than females rather than being tied to interspecific conflict. Australian anthropologists Gary Clark and Maciej Henneberg argued that such shortening of the skull‚Äîwhich may have caused a descension of the larynx‚Äîas well as lordosis‚Äîallowing better movement of the larynx‚Äîincreased vocal ability, significantly pushing back the origin of language to well before the evolution of Homo. They argued that self domestication was aided by the development of vocalization, living in a pro-social society, as a means of non-violently dealing with conflict. They conceded that chimps and A. ramidus likely had the same vocal capabilities, but said that A. ramidus made use of more complex vocalizations, and vocalized at the same level as a human infant due to selective pressure to become more social. This would have allowed their society to become more complex. They also noted that the base of the skull stopped growing with the brain by the end of juvenility, whereas in chimps it continues growing with the rest of the body into adulthood; and considered this evidence of a switch from a gross skeletal anatomy trajectory to a neurological development trajectory due to selective pressure for sociability. Nonetheless, their conclusions are highly speculative. Hypothetical restoration of a female Ardipithecus using a hammer and anvil to crack open a nut American primatologist Craig Stanford postulated that A. ramidus behaved similarly to chimps, which frequent both the trees and the ground, have a polygynous society, hunt cooperatively, and are the most technologically advanced non-human. However, Clark and Henneberg concluded that Ardipithecus cannot be compared to chimps, having been too similar to humans. According to French paleoprimatologist Jean-Renaud Boisserie, the hands of Ardipithecus would have been dextrous enough to handle basic tools, though it has not been associated with any tools. The teeth of A. ramidus indicate that it was likely a generalized omnivore and fruit eater which predominantly consumed C3 plants in woodlands or gallery forests. The teeth lacked adaptations for abrasive foods. Lacking the speed and agility of chimps and baboons, meat intake by Ardipithecus, if done, would have been sourced from only what could have been captured by limited pursuit, or from scavenging carcasses. Paleoecology Half of the large mammal species associated with A. ramidus at Aramis are spiral-horned antelope and colobine monkeys (namely Kuseracolobus and Pliopapio). There are a few specimens of primitive white and black rhino species, and elephants, giraffes, and hippo specimens are less abundant. These animals indicate that Aramis ranged from wooded grasslands to forests, but A. ramidus likely preferred the closed habitats, specifically riverine areas as such water sources may have supported more canopy coverage. Aramis as a whole generally had less than 25% canopy cover. There were exceedingly high rates of scavenging, indicating a highly competitive environment somewhat like Ngorongoro Crater. Predators of the area were the hyenas Ikelohyaena abronia and Crocuta dietrichi, the bear Agriotherium, the cat Dinofelis and Megantereon, the dog Eucyon, and crocodiles. Bayberry, hackberry, and palm trees appear to have been common at the time from Aramis to the Gulf of Aden; and botanical evidence suggests a cool, humid climate. Conversely, annual water deficit (the difference between water loss by evapotranspiration and water gain by precipitation) at Aramis was calculated to have been about , which is seen in some of the hottest, driest parts of East Africa. Carbon isotope analyses of the herbivore teeth from the Gona Western Margin associated with A. ramidus indicate that these herbivores fed mainly on C4 plants and grasses rather than forest plants. The area seems to have featured bushland and grasslands.

His record albums were among the most popular of easy listening and space age pop organists of the 1950s through the early 1970s. His signature hit, \\"Plantation Boogie\\", charted as a Top 20 hit in 1955. He also had a gold record with 1970's Spinning Wheel. Dee played a variety of songs in numerous styles. He played original compositions, popular songs, and novelty tunes, and was a master of improvisation. Although his unique style was a pop/boogie- woogie blend, he also played ballads, country and western, jazz, rock, and patriotic songs. Biography=Early years= Born in Chicago, Illinois in 1923, Dee was an only child (though it is sometimes erroneously reported that he was one of eleven or twelve children). He was born to Florence De Stoppelaire n√©e Sophie (1897-1974) and George De Stoppelaire (1891-1970) who had both migrated from Belgium: his father came over as a young man, his mother had moved as a little girl with her family, they married in Chicago, Illinois in 1916. As a child, he sang in his church's choir; he also played ukulele, banjo and accordion. As a teenager, he turned playing the accordion into a profession in his uncle's quartet, which he continued until he volunteered into the Navy during World War II in 1943 aboard the aircraft carrier, USS Lexington. Upon his return from service, Dee spent his Navy earnings on a Hammond Model A organ, one of the earliest of its kind. With money from the G.I. Bill, he received instruction in organ at the Chicago Conservatory of Music. Afterward, he began playing hotels and night clubs in the south in the late 1940s to some degree of success, but no record contracts. =Decca/MCA years= It was not until the early 1950s that Dee was signed up to Decca after country singer Red Foley heard him playing at the Plantation Inn in Nashville, Tennessee, and thought Dee's unique sound would be a good contrast to the label's then prominent organist, Ethel Smith. Dee made good, and his original composition, \\"Plantation Boogie\\" charted at #18 in 1955. Dee re-recorded the hit on numerous albums, and was often imitated, even plagiarized, but never duplicated. Dee wrote 'Chicken in the Rough', and recorded the song as a duet with saxophonist, Boots Randolph. The uncanny similarity of 'Yakety Sax' to Dee's 'Chicken in the Rough\\" is often noted. Dee ventured into recording albums for Decca starting in 1954 with his first LP, Dee-lightful. Part of Dee's charm was his albums' zany covers featuring Dee in various situations, and titles with puns that usually included his name, such as Dee-Lirious, Dee-Licious, and Dee-Most! Dee recorded dozens of albums for Decca which sold moderately well although only three of them managed to hit the Billboard Hot 200 album chart; like many easy listening instrumental artists of the day he had a following that bought his albums over the years but rarely rushed out to buy them when newly released so that they would make the charts. His recordings featured organ with other instruments that were produced by Owen Bradley and developed into the Nashville sound and country pop of the 1970s and 1980s. He was nearly always backed by percussion; depending on the song, he also recorded with guitar legends, Les Paul and Chet Atkins; bass; a backup chorus; strings; horns such as saxophones, trombones, trumpets; and even the banjo. Dee played various instruments, and was highly influential in the history of organs and keyboards. Dee was recognized for his contribution to the field of music by Time Life for what Dee described as \\"bringing the organ out of the church and into mainstream music\\". When Dee married his second wife, Hendrica, in 1960, the couple settled down in Sarasota and eventually St. Petersburg, Florida, which would become the base of Lenny's operations for the rest of his career. They had two children: Raymond and Georgia. Lenny Dee Jr., his drummer, was one of three children from his first marriage (Betty), daughters are Barbara and Linda. Despite his contract with Decca, Lenny Dee's first love was live performance. Dee loved people and he loved to entertain them with music and laughter. Dee was a show man and a performer. In the mid-1950s he performed for several summers at the Lake Breeze Hotel lounge, at Buckeye Lake, just east of Columbus, Ohio. Around 1960, he played for a few years at a lounge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the 1960s and 70s, St. Petersburg Beach was a popular vacation destination, complete with an early theme park and a few luxury resorts. In 1967, after performing regularly at Davy Jones Locker, and later in hotel super clubs at St. Petersburg Beach like the Desert Ranch and Dolphin Beach resorts, Dee started his own up-scale supper club, named Lenny Dee's Dolphin Den. He held two shows each night with full bands playing dancing music between shows, and he packed the supper club nightly. Dee was a significant attraction to St. Petersburg Beach for decades. In the 1980s, he later opened Lenny Dee's King's Inn a few miles away. His supper club format ‚Äî with dinner, drinks, opening acts and his musical and his comedy routines ‚Äî was popular with local fans and visitors from around the world. The supper club's menu included the \\"One Pound Pork Chop,\\" along with other high-end steak house selections. Although he was not a country music performer per se (his work fell more into the easy listening category), his stage act included comedy typical of the Nashville country music entertainment genre, with jokes and changing the lyrics of songs, and routines that Dee was noted for, such as making realistic sounds of trains, whistles, and waves of water with the organ while wearing wild hats as costume. A lover of animals, Dee often included his pet dog, a black toy poodle he owned named \\"Little Miss Muffett\\", in his routine. The dog was trained to bark along with some of his numbers and smiled on queue. His beloved Miss Muffett lived to be 17; she had kept him company while he traveled on the road earlier in his career. Fans continued to ask him about the dog long after she had passed. His television credits include appearances on Toast of the Town with Ed Sullivan, The Tonight Show with Jack Paar, The Lawrence Welk Show, and later Nashville Now. Dee even had his own show in the mid-50s on WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida called Ladies' Day with Lenny Dee; it enjoyed a brief run. =Later years= Dee continued recording into the 1970s, adding a background orchestra in the late '60s as many other easy listening performers were doing at the time. By the late 1970s, Dee was in less demand. After recording 56 albums, he was finally released from the MCA label, along with many other easy listening artists. Time Life honored him for his 1950's contribution to music, including his recording of \\"A Foggy Day (In London Town) - Lenny Dee\\" on the CD \\"Instrumental Favorites - Around the World (A Time Life Collection).\\" Dee spent the rest of his career at his night clubs and on tour, but the demand for his music continued to decline. In 1999, Dee played on a series of cruise ship tours. He retired in 2003. He died at home on February 12, 2006 in St. Petersburg. Instruments After his discharge from the Navy, Dee bought a Hammond Model A organ. He later customized this instrument with a Hammond Solovox, a Maas-Rowe Vibrachord, and Leslie speakers (model 31-H). He also had a tape echo built into his organ, allowing him to create his trademark re-echo sound. In the early 1960s, Dee recorded on a Wurlitzer organ overdubbed with his Hammond Model A. In 1967, he started recording on a Hammond X-66; in 1972, he switched to a Hammond Concorde. In the 1970s, he also recorded on Yamaha and Thomas organs. Other keyboards he used include the Hammond Piper, which he used for its trumpet and harpsichord sounds, and the ARP synthesizer. When he toured on a cruise ship towards the end of his life, he played a Hammond-Suzuki Elegante. Posthumous releases Since his death, three compilation CDs have been released. Golden Organ Memories, a two-disc set, was released by Universal in 1998. Jasmine Records issued two additional compilations. Double Dee-Light was released in 2006 and features 48 tracks on two discs, including Plantation Boogie. This collection features songs from his earliest albums, including Dee-Lightful, Dee-Lirious, Dee-Licious, and Dee-Most!. The second Jasmine compilation, In Dee-Mand, released in 2008, features 57 tracks on two discs. It includes tracks from Hi- Dee Fi, Dee-Day, and Mr. Dee Goes to Town, as well as nine singles. Material loss On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Lenny Dee among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

They endure trials and tribulations of being a dysfunctional family due to Alden's passive-aggressive nature and Justin's desire to want to be able to grow up without having to talk to his mother about topics such as sexual intercourse or drug usage. An argument ensues when Alden informs Ashley that he has hired a homeless man to do some finishing touches on their long postponed yard work. As a result, the homeless man (who is given the name Glen but is not given any stage time) murders Ashley and leaves her body in the basement for Justin to find. Justin immediately makes a call to 911 to inform them of his mother's murder. Three years later, in 2002, Alden and Justin have been invited to appear on a talk show in Central Florida with TV producer David Gavin to talk about Alden's best selling book, entitled After Ashley. Alden makes certain that everyone knows of the pain he and Justin have endured since losing a wife and mother, but Justin continuously gives unhelpful and insulting answers to all of David's questions, and protests that simply because someone has died, doesn't mean that all their recognition should be directed on only the good qualities of their character, and not only that, but Alden is lying about his wife to make the two of them look good. That night, Justin sneaks into a bar where he meets Julie, a girl with a gothic image who recognizes him as the \\"911 Kid\\". At first, Justin talks about his \\"love\\" for Jesus Christ, which he shortly thereafter admits he was only lying to be funny. During this conversation, he attempts to \\"figure her out\\" so that she'd be more interested in having sex with him, which as it turns out, is why Julie initiated a conversation at all. So they go to Justin's apartment that night. The following day, Alden comes in and is surprised by Julie's presence, but decides to tell Justin that he has news: David has decided to produce a new show depicting crimes similar to Ashley's murder and unresolved cases, and he has put a demo of an episode on a VHS tape that they plan to screen the next day. To add on to the problem, David shows up shortly after that and announces that he is opening a homeless shelter entitled \\"Ashley House\\", which will open on the same evening. Justin, disgusted by this news, employs the help of a sex cult leader named Roderick Lord to help in any way he can to ruin the premiere. With the aid of Roderick, Justin is able to swap the demo episode for a sex tape that Ashley had made with Roderick when she was still alive, only in exchange for his making a sex tape with Julie. The screening happens the next day, beginning with an introduction from David, a statement read by Alden, and finally an excerpt from a poem read by Justin, and as Ashley's sex tape premieres, Justin lashes out at a painting that was created for the premiere by slashing it. Appalled by this, Alden leaves the screening and cuts off Justin financially. After the exposure, Justin and Julie sit on the edge of a lake and talk about their relationship, or lack thereof. They resolve that in the end, it would be best for them to be together due to some of the hardships that Justin has had to endure and because his need of a female companion whom he wasn't uncomfortable with, their relationship would be an ideal solution. As this conversation is happening, Ashley's ghost is standing behind them, yet, they are both oblivious to her presence, as she looks at their union disapprovingly.

Novint designed and built haptic, or 3D touch, devices and software. Novint developed the Novint Falcon, the world's first consumer 3D touch device, which allows users to use their sense of touch in computing. Novint has two primary areas of focus, video games and professional uses of its technology. In video games, the Novint Falcon can be used to feel objects and events in the game, giving the player a more immersive experience. In the professional applications group in Novint, called the Advanced Products Group (APG), Novint's technology has been used to add the sense of touch to a variety of professional applications and projects. Novint Falcon A pair of black Novint Falcons. The nearer one has the pistol grip attached, and the further one has the standard ball grip. Novint's flagship consumer product is the Novint Falcon, a USB haptic device intended to replace the mouse in video games and other applications. The name of the Novint Falcon comes from the fact that the falcon is a predator of the mouse. The Falcon has removable handles, or grips, that the user holds onto to control the Falcon. As the user moves the grip in three dimensions (right-left and forwards-backwards, like a mouse, but also up-down, unlike a mouse), the Falcon's software keeps track of where the grip is moved and creates forces that a user can feel, by sending currents to the motors in the device. The Falcon's sensors can keep track of the handle's position to sub-millimeter resolution, and the motors are updated 1000 times per second (1 kHz), giving a realistic sense of touch. The surfaces of virtual objects feel solid, and can have detailed textures applied to them. The weight and dynamics of objects can be simulated so that an object's inertia and momentum can be felt. The actions and interactions of a character in a game can be felt, such as the feel of a recoil of a gun, the motion of a golf club, or the accelerations of a car. The Falcon in essence is a consumer robot. It consists of its grip connected via three arms to a roughly conical body, which sits on a U-shaped base. Each of the three arms moves in and out of the Falcon's body. The default grip is a small spherical grip with 4 buttons on the top. The buttons are the Novint Logo for the primary button (which is similar to an 'N'), an upside down triangle (similar to a 'V'), a lightning bolt (similar to an 'N'), and a plus (similar to a 'T'), which collectively make the letters 'NVNT', the consonants in Novint's name and its ticker symbol as a public company. At the front flattened point of the Falcon's conical housing is a Novint Falcon logo that lights up in different colors to indicate the state of the device. The body contains 3 motors, each attached to one of the Falcon's arms by a cable that is wrapped around a capstan on the motor. As each of the 3 arms moves, an optical sensor attached to each motor keeps track of the movements of the arm. A mathematical function called a Jacobian is then used to determine the position of a three-dimensional cursor in Cartesian coordinates based on the positions of the arms. The position of that haptic cursor is therefore controlled by the Falcon's movements, and is used by the Falcon's software to determine the forces to be applied to the user. Currents are sent to the motors at the 1 kHz servo rate to present the user with an accurate sense of touch. In this way, a force can be applied to the grip in any direction, up to the maximum force (over 2 pounds of force), every 1/1000 of a second. Novint has developed several grip accessories. On the consumer side, Novint developed a pistol grip, which is the shape of a pistol handle and attaches to the Falcon in place of the spherical grip. It has a main trigger button, and 3 side buttons. It was intended for use in First Person Shooter (FPS) games, but is generally an ergonomic grip that can be used for many applications. Novint has also developed several professional grips, including a 3 Degree of Freedom (3 DOF) grip that tracks rotations of the handle, two of which Degrees of Freedom are actuated and can present forces to the user. Novint software  3D touch software has been a primary focus of Novint since its inception, and Novint has had more focus historically on software than hardware. Novint's software was created to give users an accurate sense of touch in computing. Novint creates software in several different categories. It has developed a low level driver software called HDAL, which stands for Haptic Device Abstraction Layer. HDAL handles the low level communications between the Falcon and the computer. Novint has created a software layer above HDAL, called HFX (i.e. Haptics Effects), which is used for creating force effects in games. Novint has developed a variety of applications for its professional projects. Novint has also published a number of video games, some of which were developed by Novint directly and some of which were existing games in which Novint added support for the Falcon. An independent group has also developed an open source driver library for the Falcon. The Falcon is packaged with 3 applications; a tutorial, a game called Newton's Monkey Business, and the Feelin It Sports Pack. The tutorial allows users to feel a virtual sphere that can have a variety of textures applied to it. For instance, choosing an ice texture presents a hard, slippery surface to interact with, while sandpaper feels rough, and molasses presents a viscous texture the 3D cursor can move through. The tutorial also shows the feeling of dynamics through a ball attached to a rubber band which can be swung around, and a simulation of catching a baseball with a catcher's mitt. Finally the tutorial allows a user to shoot a virtual slingshot which can be used to shoot cans off a fence. Newton's Monkey Business contains 24 mini games which contains a variety of mini-games showing many different types of game interactions. The Feelin It sports pack has several sports games, including bowling, a home run derby, a three point shootout, table tennis, and Feelin It Golf. One of Novint's earliest games was a free download called Haptics Life 2, a Half-Life 2 mod in which the mouse controls have been replaced with Falcon controls and 3D Force Feedback was incorporated. As a result, weapons recoils, the weight of carried objects, damage dealt to the character, and character and vehicle accelerations are all conveyed by the Falcon to the player. Each gun in the game has a different, tangible recoil. Novint has developed a variety of additional games across a wide variety of genres. As of 2009, Novint had published over 50 titles that work with the Falcon. A majority of Novint's game library is based on existing games that Novint added touch to. Novint is currently releasing 2 types of game support, FalconHD and F-Gen. FalconHD games are games in which Novint has licensed source code access for a game, and integrates forces directly into the game. F-Gen games utilize Novint's F-Gen application to add controls and forces into games. Mods, or modifications to games, will continue to be developed by Novint and its community, but mods will generally become classified through F-Gen support. F-Gen was developed to create a larger number of supported games and applications for the Novint Falcon with the understanding that the control and forces for many interactions in games/apps could be implemented without source code access. Novint therefore developed a system, F-Gen, where its community and users themselves could add support for games and applications, share their work, and get more game and application support more quickly, that is more robust. F-Gen was designed to be a community tool. It includes a strong scripting language and the ability to add F-Gen 'Tools', which can add functionality to F-Gen. The F-Gen drivers emulate a mouse, and are customizeable, making the Falcon work with any PC game or any PC application. Users can adjust the movement scales for the Falcon's control, and save settings for various games. Grip buttons can be mapped to different controls in games. Novint is developing a gesture recognition system, called the Gesture Cube or G-Cube, in which a user can easily access 36 simple to remember gestures to activate any key press or macro. A movement such as moving right then moving forward, will be able to turn on a flashlight (along with haptic cues to make the movements easy to control), while down-down could make the character crouch. The G-Cube will be able to be used universally in other applications, such as mapping forward-up to 'cut' while forward-down could be mapped to 'paste'. Beyond the FalconHD titles, there are 3 levels of game support for F-Gen. They are F-Gen Bronze, F-Gen Silver, and F-Gen Gold. F-Gen Bronze will just be basic mouse support with customized inputs. F-Gen Silver will have basic forces. F-Gen Gold will have strong force feedback support. =Novint games= With the F-Gen Beta release, all PC games can be played with the Novint Falcon. Novint and Novint's community are adding specific drivers within F-Gen to add more forces to many games. History  In 1995 Sandia National Laboratories, a United States government laboratory, bought one of the world's first commercial 3D haptic devices, and began developing haptic software. Sandia did core haptic research and research on how to use the technology for scientific visualization. It was one of the first companies in the world focused purely on the software side of the field of haptics. Anderson led the project at Sandia until 2000 at which point he founded Novint. Novint acquired an exclusive license to the technology and began to commercialize it. Novint's vision was that the technology could fundamentally change computing, adding one of our most basic human senses and experiences to computers. Given this vision, Novint was originally focused on consumer applications, but quickly found itself in a situation where the dot com bubble was bursting and the markets were collapsing. Investments in 2001 were difficult to come by for an early stage company, so Novint focused its efforts on higher end professional applications. Novint spent several years focusing on custom development for a variety of companies including Lockheed Martin, Chrysler, Chevron, Mobil, Aramco, Sandia National Laboratories, and Harvard University, among others. In 2004, the cost of 3D haptic hardware was still very high, over $10,000. Novint felt that to again move towards the consumer space, it would need to develop a consumer level hardware device itself. Novint took on the daunting challenge of taking a $15,000 haptic device, licensed from its partner company Force Dimension, and turn that device into a consumer level device, robust enough for gamers, yet still have the fidelity to be used in surgical simulations. By 2006 Novint had taken the expensive, high-end design, and working with Lunar Design, made a consumer level prototype. In June 2006, Novint went public on the OTC:BB under the ticker symbol NVNT. In late 2006, Novint put together a partnership with V-Tech to manufacture the Falcon in China. At CES in 2007, Novint announced plans to launch the Novint Falcon as a consumer device, and on June 18, 2006 (Tom Anderson's 32nd birthday) Novint launched the world's first consumer 3D touch device, having effectively brought the cost of the hardware down two orders of magnitude (1/100 of the original cost). At that point in time, Novint had a strong hardware solution, but felt that it needed better game support, which was one of the main focuses of the company. In May 2008, Novint made an agreement with Electronic Arts to license 7 AAA game titles. Novint then signed licensing agreements with other publishers and developers, including Valve. In June 2009 Valve released updates to Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Portal and Team Fortress 2 adding game support for the Novint Falcon. In December 2009, Novint launched the first beta version of F-Gen, a tool which allowed mouse-like use of the Falcon in Windows. The program also included a scripting functionality that theoretically allowed users to integrate the Falcon into practically any game. In February 2010, Novint launched their second Beta version of their F-Gen software, integrating their proprietary G-cube functionality. Later that same month they released a small dll patch to fix a bug that had emerged in the button functionality. Both the beta and the patch were released only on the Novint forums.

The system was responsible for flooding rains across many areas in California along with very strong winds locally exceeding hurricane force strength as well as heavy mountain snows across the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain chains as well as those in Idaho, Utah and Colorado. The storms were responsible for the death of at least 12 people across three states, and extensive damage to utility services as well, as damage to some other structures. The storm was also responsible for most of the January 2008 tornado outbreak from January 7‚Äì8. Meteorological synopsis The strong low pressure system responsible for much of the extreme weather (this was actually a series of three storms) traversed much of the Pacific Ocean, before the first storm arrived late on January 3. On December 29, 2007, a powerful extratropical disturbance developed over eastern Siberia, which emerged into the northwest Pacific, and moved to the Aleutian Islands as a well-defined low by January 3. On January 2, another extratropical disturbance developed within a well-defined trough of low pressure, in the northeast Pacific Ocean. On January 3, the 1st storm system approached the northern part of the West Coast, powered by a Pineapple Express atmospheric river, resulting in heavy downpours of rain and strong gusts across much of the Western Seaboard. Late on January 3, the 2nd storm system in the Gulf of Alaska split, with the 3rd, new storm to the south usurping the majority of the moisture of the 2nd system. On January 4, as the 1st storm system weakened, and the southern part of the storm split off into another storm, which began moving eastward across the Southern United States. Later on the same day, as the first storm began moving ashore in British Columbia, the 3rd (and the most powerful) storm brought the largest bands of snow and rain, which impacted the Pacific Coast from British Columbia to northern Mexico, on January 4. Heavy downpours of rain, heavy snow, and fierce winds lashed the West Coast. Meanwhile, the 2nd storm system slowly moved eastward along the southern coast of Alaska, before stalling in the Gulf of Alaska on January 5. From January 4 to 5, general rainfall from the superstorm in the West Coast was around of rain in Oregon and Utah, while nearly fell over parts of Nevada and as much as in parts of California. Snowfall amounts for those two days reached as much as in Blackcap Basin, California, while many mountain regions of California, Nevada and Idaho received between 1 and of snow. By this time, the 3rd storm's explosive intensification had transformed the system into a massive superstorm, becoming the dominant system in the Western US. Widespread hurricane-force wind gusts were reported across most western states with winds reaching speeds of or more.AccuWeather.com - Weather Blogs - Weather News The highest reported wind gusts were 165 mph (266 km/h) in Tahoe City, California, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson scale. Waves were reported as high as offshore Washington State. Early on January 5, the superstorm reached a minimum low pressure of - the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane, becoming the most powerful storm on record to affected the West Coast, in terms of low pressure. Later on the same day, the 3rd storm began to interact with the 1st storm, which was situated over northwestern Canada, weakening that system. Also, the superstorm slowly began to weaken, and it developed a secondary low to the north of Montana, as the system gradually began to split. Late on January 6, the superstorm's secondary low became the dominant low in the system, as the storm system's circulation began to break down. On January 6, the superstorm's original low pressure center was absorbed into the 2nd storm, located just south of Alaska, while the main bulk of the storm system continued moving eastward, across Western Canada. However, the western chunk of the storm complex's moisture continued to dump rain and snow across the Western US. On the afternoon of January 6, Kirkwood Ski Resort reported of snow in 48 hours with a storm total of 11 feet. On January 7, the storm complex weakened further, and the circulation in the western half of the storm completely collapsed, resulting in the storm's moisture spreading out throughout most of the Western United States. Soon afterwards, a few clumps of the mass of moisture organized into separate storm systems, while the dominant low over Canada stalled just southwest of Hudson Bay. As the storm complex moved westward on January 7, the instability in the air triggered a rare January tornado outbreak, spawning 58 tornadoes over the course of 2 days, resulting in the deaths of 4 more people. On January 8, the western fragment of the complex in the US dissipated, while the southern and eastern chunks continued to organize. On the same day, the 2nd storm system in the Gulf of Alaska was absorbed by another more powerful incoming extratropical cyclone, even as the main storm complex continued heading eastward across the United States. Later on January 8, the eastern chunk of the storm complex merged into the southern chunk, while the low near Hudson Bay began to deteriorate. On January 9, the low pressure center over the Great Lakes region became the dominant low of the storm complex. On the same day, the 1st storm over northern Canada was absorbed by a cold front, even as the storm complex continued to organize over the Eastern United States, triggering more tornadoes across the region. By January 9, the storm complex had organized into a 973 mbar storm to the northeast of the Great Lakes, and it began to strip away moisture from the low near Hudson Bay. The storm complex slowly moved northeastward, and the storm's outer rainband eventually exited the East Coast. On January 10, the low west of Hudson Bay dissipated, while the main storm complex began to exit Atlantic Canada. On January 11, the storm entered Labrador Sea, and stalled for several hours, before continuing to move northeastward. At the same time, the system gradually weakened. On January 12, the system reorganized to the southeast of Greenland, and was assigned the name Ilse by the Free University of Berlin.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20080112.gif On January 14, Windstorm Ilse intensified to 980 mbars and impacted the United Kingdom and parts of Western Europe, before entering the Norwegian Sea on January 15.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20080115.gif During the next couple of days, Ilse accelerated northeastward,http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20080117.gif before turning to the east on January 17.http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20080118.gif On January 22, Ilse was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone to the south, over the Barents Sea.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20080122.gif Impacts Satellite image of the system as it approached the West Coast (Courtesy of NWS Hanford, California) Flights departing from San Francisco were grounded, while over of Interstate 80 was shut down in eastern California and western Nevada due to poor visibility and a 17-vehicle pile-up.

This wildflower is endemic to California, where it is a resident of the chaparral slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast. It has a long root from which it erects tall stems usually exceeding a meter in height and often approaching two meters. The leaves arise on long petioles and are each divided into as many as 15 fingerlike pointed lobes. The top of the stem is occupied with a very large inflorescence usually containing over 50 flowers. Each flower rises on a pedicel several centimeters long. The sepals point forward to make a cup out of the mouth of the somewhat tubular flower. The longest sepals are about a centimeter long and the spur of the flower may approach two centimeters in length. The flower is generally white to greenish white to light lavender.

The incident, inspired by the Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China, occurred in direct response to a violent police crackdown against Chinese protestors demonstrating against corruption and colonialism in Macau. The incident is known as \\"12-3\\", in reference to the date of the riots.Macau History and Society, Zhidong Hao, Hong Kong University Press, 2011. . page 215 Pressured by business leaders in Macau and the mainland Chinese government, the colonial government agreed to meet the demands of the protestors and apologized for the police crackdown. Portuguese sovereignty over Macau diminished after the incident, leading to de facto Chinese control over the territory.  Origins  The Portuguese occupation of Macau is broadly divided into three different political periods.Cardinal 2009, p. 225 The first, being the establishment of the first Portuguese settlement in Macau from 1557 until 1849.Halis, Denis de Castro (2015). \\"'Post-Colonial' Legal Interpretation in Macau, China: Between European and Chinese Influences\\". In East Asia's Renewed Respect for the Rule of Law in the 21st Century. Leiden: Brill Nijhoff. . pp. 70‚Äì71 During this period the settlement administrators only had jurisdiction over the Portuguese community. The second period, known as the colonial period, scholars generally place from 1849 to 1974, it was in this period the Portuguese colonial administration began to take an active role in the lives of both the Portuguese and ethnic Chinese communities in Macau.Hao 2011, p. 40 On 26 March 1887, the Lisbon Protocol was signed, in which China recognized the \\"perpetual occupation and government of Macau\\" by Portugal who in turn, agreed never to surrender Macau to a third party without the consent of the Chinese government.Mayers, William Frederick (1902). Treaties Between the Empire of China and Foreign Powers (4th ed.). Shanghai: North-China Herald. pp. 156‚Äì157. This was reaffirmed in the Treaty of Peking on 1 December 1887. Throughout the colonial administration of Macau, development of Portuguese Macau stagnated due to a complex colonial bureaucracy and corruption. Racial segregation and division also existed throughout society. Within the governance of Macau, almost all government officers and civil service positions were held by local Portuguese residents. In September 1945, Republic of China Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed to the Portuguese government a desire to transfer Macau back to Chinese control. However, due to the Chinese Civil War, discussions related between the Kuomintang and the Portuguese were postponed indefinitely. In 1949, with the founding of the People's Republic of China a large number of refugees and Kuomintang supporters fled China to Portuguese Macau. Before the 12-3 incident, the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party parties both maintained a presence in Macau. With the founding of the People's Republic, the colonial Portuguese government opened unofficial relations with China due to the close proximity of Macau to Communist controlled southern China. Following the founding of the PRC, the influence of the Chinese Communists grew substantially in Macau especially among business leaders throughout the region.  The incident  Schools and education in Macau were divided on racial lines, with the Portuguese and Macanese sending their children to fully subsidized private schools while the Chinese population had to send their children to either Catholic or Communist schools.Chan, Monica Kiteng. ‚ÄúMemory Plaza: Encounter and Missed Encounter.‚Äù Portuguese Literary and Cultural Studies 17/18 (2010): 233‚Äì41. The segregation of education in Macau was an area of great contention for the local populations. In 1966, residents of Taipa Island, sponsored by the Chinese communists, tried to obtain permission to build a private school.Hong Kong's Watershed: The 1967 Riots, Gary Ka-wai Cheung, Hong Kong University Press, 2009, page 16 Despite being granted a plot of land by the Portuguese authorities, Portuguese officials delayed the processing of the building permits, as they had not received any bribes from the residents of Taipa Island. In spite of receiving no building permits from the local administration, local residents began construction of the private school.Sovereignty at the Edge: Macau and the Question of Chineseness, Cathryn H. Clayton, Harvard University Press, 2009, page 47 On 15 November 1966, Urban Services Officers on Taipa blocked further construction of the school, leading to a confrontation between Chinese protesters and Macau Police. The police, including plain-clothes officers, injured over 40 people, of whom 14 were later detained.Selected Hsinhua News Items, Xinhua News Agency, 1966, page 144 In response, a group of around 60 Chinese students and workers demonstrated outside the Governor's Palace in support of the residents of Taipa Island. The demonstrators shouted revolutionary slogans and read aloud from Mao Zedong's Little Red Book.Twentieth Century Colonialism and China: Localities, the Everyday, and the World, Bryna Goodman, David Goodman Routledge, 2012, pages 217-218 On 3 December 1966, demonstrators began to riot and denounced Portuguese authorities for \\"fascist atrocities\\".It Is My Opinion, Irene Corbally Kuhn, Reading Eagle, 19 January 1967 Protestors, instigated by local communists and pro-Beijing business owners, ransacked Portuguese institutions throughout Macau such as the Macau City Hall and Public Notary's Office. Violence was also directed towards local Chinese businesses and organizations loyal to the Kuomintang. Unlike in neighboring Hong Kong - which faced similar leftist riots - the business community largely did not back the colonial government. In Mainland China, specifically in Guangdong, Red Guards, inspired by the Cultural Revolution and angered by the violence towards Chinese in Macau, began to protest in large numbers at the Chinese-Macau border. On 3 December, the colonial government ordered the rioters and demonstrators to be arrested, leading to even more mass discontent and popular support for opposition to the Portuguese administration. In response, demonstrators toppled the statue of Colonel Vicente Nicolau de Mesquita at Largo do Senado, the city center, and also tore off the right arm of a statue of Jorge Alvares located on the former outer harbor ferry port.The Voices of Macao Stones: The Nanjing Massacre Witnessed by American and British Nationals, Lindsay Ride, May Ride, Jason Wordie, Hong Kong University Press, 1999, page 23 At the Leal Senado or city hall, portraits of former governors were torn off the walls, and books and city records were tossed into the street and set on fire.Rioters Fight Macao Police, The Evening Independent, 3 December 1966, page 14A Consequently, martial law was declared, authorizing a Portuguese military garrison and police to crack down on the protests. As a result, 8 people were killed by police and 212 were injured.  Resolution  In response to the crackdown, the Portuguese government immediately implemented a news blockade, Portuguese-language newspapers and magazines were banned, and newspapers in Portugal and overseas provinces were ordered to censor reports about the incident. In response to the incident, the Chinese government deployed the People's Liberation Army to the Chinese-Portuguese Macau border to prevent Red Guards from invading Macau.\\"Report of the Acting Director-General of Political Affairs of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Jo√£o Hall Themido, 28 December 1966,\\" PAA M. 1171, Portuguese Historic-Diplomatic Archives (AHDMNE), Lisbon.Fernandes, Mois√©s Silva. ‚ÄúMacau in Chinese Foreign Policy during the Cultural Revolution, 1966-1968.‚Äù Portuguese Literary and Cultural Studies 17/18 (2010): 209‚Äì24. Four Chinese warships also entered the waters of Macau in response to the crackdown. The security ring set around Macau by the Chinese would be involved in multiple casualty-causing conflicts with Red Guards attempting to invade Macau by both land and by sea. The pro-Beijing community in Macau adopted a \\"Three No's\\" approach as a means to continue their struggle with the Government -- no taxes, no service, no selling to the Portuguese. Representing Chinese Macau was the pro-Beijing Struggle Committee against Portuguese Persecution, known locally as the Committee of Thirteen. Chairman of the Committee was Leong Pui, the leader of the pro-Beijing Macau General Association of Labour. Negotiations to resolve and prevent further escalation between the People's Republic of China, Committee of Thirteen, and the Portuguese government took place in Guangdong. The chief negotiator for the Chinese was Ho Yin, whose involvement and commitment to resolve the crisis caused by the riot was crucial because at that time he was the only one who could contact directly both the Portuguese administration and Chinese officials in Guangzhou and Beijing, as he was the representative of Macau in the Legislative Council.Macao Is A Relic Of Bygone Era Of European Gunboat Diplomacy, David J Paine, Associated Press, Daily News, 14 May 1971, page 17 Ho Yin, Beijing's \\"unofficial representative\\" in Macau with Mao Zedong in 1956. The Portuguese, due to increasing pressures from both Beijing and Lisbon, agreed to sign agreements with the Committee of Thirteen and the Guangdong Government Foreign Affairs Bureau, along with an official statement of apology, and accepted responsibility for the events on 3 December 1966. On 29 January 1967, the Portuguese Governor, Jos√© Manuel de Sousa e Faro Nobre de Carvalho, with the endorsement of Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar, signed a statement of apology at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, under a portrait of Mao Zedong, with Ho, as the Chamber's President, presiding.Naked Tropics: Essays on Empire and Other Rogues, Kenneth Maxwell, Psychology Press, 2003, page 279 Alongside the apology, the Portuguese agreed to reinforce the role of the Macau Chinese business elite in running the governmental affairs of Macau, promised to never use force against the Chinese community of Macau, and agreed to pay reparations to the Chinese community in Macau to the sum of 2 million Macanese pataca as compensation for the eight dead and 212 injured. In contrast, the agreement signed with the Guangdong government was more favorable to the Portuguese; per the agreement, the Chinese government would take back all refugees who arrived in Macau from 30 January 1967 on wards, a promise China would keep until 1978. This marked the beginning of equal treatment and recognition of Chinese identity in Macau and the beginning of de facto Chinese control of the territory with Chinese Communist Ho Yin becoming the de facto governor of Macau. Portugal, China and the Macau Negotiations, 1986-1999, Carmen Amado Mendes, Hong Kong University Press, 2013, page 34 The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Alberto Franco Nogueira, described Portugal's role in Macau after 1967 as \\"a caretaker of a condominium under foreign supervision\\". Chinese media described the political situation of Macau as a \\"half liberated zone\\". Shortly after the agreements were signed, Chinese military forces around Macau were withdrawn and the Red Guard threat had subsided.  Aftermath  With the Portuguese now only nominally in control of Macau, political power would increasingly rest with the pro-Beijing trade unions and business leaders.Far Eastern Economic Review, 1974, page 439 The official Portuguese and Chinese positions about the political status of Macau did not differ, as both now described the region as a Chinese territory under Portuguese administration and not a colony or overseas territory.3Franco Nogueira, Salazar: estudo biografico, 6 vols.

As a consequence of Beijing's increasing influence, pro-Kuomintang activities in Macau were banned, and the Republic of China's diplomatic mission was closed.Macao Locals Favor Portuguese Rule, Sam Cohen, The Observer in Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 2 June 1974, page 4H The flying of the flag of the Republic of China was banned, and Kuomintang-run schools were also closed. In addition, refugees from mainland China were either barred from entering or returned to China. Emboldened by their success against the Portuguese, the Committee of Thirteen encouraged demonstrations against other institutions in Macau that were perceived to be antagonistic towards the People's Republic. Specifically, the British Consulate and the Macau Branch of the Hong Kong Immigration department were once again targeted by protestors. British consular staff in Macau were under constant threat and harassment by Red Guards, leading to the closure of the British consulate in 1967.Fernandes, Mois√©s Silva(2004) \\"As prostra√ß√µes das institui√ß√µes brit√¢nicas em Macau durante a 'revolu√ß√£o cultural' chinesa em Maio de 1967 e algumas das suas consequ√™ncias\\" (\\"The Prostration of British Institutions in Macau during the 'Chinese Cultural' Revolution in May 1967 and some of its Repercussions\\") Daxiyangguo: Revista Portuguesa de Estudos Asi√°ticos (Portuguese Journal of Asian Studies)Davies, Hugh. \\"An Undiplomatic Foray: A 1967 Escapade in Macau.\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch 47 (2007): 115-26.

On 25 April 1974, a group of left-wing Portuguese officers organized a coup d'√©tat in Portugal, overthrowing the right-wing ruling government that had been in power for 48 years. The new government began to transition Portugal to a democratic system and was committed to decolonization. The new Portuguese government carried out de- colonization policies and proposed Macau's handover to China to occur in 1978. The Chinese government rejected this proposal, believing that an early transfer of Macau would impact relations with Hong Kong. On 31 December 1975, the Portuguese government withdrew its remaining troops from Macau. On 8 February 1979, the Portuguese government decided to break off diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China the next day. Both Portugal and the People's Republic of China recognized Macau as Chinese territory. The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 20 December 1999, when it was transferred to China.

Angolan Influence in Portugal  Embassy of Angola in Lisbon The government in Angola had defeated the rebels, and the oil production had doubled the economy became one of the world's fastest growing economies.

They were added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 2007. History Twin towers in the Irish Hills In the early 1920s, the Michigan Observation Company sought places of high elevation to erect enclosed platforms to boost tourism. In southern Michigan, a tower was placed atop Bundy Hill in Hillsdale County and officials sought a knoll in the heart of the Irish Hills in Lenawee County. A farmer who owned half of the knoll, Edward Kelly, turned down the company's offer to purchase his portion of the land. The adjoining land owner, Thomas Brighton, consented to the sale of his plat, and construction of the Irish Hills Observatory commenced. The opening of the Irish Hills Observatory was announced by The Brooklyn Exponent in September 1924. In a gala celebration on October 4 and October 5, hundreds of people ascended the hill and tower to gaze upon the rolling landscape and crystal blue lakes in all directions. Kelly seemed angered by the exploitation of the MOC's venture, and protested by erecting his own tower. By the end of November, 1924, his own observation platform was in place, just feet away from the MOC's structure and several feet higher. The Michigan Observation Company responded by adding a second observation enclosure to the top of its own facilities, now designated as the Original Irish Hills Tower. Kelly proceeded to add a raised platform to his \\"Gray\\" tower (named as such because of its gray-painted exterior), an act which brought the two edifices to an even height. The MOC informed Kelly that if he attempted to compete with more height given to his tower, they would tear down their own and construct a metal observatory so large that Kelly's efforts would be nullified. He conceded, and turned his efforts instead to drawing more revenue to his creation. The Irish Hills Towers operated as separate and competitive entities through the 1950s, when Frank Lamping acquired both and connected them with a gift shop at the ground floor. They briefly closed in the late 1960s, and were refurbished in 1972, by Allen Good. They were given new observation platforms, and, as a result, attained a near-identical look. The Irish Hills Towers closed to the public at the end of the summer of 2000. The township deemed the towers unsafe in April 2013. The Irish Hills Historical Society began demolition of the tops of the towers on July 1, 2013 to begin the process of bringing them up to code. As of their September 2014 meeting, the township board had once again agreed to hold off demolition while the historical society continued fundraising to save the landmarks. As of 2017, the towers are being restored.

Club career After four seasons with local Club Atl√©tico River Plate, Montevideo-born Correa moved abroad to Atl√©tico Madrid, making his La Liga debut on 10 September 1995 against Racing de Santander. Incidentally, he would be loaned for two years to the Cantabrians, scoring 27 league goals in that period which was enough to earn a return to the Spanish capital. There, however, he would never be more than a decent attacking backup, at least in the top level; he did form an efficient partnership with compatriot Diego Alonso in 2001‚Äì02, as the Colchoneros returned to the top tier after two years, combining for 35 league goals. After a two-year stint with RCD Mallorca and a further six games for Real Valladolid (Segunda Divisi√≥n), Correa returned to Uruguay and River Plate, signing for Pe√±arol after a short stint with China's Shanghai Shenhua FC. In 2009, the 35-year-old rejoined his first professional club. Following his retirement, Alonso worked as assistant to Alonso in several teams.

In 2004, as he was a Mallorca player at the service of the national team, Correa tested positive for cocaine and was suspended for one year, also being immediately released by Atl√©tico.

In conflict with his ministry is the ‚ÄúIndigenous Church philosophy,‚ÄùIndigenous church mission theory which suggests that missionaries and evangelists working in Latin America should be Hispanic. More recently Jason Frenn‚Äôs crusades have shifted to include North America, again aimed at Spanish-speaking audiences. For years, Jason Frenn preaches that regardless of one's ethnicity, race or background, it is God who determines who is called to preach and not organizational philosophy.

The band also featured Hodgie Haynes, Dave Hanson (both on guitar), Ky Lambert (bass) and Dennis Wolfe (drums).

The album was described as \\"erupting with swelling pop melodies, hot-lava guitar textures and urgent punk attitude\\", and a \\"well crafted first effort\\". To date, this is U.S. Crush's only released album. About a year after its release, the group parted ways with Immortal/Virgin. After a break in 2001, U.S. Crush headed back into the studio in 2002 for their second album, and recorded several songs including \\"White Trash Girlfriend\\", \\"Enemy\\" and \\"Girls With Guitars\\", and shopped them around to labels but nobody was interested.

This wildflower is native to California and Baja California, where it grows on coastal, inland, and desert chaparral slopes, such as the Colorado Desert, and the Peninsular and Transverse Ranges. The presence of diterpenoid alkaloids, probably including the highly toxic methyllycaconitine,M. H. Benn (1966) Can. J. Chem. 44 1-8. in the above-ground parts of D. cardinale plants means that they are likely to be toxic. Description This tall larkspur grows on an erect stem which often exceeds two meters (~6 ft.) in height. The leaves are divided into many narrow lobes. The top of the thin stem is occupied by many widely spaced flowers, each at the end of a pedicel several centimeters long. Each flower has scarlet red sepals which are generally curled forward into a bowl shape. The petals are also scarlet, except for the top two which are scarlet marked with bright yellow blotches. The flower may be 3 centimeters wide and the same in length, including the spur. Habitat Typical habitat is in chert or shale talus at the edge of chaparral or within chaparral gaps. As its flowers would suggest, it is hummingbird pollinated. Chemical Studies Since D. cardinale does not seem to have been associated either with folk-medicinal usage or livestock- poisoning, it has been the object of only limited chemical study: in 1966, Mike Benn of the University of Calgary in Canada isolated the following diterpenoid alkaloids from the above-ground parts of D. cardinale plants collected in California: browniine; dehydrobrowniine; hetisine; dehydrohetisine and lycoctonine. There was also good evidence for the presence of methyllycaconitine, but this was not isolated.

Satyress is the female equivalent to satyrs. They are entirely an invention of post-Roman European artists, as the Greek satyrs were exclusively male and the closest there was to female counterparts were the nymphs, altogether different creatures who, however, were nature spirits or deities like the satyrs. Later on, Romans described their counterpart of the satyr -- the faunus -- as having his own female specimen, the fauna. Although effectively the same creature as the then-inexistant satyress, it actually came to be part of the Roman religion. The creation of gender-complementary pairs of deities serving the same function was a typically Roman religious characteristic. Description The Satyresses depicted with a human head and torso, generally including bare breasts, but the body of a goat from waist down. They were a late invention by poets and artists and are comparatively rare in classical art. Such a creature may also be known as a fauness, but this nomenclature is rarely seen in English; ' is the spelling in French. Though not often seen compared to the omnipresent depictions of male satyrs and centaurs, the satyress figure was certainly not unknown to Renaissance artists. Michelangelo included a haggard satyress nursing drunken toddlers at her elderly breasts in his 1533 work, The Children's Bacchanal.Michelangelo Buonarotti: The Children's Bacchanal, published online by Royal Collection: Royal Palaces, Residences, and Art Collection.

It aired on Fox in late 2001 and was produced by Columbia TriStar Television. With a pilot airing on November 8, the series ran nine episodes on broadcast television. It was released to DVD in 2003. History The 2001 sitcom was the first attempt at a live action incarnation of The Tick, a comic book created by Ben Edlund, which had previously been adapted for television as a successful animated series, The Tick, which ran 3 seasons from 1994 to 1996. The pilot for the live-action series, completed in May 2000, was written by the four main animated-series writers, Edlund, Randolph Heard, Richard Liebmann-Smith and Chris McCulloch, and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld with production design by Bo Welch. Executive producer Larry Charles sought to create a character camaraderie similar to that of Seinfeld. He discussed this approach at a July 2000 press conference: > If the show is perceived as merely a superhero show or merely a superhero > parody show, I don't think it's going to work on a weekly basis. What's > great about the comic book and what was great about the cartoon also has to > be great about the live-action show, which is the characters and the > interaction of the characters and creating a world that you believe is real. > It's a world in which the characters being superheroes is almost a secondary > consideration, so that the characters are more important than their > costumes. While working on the pilot episode, Ben Edlund described the series as \\"closer in tone to the comic book, favoring character over action, painting a superheroic portrait of genuine human lameness.\\"Ben Edlund comments from alt.tv.the-tick TheTick.ws (2000). Retrieved on 5-15-09. It features a parody style similar to the animated series and the bulky Patrick Warburton in the title role. Guest stars include Ron Perlman, Christopher Lloyd, Kurt Fuller, Armin Shimerman, and Dave Foley.Naugle, Patrick The Tick: The Entire Series DVDVerdict.com (October 31, 2003). Retrieved on 1-05-08. The series also featured appearances by then unknowns T.J. Thyne and Missi Pyle. The Walt Disney Company inherited Fox's previous children's programming lineup and therefore owned the rights to many of the show's names and trademarks. For this reason, American Maid and Die Fledermaus, two major characters in the animated series, were unable to be written into the new show; they were replaced by Captain Liberty and Batmanuel. Disregarding the back stories given in both the comic books and animated series, the sitcom has The Tick being tricked into moving to (and protecting) The City after irritating employees of a remote bus station he had sworn to protect. It is also more adult oriented, including more sexual innuendo and adult situations. As such, the series virtually eliminated action scenes and significantly reduced emphasis on extravagant supervillains, both of which were often featured in the animated series. Regarding the mature tone, Edlund expressed his desire for less vulgarity, particularly in a moment of the pilot where The Tick said \\"Java Devil, you are now my bitch.\\" However, Edlund lacked the authority to remove such phrasing.Thus Spake Tick Creator Ben Edlund Slashdot.org (November 27, 2001). Retrieved on 5-16-09. The Tick's costume, designed by Colleen Atwood, bore a notable difference from previous incarnations in that the Tick's face would be entirely exposed. This eliminated the large pupil-less eyes seen in previous incarnations and allowed Warburton to utilize his expressive face; according to Edlund, \\"There was no way to cover his eyes and get the same range, intensity, and specificity of emotion. With face unfettered, Patrick has created a three-dimensional, hilarious, totally convincing Tick.\\" The antennae of Tick's mask were also remote-controlled by puppeteer Mark Setrakian for comedic effect. The production design is by Emmy-nominated Michael Wylie. Over a year and a half after its development, The Tick was finally picked up by the network for an 8:30 p.m. prime time slot on Thursday nights. Due to budget constraints, additional episodes were shot with several- month gaps between filming. Fox had initially wanted to premiere the series in early 2001 as a midseason replacement but opted to air it in prime time both due to its ratings success and the network's fear that a strike might delay the fall season. Cast, crew, and journalists expressed early concern over the high-stakes slot, with Fox's Sunday night comedy schedule looking more favorable. Nevertheless, Fox Television Entertainment Group president Sandy Grushow assured that promoting The Tick during the 2001 World Series would work and that \\"Baseball is a terrific promotional platform for a show like The Tick.\\" Grushow also noted that if the series were to perform well, the network would have until December 2001 to order new episodes, though they would not likely be ready until late spring or summer at the earliest.Owen, Rob 'The Tick': Tick, tick, tick ... Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (November 5, 2001). Retrieved on 5-16-09. While Fox has been criticized for its lack of investment in the series, N2Toys produced a line of action figures based on it. The live action Tick ultimately failed to recapture the success of its animated predecessor; however, its popularity was strong enough that the series would be released on DVD in 2003. The series led to Christopher McCulloch, who wrote for the Tick comic book, animated series, and sitcom, meeting Patrick Warburton during filming; shortly after, he cast Warburton as the voice of Brock Samson for his Adult Swim series, The Venture Bros. Tick creator Ben Edlund also wrote for The Venture Bros. on occasion. =Cancellation= Concerns regarding the show's time slot, where it aired against popular shows like Survivor: Africa and NBC's Must See TV lineup, were manifested in early 2002 when The Tick was canceled after eight of the nine episodes had aired. According to Patrick Warburton, The Tick performed poorly because Fox did not own the series as they did The Bernie Mac Show and 24, and therefore rarely promoted it. Warburton added that despite fan and critical praise, the high production costs further discouraged FOX from giving The Tick a chance.Thomas, David The Hardest Working Vocal Cords in Show Business: An Interview with Patrick Warburton AMCtv.com (originally on FilmCritic.com) (2004).

Rambertino di Guido BuvalelliHis first name is also given as Lambertino (a diminutive of Lambert/Lamberto) and his surname appears in various forms in contemporary Latin: Bonarellis, Brumarello, Buraldo, Bucanello, Bovarellus, and de Bivialdo. \\"di Guido\\" implies that Guido (Guy) was his father's name and \\"Buvalelli\\" that the name of his grandfather or the founding father of his family was Buvalello (diminutive of Buvalo). His standardised Occitan name is Lamberti (or Ramberti) de Buvalel. Occitan variations include Rambertin, Lambertin, Rambertins, and Rabertis, as well as Bonarel, Bonarelh, and Buvarel. (1170/1180 - September 1221), a Bolognese judge, statesman, diplomat, and poet, was the earliest of the podest√†-troubadours of thirteenth-century Lombardy. He served at one time or other as podest√† of Brescia, Milan, Parma, Mantua, Genoa, and Verona. Ten of his Occitan poems survive, but none with an accompanying melody. He is usually regarded as the first native Italian troubadour, though Cossezen and Peire de la Caravana may precede him. His reputation has secured a street named in his honour in his birthplace: the Via Buvalelli Rambertino in Bologna. Political career Rambertino was a law student at the University of Bologna in his youth and became attached to the Este court not long after. It was there that he made the acquaintance of Beatrice d'Este, whom he celebrates in all his songs. He was patronised by Azzo VI and he had strong ties to the Guelph party in Italy. He first appears as podest√† of Brescia in 1201, when the Annales Brixienses (\\"Annals of Brescia\\") record that receptus est Rembertinus potestas (\\"Rambertino was received as podest√†\\"). He made peace that year with Cremona, Bergamo, and Mantua. In 1203 he was again in Bologna, serving as a procurator, his term in Brescia having ended. The next five years are obscure from a distance of eight hundred, but he was podest√† of Milan in 1208. He appears in Milanese documents as Lambertinus Bonarelus and Lambertinus de Bonarellis, but there is no doubt among historians that they are references to the troubadour. In 1209 Rambertino was back in Bologna, where he was console di giustizia (\\"consul of justice\\"). In 1212 he was serving as ambassador for Pope Innocent IV's cardinal-legate Ugo di Sessa, soon to be Bishop of Vercelli, to Modena, but by May he had returned to Bologna. A Buvalello was procurator of Bologna again in 1212, though it is a myth that Rambertino was involved in a property dispute involving Sambuca during the guerrilla between Pistoia and Bologna that year. He was podest√† of Parma in 1213.He is referred to in Parmesan documents under the long name and title dominus (=lord) Lambertinus Guidonis Buvali de Bononia. He resumed the office of consul in Bologna in 1214 and swore to uphold the league between Bologna and Reggio nell'Emilia that year. Rambertino was podest√† at Mantua between 1215 and 1216, his longest term yet.Documents refer to him as Lambertinus de Bivialdo. In 1217 he was elected to the podesteria of Modena, to which he had formerly served briefly on an embassy.The chronicle of Marano reports that Lambertinus de Buvalello de Bononia potestas Mutine in MCCXVII. A document of 5 December 1217 mentions a judgement made by a judge of the commune during the tenure of \\"d. Ramb.\\", clearly dominus Rambertinus. In 1218 Rambertino was named to the podesteria of Genoa and he held it for three consecutive years through 1220.Another Rambertino Buvalelli was podest√† of Genoa in 1248. It was probably in his three years at Genoa that he introduced Occitan lyric poetry to the city, which was later to develop a flourishing Occitan literary culture. Rambertino was again offered the podesteria of Modena in 1221 but refused it because of a papal injunction of Honorius III. In that very year he was named podest√† of Verona, a post he accepted, but he died in September. His obituary reads: MCCXXI. Hoc de mense septembris obit dominus Lambertus Buvalelli potestas Verone.\\"1221. This month of September died lord Lambert Buvalelli, podest√†.\\" Poetic career Rambertino probably learned Occitan by reading anthologies (chansonniers) rather than through contact with other troubadours.Brand and Pertile, 8. His poetry, modest in volume, is skilled and the poet utilised difficult rhyme schemes and alliteration. Rambertino's technical proficiency is evident and his language is unadulterated by Italianisms.Keller, 295. As one of the earliest Italian troubadours, it is perhaps unsurprising that he stuck with the theme of courtly love and wrote only cansos. He did have contact with other troubadours, notably Elias Cairel, whom at the end of Toz m'era de chantar gequiz he asks to bring the poem to Beatrice at the Este court. And perhaps it was Rambertino's deft treatment of love that prompted Peire Raimon de Tolosa to address his De fin'amor son tuit mei pessamen, described as \\"one of the finest descriptions of fin'amor ever written\\", to him.Keller, 299. Works Rambertino's surviving poems are listed alphabetically: *Al cor m'estai l'amorous desirers *D'un salut me voill entremetre *Er quant florisson li verger *Eu sai la flor plus bella d'autra flor *Ges de chantar nom voill gequir *Mout chantera de ioi e voluntiers *Pois vei quel temps s'aserena *S'a mon Restaur pognes plazer *Seigner, scel qi la putia *Toz m'era de chantar gequiz NotesSources *Bertoni, Giulio.

In the 2009-10 season Carter signed to the NBDL and was drafted 21st by the Austin Toros under Coach Quin Snyder. Hampered by injuries the entire season Carter posted averages below those of his previous NBDL campaign (6.4ppg, 2.4rpg). Towards the end of the regular season Carter left the team to play overseas in both Venezuela (Bucaneros de La Guaira- 17.4ppg, 8.1rpg) and Colombia (Bucaros de Bucaramanga-27.2ppg, 7.5rpg). In 2010-11, Carter had a brief stint with Verviers-Pepinster (Belgium 1st Division). After coach Ivica Skelin was fired due to a losing record, Carter opted out of his contract to play in Philippines (PBA) for the Powerade Tigers.

Born in Sarlat in the P√©rigord, he first travelled with the Fourth Crusade and settled down in the Kingdom of Thessalonica at the court of Boniface of Montferrat (1204-1208/10) before moving back to western Europe, where he sojourned at the court of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n (1210-11) and in Lombardy (1219-1222/24). He wrote fourteen surviving lyrics: ten cansos, one tenso, one descort, one sirventes, and one Crusade song. He was partial to refrain rhyming and coblas capfinidas. Elias' vida survives in three manuscripts with a variant in a fourth designed to refute the other three.Egan, 31. According to his biographer he was gold- and silversmith and an armourer who turned to minstrelsy. His singing, composition, fiddling, and speaking were reputed as \\"bad\\", but his biographer says ben escrivia motz e sons: \\"well he wrote words and songs\\", implying a distinction between his composing and his writing.Aubrey, 28-29. He supposedly returned from Romania to die in Sarlat. Elias composed his only tenso with the trobairitz Ysabella, who may have been either a high-ranking noblewoman of Italy or Greece, or perhaps just a local girl of P√©rigord who Elias knew in his youth. She is also the addressee of two other poems. Elias also addressed one poem to Ruiz D√≠az de Coneros (Roiz Dies), a Spanish patron, and another to Conon de B√©thune (Coino), a trouv√®re.Riquer, 1144-45. Elias may have been present at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. In his Toz m'era de chantar gequiz, the Bolognese troubadour Rambertino Buvalelli asks Elias to bring the poem to Beatrice d'Este when he travels to the court of Azzo VII at Este.

It grows in moist mountainous environments, such as riverbanks and meadows. This plant sprouts one to several tall, stout, pale green erect stems which may approach three meters in height. The lobed leaves are generally found only at the base of the plant. The top of the stem is a large inflorescence which may itself be over a meter long. It usually contains over fifty widely spaced flowers, with each flower on a pedicel a few centimeters long. The sepals are flat and extend to the sides or point forward. The sepals and petals are dark blue to deep purple, although the top two petals may be lighter in color to almost white. They may be somewhat wrinkly. The spur is about two centimeters long. Larkspurs have long been associated with livestock-poisoning in North America, and D. glaucum (under the name D. brownii) is a species that has caused problems in the rangelands of Alberta, in western Canada.V. N. Aiyar, M. H. Benn, T. Hanna, J. Jacyno, S. H. Roth and J. L. Wilkens (1979) Experientia 35 1367-1368. Chemical studies The earliest phytochemical research on D.glaucum (then known as D. brownii ) was that of Richard Manske, working at the National Research Laboratories in Ottawa, Canada, in 1938, who isolated an alkaloid that he was unable to purify adequately, and the common plant-sugar, mannitol.R. H. F. Manske (1938) Can. J. Chem., Sect. B 16 57-60. A few years later, John Goodson, at the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories in London, England, isolated what he believed to be the same alkaloid, in purer form, from seeds of Delphinium elatum, and named it \\"methyl-lycaconitine\\".J. A. Goodson (1943) J. Chem. Soc. 139-141. Further work to identify the chemical constituents of D. glaucum (still called D. brownii) was carried out by Michael Benn and his co-workers at the National Research Council laboratories in Ottawa, Canada in 1963.M. H. Benn, M. A. M. Cameron and O. E. Edwards (1963) Can. J. Chem. 41 477-482. These chemists confirmed the presence of methyllycaconitine in the plant, and also isolated another, structurally related diterpenoid alkaloid, which they named browniine. Delphinium glaucum (still under the name D. brownii) was studied again by Mike Benn's research group, at the University of Calgary, in Canada, with the objective of identifying the compounds responsible for its toxicity. These researchers again found methyllycaconitine and browniine in the plant, but also a closely related alkaloid, browniine-14-acetate, as well as the alkaloid magnoflorine, belonging to the aporphine class. Of these, methyllycaconitine was found to be the most toxic.

In 1876 he earned his doctorate at the University of Vienna, and remained in Vienna as an assistant in the clinic of Heinrich von Bamberger (1822‚Äì1888). Soon afterwards, he became a surgical apprentice to Theodor Billroth (1829‚Äì1894), and from 1878 to 1881 worked as a secondary physician under Leopold Ritter von Dittel (1815‚Äì1898). In 1881 he became hospital director at Landesklinikum Weinviertel in Hollabrunn. He was a younger brother to Alexander von Winiwarter (1848‚Äì1917), who also spent part of his career working with Theodor Billroth. Winiwarter is credited for providing an early description of thromboangiitis obliterans. In 1879 he described a situation involving a 57-year-old male patient who had an unusual obliteration of the arteries and veins of the leg. He attributed this disorder to new growth of tissue from the intima, and proposed the name \\"endarteritis obliterans\\" for the disease. Winiwarter's discovery wasn't the first modern description of the condition, as three years earlier, bacteriologist Carl Friedl√§nder (1847‚Äì1887) referred to it as \\"arteritis obliterans\\".

Participants may be committed to the nudist lifestyle or want a different kind of wedding. Hedonism III's world's largest nude wedding in Jamaica, February 14, 2003. The wedding couple may be nude while the guests may come nude or dressed, or with the couple and all the guests naked. There are 270 clubs in America that are clothes-free or clothes-optional, and some of these serve as locations for nude weddings. In China, \\"naked wedding\\" has come to mean a simple, low-budget wedding, not involving the purchase of a house, car, or wedding rings. Such weddings have become more popular. The term does not refer to actual nudity. Growth of the nude wedding The first publicized nude wedding took place at the Garden of Eden at the 1934 World's Fair in Chicago. There has been an increase in nude weddings with the growth of nude recreational practices. According to the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR), founded in 1931, nude recreation grew 75 percent during the 1990s. Today, the AANR estimates it has grown to be a 440 million dollar industry, from $120 million in 1992. Traditional elements Nude weddings can include traditional flowers, veils and accessories, music, and food. An official conducts the ceremony and legal requirements are as for any other wedding. World's largest nude wedding The largest nude wedding took place 2003 in Jamaica with 29 couples married at the same time. The wedding was at Hedonism III in Runaway Bay, Jamaica on Valentine's Day. Couples included a Russian, a Canadian, and an American Indian from the Crow tribe. The ceremony was conducted by Rev. Frank Cervasio of the Universal Life Church in Florida. Participants were required to stay a minimum of 4 days, and arrive on February 12, two days before the marriage ceremony. In popular culture Nude weddings are the norm in the fictional Betazoid culture in Star Trek because of their ability to see thoughts and emotions of others. This gift evolved their society into an open one, which allowed nude weddings without taboo. In the 1960s Irving Klaw directed Girls Come Too (also known as How I Became a Nudist ) in which Maria Stinger married her real-life husband Harry Stinger (known in the film as 'Dick Powers') in a nudist ceremony at a Miami nudist camp.

It is the third indigenous Muslim dynasty of Sistan, having been preceded by the Saffarid and Nasrid dynasties. Overview Most of what is known about the Mihrabanids comes from two sources. The first, the Tarikh-i Sistan, was completed in the mid-14th century by an unknown chronologist and covers the first hundred years of the dynasty's history. The other, the Ihya' al-muluk, was written by the 17th century author Malik Shah Husayn ibn Malik Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad and covers the entire history of the Mihrabanids' rule of Sistan. The Mihrabanids used the title of malik during their rule of Sistan. A malik could inherit the throne or be appointed by the nobles and military commanders. Their capital was generally the city of Shahr-i Sistan. Outside of the capital, the Mihrabanids frequently had problems asserting their authority over the outer towns of the province, and on occasion had to resort to force in order to bring them into line. The maliks often gave control of these towns to other Mihrabanids. Sometimes the Mihrabanids managed to extend their influence beyond Sistan, such as when parts of Quhistan were conquered in the late 13th century. Ilkhanate vassals The Mihrabanids were often vassals of their more powerful neighbors. The Mihrabanids assumed control of Sistan in the wake of its subjugation by the Mongols. After the foundation of the Ilkhanate by Hulegu Khan in 1256 the maliks recognized the Ilkhans as their overlords. Under the Ilkhans, Sistan's distance from the capital gave the Mihrabanids a high degree of autonomy. During this time they intermittently fought against the Kartid maliks of Herat, who were also Ilkhanid vassals, and had replaced them in eastern Persia.Farhad Daftary, A Short History of the Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community, (Edinburgh University Press, 1998), 163. By 1289, all of Quhistan had been conquered by the Mihrabanids, with Nasir al-Din Muhammad giving it to his son Shams al-Din 'Ali as an appanage.Farhad Daftary, The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines, (Cambridge University Press, 2007), 411. After the Ilkhanate's collapse in the mid-14th century the Mihrabanids were independent for almost half a century. This independence was ended by Timur, who invaded Sistan in 1383 and caused extensive devastation to the province. The Mihrabanids henceforth were Timurid vassals until the latter's overthrow by the Shaybanids in the first decade of the 16th century. The last malik of the dynasty decided to recognize the authority of the Safavids, eventually handing over control of Sistan and ending the Mihrabanids' governance of the region. Both the Mihrabanids and the general population of Sistan were Sunni Muslims. In the early 16th century Malik Sultan Mahmud became a Safavid vassal; as a result certain Shi'i religious practices were introduced, such as the Shi'i call to prayer. This transition was disliked by many of the people of Sistan.C.E. Bosworth, The History of the Saffarids of Sistan and the Maliks of Nimruz (247/861 to 949/1542-3), (Mazda Publishers, 1994), 475-6.

He also designed costumes for Jane Annie at the Savoy (1893) and for the Olympia, London spectacles Nero (1889) and Venice (1891). A design for As You Like It Wilhelm was, perhaps, best known for his work for the Empire Theatre, London, from 1887 to 1915, where he designed both scenery and costumes for (and sometimes produced) numerous ballets, many of which starred Adeline Gen√©e, and which established a fashion for stage design and were much imitated. His later costume designs included The New Aladdin (1906); Edward German's opera Tom Jones (1907); Peter Pan (the famous mermaid costumes for the 1905 revival); and The Arcadians (1909) and The Mousm√© (1911), among other musical comedies.

Zamloch performed at mining camp ‚Äúopera houses‚Äù in the wild west, New York theaters and locations in Mexico, Hawaii, Canada and across the United States. His act grew to a large size, and he traveled with three assistants and ‚Äúover a ton of baggage.‚Äù Some newspaper accounts described him as ‚Äúthe greatest magician of the age.‚Äù Early years touring the west In the early years of his career, Zamloch toured mining towns and other locales in the western United States. The first press report found on Zamloch was a review in the Morning Oregonian on November 11, 1874, reporting that ‚ÄúProf. Zamloch, the clever magician, made his professional appearance for the first time in Portland, and gave a number of good tricks.‚Äù In October 1879, the Oakland Tribune reported on Zamloch's performances at the Dietz Opera House: ‚ÄúThe continued success which Zamloch the magician has met with at Dietz Opera House this week is almost unprecedented in the history of public entertainments given in Oakland. . . . . His extravaganzas of magic were so swiftly executed and so mysteriously subtle that two centuries ago he could have been richly deserved being burned at the stake as a necromancer of the blackest arts and disciple of his satanic majesty. But at this advanced age in anno domini 1879 he is a pleasant gentleman and harmless entertainer. The world does move.‚Äù In 1881, he visited southern Utah. To secure publicity for his shows, he went to the office of the local newspaper, The Silver Reef Miner. Supposing it would amuse the editorial staff, he made three unopened quarts of whiskey and a large box of cigars vanish. Zamloch later recalled that the editors were not amused, accused him of banditry, and he was nearly shot. The incident ended with the return of the whiskey and cigars, and the paper ran an account Zamloch's hoax. Zamloch kept a clipping from The Silver Reef Miner in his scrapbook. He once traveled with a sixteen-mule freight operation from Silver City, New Mexico, to Winnemucca, Nevada ‚Äì a ten-day journey of ‚Äúcontinual dust.‚Äù When Zamloch appeared in Tombstone, Arizona, site of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the local paper reported: ‚ÄúProfessor Anton Zamloch returned to Tombstone, on November 19, fortified with more experience and the plaudits of other communities. . . . ‚ÄôHis spirit rapping, taking three cages and as many canaries from a hat of one of the audience, shooting doves out of an omelet, and hundreds of other amusing deceptions kept the audience in good humor.\\" Tours of Mexico He made tours of Mexico in 1905 and 1906. While traveling to Mexico, he was robbed by customs agents before being allowed to take his magical contraptions into Mexico. In Mexico City, he was accompanied by performing bullfighters, who were killed off one by one. Zamloch was surprised to learn that most Mexican theaters he appeared in did not have seats. Instead, it was customary for spectators to bring chairs from home or rent them from furniture stores. Culiac√°n Municipal Palace Zamloch also learned that the most effective form of advertising in Mexico was to hold a street parade promoting the show. Musicians were hired, and local boys were paid to pass out programs along the parade route. During the parade, business would stop as the people of the town came to watch the parade. In Culiac√°n, the capital of Sinaloa, Zamloch's parade passed the palace, where the governor was sitting on his veranda. Zamloch stopped in front of the governor, bowed, and pulled from his top hat a green, white and red bird ‚Äì the colors of the Mexican flag. The governor bowed back at Zamloch, who then waved a program which turned into a silk Mexican flag. The governor saluted, and Zamloch pulled from his hat cigarettes, combs, and five or six pounds of green, white and red candy, which he gave to the locals. Finally, he pulled a pint of champagne from the top-hat, which he shared with the governor. Tours of Hawaii David Kalakaua He made four tours of Hawaii in 1880, 1882, 1895, and 1904. Zamloch recalled that superstitious Hawaiians would lower their voices whenever they spoke of ‚ÄúKahuna‚Äù (black arts). Zamloch said he was known in Hawaii as ‚ÄúZamaloka Kahuna‚Äù. He met King David Kalakaua at Iolani Palace in January 1880 and kept an autographed letter from the king and an autographed invitation card from Queen Kapiolani to attend an afternoon luau on the palace grounds. The act Zamloch's act changed over his 40-plus years as an entertainer and included communication with the deceased through spiritualism, sleight of hand tricks using Zamloch's skills of prestidigitation, illusions, card tricks, conjuring, vanishing tricks, burlesque, and humor. =The spirit- rapping table and goblin drum= One of Zamloch's trademark routines involved his spirit-rapping table and drum. An 1890 newspaper article described the trick this way: ‚ÄúThe rapping table is placed in the main aisle in the auditorium and has a wooden dish which tilts against the top of the table and raps out answers to questions posed by the audience. The drum held in the hands of the magician raps answers also.‚Äù In 1896, the Hawaiian Gazette described the routine this way: ‚ÄúThe most mysterious of the twelve numbers on the program was the mystic bouquet, in which spirit rapping table and the goblin drum were introduced. On an ordinary table was placed a wooden disc higher in the center than on the edge ‚Äì this was placed in the aisle within plain view of persons sitting near. Without any visible connections the disc rapped on the table at the call of the professor. Then a drum suspended from uprights was placed in the aisle, nearer the stage, and was made to beat roll call, marches and knock in answer to questions regarding cards selected by persons in the audience from a pack which the professor held in his hand.‚Äù Zamloch later recalled that the Eastern cities were ‚Äúdaffy about spiritualism‚Äù in the 1880s and 1890s. After a tour of the East, vaudeville king Tony Pastor said, ‚ÄúNo one has been able to solve the mystery of how a drum and table can be made to talk; yet they do ‚Äì at command of Zamloch.‚Äù In retirement, Zamloch kept the talking drum and table in his basement and proudly boasted that, ‚ÄúNo performer ever has had my magic table and drum act. That is, nobody except the baby of our family, Carl Zamloch; he made them talk during the few months he was in vaudeville; he could be a clever magician, if he didn‚Äôt prefer baseball.‚Äù (Zamloch's son, Carl Zamloch, played baseball with Ty Cobb on the Detroit Tigers and was the head coach of the University of California's baseball team from 1916‚Äì1929.) =Making an omelet in a top-hat= Typical top hat of the time One of Zamloch's most popular conjuring tricks was to beat eggs in a top hat borrowed from a man in the audience. He would mix eggs and other ingredients in the hat and, when he was done, serve an omelet on a platter to a woman in the audience. He would then brush off the top hat and return it to the owner‚Äîundamaged. =The bumbling assistant reveals the illusion= In the 1880s, Zamloch met a young man named Charlie Irving, who sang parodies on the songs of the day. Zamloch hired him as his assistant to sing comic songs, dress as a stage clown, and burlesque some of Zamloch's lesser tricks. Zamloch had a running gag with Irving in which the assistant's ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù buffoonery would expose how one of Zamloch's tricks had been done. At times, Irving would do a comic version of the omelet in the hat trick in which he would take the hat from a confederate in the audience, wipe his egg-dripped hand on the outside of the top hat. Irving would then return the badly damaged hat to its ‚Äúowner‚Äù and say, ‚ÄúExcuse me, but I have forgotten the rest of this trick.‚Äù Once in Canada, Irving used the hat of the local governor instead of the hat of a confederate. When Irving returned the governor's hat ‚Äúfilled with goo‚Äù, the audience ‚Äúbroke loose and some laughed until they lay down in the aisles‚Äù. Zamloch ran from the wings and offered to pay for the hat. In 1881, the bumbling assistant routine resulted in articles published across the country, including Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The articles typically reported that Zamloch had hired an assistant named Higgins who revealed to Zamloch shortly before the curtain went up for a big show that he so near-sighted he could not see ten feet in front of him. The near-sighted assistant was positioned below a trap door in the stage, and when the signal came to make a boy disappear, the assistant inadvertently shoved a ‚Äútwo dollar ladder‚Äù up through the trap door knocking over Zamloch's props and exposing the illusion. Zamloch acted bedeviled, and the audience laughed at the mishap. The articles reported that Zamloch concluded his show with an illusion in which he rammed the near-sighted assistant into a double-barrel shotgun and shot him at a mark. The articles ended by noting that the assistant had not been seen since the show, ‚Äúand the janitor who found a large wart on the stage, which he said he could identify, thinks that there has been foul play somewhere.‚Äù =The enchanted horse trough= Another popular Zamloch trick was the ‚ÄúEnchanted Horse Trough‚Äù. In this routine, buckets of water were poured into a trough on stage. Zamloch would then fish with rod and line and catch live and wet carp from the trough. His assistant would also fish from the trough and pull out, dripping wet, a rubber boot, a dead cat and finally a live devil, which was pushed back into the trough with much splashing. Then, Zamloch would tip over the trough and reveal it to be empty and dry. Zamloch later recalled that the enchanted trough was a big hit in Chicago, Omaha, and Kansas City. =Accusation of stealing a wedding ring= So powerful were Zamloch's skills that an audience member following a show in 1897 complained to the local police that Zamloch had bewitched her wedding ring from her gloved hand. Zamloch kept a letter he received from a California constable that said: ‚ÄúI take pleasure to write you that the lady, Mrs. Crossman, who claimed last night that you, by your magic and bewitching power, had stolen her wedding ring from her gloved hand during your last night‚Äôs performance, is feeling much better this morning. She says she found that you had reconsidered the matter and by your great spirit power had returned the ring to her. In other words, she found the darn ring in her trunk, which she had packed yesterday for a trip to Montana.‚Äù =The Indian basket trick= Zamloch also had a trick in which he would close himself in a large Indian basket on stage and then re-appear in the audience or at the back of the theater. In 1890, a Fresno, California, newspaper described the trick this way: ‚ÄúOne of the most surprising things in the performance is the Indian basket trick. A large basket is placed on four chairs on the stage in full view of the spectators. Zamloch gets into the basket and the cover is shut down. In less than two minutes he was seen in the middle of the dress circle and the cover is taken off the basket, showing that it is empty.‚Äù In a variation on the basket trick, Zamloch shut himself up in an oversized champagne basket on center stage. He would stick his hand out of the basket and fire a pistol and then a moment later greeting the audience by saying, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù from the main entrance. =Dancing skeletons= One of his most popular routines was the skeleton dance, in which he ‚Äúcould make two skeletons do a buck-and-wing dance (a form of tap-dancing used in 19th century minstrel shows) to ragtime music.‚Äù Another article reported favorably on ‚Äúthe graveyard scene of the dancing skeletons.‚Äù Spectators in Hawaii were ‚Äúdisappointed at the non-performance of the ‚Äòdancing skeletons.‚Äô‚Äù =Severed nose= Zamloch also performed an illusion in which he perform rhinoplasty on stage. A Fresno newspaper described the routine as follows: ‚ÄúFor one of his feats he called an urchin from the audience to the stage. The Professor found, he said, that the boy‚Äôs nose was too long and he would have to cut a portion of it off, which he, it appeared from the auditorium, had proceeded to do. It was very funny and realistic, and when he had finished the little chap felt to see if his nose was all there to the merriment of the spectators. ‚ÄòJust tell them at the doorkeeper tomorrow night that you are the boy whose nose was cut off last night and he will let you in free,‚Äô remarked the Professor, as the little fellow left the stage.‚Äù In 1882, The Evening Telephone from Eureka, California, gave this account of the severed nose trick: ‚ÄúZamloch cut off a boy‚Äôs nose last night. However, he put it on again ‚Äì and not upside down. Congratulations, young fellow! Put it there! Your hand ‚Äìnot the nose.‚Äù =Disappearing jewels= Zamloch also had a routine in which he would use a large case of \\"jewels\\". He would ask a shy young man in the audience to hold the case for him, and \\"later, when the shy young man was requested to show the jewels to the spectators, there would be nothing in the case but one of those large whaleboned corsets in which girls of that period encased themselves.\\" Zamloch recalled that the routine \\"always brought a great laugh, much to the shy young man‚Äôs discomfiture.‚Äù =Other tricks= Zamloch's other noted tricks included: make a bird cage containing two birds vanish; making and serving hot coffee from a little baskets of colored bits of paper; and breaking eggs into a frying pan and making a fire in it, and upon uncovering the pan having a pair of doves fly out. =Billy Marx= Zamloch also used a comic sidekick and assistant known as Billy Marx, who was the brother of Zamloch's wife. Zamloch's handbills described Marx as being slow and ‚Äúnever in a hurry‚Äù. In 1897, the Fresno Bee described Zamloch as ‚Äúone of the wonders of the world‚Äù and noted of Billy: ‚ÄúBilly, the assistant, is one of those peculiar personages whose every wink and gesture, brings forth peals of laughter.‚Äù According to the Oakland Tribune, ‚ÄúBilly made wise-cracks and ‚Äòhad a way with him‚Äô that audiences found amusing.‚Äù The Hawaiian Gazette described him as Zamloch‚Äôs ‚Äúirrepressible assistant ‚ÄòBilly‚Äô Marx.‚Äù On their appearance in Reno, Nevada, in 1896, the Nevada State Journal commented on Zamloch‚Äôs use of a ‚Äúslow-going‚Äù assistant named ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù, who afforded ‚Äúno little amusement to the audience‚Äù. The Ventura Democrat described him as the ‚Äúconstitutionally tired assistant‚Äù. Apparently, though, Marx's humor was not for all tastes. In 1897, one writer noted: ‚ÄúZamloch is assisted by ‚ÄòBilly‚Äô Marx, ‚Äònever in a hurry,‚Äô as the program states, and that's no exaggeration. He is painfully slow at times and his humor is of an inferior kind. ‚ÄòNever in a hurry‚Äô ought to be suppressed just a little.‚Äù Press coverage of Zamloch Zamloch was also apparently an expert in dealing with the press. His arrival and performances received extensive press coverage in local newspapers in the cities where he performed. The following is a sampling of that coverage. In 1880, The Daily Gazette in Colorado Springs noted: ‚ÄúDo not fail to visit Court House Hall tonight. Zamloch, the wizard will give you a present worth ten times your money, more or less, and will entertain you besides to a greater extend than the price of your ticket.‚Äù On his return to Colorado Springs the following year, The Daily Gazette noted: ‚ÄúZamloch is certainly a very clever prestidigitator and many of his tricks appear incapable of explanation. When he holds a wire cage containing a live canary and then advancing into the midst of the audience with an upward toss of his hand makes the cage and bird instantly disappear he performs one of the cleverest tricks known to the profession. The manner in which Zamloch manufactured piping hot coffee out of nothing and then provided cream from empty space was truly startling and was greeted with prolonged applause. To describe all the feats performed by him would take more than a column of space . . .‚Äù The review noted that Zamloch also distributed presents of real value ‚Äúin strict accordance with the announcement.‚Äù A California newspaper in 1883 gave Zamloch the following review: ‚ÄúZamloch, the great presidigitateur and gift autocrat, concluded a series of four entertainments in the City Hall, Tuesday evening. The gentleman is a clever performer, and his entertainments were largely patronized and gave general satisfaction. The presents distributed were of a higher grade than those usually given by shows of this character. Zamloch is great.‚Äù When Zamloch returned to Portland in 1883, the Morning Oregonian announced: ‚ÄúTomorrow evening Zamloch, the Austrian conjuror, opens for a week at the New Market with his wonderful sleight of hand entertainment. Since his appearance here several years ago, Zamloch has made a tour of the world, adding largely to his stock of illusions.‚Äù The San Luis Obispo Daily Register offered this colorful analysis in February 1888: ‚ÄúBlaze away, O Zamloch, with your __erried battery of mind-bewildering mystifications. We are converted and convorted. Come up. Imp-of-Darkness, and tie a red-ribbon to our hydrant and bid the ruby wine to flow forth. Then, indeed, poor printers will ever be thy proselytes. Step into our sanctum and coax dazzling editorials from the crown of our last election-won hat . . .‚Äù In 1891, the San Antonio Daily Light noted: ‚ÄúProfessor Zamloch, the Prestidigitateur, drew a large audience at Rische‚Äôs theater last night. Many of his feats of legerdemain are really wonderful and a good entertainment was given. The Professor has a great spiritualistic s√©ance which is very clever and will be seen by the San Antonio public ere the departure of that gentleman.‚Äù When he visited Phoenix, The Arizona Republican said: ‚ÄúProf. Zamloch, the renowned conjuror, gave three exhibitions at Patton opera house during the past week. To say that the professor is the sleekest man in the world on the dark art business is putting it mildly.‚Äù When Zamloch arrived in Hawaii in 1891 as part of a world tour, the Hawaiian Gazette reported: ‚ÄúProfessor Anton Zamloch, magician, arrived in Honolulu on the Australia. He will be favorably remembered by many families and friends as giving his wonderful entertainments here about twelve years ago. He brings with him a vast amount of new and interesting features, and will undoubtedly receive a hearty welcome from our amusement-loving people. Himself and staff, among which is the irrepressible assistant ‚ÄòBilly‚Äô Marx, will remain in Hawaii for about two weeks, and then proceed on their second great tour around the world. The Hawaiian Gazette reported on his performances to large crowds, noting: ‚ÄúWhile admitting that everything he did was mere trickery, it was the object of each person in the hall to learn just how they were done. . . . Another interesting act was one in which flags of all nations, wine, ribbons, cigars and matches were taken out of the same bottle.‚Äù Several nights later, the paper reported: ‚ÄúZamloch reigned at the Opera House last night. The very air seemed to be permeated with mystery, and the spectators were at times almost breathless with expectancy at the wonderful results in magic, or in anticipation that he must surely fail in some great trick. But with Zamloch the word failure is not known, his feats in the mysterious arts are carried out so neatly and seemingly so easily, that the audience is mystified and simply stare in speechless wonder. His basket trick, the changing of the canary birds from a glass case one side of the stage to a cage on the other side, by simply tapping his wand and right in full view of the audience, cannot be explained. His cabinet s√©ance is as much a mystery as the many other things he does, and still he says it is not spiritualism, rheumatism or any other ‚Äòism, but explains to the wondering audiences that it is just the way he does it, and they don‚Äôt ‚Äòcatch on.‚Äô‚Äù On November 12, 1897, the Ventura Democrat reported: ‚ÄúA crowded house greeted Zamloch last evening at Armory Hall, and the entertainment furnished by this greatest of conjurers and his constitutionally tired assistant, ‚ÄòBilly,‚Äô was excellent throughout. Zamloch, in his most marvelous mystifications, is the most successful operator of his class today, barring none ‚Äì being the equal of the famous Herman, who has caused wonder among the people of all countries and kingdoms. Zamloch is easy, graceful, courteous and humorous ‚Äì his every deception practiced with complete success.‚Äù In December 1897, the Fresno Bee reported: ‚ÄúWherever Prof. Zamloch has appeared his performances have been highly praised by the press and public. His show is clean and is first class in every detail. Nothing to shock the most fastidious, at the same time keeping the audience in roars of laughter from rise to fall of the curtain.‚Äù Retirement in Oakland Zamloch retired to his home in Oakland, California, where he took up bee-keeping, keeping 50 hives, as his hobby. He was married for 50 years to his wife, whom he married in approximately 1880. In earlier years, Mrs. Zamloch would tour with her husband, and she was the beautiful woman whom he would float through the air. The Zamlochs had three sons, Claude, Archer and Carl. Carl Zamloch pitched for the Detroit Tigers and played with Ty Cobb.

It stars Hedyeh Tehrani, Taraneh Alidousti, and Hamid Farokhnezhad. Plot The film portrays the life of a turbulent couple, Mozhdeh and Morteza Samiei, as they prepare for a vacation to Dubai the morning after Chaharshanbe Suri, a festival held on the eve of Wednesday before Nowruz. Morteza orders Rouhi, a maid and bride- soon-to-be, to help the couple clean their apartment, though Mozhdeh initially insists that she is not required. While she is doing her work, Rouhi learns piece by piece what is happening between the two: Mozhdeh suspects that Morteza is seeing their divorced neighbor, Simin, behind her back, after discovering Simin's phone number in the logs. Simin, meanwhile, is working as a beautician, which disturbs the neighborhood due to all the noises, eventually leading to a court order imposed against her to either quit or leave. As Morteza says that he would not come home until 5 PM, Mozhdeh sets Rouhi, who wants her eyebrow trimmed, to ask Simin if she is also unavailable until 5 PM; her fears are confirmed. Simin, though, has enough time to trim Rouhi's eyebrows; there, Rouhi overhears that Simin knows when the Samiei are due to depart to Dubai. When she goes back to Samiei, she finds her chador taken by Mozhdeh, who wants to spy on Morteza, leaving her to take the Samiei's son, Amirali, home from school. Morteza is enraged upon learning these and publicly beats Mozhdeh. Fed up, Mozhdeh decides to move to her sister and brother-in-law's residence with Amirali, refusing to hear Morteza's apologies. To calm the situation down, Rouhi lies about the reason why Simin knows their departure time. Morteza offers Rouhi a ride home in exchange for accompanying him and Amirali to see the fireworks. He leaves the two for a while and meets with Simin in private, confirming that the two are indeed having an affair; to his dismay, though, Simin wants them to separate, as she does not want to break up the Samiei. Rouhi later sniffs Simin's perfume scent on the way home (she has previously scented her hand with Simin's perfume) and realizes the truth. However, she ultimately chooses not to tell Mozhdeh.

Deborah Young of Variety wrote in her review: \\"Few Iranian films have tried to realistically depict both the urban middle and lower classes, and fewer still with the complexity of story telling and depth of characterization in Asghar Farhadi's impressive third feature, Fireworks Wednesday... The quality of the production is evident in Hossein Jafarian's fluid cinematography and Hayedeh Safyari's nervous editing. The final scenes are a tour de force in which the bonfire-strewn streets fill with merrymakers and the exploding fireworks look as dangerous as a war, an apt metaphor for the everyday violence in the characters' lives.\\" Sheila O'Malley of Slant Magazine praised the movie as well as Hedyeh Tehrani's performance: \\" Hedyeh Tehrani, a delectable actress, plays Mozhde, the depressed wife. This is a marvelous performance, layered, painful, heartfelt. It's a difficult part... Tehrani has one of those malleable expressive faces so beloved by cameras everywhere. She thinks something, and it shows. She feels something, and we get it. The scenes of the fights with her husband are electric, exhilarating to watch. They feel like real arguments and have a jagged chaos to them that is truly frightening.\\" In another review Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid gave the film 3 & 1/2 Stars (out of 4) and praised originality of Iranian cinema: \\"One of the things I love about Iranian cinema is that it seems to inspire itself. Even a decade after the first Iranian \\"New Wave\\" films began appearing in the United States in 1997, Iranian filmmakers have refused to \\"go Western\\" and use Hollywood methods in their films. Rather, Iranian filmmakers have continued to work with the original ideas and methods that made their cinema exciting in the first place... Director Asghar Farhadi takes his time, allowing information to creep in at its own pace rather than trying to force it all upon us in the first ten minutes. But the most vivid element is his well-rounded characters: men and women truly relating to one another in both positive and negative lights.\\" Geoff Andrew of Time Out wrote: \\"What distinguishes the film is the way Farhadi keeps us guessing from as to what exactly is happening and why; repeatedly shifting our point of view, he forces us to question our assumptions about characters and their reliability. This compelling, corrosive account of male-female relationships in today‚Äôs Tehran is tempered by genuine compassion for the individuals concerned; wisely, Farhadi never serves judgement on them in their troubled pursuit of truth, love and happiness. Intelligent, illuminating and directed with unflashy expertise.\\" Accolades *Gold Hugo at Chicago International Film Festival (2006) *Golden Lady Harimaguada at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria International Film Festival (2007) *Crystal Simorgh for Best actress (Hedieh Tehrani), Best Director (Asghar Farhadi) and Best Editing (Hayedeh Safiyari) in 2006 Fajr International Film Festivalhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0845439/awards ReferencesExternal links * Category:2006 drama films Category:2006 films Category:Films directed by Asghar Farhadi Category:Iranian films Category:Iranian drama films Category:Films whose director won the Best Directing Crystal Simorgh Category:Crystal Simorgh for Audience Choice of Best Film winners ","title":"Fireworks Wednesday"},{"id":"15055898","text":"Sun's seasonal declination differences, viewed from some northern mid-latitude Sun path polar chart for any location at the latitude of Rotterdam solargraph exposed over the course of a year shows the Sun's paths of diurnal motion, as viewed from Budapest in 2014. (Credit: Elekes Andor) Sun path, sometimes also called day arc, refers to the daily and seasonal arc-like path that the Sun appears to follow across the sky as the Earth rotates and orbits the Sun. The Sun's path affects the length of daytime experienced and amount of daylight received along a certain latitude during a given season. The relative position of the Sun is a major factor in the heat gain of buildings and in the performance of solar energy systems. Accurate location-specific knowledge of sun path and climatic conditions is essential for economic decisions about solar collector area, orientation, landscaping, summer shading, and the cost-effective use of solar trackers.  Effect of the Earth's axial tilt  Sun paths at any latitude and any time of the year can be determined from basic geometry. The Earth's axis of rotation tilts about 23.5 degrees, relative to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. As the Earth orbits the Sun, this creates the 47¬∞ declination difference between the solstice sun paths, as well as the hemisphere-specific difference between summer and winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, the winter sun (November, December, January) rises in the southeast, transits the celestial meridian at a low angle in the south (more than 43¬∞ above the southern horizon in the tropics), and then sets in the southwest. It is on the south (equator) side of the house all day long. A vertical window facing south (equator side) is effective for capturing solar thermal energy. For comparison, the winter sun in the Southern Hemisphere (May, June, July) rises in the northeast, peaks out at a low angle in the north (more than halfway up from the horizon in the tropics), and then sets in the northwest. There, the north-facing window would let in plenty of solar thermal energy to the house. In the Northern Hemisphere in summer (May, June, July), the Sun rises in the northeast, peaks out slightly south of overhead point (lower in the south at higher latitude), and then sets in the northwest, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere in summer (November, December, January), the Sun rises in the southeast, peaks out slightly north of overhead point (lower in the north at higher latitude), and then sets in the southwest. A simple latitude-dependent equator-side overhang can easily be designed to block 100% of the direct solar gain from entering vertical equator-facing windows on the hottest days of the year. Roll-down exterior shade screens, interior translucent-or-opaque window quilts, drapes, shutters, movable trellises, etc. can be used for hourly, daily or seasonal sun and heat transfer control (without any active electrical air conditioning). Everywhere around the world during the equinoxes (March 20/21 and September 22/23) except for the poles, the sun rises due east and sets due west. In the Northern Hemisphere, the equinox sun peaks in the southern half (about halfway up from the horizon at mid latitude) of the sky, while in the Southern Hemisphere, that sun peaks in the northern half of the sky. When facing the equator, the sun appears to move from left to right in the Northern Hemisphere and from right to left in the Southern Hemisphere. The latitude (and hemisphere)-specific solar path differences are critical to effective passive solar building design. They are essential data for optimal window and overhang seasonal design. Solar designers must know the precise solar path angles for each location they design for, and how they compare to place-based seasonal heating and cooling requirements. In the U.S., the precise location-specific altitude-and-azimuth seasonal solar path numbers are available from NOAA ‚Äì the \\"equator side\\" of a building is south in the Northern Hemisphere, and north in the Southern Hemisphere, where the peak summer solstice solar altitude occurs on December 21. = Shadow of a vertical stick at solar noon = On the equator, the sun will be straight overhead and a vertical stick will cast no shadow at solar noon on the equinoxes. Roughly 23.5 degrees north of the equator on the Tropic of Cancer, a vertical stick will cast no shadow on June 21, the summer solstice for the northern hemisphere. The rest of the year, the noon shadow will point to the North pole. Roughly 23.5 degrees south of the equator on the Tropic of Capricorn, a vertical stick will cast no shadow on December 21, the summer solstice for the southern hemisphere, and the rest of the year its noon shadow will point to the South pole. North of the Tropic of Cancer, the noon shadow will always point north, and conversely, south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the noon shadow will always point south. The solar noon shadows of objects on points beyond and below subsolar points will point towards true north and true south respectively only when the solar declination has its maximum positive (Œ¥‚òâ = +23.44¬∞) or maximum negative (Œ¥‚òâ = ‚àí23.44¬∞) value. On the other hand, on the equinoxes when the sun is neither declined north nor south (Œ¥‚òâ = 0¬∞) and solar time noon shadows point NNW north of the equator and SSE south of the equator on the vernal equinox (and point NNE north of the equator and SSW south of the equator on the autumnal equinox). =Duration of daylight= Within the polar circles (north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle), each year will experience at least one day when the Sun remains below the horizon for 24 hours (on the winter solstice), and at least one day when the Sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours (on the summer solstice). In the middle latitudes (between the tropics and the polar circles, where most humans live), the length of daytime, as well as solar altitude and azimuth, vary from one day to the next, and from season to season. The difference between the lengths of a long summer day and of a short winter day increases as one moves farther away from the Equator.  Building design simulation  Before the days of modern, inexpensive, 3D computer graphics, a heliodon (precisely-movable light source) was used to show the angle of the sun on a physical model of a proposed building. Today, mathematical computer models calculate location- specific solar gain (shading) and seasonal thermal performance, with the ability to rotate and animate a 3D color graphic model of a proposed building design. Heating and cooling issues in passive solar building design can be counterintuitive. Precise performance calculations and simulations are essential to avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating expensive experimental design errors, such as skylights that turn a building into a solar furnace in summer (see Daylighting#Sawtooth roof). Visualization The pictures below show the following perspectives from Earth, marking the hourly positions of the Sun on both solstice days. When connected, the suns form two day arcs, the paths along which the Sun appears to follow on the celestial sphere in its diurnal motion. The longer arc is always the midsummer path while the shorter arc the midwinter path. The two arcs are 46.88¬∞ (2 √ó 23.44¬∞) apart, indicating the declination difference between the solstice suns. In addition, some \\"ghost\\" suns are visible below the horizon, as much as 18¬∞ down, during which twilight occurs. The pictures can be used for both the northern and the southern hemispheres of Earth. A theoretical observer is supposed to stand near the tree on a small island in the middle of the sea. The green arrows represent the cardinal directions. * In the Northern Hemisphere, north is to the left. The Sun rises in the east (far arrow), culminates in the south (to the right) while moving to the right, and sets in the west (near arrow). Both rise and set positions are displaced towards the north in midsummer and the south in midwinter. * In the Southern Hemisphere, south is to the left. The Sun rises in the east (near arrow), culminates in the north (to the right) while moving to the left, and sets in the west (far arrow). Both rise and set positions are displaced towards the south in midsummer and the north in midwinter. The following cases are depicted: * On the abstract line of the Equator (0¬∞ latitude), the Sun's maximum altitude is great during the entire year, but it does not form a perfect right angle with the ground at noon everyday. In fact it happens two days of the year, during the equinoxes. The solstices are the dates that the Sun stays farthest away from the zenith but anyway also in those cases it's high in the sky, reaching an altitude of 66.56¬∞ either to the north or the south. All days of the year, solstices included, have the same length of 12 hours. * Solstice day arcs as viewed from 20¬∞ latitude. The Sun culminates at 46.56¬∞ altitude in winter and 93.44¬∞ altitude in summer. In this case an angle larger than 90¬∞ means that the culmination takes place at an altitude of 86.56¬∞ in the opposite cardinal direction. For example, in the southern hemisphere, the Sun remains in the north during winter, but can reach over the zenith to the south in midsummer. Summer days are longer than winter days, but the difference is no more than approximately two and a half hours. The daily path of the Sun is steep at the horizon the whole year round, resulting in a twilight of only about one hour and 20 minutes in the morning and in the evening. * Solstice day arcs as viewed from 50¬∞ latitude. During the winter solstice, Sun does not rise more than 16.56¬∞ above the horizon at midday, but 63.44¬∞ in summer solstice above the same horizon direction. The difference in the length of the day between summer and winter, from here to the north, begin to be striking ‚Äì slightly more than 8 hours at winter solstice, to more than 16 hours during the summer solstice. Likewise is the difference in direction of sunrise and sunset. At this latitude at midnight (around 1 a.m. with summer legal hour) the summer sun is 16.56¬∞ below the horizon, which means that astronomical twilight continues the whole night. This phenomenon is known as the grey nights, nights when it does not get dark enough for astronomers to do their observations of the deep sky. Above 60¬∞ latitude, the Sun would be even closer to the horizon, only 6.56¬∞ away from it. Then civil twilight continues almost all night, only a little bit of nautical twilight around the local midnight. Above 66.56¬∞ latitude, there is no sunset at all, a phenomenon referred to as the midnight sun. * Solstice day arcs as viewed from 70¬∞ latitude. At local noon the winter Sun culminates at ‚àí3.44¬∞, and the summer Sun at 43.44¬∞. Said another way, during the winter the Sun does not rise above the horizon, it is the polar night. There will be still a strong twilight though. At local midnight the summer Sun culminates at 3.44¬∞. Said another way, it does not set; it is the polar day. * Solstice day arcs as viewed from either pole (90¬∞ latitude). At the time of the summer or winter solstices, the Sun is 23.44¬∞ degrees above or below the horizon, respectively, irrespective of time of day. Whilst the Sun is up (during summer months) it will circle around the whole sky (clockwise from the North Pole and counter-clockwise from the South Pole), appearing to stay at the same angle from the horizon, therefore the concept of day or night is meaningless. The angle of elevation will gradually change on an annual cycle, with the Sun reaching its highest point at the summer solstice, and rising or setting at the equinox, with extended periods of twilight lasting several days after the autumn equinox and before the spring equinox. ;Solstice day arcs as viewed from selected latitudes File:solstice-0.jpg0¬∞ latitude (the Equator) File:solstice-20.jpg20¬∞ latitude File:solstice-50.jpg50¬∞ latitude File:solstice-70.jpg70¬∞ latitude File:solstice-90.jpg90¬∞ latitude (either pole)  See also  * Ecliptic * Passive solar design * Solar access * Pyranometer * Pyrheliometer * Heliostat * Daylighting * Analemma * Effect of sun angle on climate * Position of the Sun * Equinox * Solstice  References  External links  * U.S. Naval Observatory Sun or Moon Altitude/Azimuth Table * The simple geometry of sun, moon, and star paths * Sun path calculation and visualization on Android * Sun path in augmented reality * Sun path by location and date * Sun positions, diagram and paths around the world by location and date * Seasonal and Hourly Sun Path Design Issue Tutorial * Sun path on map, charts and table, sun position for every location and date * Sun position by location and date Category:Observational astronomy Category:Solar design ","title":"Sun path"},{"id":"15055912","text":"Jos√© Manuel Salda√±a is a Puerto Rican academic who served as president of the University of Puerto Rico during the 1980s.

It eventually ended with a return to the previous status quo ante bellum following the Treaty of Seville. Background During the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain lost Gibraltar to an Anglo-Dutch fleet and when the war finished in 1714, Spain was forced to accept the loss of Gibraltar in the Treaty of Utrecht, but it was a long-term goal of Spain to recover both Gibraltar and the island of Menorca from the British. After the Treaty of Vienna in 1725, Spain had the support of Austria and thought the time to be right to try to recapture Gibraltar. In reaction, Britain signed the Treaty of Hanover with France and Prussia. Some historians put the beginning of the war in 1726, the year in which the Anglo-Spanish relation was already very tense. A British fleet was sent to the Spanish West Indies to disturb Spanish shipping without actually starting a war. Action=Porto Bello= Britain had tried to use its naval power early in the dispute, by blockading Porto Bello in Panama but the attempt proved a disaster, in which 4,000 men were lost to disease. The main objective of the blockade had been to prevent Spanish galleons leaving and sailing for Spain, but the blockaders failed to do this - and eventually withdrew. =Siege of Gibraltar= On 11 February 1727 Spain, under command of the Marquis de las Torres and supervision of Chief Engineer of the Spanish Royal Engineer Corps Marquis of Verboom, laid siege to the city (Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar). Depending on the sources, Spanish troops were between 12,000 and 25,000. British defenders were 1,500 at the beginning of the siege, increasing up to about 5,000 by troops brought from overseas by a fleet commanded by Charles Wager. After a four-month siege, with several unsuccessful and costly attempts, Spanish troops gave up and retired on 12 June. Spain had lost over 1,400 men while the British had suffered around 300 casualties. The Spanish had expected material help from the Austrians promised under the Treaty of Vienna, but they received little. They had been outmanoeuvred by British diplomats, who had concluded a secret deal with the Austrians to prevent them intervening. Peace No more hostilities took place and a truce was declared in February 1728, with a preliminary agreement of issues at the March Convention of El Pardo and the Congress of Soissons. The final peace, that confirmed the status-quo, was concluded in the 1729 Treaty of Seville. Many of the outstanding issues between the two states had not been resolved, and a decade later the War of Jenkins' Ear broke out between them. Britain emerged from the conflict by forming a very strong alliance with Austria, that lasted until 1756.

However, during a visit to Belfast, he witnesses his elderly uncle, a Catholic priest, being assaulted by a Protestant mob. When the members of the Irish Republican Army attempt to defend the church building, Devlin picks up a gun and joins them.

He is parachuted near the Northern Ireland border and makes his way into England, posing as an Irish veteran of the British Army. While scouting for the arrival of German paratroopers in Norfolk, Devlin poses as a stereotypical \\"bog Irishman.\\" He also meets and falls in love with Molly Prior, a young girl from the village of Studley Constable. He subsequently saves her from a would-be rapist and introduces her to the poetry of Antoine √ì Raifteiri. Soon after, they make love. When the German soldiers commanded by Col. Kurt Steiner arrive, they pose as Free Polish troops. Molly is overjoyed, believing that Devlin is still in the British Army and not a black marketeer like she had previously thought. However, one of the paratroopers is killed while trying to rescue a child of the village in an accident and his German uniform is seen by the villagers. As a result, the villagers and their priest are taken hostage and hidden in the village's Roman Catholic church. The priest's sister is able to escape and inform a nearby unit of the United States Army. Although enraged and betrayed when she learns of Devlin's true loyalties, Molly has no desire to see him killed by the Americans. When she warns him, however, he refuses to flee and says that he is going to the church to die alongside the Germans. Before he leaves, he insists that he is not a traitor, but a man serving his country. He has also left a letter on the mantle expressing his love for her and saying goodbye. When the Americans arrive, Col. Steiner releases the hostages so that they will not be caught in the crossfire. After a violent gunfight, Molly arrives and reveals a secret tunnel out of the church. Col. Steiner, however, slips back into the village and is officially killed while trying to gun down Churchill, who is later revealed to have been a decoy. Devlin and the last surviving member of Steiner's unit are rescued at the seaside by a German E-boat. =Rescuing Steiner= In the later novel The Eagle Has Flown, Steiner is revealed to have survived. Devlin, who is hiding in Lisbon and planning to escape to America, is persuaded by SS Gen. Walter Schellenberg, then chief of the Ausland-SD, to rescue Steiner from the Tower of London. After they return to Germany, Devlin and Steiner prevent Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler from seizing control of the Reich. In the aftermath, Himmler orders Schellenberg to murder them. Instead, Schellenberg arranges their escape to the neutral Irish Free State. The novel ending states that Devlin now lives in a cottage in County Mayo and that he and Steiner remain friends. Other appearances As well as appearing in The Eagle Has Landed and The Eagle Has Flown, Devlin also appears as a major character in the Higgins novels Touch the Devil and Confessional. In other novels, Devlin has made cameo appearances as a mentor to Sean Dillon (in Drink with the Devil, The President's Daughter and Day of Reckoning) and Martin Brosnan (in Eye of the Storm).

He was the father of Aoyama Tadatoshi, and the Aoyama region of Shibuya is named after him. History The Aoyama clan were provincial lords of D≈çdo village, Nukata District in Mikawa Province (present Okazaki, Aichi). Aoyama Tadakado, Tadanari's father, served both Matsudaira Hirotada and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and thus Tadanari served near Ieyasu since he was young. In 1572, his father died in battle with Takeda Shingen and Tadanari inherited the estate. Tadanari was highly trusted by Ieyasu, and in 1585 he commanded him to guard his son Hidetada. In 1588, Tadanari accompanied Hidetada to the capital where he was granted Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade of Hitachi Province by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1590 Ieyasu relocates to Kant≈ç and promotes Tadanari to magistrate of Edo with lands worth 5,000 koku (increased by 2,000 koku in 1593). His estates centered on Harajuku village and extended from part of Akasaka to Shibuya. Present day Aoyama is so named because one of Tadanari's mansions was located there. In 1600, Tadanari joined Hidetada's army at the Battle of Sekigahara and obtained 15,000 koku of lands between Kazusa Province and Shim≈çsa Province. In addition to being the Edo magistrate, he also served as the general magistrate for the entire Kant≈ç region. After the start of the Edo shogunate, he was heavily involved in shogunate policy along with Honda Masanobu and Nait≈ç Kiyonari. Along with Nait≈ç in 1606, he is temporarily sentenced to house arrest but is soon pardoned.

She was ousted from her position as mayor due to \\"unbecoming\\" conduct and subsequently posed for Playboy, cashing in on her notoriety.  Biography =Background= Brooks grew up in Georgetown, Colorado and gave birth to her son Dustin at the age of 17. She did not pursue education after high school, turning to topless dancing. By 2001, Brooks owned Dare 2 Be Different Tanning and Hair Salon. =Run for mayor= Brooks' entry into politics created much heat from the preservationist faction of the town. Her platform included the construction of a video arcade, a bowling alley and a skateboard park, introducing a concert venue, snowmobiles and barbecues all meant to update the town to the 21st century. These went against the preservationist view of saving the town's pastel Victorian style. Brooks' supporters experienced pressure and social displacement for their support. Sign maker Wendell Pugh was fired for drawing a pro-Brooks cartoon. Tasso Maras' restaurant was boycotted by a group of citizens. In 2001, she won the election for the position of mayor with a 31-point margin. In her brief tenure, Brooks was accused of flashing her breasts in a bar, putting out a hit on a policeman who didn't support her and marijuana use. =Accusations= In February 2002, Brooks reported an attack on her life by a knife-wielding middle-aged man. After conflict erupted between her and the police force, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation stepped in and charged her with evidence-tampering and false reporting. Brooks' trial date was initially set on April 19 and then moved to May 24 with a change of venue. This allegation resulted in a recall vote and on April 2, she was forced to leave her position as mayor. Promotional career Following her chaotic tenure, Brooks made appearances on talk shows and made a website that recalled her topless dancing days. She also posed for Playboy in an office inspired setting. An Emmy-winning writer of The Sopranos bought the rights to Brooks' story.

PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Smartphones ports were announced in May 2016. The Windows version was released in Taiwan in June 2006. A Japanese version of the game was released in December 2006. The PlayStation 3 version was released, on the Japanese PlayStation Store, on September 25, 2008. It's free to download and uses the same pay-per-item model as its PC counterparts. Gameplay Every player starts in the Angel Lyceum, a college to train Little Angels (the players) to become Angel Protectors to guard Eden against Lucifer (requirement). Once the player finishes the tutorial, they are teleported to the campus of the Lyceum where they can accumulate student credits on campus by doing lessons (composed of either defeating a certain number of a monster or collecting/manufacturing a certain amount of an item). The student credit's primary purpose is to determine whether a student can now graduate or attend the Top Student Training. When a player graduates they become an Angel Protector and choose a faction and city. =Job System= There are 14 classes available in Angels Online. Each has six different skills with skills maxing out at level 380. All the classes are divided into one of the following systems - Fighting, Magic or Production. Players can also change their skills by talking to the Skill Angel (there are certain exceptions). Due to this, everyone's character can be truly unique. The only thing to take into account before changing a skill is how the two skills match. The game has a unique double class and skill system. Players are able to change or match skills after having chosen a class, which helps make characters distinctive. Different classes are able to have the same skills. For example, a character from the fighting class is able to have the magic skill. However, some special skills cannot be matched with each other, such as the chaos and the earth skills. A skill may be leveled up by using it, but can never be higher than the character's level, which maxes out at level 380. Players can change skills after reaching level 20, but need a special item called a skill crystal to do so.Angels Online Skills Page Story Long, long ago, the archangel Lucifer fell in love with a girl. Unfortunately, she was already in love with another angel. Lucifer lost his mind and in order to separate the two lovers forever, transmuted her into dew and him into starlight. Knowing he would be punished sooner or later, he gathered a rebellious army and attempted to overthrow the reign of Jupiter. However, he and his followers failed, and were expelled to Hell. Ever since then, he has been planning his revenge. He is now expanding his evil forces, and has founded a demon training camp with the sole purpose of destroying the Garden of Eden. So, all of the Little Angels there have undertaken special training, and have descended to Earth so that the battle can commence in Eden. The land of Eden includes four realms that are home to the Aurora, Steel, Shadow and Beast factions. Each has its own seat of power. Aurora City stands between the seacoast and a fertile plain. Due to its location, it's plagued by pirates, so the king has decided to engage valiant chevaliers to drive them out. Iron Castle rises above a barren desert. Resources extracted from mines in the nearby mountains fuel its economy and its centuries-long war against a hated rival. The inhabitants of Dark City are highly proficient excavators, their expertise honed over generations of digging out large caverns. Right now, they're concerned about a mysterious hole. Its origin is unknown, as is the depth to which it extends. The residents of Breeze Jungle love their home and wish to protect it from being ravaged by powerful giants.Angels Online Story  References  External links  * Category:2006 video games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Persistent worlds Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games about angels Category:Video games developed in China Category:Video games developed in Taiwan Category:Windows games ","title":"Angels Online"},{"id":"15056081","text":"IAGS may refer to: * International Association of Genocide Scholars - an association against genocides. * Institute for the Analysis of Global Security - an American organization analysing energy security issues.

In 1991‚Äì92, he became an instrumental figure in transitioning Georgia into the free-market economic system by founding the country's first ever commodity exchanges ‚Äì Tbilisi Universal Exchange and Georgian Tea and Wine Exchange. Following the Georgian Civil War and the consequent overthrow of the country's first democratically elected government by the forces of Eduard Shevardnadze in 1992, Maisashvili was forced to flee the country and seek refuge abroad. He was granted political asylum by the United States. While living in the US, he earned an MPA from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1997 and that same year, became married to an American lawyer, Robin Lightner. Soon after, he joined the Houston, Texas-based energy company Enron and served as the head of a risk analysis division until resigning from the company in 2001, shortly before the scandal. He returned to Georgia on the eve of the 2003 Rose Revolution and became a political mentor and an economic adviser to then opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili. Shortly after Saakashvili's ascend to power, Maisashvili became publicly critical of Saakashvili and distanced himself from the new president. In July 2007, he established his own political party ‚Äì the Party of Future (momavlis partia). He ran as a Presidential candidate for the early elections called on January 5, 2008. He made a major focus on economy and social solidarity, and supported Georgia's bid to join NATO. On November 30, 2007, in what is now considered the critical blunder of his campaign, he stated that he would rather support Mikheil Saakashvili in the case of a second-round run-off against the oligarch Badri Patarkatsishvili.Candidates: Giorgi Maisashvili.

Such a statement was immediately exploited by his opponents and sensationalized by the media, resulting in significant drop in his poll numbers from which he never recovered.

Human Rights Georgia. September 9, 2009. He eventually made a full recovery from his injuries. Following the incident, he shifted away from direct involvement in Georgian politics and instead focused on bringing about an ambitious bottom-up educational reform in Georgia through the expansion of his Leadership School, a venture he originally started in 2006 with his American friend and mentor Bob Spears. The declared aim was to rear \\"a new generation of skilled, wise and courageous leaders of Georgia.\\" In March 2015, Maisashvili was diagnosed with Glioblastoma - an aggressive form of brain cancer. After undergoing a successful surgery and a chemotherapy treatment, he seemed to have made a recovery - but it was ultimately short lived. The cancer came back and Gia Maisashvili died on 26 February 2018. His body was flown from California to Georgia and his funeral held at the Sioni Cathedral in Tbilisi. Thousands of Georgians attended and paid their respects to the \\"Leader\\". He leaves behind his three children - Sophia, William and Anna.

It was one of the first established in a Jewish community in the Catskill region, and is still in use today. Sam Meyerson, the region's first Jewish resident, bought land in the area shortly after 1900. His neighbors, all Christians of various Protestant denominations, decided to accept and befriend him after conferring about the matter among themselves. Other Jewish families followed, and a congregation was formally established in 1908. The congregation had been meeting at Spring Glen's Episcopal church. By the early 1910s, with more Jewish families buying summer homes in or near Spring Glen, members realized they needed a place of worship of their own. In July 1916, the Torah scrolls were dedicated. Two local Gentiles, stationmaster Wells C. Smith and postmaster John Thornton, presented the congregation with a Bible they had purchased. Throughout most of 1917, a small white clapboard bungalow with blue trim house in the middle of the hamlet, festooned with wooden Stars of David, in the center of the hamlet, was under construction, finished in 1918. In 1920 the congregation formally incorporated. The synagogue was open every morning and afternoon for prayers, and congregants helped sustain it through the off- season by holding their weddings, bar mitzvahs, Yom Tovs and other ceremonies there. No significant changes have been made to the building since its construction other than the addition of discreet aluminum siding and bathrooms, during the 1960s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

Two- hundred and thirty-seven feet in overall length, with a 42-foot beam, she was rated at 1,000 gross tons register. Nenana was built at Nenana, Alaska, and launched in May 1933. Marine architect W.C. Nickum of Seattle designed the sternwheeler, which was prefabricated in Seattle and put together at Nenana, Alaska, by Berg Shipbuilding Company. Nenana was built to serve as a packet. She could carry both passengers and freight. Nenana had accommodations for 48 passengers on her saloon deck. Up to 300 tons of freight, including two tons in cold storage, could be carried on her main deck. A Texas, topped by a pilothouse mounted forward in poolboat style, provided staterooms for a portion of the crew of 32. Nenana could push five or six barges on the Yukon River; but, because of sharp bends, only one on the Tanana River. Fully laden, she drew three feet, six inches of water. World War II brought a military buildup in Alaska and kept Nenana busy. She supplied Galena Air Base from which fighter aircraft were supplied to the Soviet Union as well as transporting supplies to a number of military establishments in the advance defense system in Alaska. After the war ended, the decline in passenger revenues that had been arrested by the war continued. Alaska Railroad suspended all river passenger services after the 1949 season. At the close of the 1952 navigation season, Nenana was reconditioned at Whitehorse at a cost of $164,409.20. She only made one more trip north for the Alaska Railroad before being laid up until a newly formed company, Yutana Barge Lines, leased the entire Alaska Railroad fleet in 1954. Yutana Barge Lines operated Nenana to haul freight on rivers for one season but discontinued her lease at that time as unprofitable. The General Services Administration called for bids on Nenana on December 10, 1955. All bids were rejected as too low until a group with associations to the Chamber of Commerce formed to bring Nenana to Fairbanks. This group, Greater Fairbanks Opportunities, Inc., purchased the steamboat, steamed her up the Tanana and Chena rivers to Fairbanks and opened her as a museum ship in 1957. For a time during a severe shortage of rooms, Nenana also operated as a hotel. Weather, neglect, and souvenir hunters damaged Nenana at her berth on the river, and to protect, preserve, and interpret her the vessel was moved to a permanent protected dry berth in 1965. Nenana became the centerpiece of \\"Alaskaland\\", a historical park in Fairbanks. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. An extensive restoration program was begun to return her to her former glory. The latest phase of this work has rebuilt the bow and renewed her decks. She is the only surviving wooden ship of this type, and was for this reason declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Approximately 70 to 90 percent of her original materials remained at that time. From the exterior, the boat appears much as she did during her operating life. Although the interior, particularly the forward main deckhouse, saloon deckhouse, and Texas deckhouse, has been substantially altered, important features such as the engineroom remain intact. and The ship was originally commissioned by the Alaska Railroad and provided freight transfer from the railroad yards at Nenana to villages along the Yukon and Tanana Rivers. This history is reflected within the park's current interpretative programs. She is currently preserved and displayed at Pioneer Park in Fairbanks, Alaska.

But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the imposition of hands, which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. Anointing with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition.\\" Background There are numerous references in the Hebrew Bible to the obligation for circumcision says: on the eighth day a boy is to be circumcised. and the uncircumcised are to be cut off from the covenant in Genesis 17:14. :Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant. During the 1st century BC there was a controversy in Judaism relating to whether or not a proselyte who was already circumcised needed to be ritually re-circumcised. This is done via a pinprick creating a drop of blood and is still practiced to this day. 1st and 2nd century AD Judaism Jewish sources vary on whether or not circumcision of proselytes was a universal practice in tannaitic times. The disagreement centers on the correctness of contradictory passages in the Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud and which passage is older. B. Yevamot 46a is summarized as follows: :Rabbi Joshua says that if a proselyte is immersed but not circumcised this is valid. Because our mothers where immersed but not circumcised. Rabbi Eliezer says the opposite. Because such was found regarding our fathers. However the sages say both are required. P. Kiddushin 3:12 (3:14, 64d) is summarized as follows: :Rabbi Eliezer says only circumcision is required the same as in B. Yevamot 46a. Rabbi Joshua says both are required. During tannaitic times uncircumcised semi-converts also existed, see God-fearer and Ger toshav. Circumcision of Jesus Circumcision of Jesus, sculpture in the Cathedral of Chartres. According to the Gospel of Luke, Jesus was circumcised eight days after his birth, in accordance with Mosaic Law. Mosaic Law in Early Christianity  James the Just, who issued the Apostolic Decree () at the Council of Jerusalem, c. 50 AD. Similar differences and disputes existed within Early Christianity, but disputes within Christianity extended also to the place of Mosaic Law or Old Covenant in general in Christianity. This is particularly notable in the mid-1st century, when the circumcision controversy came to the fore. Alister McGrath, a proponent of Paleo-orthodoxy, claimed that many of the Jewish Christians were fully faithful religious Jews, only differing in their acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah.McGrath, Alister E., Christianity: An Introduction. Blackwell Publishing (2006). . Page 174: \\"In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief ‚Äî that Jesus was the Messiah. Unless males were circumcised, they could not be saved (Acts 15:1).\\" As such, they tended to be of the view that circumcision and other requirements of the Mosaic Law were required for salvation. Those in the Christian community who insisted that biblical law, including laws on circumcision, continued to apply to Christians were pejoratively labeled Judaizers by their opponents and criticized as being elitist and legalistic.McGrath, page 174: \\"Paul notes the emergence of a Judaizing party in the region ‚Äî that is, a group within the church which insisted that Gentile believers should obey every aspect of the law of Moses, including the need to be circumcised. According to Paul [reference is made to Galatians, but no specific verse is given], the leading force behind this party was James ... the brother of Jesus ...\\" The Council of Jerusalem of about 50 AD was the first meeting in early Christianity called upon to consider the application of Mosaic Law to the new community. Specifically, it had to consider whether gentile converts to Christianity were obligated to undergo circumcision for full membership in the Christian community, but it was conscious that the issue had wider implications, since circumcision is the \\"everlasting\\" sign of the Abrahamic Covenant. Jewish culture was still trying to find its place in the more dominant Hellenistic culture which found circumcision to be repulsive.Jewish Encyclopedia: Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature: \\"Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved nudity], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by epispasm (\\"making themselves foreskins\\"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, \\"Ant.\\" xii. 5, ¬ß 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18; Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer. Peah i. 16b; Yeb. viii. 9a). All the more did the law- observing Jews defy the edict of Antiochus Epiphanes prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons.\\"; The decision of the Council, called the Apostolic Decree, was that most Mosaic Law, including the requirement for circumcision of males, was not obligatory for gentile converts, in order to maintain the core Christian doctrine of salvation by faith in Christ alone. The Council did retain the prohibitions against eating meat containing blood, or meat of animals not properly slain, and against \\"fornication\\" and \\"idol worship\\".Karl Josef von Hefele's Commentary on canon II of Gangra notes: \\"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. Balsamon also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty- third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by St. Augustine in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third 731 forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed Ecumenical Synods, can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws.\\" There is a view that 'strangled' and 'blood' in the texts refer to foreskin conditions - paraphimosis and ruptured frenulum, respectively. Beginning with Augustine of Hippo,Contra Faust, 32.13 many have seen a connection to Noahide Law, while some modern scholarsFor example: Joseph Fitzmyer, The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries), Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), , chapter V reject the connection to Noahide Law and instead see Leviticus 17-18 as the basis. The Decree is one of the first acts differentiating the Church from its Jewish roots,Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism: \\"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a proselyte to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab.

Teaching of Paul Artist depiction of Saint Paul Writing His Epistles, 16th century (Blaffer Foundation Collection, Houston, Texas). Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 316-320. Harris cites , , , , . Joseph Barber Lightfoot in his Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians writes: \\"At this point [] the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name (; ) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois grammasin), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.\\" While the issue was theoretically resolved, it continued to be a recurring issue among Christians. Four years after the Council of Jerusalem, Paul wrote to the Galatians about the issue, which had become a serious controversy in their region. There was a burgeoning movement of Judaizers in the area that advocated adherence to traditional Mosaic laws, including circumcision. According to McGrath, Paul identified James the Just as the motivating force behind the movement. Paul considered it a great threat to his doctrine of salvation through faith and addressed the issue with great detail in Galatians 3.McGrath (2006). Pp 174-175. Paul, who called himself Apostle to the Gentiles, attacked the practice, though not consistently. In the case of Timothy, whose mother was Jewish Christian but whose father was Greek, he personally circumcised him \\"because of the Jews\\" that were in town.McGarvey on Acts 16: \\"Yet we see him in the case before us, circumcising Timothy with his own hand, and this 'on account of certain Jews who were in those quarters.'\\" He also appeared to praise its value in . Two interpretations exist of Paul's comment on those wanting to force circumcision on Gentile Christians in . The KJV reading \\"I would they were even cut off\\" suggests cut off from the Church, but most modern versions, following scholars such as Lightfoot, R. C. H. Lenski and F. F. Bruce, read as the ESV \\"I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!\\" - due to a reading of the Greek text apokopsontai·ΩÑœÜŒµŒªŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫œåœàŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ Œø·º± ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ±œÑŒø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ ·ΩëŒº \\"be cut off\\" as Paul wishing that the circumcisers would castrate themselves.Thomas Marberry, Robert E.

Eusebius reported that the early Christian Origen did in fact castrate himself, though following . Paul argued that circumcision no longer meant the physical, but a spiritual practice.

Keeping God's commands is what counts\\". () Later Paul more explicitly denounced the practice, rejecting and condemning those who promoted circumcision to Gentile Christians. Paul warned that the advocates of circumcision were \\"false brothers\\".() He accused Galatian Christians who advocated circumcision of turning from the Spirit to the flesh: \\"Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?\\" () He accused advocates of circumcision of wanting to make a good showing in the flesh () and of glorying or boasting of the flesh. () Some believe Paul wrote the entire Epistle to the Galatians attacking circumcision and any requirement for the keeping of Jewish law by Christians, saying in chapter five: \\"Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.\\" () In a late letter he warned Christians to \\"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision,\\" (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÑŒøŒºŒÆ, katatomƒì)Strong's G2699 saying that Christians were the true circumcision because they worshipped in the Spirit of God. () Florentine Bechtel notes in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1910): Judaizers: :Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required (). Thus he shortly after circumcised Timothy (), and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem ().Bechtel, Florentine. Later views St. Peter holding the Keys of Heaven, by Rubens According to Acts, Simon Peter condemned required circumcision of converts. When the various passages from the New Testament regarding circumcision are gathered together, a strongly negative view of circumcision emerges, according to Michael Glass.The New Testament and Circumcision Some Biblical scholars think that the Epistle to Titus, generally attributed to Paul, but see Authorship of the Pauline epistles, may state that circumcision should be discouraged among Christians, though others believe this is merely a reference to Jews. Circumcision was so closely associated with Jewish men that Jewish Christians were referred to as \\"those of the circumcision\\"cultural/glass1 or conversely Christians who were circumcised were referred to as Jewish Christians or Judaizers. These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean Jews and Greeks, who were predominate, however it is an oversimplification as 1st century Iudaea Province also had some Jews who were not circumcised, and some Greeks (called Proselytes or Judaizers) and others such as Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Arabs who were. A common interpretation of the circumcision controversy of the New Testament was, that it was over the issue of whether Gentiles could enter the Church directly or ought to first convert to Judaism. However, the Halakha of Rabbinic Judaism was still under development at this time, as the Jewish Encyclopediaarticle on Jesus Jesus article on Jesus notes: \\"Jesus, however, does not appear to have taken into account the fact that the Halakha was at this period just becoming crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes of the Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai were occurring about the time of his maturity.\\" This controversy was fought largely between opposing groups of Christians who were themselves ethnically Jewish, see section Jewish background above. According to this interpretation, those who felt that conversion to Judaism was a prerequisite for Church membership were eventually condemned by Paul as \\"Judaizing teachers\\". The source of this interpretation is unknown; however, it appears related to Supersessionism or Hyperdispensationalism (see also New Perspective on Paul). In addition, modern Christians, such as Ethiopian Orthodox and Coptic Orthodox still practice circumcision while not considering it a part of conversion to Judaism, nor do they consider themselves to be Jews or Jewish Christians. The Jewish Encyclopedia article on Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the TorahGentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah notes the following reconciliation: Contemporary practices Today, most Christian denominations are neutral about ritual male circumcision, not requiring it for religious observance, but neither forbidding it for cultural or other reasons. The practice is customary among the Coptic, Ethiopian, and Eritrean Orthodox Churches, and also some other African churches.Customary in some Coptic and other churches, indicating that it has been regionally normative since ancient times: *\\"The Coptic Christians in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians‚Äî two of the oldest surviving forms of Christianity‚Äî retain many of the features of early Christianity, including male circumcision. Circumcision is not prescribed in other forms of Christianity...

Chowbent Chapel is an active Unitarian place of worship in Atherton, Greater Manchester, England. It was built in 1721 and is the oldest place of worship in the town. It is a member of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella organisation for British Unitarians. The chapel was granted Grade II* Listed status in 1966. History The origins of Chowbent Chapel are a consequence of events that happened in 1715. The first chapel in Atherton, a chapel of ease to Leigh Parish Church was a \\"small brick edifice\\", dedicated to St. John the Baptist at Chowbent. It was built in 1645 \\"on land owned and loaned by ‚ÄúYe Lord of Atherton\\", John Atherton, a supporter of religious dissent. Sometimes referred to as the Old Bent Chapel, it was not consecrated and used by a Presbyterian congregation. The chapel was also used by the vicar of Leigh who used a Bible and Book of Common Prayer which were kept there for his use. During the 1715 Jacobite rising, its fourth minister, James Wood and members of his congregation were asked to guard the bridge at Walton-le-Dale and the ford at Penwortham near Preston against the supporters of the Old Pretender who were marching on Preston. The Chowbenters were successful but in doing so offended Richard Atherton who would inherit the Atherton manor and on whose land the chapel was built. In 1721 Richard Atherton, a staunch supporter of James II, expelled the congregation on political grounds. Architecture Chowbent Chapel interior, showing pulpit and gallery The chapel dates from 1721 on land donated by Nathan Mort of neighbouring Alder House It is built in rustic brick, in Flemish bond on a rubble sandstone plinth, with stone quoins, an eaves cornice and a slate roof. The side elevations have three bays and the rear four bays, both have round-arched windows. On the roof is a small cupola housing a single bell. A two-storey extension was added on the south side in 1901. Its facade has a gable pediment with an oculus within the tympanum. There is a fanlight above the double doors with a sundial above and a commemorative plaque above that. Nikolaus Pevsner considers the chapel \\"has the best-preserved C18 ecclesiastical interior in South Lancashire\\". The original box pews are in place upstairs and down, there is a three tier pulpit on the north wall. The galleries on the east, south and west sides are accessed by staircases with turned balusters. The galleries are supported by six turned Doric oak columns which continue through the gallery to support the plaster ceiling. A nail studded oak door separating the chapel from the vestry is thought to be from the original 1645 chapel. Other surviving artefacts brought from the 1645 building are the communion table and two Commonwealth silver communion cups gifted by Robert Mort in 1654. The cups are not kept at the chapel and are rarely displayed. Some of the stained glass windows are by Shrigley and Hunt. When newly built, the chapel's oak rafters and trusses were open to view, its walls were whitewashed and the windows contained leaded panes of clear glass set in a lozenge pattern. An organ was installed in 1806 as up to then the only music was the chanting of psalms. An organ by Young of Manchester was installed in 1901 when the chapel was enlarged. Community Wall plaque for the Unitarian Sunday School, 1860 A schoolroom was opened in the minister's house shortly after the chapel opened. It was extended in 1860 and again in 1890. Before 1900 a library provided by the chapel was opened in Chowbent School for the inhabitants of the town. Its collection of 4000 volumes was donated to Atherton's Carnegie library when it opened in 1905. Ministers Apart from Wood, other notable ministers of the chapel included Harry Toulmin (1766 ‚Äì 1823) who moved to America and became Secretary of State of Kentucky and Thomas Walker Horsfield (1792‚Äì1837) a historian and topographer.

It led to Rabin's de facto resignation from the government. Affair In March 1977, while Yitzhak Rabin was meeting US President Jimmy Carter, Leah Rabin was spotted making a withdrawal from a Washington, D.C. bank. She had been withdrawing money from a joint dollar account in the names of Yitzhak and Leah Rabin. At the time, it was illegal for Israeli citizens to hold bank accounts overseas, barring exceptional circumstances; the account in question had been opened while Yitzhak Rabin was the Israeli ambassador to the United States (1968‚Äì73), and according to procedure, should have been closed once he left that post. Dan Margalit, the Washington correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz was tipped off, then rushed to the bank in question, told the teller he owed the Rabins money, and asked to deposit a $50 check into the account. After confirming the existence of the account, the teller wrote down the account number on the back of Margalit's check prior to depositing it. Margalit memorized the digits and wrote them down. Haaretz broke the story on March 15, 1977, the day after Rabin returned to Israel. Such minor offenses were usually resolved by an administrative fine, but Attorney-General Aharon Barak announced his intention to prosecute, coining the phrase \\"Buzaglo test\\", meaning that a leader must be held to the same judicial standards as an ordinary citizen. Although Leah Rabin explained that she alone had operated the account, Rabin publicly accepted joint moral and legal responsibility. He resigned following the revelation by Maariv journalist S. Isaac Mekel that the Rabins held two accounts in Washington, not one, containing $10,000, and that a Finance Ministry administrative penalty committee fined them IL150,000. Rabin thereupon announced (April 8) that he was withdrawing from the first place in the Alignment's Knesset list, and Defense Minister Shimon Peres was unanimously elected to succeed him. Since, according to Israeli law, resignation from a caretaker government was impossible, Rabin took a vacation from his duties as prime minister and Peres took his place. Aftermath The affair followed a series of corruption scandals and is often seen as one of the reasons for the Alignment's loss in the upcoming election. Margalit's source later revealed himself to be the security officer of the Israeli Embassy in Washington. He said his motive for informing was moral rather than political, and that he himself had always been a Labor voter. Criminal charges against Leah Rabin for maintaining an illegal bank account. She plead guilty to the charges in the Tel Aviv District Court and was fined IL 250,000 ($27,000) by judge Dov Levin. The Israeli Treasury imposed an administrative fine of IL 15,000, ruling that his role in the currency violation had been passive.https://www.jta.org/1977/04/18/archive/leah-rabin-fined- il-250000https://www.jta.org/1977/04/12/archive/rabin-fined-il-15000-must- remain-in-office-until-may-17-elections In 2002, Maariv correspondent Ben Caspit reported that Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, Yitzhak and Leah's daughter, said she recently spoke with Professor Yaakov Ne'eman, a lawyer. She said he told her that many years ago he discovered a yellowing, forgotten internal regulation in the Finance Ministry's archives. This regulation stipulated that a member of the Foreign Ministry who completed his term abroad was permitted to hold a dollar account for three more years. Neeman said that following the discovery, he contacted Barak, who denied knowing about it. Formally, the regulation did not apply, as the account was discovered over three years after Rabin completed his term as ambassador in Washington. However, it might have dissuaded Barak from prosecuting, thus perhaps preventing Rabin's resignation. In an interview given to Haaretz in 2009, Barak said that had Yitzhak Rabin not resigned, he would have prosecuted him as well as his wife. Rabin's resignation is sometimes seen as a display of public responsibility unmatched by later politicians.

He has contributed to the general theory of receptor and synaptic mechanisms, and in particular the theory and practice of single ion channel function. He held the A.J. Clark chair of Pharmacology at UCL from 1985 to 2004, and was the Hon. Director of the Wellcome Laboratory for Molecular Pharmacology. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1985 and an honorary fellow of UCL in 2004. Colquhoun runs the website DC's Improbable Science, which is critical of pseudoscience, particularly alternative medicine, and managerialism.  Early life and education  Colquhoun was born on 19 July 1936 in Birkenhead, UK. He was educated at Birkenhead School and Liverpool Technical College. After working unhappily as an apprentice pharmacist, he was motivated to go into research. He obtained a BSc from the University of Leeds with a specialisation in pharmacology, and went on to complete a PhD at the University of Edinburgh where he studied the binding of immunoglobulins to lung tissue. His supervisors were Walter Perry and W.E. Brocklehurst. During his education, Colquhoun developed an interest in statistics and random processes, which would influence his research in years to come. Upon completion of his PhD, Colquhoun conducted further research (largely unsuccessful) on immunological problems at UCL from 1964 to 1969. During this time he published a book on statistics. Following this, he completed stints at Yale University and at the University of Southampton. He returned to the pharmacology department at UCL in 1979, where he has remained since. In 2007, Malcolm Grant brought an end to the department, ending its eminent 102-year history (see Department of Pharmacology at University College London, 1905 ‚Äì 2007).  Scientific career  Colquhoun researched the nature of the molecular interactions that cause single ion channels to open and shut, and what it is that controls the speed of synaptic events. The invention and successful application of the patch clamp technique by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann allowed the individual openings and closings of single ion channels to be observed and recorded. However, experimentally observed recordings are random in nature. With the help of the statistician Alan G. Hawkes, Colquhoun developed a statistical method to interpret the data and test putative quantitative mechanisms for how ion channels function. = Work with single ion channels = Course mug design for the Department of Pharmacology at UCL In 1977 Colquhoun and Hawkes predicted that ion channel openings would be expected to occur in brief bursts rather than as single openings, and this prediction was verified in experiments with Bert Sakmann, in G√∂ttingen and London (1981). This work led to the first solution of the classical pharmacological problem of measuring separately the affinity and efficacy of an agonist. In the context of ion channels, this problem is also known as the binding/gating problem. This problem remains unsolved for G protein-coupled receptors, because it was shown in 1987 that the classical methods for determining affinity and efficacy were based on a misapprehension.Colquhoun D (1987). Affinity, efficacy and receptor classification: is the classical theory still useful? In Perspectives on hormone receptor classification, eds. Black JW, Jenkinson DH, & Gerskowitch VP, pp. 103‚Äì114. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York. The 1985 paper was later nominated as a \\"classic\\"Classical Perspectives, \\"Classical Perspectives are commentaries on 'classic' articles in The Journal that have stimulated new lines of research and continue to be highly cited. The articles are commissioned from acknowledged experts in the area covered by the article and should indicate how the article has contributed to current developments in the field.\\" The Journal of Physiology by The Journal of Physiology. In 1982 Colquhoun & Hawkes published a paper on the theory of bursts (and clusters of bursts) which gave a general expression for the distribution of the burst length (shown here on the design for a mug for those who attend a course designed to teach the mathematics needed for the equation).UCL's workshop Analysis and interpretation of single ion channel records and macroscopic currents using matrix methods. It was clear that the burst length was what controlled the decay rate of synaptic currents, though the formal relationship was not derived until 1998. = Missed short events = Although the general theory of single channel behaviour was completed in 1982, it could not be used in practice for fitting mechanisms to data, because the recording apparatus is incapable of detecting events shorter than, at best, about 20 microseconds. The effect of missing short shuttings is to make openings appear to be longer than they really are (and likewise for shuttings). To use the method of maximum likelihood it was essential to derive the distribution of the length of what is actually seen, apparent open times and apparent shut times. Although the Laplace transform of these distributions was known, it was thought that they were not invertible until Hawkes and Jalali found an exact solution in 1990. The exact solution was a piecewise expression that got progressively more complicated as the length of the opening (or shutting) increased. The solution became usable in practice after Hawkes and Jalali discovered an elegant asymptotic solution in 1992. The application of the exact solution to joint and conditional distributions in 1996 opened the door to maximum likelihood fitting, which was implemented in a computer program, HJCFIT, which has been the basis of subsequent experimental work. The distributions of apparent open and shut times are often referred to as HJC distributions (for Hawkes, Jalali, Colquhoun). = Intermediate shut states = All the early work was based on mechanisms that were essentially generalisations of the simple scheme proposed by del Castillo & Katz in 1957, in which the receptor existed in only two conformations, open and shut. It was only when the glycine receptor was investigated that it was realised that it was possible to detect an intermediate shut state (dubbed the \\"flipped\\" conformation), between the resting conformation and the open state. Subsequently, it was discovered that this extra \\"flipped\\" conformation was detectable too in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Lape et al. (2008) found that partial agonists were partial, not, as had been supposed since 1957, because of a deficiency in the open reaction itself, but because of a deficiency at an earlier stage, a reluctance to move from the resting conformation to the intermediate shut state that precedes opening. The actual shut-open conformation change turned out to be much the same for partial agonists as it was for full agonists. In the original formulation the flipping reaction was supposed to be a concerted transition. The essentials of this new mechanism were confirmed by Mukhtasimova et al. (2009), who generalised it to the case where the subunits can flip independently. = Statistical inference = After retiring from single ion channel work, Colquhoun maintained an interest in statistical inference. His 2014 paper, An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values, contributed to the p-value debate, and to the discussion of reproducibility in science. This paper has been followed by others which have explored the basis of inductive inference, and which have investigated in more depth the alternatives to using p values Also available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04888 . The hazards of reliance on p-values was emphasised in by pointing out that even observation of p = 0.001 was not necessarily strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Despite the fact that the likelihood ratio in favour of the alternative hypothesis over the null is close to 100, if the hypothesis was implausible, with a prior probability of a real effect being 0.1, even the observation of p = 0.001 would have a false positive risk of 8 percent. It would not even reach the 5 percent level. It was recommended that the terms \\"significant\\" and \\"non- significant\\" should not be used. P values and confidence intervals should still be specified, but they should be accompanied by and indication of the false positive risk. It was suggested that the best way to do this is to calculate the prior probability that would it would be necessary to believe in order to achieve a false positive risk of, say, 5%. Or, perhaps more simply, the p value could be supplemented by the minimum false positive risk, FPR50, -that calculated for a prior probability of 0.5. Although this would be safe only for plausible hypotheses, it would be a great improvement on giving on p values and confidence intervals. The calculations can be done with R scripts that are provided, or, more simply, with a web calculator.  Criticism of scientific fraud, alternative medicine and managerialism  Colquhoun has been an outspoken critic of pseudoscience and scientific fraud for many years. He has written extensively on the topic, including articles and letters in Nature and The Guardian. He is particularly critical of alternative medicine, and of the decision of a number of UK universities to offer science degrees incorporating courses in complementary and alternative medicine such as homoeopathy and acupuncture. stating that they are \\"anti-science\\" and that \\"universities that run them should be ashamed of themselves.\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/rise-in-applications- for-soft-subjects-panned-as-traditional-courses-lose-out/209755.article His interest in inference extends to methods that are used to assess and manage science, and critical assessment of research \\"metrics\\". In December 2009, Colquhoun won a Freedom of Information judgement, after a three-year campaign, requiring the University of Central Lancashire to release details of their BSc course in homoeopathy.Information Tribunal appeal judgementColquhoun's response to judgement = DC's Improbable Science website = Colquhoun created his personal website, DC's Improbable Science, devoted to criticism of pseudoscience, in 2001. It has a particular focus on alternative medicine (AM), including such practices as homoeopathy, Traditional Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, and others, calling them \\"pure gobbledygook\\". In addition to his outspoken disapproval of AM in academia, Colquhoun frequently speaks out on his website against misrepresentation of AM as science in the media, and against governmental support of AM. His blog discusses also wider problems in science, medicine and higher education. It was listed among the 100 best blogs in 2009. It was blog of the week in the New Statesman (30 May 2010). And in 2012 it was co-winner of the first UK Science Blog Prize, awarded by the Good Thinking Society.UK Science Blog. Good Thinking Society. The most-read post on his blog is not related to alternative medicine however, instead dealing with the death of Stefan Grimm: \\"Publish and perish at Imperial College London: the death of Stefan Grimm\\", which has been viewed more than 200,000 times. = Controversy over website hosting = In May 2007, Colquhoun announced on his website that recent comments he had made questioning the validity of claims made by Ann Walker, a lecturer in Nutrition at the University of Reading and a herbalist, had resulted in a complaint to Malcolm Grant, provost of UCL. In response to legal threats from Alan Lakin, husband of Walker, Grant required Colquhoun to remove his website from the UCL server. This resulted in an outcry from the scientific community, citing a violation of Colquhoun's academic freedom. Grant ultimately reconsidered his decision and on 13 June 2007, he and Colquhoun released a joint statement that Colquhoun's website would be reinstated with some modifications effected on advice of counsel. By that time, the web pages had been moved to a proper blog and never did return to the UCL server. = Alternative medicine and the government = Colquhoun was a member of the Conduct and Competence Committee of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC), a regulatory body for alternative medicine in the UK. Colquhoun has stated he was surprised at being accepted for the position. However, he was dismissed in August 2010.

Like all caseids, Ennatosaurus had a small head compared to its wide, lizard-like body. Its mouth was lined with blunt, peg-like teeth. It lived alongside other Permian creatures, such as the herbivorous Nyctiphruretus and the carnivorous Biarmosuchus. The adult size for Ennatosaurus is unknown. Fossil remains show an animal about the size of a cat, but these are likely juvenile specimens, the adults growing to sizes that may have rivaled those of -long cousin, Cotylorhynchus.

Likumi ‚Äì Latvijas Republikas Tiesƒ´bu Akti. () was adopted on 4 May 1990, by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR. The Declaration stated that, although Latvia had de facto lost its independence in 1940, when it was annexed by the Soviet Union, the country had de jure remained a sovereign country as the annexation had been unconstitutional and against the will of the Latvian people. Therefore, it resolved that the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 were illegal. It also asserted that the heavily rigged 1940 elections were illegal and unconstitutional, and that all acts of the \\"People's Saeima\\" chosen at that election‚Äìincluding the request to join the Soviet Union on 21 July 1940‚Äìwere ipso facto void. On this basis, the Supreme Soviet‚Äìnow renamed the Supreme Council‚Äìannulled the declaration on the accession of Latvia to the Soviet Union, reinstituted the Constitution of Latvia (Satversme) of 1922, which was thereupon partly suspended, and began a transition to de facto independence, which would end upon the first session of Saeima. It also ruled that during the transitional period the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and other laws would remain applicable as long as they did not contradict articles 1, 2, 3, and 6 of Satverme, which were reinforced by the declaration. It was provided that a committee to elaborate a new edition of Satversme should be created. Social, economic, cultural, and political rights were granted to citizens and residents of Latvia in accordance with international human rights. The declaration also stated that Latvia would form its relationship with the Soviet Union on the basis of the Latvian‚ÄìSoviet Peace Treaty of 1920, in which the Soviet Union had recognized the independence of Latvia as inviolable \\"for all future time\\". The 4th of May is a national holiday in Latvia. Overview=Historical and juridical background= In its beginning the Declaration establishes several historical facts and on the basis of these facts concludes that the Republic of Latvia was still de jure a sovereign country. It observes that the Republic of Latvia proclaimed independence on 18 November 1918 which was internationally recognized in 1920, and that Latvia was admitted to membership in the League of Nations in 1921. The first country to recognize the independence of Latvia de jure was Soviet Russia on 11 August 1920, when the Soviet-Latvian Peace treaty was signed (it is generally considered that the independence of Latvia de jure was internationally recognized on 26 January 1921, when it was recognized by the Allies of World War I). The declaration notes that in April 1920 the Latvian nation followed the principle of self-determination by electing a Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, which adopted the Constitution of Latvia on 15 February 1922, in general, equal and direct elections, based on proportional representation. On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which included a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Latvia was apportioned to the Soviet sphere and on 5 October 1939, signed a mutual assistance pact. On 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Latvia accusing it of not carrying out the treaty, namely of forming a military alliance against the USSR, and requested a new government to be formed and to guarantee Soviet military free entrance in Latvia. The Latvian government decided to give in to the ultimatum and on 17 June 1940, Soviet forces entered Latvia. The Declaration states that the Soviet ultimatum and ensuing invasion amounted to an \\"international crime,\\" and contended that the government formed in accordance with Soviet demands should not be recognized as a representative of Latvian state power, since it represented Soviet, not Latvian, interests. On 14‚Äì15 July 1940 a parliament called the \\"People's Saeima of Latvia\\" was elected, which on 21 July 1940, declared accession to the Soviet Union. The declaration states that the election of the People's Saeima took place on the basis of unconstitutional and illegally adopted election law in a state of political terror. It noted that the Communist \\"Labor People's Bloc\\" was the only party allowed to contest the election out of 17 which submitted lists. According to the declaration, the Labor People's Bloc gave no indication prior to the election that it intended to make Latvia part of the Soviet Union, and the election results were heavily falsified. The declaration observes that the People's Saeima was formed by misleading the people and therefore did not express the sovereign will of the Latvian people. It also notes that the People's Saeima had no right to change the political system in Latvia and liquidate its sovereignty, since the Constitution stipulates such matters must be submitted to a national referendum. Therefore, the Declaration ruled that, in accordance with international law, the annexation of Latvia to the Soviet Union was not valid. It therefore reasserted the status of the Republic of Latvia as a de jure subject of international law, and noted that more than 50 countries still recognized Latvia as an independent state. =Basis= After concluding that the Republic of Latvia de jure is a sovereign country the Declaration makes note of previously adopted documents and explains that the Supreme Soviet is acting according to the will of inhabitants of Latvia. First it notes two previous declarations of the Supreme Soviet ‚Äî \\"On sovereignty of state of Latvia\\" of 28 July 1989, which declared that the Latvian SSR will act as a sovereign state and that laws adopted by the Soviet Union will come in force in the territory of Latvian SSR only if the Supreme Soviet has ratified them and \\"In question of independence of Latvia\\" of 15 February 1990, in which the Supreme Soviet condemns declaration \\"On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union\\" of 21 July 1940, however none of these explicitly called for secession from the Soviet Union. Secondly it notes Appeal of All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, which called for restoration of independence. Then it is stated that the Supreme Soviet is acting in accordance with the will of inhabitants of Latvia, which had been clearly expressed by electing as a majority those deputies, who had stated that they will restore independence of the Republic of Latvia in their reelection programme. = Act = After establishing that the Republic of Latvia de jure is a sovereign country and that by the will of its people it should be independent, the Supreme Soviet ruled: 1\\\\. To recognize the priority of international laws over national laws. To hold to be illegitimate the treaty between the USSR and Germany of 23 August 1939, and the consequent liquidation of independence of Latvia resulting from Soviet military aggression on 17 June 1940. 2\\\\. To proclaim the declaration \\"On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union\\" of 21 July 1940, to be void from the moment of adoption. 3\\\\. To re-establish the authority of the Constitution of Latvia. The official name of the state of Latvia is the Republic of Latvia, in short Latvia. 4\\\\. To suspend the Constitution of Latvia until a new edition is adopted, except for the articles, which in accordance with the 77 article of the Constitution can only be amended if submitted to a national referendum: > 1\\\\. Latvia is an independent democratic republic. > 2\\\\. The sovereign power of the State of Latvia is vested in the people of > Latvia. > 3\\\\. The territory of the State of Latvia, within the borders established by > international agreements, consists of Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale. > 6\\\\. The Saeima shall be elected in general, equal and direct elections, and > by secret ballot based on proportional representation. Article 6 shall be applied when the governmental institutions of independent Latvia have been restored, which grant free elections. 5\\\\. To set a period of transition to de facto independence until the first session of the new Saeima. During the transitional period the highest power of the state shall be the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia. 6\\\\. During the transitional period the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and other laws of the Latvian SSR in force at the time when the declaration was made may be applicable as long as they do not contradict articles 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the Constitution of Latvia. Disputes over the applicability of laws shall be resolved by the Constitutional Court. During the transitional period laws shall be made or amended only by the Supreme Council. 7\\\\. To constitute a committee, which will elaborate a new edition of the Constitution of Latvia, suitable to the current political, economic and social state of Latvia. 8\\\\. In accordance with international human rights, to grant social, economic and cultural rights, as well as political freedoms, to the citizens of Latvia and other countries, who reside in the territory of Latvia. This shall fully apply to those citizens of the Soviet Union who chose to reside in Latvia without its citizenship. 9\\\\. To build Latvian-Soviet relationships upon the Latvian-Soviet peace treaty of 11 August 1920, in which the Soviet Union recognizes eternal independence for Latvia and which is still in force. To constitute a committee for negotiations with USSR. Adoption The Supreme Soviet was elected on 18 March 1990; it was the first election in Soviet Latvia in which multiple parties were allowed to participate. 201 deputies were elected. The declaration was adopted on 4 May 1990, in an open vote, a majority of two thirds ‚Äî 132 votes ‚Äî was required, 138 deputies voted for adoption of the declaration, 1 abstained, while others did not participate in the vote and therefore there were no votes against the declaration. Response On 4 May 1990, after the declaration was adopted, the Communist Party of Latvia resolved that it was unconstitutional, contained notable contradictions and historical inaccuracies, and noted that such issues should be decided by referendum. The Communist Party deemed that the declaration might trigger the President of the Soviet Union to take countermeasures, therefore the party should launch a propaganda campaign against the declaration and ask the President of the Soviet Union to annul the declaration of the Supreme Soviet. On 14 May 1990, the President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev issued a decree stating that the declaration violated the Constitution of the Soviet Union and the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and thus stood void from the moment of adoption. The Supreme Council answered that the Constitution of the Soviet Union did not grant the president the right to annul acts adopted by Supreme Soviets of Soviet republics. Furthermore, the Supreme Council announced that the Supreme Soviet, as the legal successor of the People's Saeima, had the right to annul its decisions which contradicted the Constitution of Latvia which was in force at the time these decisions were made and as the Constitution of the Soviet Union ruled that the Soviet Union was founded upon principles of self-determination, but Latvia was forcibly annexed, reference to it had no juridical basis regarding the Latvian SSR. It also noted that the law of the Soviet Union regarding secession from the Soviet Union to which the decree also referred was not in force in the territory of the Latvian SSR as the Supreme Soviet had not ratified it and that the law contradicted the Constitution of the Soviet Union and the Constitution of Latvian SSR, which provided that Soviet republics can freely secede from the Soviet Union. It was stated that the call for a referendum on secession from the Soviet Union to take place has neither a legal or a political basis, because Latvia had been annexed by the Soviet Union without holding a referendum, which was required by the Constitution of Latvia. Therefore, the Supreme Council argued, Latvia was not seceding from the Soviet Union, but reasserting an independence that still existed under international law. It was noted that the Constitution of the Latvian SSR did not call for a referendum as it had been stated in the decree, but recommended two alternatives ‚Äì either a referendum or a public debate which had de facto taken place as it had been discussed in the press and several public opinion polls had taken place showing that a majority of the public supported independence. Similarly in the All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, 8003 had voted for restoration of independence and the declaration had been adopted by a vote of two thirds of members of the Supreme Soviet which was required for constitutional amendments. Furthermore, the Supreme Council referred to the result of elections of Supreme Soviet as a clear indicator of public opinion that supporters of independence had won the election. The Supreme Council stated that by 28 May 1990, it had received letters and telegrams from 646,726 residents of the Republic supporting the declaration and only 8,993 people had expressed opposition. Given these provisions, the Supreme Council stated that the Declaration was legitimate and in force. Further developments On 21 August 1991, during the Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt, the Supreme Council adopted a Constitutional law, \\"On the statehood of the Republic of Latvia\\", repealing Article 5 of the Declaration, thus ending the transitional period and restoring de facto independence. However, some elements defining the transitional period remained in force until the first session of the 5th Saeima on 6 July 1993 ‚Äì The Supreme Council remained the highest power of the state and the constitution was suspended. On 31 July 1990, the Supreme Council formed a work group of 22 deputies, which had to elaborate a new edition of the Constitution before 1 January 1990, though a new edition was never drafted and the Constitution was restored unamended. The Constitutional Court, which was intended to resolve Constitutional disputes during the transitional period, was only founded in 1996. To comply with international human rights as indicated in Article 8, the Supreme Council adopted a declaration of human rights immediately after the Declaration of independence. On September 6, 1991, after the failed coup attempt, the Soviet Union recognized Latvia's independence.Soviet Turmoil; Soviets Recognize Baltic Independence, Ending 51-year Occupation of 3 Nations by Serge Schmemann, September 7, 1991.

It was mobilized in January, 1935 in Imperia city. It was made up almost totally of Ligurians and Montferratians. Action The 5th Division \\"Cosseria\\" participated in the Second Italo- Abyssinian War, with parts of it forming 105th Division Cosseria II.David Nicolle, \\"The Italian Invasion of Abyssinia 1935-36\\" , p. 41 In August‚ÄìSeptember Cosseria was moving to Benghazi, where it stayed until December, 1935. Casseria was transferred to Adi Quala in Eritrea in the beginning of January, 1936. It was mostly tasked with population control and supply lines protection behind the front-line. In March, it started to advance to Addi Onfito, reaching Axum in April, 1936 and spreading in Adwa area. It has returned to Italy in September, 1936, and was reorganized as a binary division 25 March 1939.http://www.regioesercito.it/reparti/fanteria/rediv5.htm 10 June 1940, it was deployed on the French border, in the strip from Cima Longoira to the sea. 20 June 1940, the Cosseria division has started assault on French positions at bridges of Via Aurelia (Corso Francia) and Ponte San Luigi over Ro San Luigi river near coast, and mountain pass San Paolo near I Colletti, in Ventimiglia commune. Although the thrust through the bridges over Ro San Luigi river was initially repulsed, Cosseria has succeeded in taking over pass San Paolo 22 June 1940. As result, the French forces defending bridges over Ro San Luigi and Menton area were outflanked, with Italians capturing rural areas between Castellar and Roquebrune. Cosseria has remained in the occupied territory until middle of August, 1940, than it was transferred to coastal defence duties in Western Liguria. =Deployment in Russia= The division was one of the twelve divisions that served on the Eastern Front as part of the Italian Army in Russia. The Cosseria division has received orders to move from Liguria to Russia in June, 1942, accordingly arriving to Horlivka in the beginning of July, 1942. It was used initially as the reserve of 35th Army Corps. Following attacking forces, Cosseria has arrived to Donetsk 15 July 1942, and in Luhansk 25 July 1942. It crossed Seversky Donets River at Stanytsia Luhanska. In the first half of August, the Cosseria fas transferred to the front-line at the Don river, on the north of 3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna, taking positions between Novaya Kalitva and Verhny Mamon. From 20 August until 26 August 1942, the Cosseria has repelled a Soviet assault without giving up any ground. Further Soviet attack at Krasno-Orehovo and Derezovka 11 September 1942, succeeded in pushing back the Cosseria troops, but all losses were recovered by Italian counter- attack 12 September 1942. Soon after, the division was moved back to the reserve. The Cosseria division was in complete rout by 24 December 1942. The division was relieved of front-line duty by German units. The remains were partly used to reinforce the Ravenna division, and partly used to protect supply lines around Rovenky. But rapidly deteriorating situation has forced the Cosseria remnants to retreat to the south-west, first maintaining front- line, and then in several columns. The street fighting has begun in Rovenky 2 January 1943. During the Voronezh Front operations in the Upper Don area under Golikov, Soviet cavalry struck out very successfully for Valuiki and under the pale winter sun on 19 January the horsemen in black capes and flying hoods charged down the hapless Italians, killing and wounding more than a thousand before the brief resistance by the fleeing, hungry and frostbitten men of the 5th Italian Infantry Division ended. The soldiers of Cosseria then reached Izium, where they linked with other Axis forces. The further retreat route was through Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Romny, Pryluky, Nizhyn, finally reaching Novobelitsa at the southern outskirts of Gomel at 7 March 1943. The division was removed from duty and moved to the Tuscany province of Italy during late April - early May, 1943, where it started to re-form. The brief tour to Milan was done at 25 July 1943, and after Cosseria was assigned for the police duties at Sesto San Giovanni. The division has ceased to exist 12 September 1943, with troops mostly surrendered to German in the aftermath of the Armistice of Cassibile.

The Immortal Alamo is an American silent film released on May 25, 1911. The Immortal Alamo is the earliest film version of the events surrounding the 1836 Battle of the Alamo. The film was directed by William F. Haddock, and produced by Gaston M√©li√®s. The film's cast included Francis Ford, Edith Storey, William A. Carroll and one hundred cadets from the Peacock Military Academy. The film was said to be 10 minutes in length, and focused on \\"pretty girl, shy hero, and a villain\\" formula during the battle. After the Mexican army lays siege to the mission, Lieutenant Dickenson departs with a dispatch to General Sam Houston. Senor Navarre makes sexual advances on Dickenson's wife, Lucy, who is saved by Colonel William B. Travis. Navarre is ousted from the mission and provides information on the Alamo to General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna so that he can marry Lucy Dickenson. Lieutenant Dickenson returns with reinforcements before the wedding and kills Senor Navarre. The final scene of the film shows Santa Anna surrendering as a \\"common soldier\\". The film has been noted as historically inaccurate in its plot, but that it tries for accuracy in its setting. Reviews of the film were mixed and C. H. Claudy's criticism of the film is a striking contemporary account of the film's depiction. No known copies of the film exist today, and it is considered to be a lost film.  Plot  The film is a historical drama that depicts General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's attack on the Alamo Mission in San Antonio in the Battle of the Alamo. The film was made on location in the Alamo and introduced historical figures such as Davy Crockett and William B. Travis. The film has a romance element where Mexican spy Senor Navarre has affections for Lieutenant Dickenson's wife, Lucy. When the Mexican Army lays siege, Colonel Travis calls upon his men to send word to General Sam Houston and Lieutenant Dickenson volunteers. As soon as he departs, Senor Navarre attempts to charm Lucy Dickenson, but she is repulsed by his advances and is saved from being overpowered by Colonel Travis. Senor Navarre is forced out and proceeds to provide General Santa Anna information on the mission in return for the right to take a survivor to be his bride. After the Alamo falls, only a few women survive, among them is Lucy Dickenson. Senor Navarre holds General Santa Anna to the promise and prepares to marry her the next day. Before the marriage can be performed Lieutenant Dickenson and the reinforcements arrive and capture Senor Navarre. Lieutenant Dickenson avenges his wife's honor by slaying Senor Navarre with his sword. The final scene of the film shows Santa Anna surrendering as a \\"common soldier\\".  Cast  *Francis Ford as Senor Navarre, as David Crockett *Edith Storey *William A. Carroll *Gaston M√©li√®s *William Clifford *Mr. Young In response to an inquiry, The Motion Picture Story Magazine section of \\"Answers to Inquiries\\" noted that of the two men leaning against a tree, the one with his hand on it was William Clifford and the private leaning against the tree was Mr. Young.  Production and release This scene from The Immortal Alamo uses a painted backdrop. In order to shoot the film, Gaston M√©li√®s moved his production and distribution unit, the Star Film Company from its location in New York to San Antonio in January 1910. M√©li√®s promised to produce a historically \\"correct\\" depiction of the Battle of the Alamo. The film was directed by William F. Haddock. The film was shot in San Antonio, Texas and on location at the Alamo. One hundred cadets from the Peacock Military Academy portrayed the Mexican Army.Thompson, Frank. Texas Hollywood: Filmmaking in San Antonio Since 1910. San Antonio: Maverick Publishing Company, 2002. p. 27. Wilbert Melville \\"conceived the idea, designed the plot and formulated the scenario...\\" for the film. The film was produced with the permission of the mayor. The film was released on May 25, 1911. One estimate of the cast claimed some five hundred people were present in the picture, but this is not supported by other details of the production. An advertisement for the film highlighted the Alamo being bombarded with real cannon, the ride of Lieutenant Dickenson with the dispatch to General Sam Houston, the arrival of Dave Crockett, the death of Bowie, the escape of Rose and the surrender of Santa Anna. One of the first theaters to show the film was the Wonderland Theater which would premier the film on May 27, 1911. One advertisement for the film gave the film's length as 3,000 feet.  Historical accuracy  Richard R. Flores analyzed the lost film and notes that M√©li√®s' production was claimed to have been 10 minutes in length and that it could not make a significant depiction of the battle. The historical accuracy of the film was compromised to carry out the plot of the \\"pretty girl, shy hero, and a villain\\". While Lieutenant Almeron Dickenson was a real person and his wife was present at the mission, her name was Suzanna. Suzanna Dickenson and her infant daughter survived the battle, but there is no evidence of a Mexican spy or a marriage attempt. Instead, Santa Anna sent Suzanna north to inform the victory of the Mexican forces to General Sam Houston. Flores cites Rony's labeling of M√©li√®s' productions as a \\"hybrid documentary and fantasy\\" and notes that it was an early attempt at a historical documentary based on its attempt at a faithful setting. The uses the Mexicans' as a form of savages in M√©li√®s cinematic motifs. Frank Thompson's analysis of the production notes states that William F. Haddock was delving into the archives to produce an accurate depiction of the Alamo at the studio because the Alamo itself was altered from the time of the battle. Thompson noted that despite the battle being within living memory the \\"exact reproduction\\" used a painted canvas backdrop and focused on an entirely fictional plot.  Reception  Motography included a brief review of the film which states, \\"This is indeed a well presented historical subject. The action has breadth and historical perspective, with stirring scenes and large groupings, and at the same time there is a human plot threading its way through the historical background and giving the action a specific interest. The last scene, showing Santa Anna's surrender \\"as a common soldier,\\" is rather obscure. One wonders why he did it. In all other scenes the action is clear and effective. It would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to the thrilling scene inside the Alamo.\\" The Moving Picture Worlds review stated that \\"[it] is a very thrilling and altogether satisfactory reproduction of an important historical episode. The company deserves the highest commendation for the picture and the way it is produced.\\" A negative review in the column \\"Avoidable Crudites\\" by C. H. Claudy in The Moving Picture World found great faults with the production. Claudy wrote. \\"One hardly conceives of a commander, informed of the approach of a column of the enemy, so far away they are only visible through field glasses, getting sufficiently panic stricken to send immediately for help saying he is besieged by a thousand Mexicans. One imagines he would at least go look and see for himself! And one resents a scene labelled \\"The Attack,\\" which is so short one can't even look at all of it, said attack being motionless men in a thin line pointing guns at the Alamo! The interior of the Alamo was well done ‚Äî yet do people stop a desperate defense to go through heroics about a line and fighting to the death? Or do they fight to the death without talking about it? Perhaps the original fighters did go through that line, drawn on the floor, stunt, and agree among themselves to fight till they died, but such desperate fighters didn't all stop fighting at once to discuss the matter.

Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill. Specialist types There are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill.

The project was coordinated by Prof. Dr. Karin Lochte at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Warnem√ºnde with contributions of ten European partners and one institute from the US. The aim of the ADEPD project was to build up a joint data base for deep sea biological and geochemical data from a variety of sources and to conduct a preliminary geographical analysis of these data. Emphasis was on the North Atlantic, since from this area most data are available and it is the most perturbed deep sea region due to human activities. 1775 published and unpublished data sets were collected in two years. This was the first project which has compiled a data base from existing deep sea data, long-term archived and accessible to the scientific community. Evaluation of the data collection showed that data are clustered in some well investigated areas of the Atlantic, but large regions are devoid of data like the Mid Atlantic Ridge, parts of the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean. In particular biological data from the deep sea are much more scarce than geochemical ones, since many biological data from past investigations are not accessible in a suitable form at present. Most deep sea research projects did not carry out geochemical and biological studies at the same locations. Therefore, statistical comparisons between biological and geochemical data are still difficult despite the high total amount of data gathered. Different methods employed for the determination of one variable further complicate the matter. One of the major achievements of ADEP was to convert different measurements to common units. This allowed to investigate relationships between different chemical measurements, groups of organisms and turnover rates. Two very different approaches to estimate the total turnover of organic carbon or oxygen (respiration) at the deep sea floor gave very similar results. Regional differences in both assessments point to methodological shortcomings by one or the other method and to gaps in data coverage. While estimates agreed well in central Atlantic regions, fairly large discrepancies were found at the continental margins. This indicated that there was still insufficient knowledge about transport processes and biological turnover of organic carbon along continental margins. The following recommendations for future research were given on the basis of the ADEPD results: * It is most important to secure deep sea biological data from so far inaccessible sources and to collate them in a data information system which guarantees long-term stewardship and public access. * Biological and geochemical studies were mostly carried out separately which seems to be a systematic, scientific pattern and poses a problem in deep sea research. Interdisciplinary studies are essential to better understand of deep sea processes. * The largest differences in estimates of oxygen fluxes at the sea floor are found at continental margins which export large amounts of organic carbon to the deep sea. The knowledge of transport and biological utilization at the continental margins need further attention.

Born in Budapest, he studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music and earned his diploma first at the musicological and then in the piano department. His activities include composition, concert performances, teaching, and musicological research.  Music  He formed his first band in 1962, and with them made the first LP in the Hungarian \\"Modern Jazz\\" series. Since then he has led several bands which can be heard on the anthology-form records in that same series. In the late 1960s he co-led the Gonda-Krusa Quartet with the Polish vibrophnis Richard Kruza. He also recorded with his Gonda Sextet, which he formed in 1972. One of their famous recordings is titled Shaman Song. The sextet consisted of J√°nos Gonda (piano, electrical piano), G√°bor Bal√°zs (bass), Tam√°s Berki (vocal, guitar, percussion), P√©ter K√°ntor (soprano and alto saxophone), Istv√°n Dely (conga, percussion) and Gyula Kov√°cs (drums, percussion). As a composer, he mainly writes jazz pieces, but has also branched out into other forms of expression. Worth mentioning are his modern songs, his film scores (e.g. for the 1966 Istv√°n Szab√≥ film Vater) and other incidental music, his dance compositions and symphonic jazz works. The most significant of the last is his Australian Concerto of 1970. In 1974, he composed a musical entitled Pro Urbe.  Teaching and research  Gonda's theoretical works also focus on jazz. Of his books and studies, one should mention the book Jazz, published in 1979. He has been a professor and head of the jazz department at the B√©la Bart√≥k Conservatory in Budapest, Hungary, and vice president of the International Jazz Federation. Gonda was head of the jazz department affiliated with the Associated of Hungarian Musicians. From 1965 to 1997, he was leader of the jazz department of the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. He was the artistic director of Tatab√°nya International Jazz Camp and Tatab√°nya International Institute of Creative Music Education .  Awards  In 1974, he was awarded the Hungarian Erkel Prize.

The principal perpetrators of these war crimes were the Nazi collaborationist S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A., the so-called \\"Russian National Liberation Army\\" (, RONA), commanded by Bronislav Kaminski. The worst atrocities were committed in the local hospitals, in the Curie Institute, the Kolonia Staszica housing estate, and the Zieleniak concentration camp. In all, about 10,000 residents of Ochota were killed and had their property stolen, after which the district was systematically burnt down by German forces, as were the bodies of many of the victims. The arrival of RONA in Warsaw's Ochota district Russian National Liberation Army (RONA) hold a briefing during the Warsaw Uprising After the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising on 1 August 1944, SS-Reichsf√ºhrer Heinrich Himmler ordered the destruction of the city and the extermination of its civilian population. On 4 August 1944 at approximately 10:00, units of SS RONA commanded by Bronislav Kaminski entered Warsaw's Ochota district. The staff of RONA, having under its command 1,700 soldiers, set up their headquarters in a building of the Wolna Wszechnica Polska (Polish Free University) at 2A Opaczewska Street (today 2 Banacha Street), while the soldiers took over the building of the XXI Liceum Og√≥lnokszta≈ÇcƒÖce im. Hugona Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaja (21st Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj Secondary School) at 93 Gr√≥jecka Street. The start of the massacre RONA's first priority was to attack resistance positions at the so-called \\"Reduta Kaliska\\" (Kalisz Stronghold) further along Gr√≥jecka Street, but almost immediately, RONA units began the first of a series of robberies, rapes, and murders, initially targeting the civilian population of nearby Opaczewska Street. Groups of RONA soldiers stormed into people's homes and expelled the residents, some of whom were shot - especially if they were reluctant to leave their properties. Most of the buildings in Opaczewska Street were set on fire that day after being systematically looted. On 4‚Äì5 August 1944, people were also murdered in nearby allotments, and the residents of 104 Gr√≥jecka Street were killed with grenades while hiding in the cellar. In the first hours of the massacre, RONA troops also entered the Radium Institute where they killed some of the patients. Many of the victims were gang raped, before they were killed - a pattern which was repeated elsewhere. Zieleniak camp The Zieleniak camp memorial at the site where hundreds of prisoners were shot in August and September 1944 On 5 August, due to the ever-growing number of people being expelled from their homes, the Germans decided to create a transitional camp in Ochota where people could be gathered prior to being transported to the transit camp (Durchgangslager) in Pruszk√≥w, outside Warsaw. The transitional camp was located in the area of a former vegetable market called Zieleniak (today the area of Hale Banacha). Between 10-20,000 inhabitants of the Ochota district and its neighbouring areas were rounded up by the evening of 5 August. RONA troops took over the former administration building of the marketplace, and used caretaker boxes as guard posts. The marketplace was enclosed by a brick wall which prevented the prisoners from being able to escape. Crimes against the local population continued during the round ups carried out by RONA troops, who often beat and shot their prisoners while herding them towards the camp, pulling women out of the crowd to rape them, frequently killing them afterwards. At the gate of the camp, the victims were searched for valuables, jewels and money, and then forced into the cobbled area of the marketplace. Once inside the camp, the prisoners were given no sanitary facilities and no medicine or medical aid was available. A small amount of mouldy bread was sometimes given out, but there was no drinking water. In addition, RONA soldiers sometimes shot at the imprisoned people for fun. Erich von dem Bach, commander of all German armed forces in Warsaw during the uprising, inspected the camp on the day of its inception and concluded that \\"there was nothing wrong there, everything was in order.\\" By 7 August 1944, the camp was overflowing with civilians. Those who had been killed were laid in piles along the camp wall or buried in a makeshift manner. On the same day, several hundred people of non-Polish descent were escorted away to a similar camp in Okƒôcie. On 9 August, the first batch of prisoners was marched out of the Zieleniak camp and transported to the Pruszk√≥w transit camp. As German forces gradually pushed the insurrectionists out of Ochota in subsequent days, the camp was once again filled with people from other parts of the district, such as the Kolonia Lubeckiego (Lubecki Housing Estate) and blocks of the Social Insurance Office (ZUS) in Filtrowa Street. The capture of resistance positions along Wawelska Street (the so-called \\"Reduta Wawelska\\" - Wawelska Stronghold) on 11 August, was followed by the next wave of people expelled from their homes. As the number of murdered and deceased prisoners increased, their corpses were burned in the gymnasium of the neighbouring Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj Secondary School. They were transported to the gymnasium by conscripted civilians who were ordered to lay them in piles, after which RONA soldiers doused the bodies with alcohol and set them on fire. On 12 August, a German officer killed three captured boy scouts of the Gustaw Battalion of the Home Army, shooting them in the backs of their heads as they lowered corpses into an excavated pit. On 13 August, the final evacuation of civilians to the Pruszk√≥w transit camp began. Meanwhile, selected men were conscripted into the Verbrennungskommando and continued burning the bodies of the victims of the massacre. The Zieleniak camp operated until 19 August. During its two weeks of existence, some 1,000 of its prisoners died of hunger, thirst, and extreme exhaustion, or were shot to death by RONA soldiers. Radium Institute Tchorek plaque commemorating the staff and patients murdered at the Radium Institute in August 1944 On 5 August, German RONA units broke into the Radium Institute (founded by Marie Curie) at 15 Wawelska Street. After looting the hospital and robbing the staff and patients, they set the library on fire and destroyed the food stock, pharmacy and much of the hospital equipment. After initially deciding to execute the patients and staff inside the Institute, the RONA troops then changed their minds and decided that the patients and eight staff members would remain while the rest of the staff were marched off to the Zieleniak camp. In the evening, nurses who had stayed behind were gang-raped. The next day the building was set on fire and some of the patients were burned alive. Approximately 60 people avoided death by seeking shelter in the building's cellar and chimneys. On 9‚Äì10 August, some survivors were discovered, and RONA set the building on fire again. On 19 August, RONA troops pulled all the remaining survivors who could be found out of the building and killed the 50 critically ill patients on the spot. The remainder were sent to the Zieleniak camp, where they were also executed (according to eyewitness evidence, with a shot to the back of the head) and then burned at a pyre in the gymnasium. Prior to the execution, one female patient (of Ukrainian descent) was released. In total, about 170 people (patients and staff) were murdered. Other atrocities Rapes, robberies, arson, executions by firing squad and murders of civilians hidden in cellars (usually by throwing hand-grenades into them) were committed by RONA throughout the Ochota district. They also killed the wounded in the resistance field hospital at 11/13 Langiewicza Street with grenades. Most of the atrocities in Ochota ended with the fall of the last resistance stronghold in the building of the Wojskowy Instytut Geograficzny (Military Geographic Institute) on 13 August 1944. However, on 25 August, patients and personnel of the Szpital DzieciƒÖtka Jezus (Infant Jesus Hospital) in 4 Lindleya Street were beaten and murdered. Victims A memorial plaque on the wall of 104 Gr√≥jecka Street, where scores of people were killed with grenades in the basement and twenty people were shot in the back yard on 4 August 1944 Approximately 10,000 people were killed in the Ochota massacre, including 1,000 people who died in the Zieleniak camp. Many different sites were used for mass executions, some of which are now marked with memorial plaques to commemorate the victims. Among those killed were the 82-year-old painter Wiktor Mazurowski and his wife, who were murdered at 83 Filtrowa Street, the well-known dramatic actor Mariusz Maszy≈Ñski and his family, as well as the architect Stefan Tomorowicz and his wife, who were killed in Pole Mokotowskie. Systematic looting and destruction of the Ochota district RONA units withdrew from Ochota between 22‚Äì25 August 1944, but the looting of property in the district continued until the beginning of October. The German occupational administration organised a systematic campaign of pillaging; booty was loaded into goods trains in the Warszawa Zachodnia railway station and sent to Germany. Additionally, convoys of trucks loaded with stolen property were sent to Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. In the end, units of the Vernichtungskommando systematically set street after street on fire, thus effecting the final destruction of the district.

His next film was The Immortal Alamo in 1911, the earliest known film version of the events surrounding the 1836 Battle of the Alamo. It starred Francis Ford. No copy of that film exists today, and it is considered to be a lost film, as are many of Haddock's works. Many of his films during his early years were film shorts, starring lesser known actors and actresses. He often teamed up with early film actor Lamar Johnstone, the first time being in the 1913 film Hearts and Crosses, co-starring Lucille Young. That same year he married his wife, Rosa Koch. His last direction was on the 1919 film The Carter Case, starring Herbert Rawlinson, Marguerite Marsh, and Ethel Grey Terry.

Orthodox Christians in Bosnia and Herzegovina belong to the Serbian Orthodox Church. According to the CIA World Factbook, Orthodox Christians make up 31% of the country's population.CIA World Factbook  History  The end of the High Middle Ages saw Eastern Orthodoxy firmly establish itself - in the form of the Serbian Orthodox Church - in the east of Herzegovina, namely Zachlumia, following a period of rule by the Kingdom of Serbia. Zachlumia was conquered by Bosnian ban Stephen II Kotromaniƒá in the late 1320s and was henceforth part of the Banate of Bosnia (later kingdom), in which the Roman Catholic Church and the indigenous Bosnian Church vied for supremacy. In such political climate, the Eastern Orthodoxy never seems to have penetrated the medieval Bosnia proper beyond Podrinje. The Ottoman conquest of the Kingdom of Bosnia in 1463 led to drastic changes in the confessional structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Islam taking root and Orthodox Christianity spreading into Bosnia. Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror vowed to protect Orthodox Christianity and, like all Orthodox churches, the Serbian Orthodox Church enjoyed great support of the Ottoman state. The Ottomans introduced a sizeable Orthodox Christian population into Bosnia proper, including Vlachs from the eastern Balkans. The conversion of the adherents of the Bosnian Church also aided the spread of Eastern Orthodoxy. Later, areas abandoned by Catholics during the Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars were settled with Muslims and Orthodox Christians. The Ottoman regime consistently favored the Orthodox Church over the Catholic and encouraged conversions of Catholics to Orthodoxy due to political expediency: while the entire Orthodox hierarchy was subjected to the sultan, the Catholics were suspected of conspiring with their brethren outside the Ottoman Empire. While Bosnian Catholics were only allowed to repair existing sacral objects, a large scale construction of Orthodox monasteries and churches throughout Bosnia started in the northwest in 1515. An Orthodox priest was present in Sarajevo already in 1489, and the city's first Orthodox church was constructed between 1520 and 1539. By 1532, Bosnian Orthodox Christians had their own metropolitan bishop, who took up official residence in Sarajevo in 1699. By the end of the 18th century, the Metropolitan of Bosnia had authority over the Orthodox bishops of Mostar, Zvornik, Novi Pazar and Sarajevo. Even the high-ranking Orthodox clergymen, however, were very poorly educated and corrupt; they were reportedly ignorant of the basic principles of the faith, such as the Ten Commandments, confession, prayers and the importance of the cross. Syncretism was widespread among the Bosnians, with Catholics (as late as the 1880s) and Muslims celebrating the Orthodox slava. The tide eventually turned against the church, however, when Orthodox clergy renounced loyalty to the sultans and started encouraging and aiding peasant rebellions. The Ottomans abolished the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá and, from the late 1760s until 1880, the Orthodox in Bosnia and Herzegovina were directly under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. As such it was led by Phanariotes, Greeks from Istanbul. In the mid-19th century, there were more than 400 Orthodox priests in Bosnia and Herzegovina; it was a time of renewed prosperity for the country's Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1920, following the First World War and the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the area again came under the religious authority of the newly reunited Serbian Orthodox Church, under Patriarch Dimitrije. Serbian Orthodox Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina Five eparchies (dioceses) of the Serbian Orthodox Church cover the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina: * Metropolitanate of Dabar and Bosnia, headed by metropolitan Hrizostom Jeviƒá, since 2017.Communique of the Holy Assembly of Bishops (2017) * Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina, headed by bishop Grigorije Duriƒá, since 1999. * Eparchy of Zvornik and Tuzla, headed by bishop Fotije Sladojeviƒá, since 2017. * Eparchy of Banja Luka, headed by bishop Jefrem Milutinoviƒá, since 1980. * Eparchy of Bihaƒá and Petrovac, headed by bishop Sergije Karanoviƒá, since 2017.

From the words Lepe and Potosi, Lipes in western Bolivia might be indicated. He lived at Potosi during the period when its silver mines were most productive and luxury among the Spanish residents and mine owners had nearly reached its height. Father Barba divided his time between his priestly duties and a close study of the ores of this region and their treatment. There had been, since 1570, a complete revolution in the treatment of silver ores, through the application of mercury, and a number of improvements followed, of which Barba had knowledge. In 1609, he invented the pan amalgamation process (in Spanish the cazo or fondo process) for extracting silver from ore by mixing it with salt and mercury and heating it in shallow copper vessels. In 1640 he published in Madrid a book entitled Arte de los Metales, the earliest work on South American ores and minerals. It includes information on mineral localities in Bolivia. The book has been republished in Spanish, French, English and German.

Its name was derived from the name of the principal sponsor of the team, the soft drinks manufacturer, Kas. The team was principally based in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Its riders typically wore a jersey that consisted of yellow and blue. History=Kas‚ÄìKaskol team= The Kas team began operating in 1958, and in that year one of its riders, Fausto Izan, won a stage in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. In 1959 the team signed the 1958 Spanish champion, Federico Bahamontes, who at that time had won two King of the Mountains classifications in both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espa√±a. The Tour de France was disputed by national teams and Bahamontes won the Tour in 1959. Bahamontes left in 1960 but the team won the King of the Mountains in the 1960, 1961 and 1962 Vuelta a Espa√±a with Antonio Karmay Mestre. Julio Jim√©nez again won the King of the Mountains in the 1964 and 1965 Vuelta a Espa√±a. Kas-Kaskol dominated the 1966 Vuelta with Francisco Gabica winning, Eusebio Velez Mendizabal second and Carlos Echeverr√≠a third. It also dominated the King of the Mountains competition with Gregorio San Miguel winning. The team won six stages and held the yellow jersey for 14 of the 18 stages. Kas won the team prize in the 1967 and 1968 Vuelta. In 1971 the team signed the best new professional of the 1970 Vuelta, Jos√© Manuel Fuente. Fuente won the mountains classification in the 1971 Giro d'Italia and then won the Vuelta in 1972. A Kas teammate, Miguel Maria Lasa, was second and four other Kas riders placed in the top ten. The team won the mountains, points, and combination classifications and the team prize. It wore the yellow jersey for 17 of the 18 stages . Fuente and his team went to the 1972 Giro d'Italia where Fuente took the maglia rosa and the race became a battle between him and Eddy Merckx in the mountains in which Merckx prevailed. Fuente won the 1974 Vuelta, the third rider to win two editions of the race. Fuente led from the 10th stage but fell and then lost more time in the final time trial. He won by 11 seconds. Kas again won the team prize. The following year Kas won the mountains, points and team classifications as well as holding the yellow jersey for 19 stages until the final time trial, when Agust√≠n Tamames took it and left the Kas teammates Domingo Perurena and Miguel Mar√≠a Lasa on the lower steps of the podium. Fuente abandoned the race with problems which led to the end of his career. Kas won the Vuelta again in 1976 with Jos√© Pesarrodona and the mountains competition with Andr√©s Oliva. It won the team prize in the 1978 and 1979 Vuelta. In 1979 many Belgian riders joined and the chief directeur sportif was the Belgian Robert Lelangue. 1976 Tour de France winner Lucien Van Impe won a stage for the team in the 1979 Tour de France The sponsor then retired from the peloton. =1980s Kas team= In 1985 Kas returned as a co-sponsor of the French-based Skil-Sem team run by French directeur sportif Jean de Gribaldy. The following year Kas took over as title sponsor from Skil and the Kas jersey returned but the team remained French- based. However, the team rode more Spanish races to satisfy the new sponsor. In 1986, Sean Kelly improved on his ninth place in the 1985 Vuelta a Espa√±a by coming third, winning the points jersey at the Vuelta for the third time. Kelly also won the Tour of the Basque Country and the Volta a Catalunya. The team had further success in 1986 with Kelly, who was the World's number 1 rider during this period, winning 'monument' classics Milan‚ÄìSan Remo and Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, with Acacio Da Silva who won the Z√ºri-Metzgete, and with the Swiss cyclo-cross champion, Pascal Richard. In January 1987 de Gribaldy died in a car crash. After that the team became Spanish-based. In the 1987 Vuelta a Espa√±a, Kelly led with three days to go when he had to withdraw due to injury. He won the event in 1988, Kas' last win in the Vuelta. After 1988 the team stopped as the team owner died in 1988 and Kas retired from sponsorship.

Life and family Born in the North East of England, Ralph Dodd was the second son of Alexander Dodd, and had an aptitude for drawing along with his elder brother Robert Dodd (1748‚Äì1816).George W. Younger,\\" Robert & Ralph Dodd, Marine Painters\\", THE MARINER'S MIRROR, Vol.10, 1924, No.3. page 243 After receiving an education in mechanics, both Ralph and his brother Robert spent five and a half years at the Royal Academy schools practicing as a portrait painter. His older brother Robert is known for his maritime landscapes and works on the French Revolutionary Wars. Dodd had two sons, Barrodall Robert Dodd (c.1780-1837) and George Dodd (c.1783-1827); who both became engineers and pioneers of steam power.J.G.James, Ralph Dodd, The Very Ingenious Schemer, Newcomen Society Papers, Vol. No 47, 1976, page 161 foll. His namesake, Ralph Dodd(s) (1792-1874) went on to become an engineer and mentor to locomotive engineers George Stephenson (1781-1848) and relative Isaac Dodds (1801-1882), founder of Isaac Dodds and Son. He has been well documented as an innovator and registered a number of building patents, including British Patent No 3141 on 3 June 1801 for a building system that was over 150 years ahead of its time. As a high-profile founder and promoter of engineering schemes, particularly in London, England, Dodd generally resigned his tender as engineer within one to two years of his projects receiving Parliamentary approval. Most of his schemes went on to be successfully completed by renowned engineers of the day, such as John Rennie and Robert Mylne. During his career, Ralph Dodd, was known for his flair for publicity and generating public interest, but has been portrayed by some of his detractors as a failure due to his general early departure from these companies despite repeated success. In December 1821 he suffered severe burns when the boiler of the paddle steamer Sovereign (80 feet long, of the River Severn Steam Yacht Co, built by H. Turner, Stourport and registered on 30 Jan. 1822, British National Archives Registration No BT/107/168) exploded at Gloucester on her trial run. The damage sustained to the ship was so bad that she was broken up directly. Following the accident he took advice to go to Cheltenham for his health and, since he was nearly penniless, he walked there in the middle of winter. He died at Cheltenham on 11 April 1822.Two portraits of Ralph Dodd are to be found, one, probably in his artist days, c.1780-1810 and another at the height of his engineering career, c.1815-1820 Tunnels Having been employed to undertake surveys of canals, coal mines, harbours and other civil engineering works of the late eighteenth century Dodd turned his attention to tunnels, proposing the first under water tunnel in the United Kingdom in 1796. The Tynemouth proposal was for a tunnel between North Shields and South Shields, which was inspired by local undersea mining activities in Wylam and Whitehaven and was based on estimating parameters used for tunnel costings for the Grand Junction Canal. =Gravesend to Tilbury= In 1798 Dodd published his proposal for the building of a tunnel between Gravesend and Tilbury to ‚ÄúThe great and the good‚Äù of Kent and Essex. His prospectus for the business played on the military advantages in having a tunnel as it had long been recognised that there was a need to be able to move troops rapidly between Kent and Essex in the event of war. The proposal was of great interest to the military, but Charles Clarke of the Gravesend Ordnance Office was not impressed. In particular he believed that the tunnel design would not work as Dodd had not thought through the dimensions correctly, but also that the design was fundamentally flawed and sought to provide mathematical proof of this. He also challenged assumptions about the likely use of the tunnel and questioned Dodd's experience and capabilities. Despite Clarke's objections, and by eliciting the support of people in high places, a company to build the tunnel was set up and an Act of Parliament passed to approve its construction. (Stat. 39 GEO. III., c73) The Thames Tunnel was started some 800 yds. east of Tilbury Fort, to join Tilbury to Gravesend in 1798. Much difficulty was experienced with flooding so a steam driven pump and digging machines were commissioned in 1801. After a number of disasters the pumping was abandoned and a figure of ¬£15,242.10s.4d. was expended before the project was terminated in 1802. =Gravesend to Strood= In 1798 Dodd also proposed a canal from near Gravesend to Strood. This became the Thames & Medway canal though it is not clear whether he was involved past the planning and approvals stage. Although this canal was closed, a tunnel forming part of the route, which for many years was shared by the canal and railway is used by trains travelling between Gravesend and Strood. Waterworks Despite little experience of water works in 1805 Dodd published his book 'Observations on Water' in which he proposed the creation of numerous London Waterworks. =South London Waterworks CompanyEast London Waterworks CompanyWest Middlesex Waterworks Company=Canals and waterways In 1795 Dodd wrote An Account of the Principal Canals in the Known World. As a riposte, J. Whitfield wrote The Engineering Plagiarist, accusing Dodd of copying John Philips' General History of Inland Navigation, Newcastle 1792. However, he was undeterred and continued to work on canal schemes. =Newcastle-Carlisle-Maryport Canal= In January 1794 Dodd surveyed and proposed the Newcastle-Carlisle-Maryport Canal. Subsequently, William Chapman and William Jessop did a more detailed survey. By June 1795 he published a pamphlet proposing a canal from Stella in Blaydon- on-Tyne to Hexham on the south side of the River Tyne and estimated a cost of ¬£35,709 for 18 miles of canal with 12 locks. John Sutcliffe rejected Ralph Dodd's plans and proposed a different Stella to Hexham line 44 feet wide at the surface and 6 feet deep taking craft between 50 and 60 tons, but not existing keels. This 17 mile, 18 lock route was estimated at almost ¬£90,000 to bring a revenue of ¬£23,460 and a net yield of ¬£17,595. Having a looked at John Sutcliffe's plans, Robert Whitworth approved it, noting 'is a rugged one; I never before saw a good line like it; yet so far as I can discover, I believe it is the best the country affords: It is certainly practicable, and I have no doubt but that a good and useful canal may be made (with some variation) upon it; but it will be exceedingly expensive: I am, however, told the trade that will come upon this canal will fully answer that expense, even were it twice as much'. =Thames Medway Canal= Following a successful proposal to Parliament an Act was obtained by Dodd in 1800. Following suggested amendments by John Rennie in 1802 works began with management of the construction and engineering being undertaken by John Rowe. =Grand Surrey Canal= Dodd suggested and promoted plans for a canal between Croydon and Rotherhithe during 1799. In 1800 this developed into the Grand Surrey Canal and the Croydon Canal and his plans were authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 21 May 1801. This created the Company of Proprietors of the Grand Surrey Canal, and gave them powers to raise ¬£60,000 by issuing shares, and an additional ¬£30,000 if required. Dodd, assisted by his sons Barrodall and George, began engineering works but resigned from the project to be replaced by Rennie, a position that was to be repeated. =Other proposed works= * 1800: Involved with the Mersey and Irwell navigation * 1802: Proposal for North London (London to Cambridge) - not executed * 1810: Proposed link between Andover and Basingstoke canals - not executed * 1815: Continuation of Surrey Canal to Vauxhall - not executed Bridges=Vauxhall Bridge= Originally presented as The Prospectus for the Intended Prince's Bridge Ralph Dodd's hand written observations can be found at Battersea Library, London. Following numerous months taking tally notes on crossing types at Battersea Bridge, then operating a toll system, Dodd petitioned the Prince Regent in 1806-1811 for an Act allowing the construction of a bridge across the Thames to relieve congestion. Dodd was successful in receiving an Act of Parliament, but exited the project in 1812 after being renamed the Vauxhall Bridge Company. Once again replaced by Rennie who was unsuccessful in this endeavour and also resign from the project. =Springfield Bridge= The Springfield Bridge was constructed in 1819‚Äì1821. Docks, harbours and ports Following his work on canals and waterways Ralph Dodd briefly turned his attention to harbours producing two proposals. First in 1800 with Ralph Dodd cooperating on a huge Port of London improvement scheme together with other, more famous, civil engineers.\\"Select Committee's Third Report\\", London, 28 July 1800. and later the 1819 Brighton Pier scheme. =Other Proposals= *1796: Tynemouth Harbour proposal *1811: Grimsby harbour proposal The Intended London Distillery Company In 1807 Ralph Dodd opened public subscriptions for transferable shares to raise capital of ¬£100,000, divided into 2000 shares of ¬£50 each, for the Intended London Distillery Company Ltd,Joint stock companies with transferable shares.

Suitable premises were purchased and managers and other officers were employed, including both known malt distiller Mr Carr and chief rectifier (Rectified spirit) Mr John Taylor. However, no attempt was made to obtain incorporation and a solicitor was engaged to draft a deed of trust.The King v. Dodd, 9 East 515 (1808) This proved to be an error and in 1808 criminal action was taken against Dodd for the promotion of a scheme for a company with transferable shares in violation of the Bubble Act. Dodd decided to dispute this legal action but ultimately lost the case in 1808 resulting in the dispansion of The London Distillery Company until mid-2011.London‚Äôs whisky revival, http://misswhisky.com/tag/london-distillery-company/First whisky in 100 years to be made in London, http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/first- whisky-in-100-years-to-be-made-in-london-1-2363596 Legacy Britain led the world in the development of canals, bridges and tunnels which acted as a stimulus for the Industrial Revolution by facilitating the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods. Ralph Dodd cannot claim to have been the greatest of technical engineers but his ideas and entrepreneurial flair led to the construction of many important British landmarks, including Vauxhall Bridge in London. Ralph Dodd, with his work on the Gravesend to Tilbury tunnel, the Grand Surrey Canal and London Waterworks, paved the way for the civil engineers who followed, such as his sons whom carried out much work on their own account, John Rennie, George Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Dodd was farsighted in realising that the individual canals and waterways being built would eventually be joined together, and later forge the way for railways inspiring a new generation of civil engineers.

Exnora International is a non-governmental environmental service organization started in 1989 in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, by M. B. Nirmal, a social activist. It focuses on preserving nature and preventing environmental degradation. The name Exnora is derived from excellent, novel and radical ideas in solving environmental problems by involving those who caused the problem. It is an example of a people, public, private (PPP) partnership.  History  Prior to the formation of Exnora, the Pammal town near Chennai was under served by the local corporation in terms of MSW collection. M.B. Nirmal and a group of local residents created awareness in the neighborhood regarding the important of appropriate waste management. They set up a model where they collected monthly user fees from the households and employed waste pickers to collect and clear the MSW. The Pammal Municipal Corporation (PMC) encouraged Exnora as their fee-based model helped address MSW management in under served areas. At this time they took up the name Exnora Green Pammal. And Exnora grew to collect and manage 16.5 tonnes per day (TPD) of waste generated in Pammal. The PMC collects the balance 18.5 TPD of the total 35 TPD MSW generated by Pammal. PepsiCo also noticed Exnora and partnered with it as part of its corporate social responsibility program on solid waste management. The Zero Waste Management (ZWM) project started by educating households on the importance and benefits of waste segregation. It facilitated the recycling of all recyclable MSW and set up vermicomposting for the organic waste through a Zero Solid Waste Center. This project achieved 97% household MSW recycling and earned the Exnora-PepsiCo partnership a Golden Peacock Award for Innovation in 2006 and a UNICEF Model Project citation in 2008. UNICEF also published a best practices booklet of Exnora's MSW management model and success in five locations in Tamil Nadu. The aim of the booklet was to have other municipal corporations and urban local bodies replicate Exnora's activities in their cities. Activities The organization provides street cleaning services through about 17,000 street chapters, 40% of Chennai city and 75% of the suburbs, and some other parts of Tamil Nadu. The street cleaning service includes collection of garbage at homes, sorting at pickup, composting organic waste, and generating income for the \\"street beautifiers\\" through the sale of recyclables. The chapters also work with the local corporations and municipalities to address civic problems including sewage leaks, water supply problems, and repairs to street lamps. The organization's Environmental Training Institute conducts training programmes for school teachers on environmental issues such as biodiversity, climate change, and solid, liquid and zero waste management. The teachers are taught how to turn a home into a green building and set up vertical gardens.

An early animal rights activist, he promoted vegetarianism and founded the Animals' Friend Society with Lewis Gompertz. He published pamphlets on a wide variety of subjects, including morality, Pythagorean philosophy, bird migration, Sati, and \\"phrenology\\", a term that he coined in 1815. Life Forster was born in London, the eldest son of Thomas Furly Forster of Walthamstow who was a botanist, and follower of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He did not have the conventional classical literary education, but learned some science from his uncle Benjamin Meggot Forster. The Great Comet of 1811 aroused his interest in astronomy, a science which he continued to pursue, and eight years later, on 3 July 1819, he himself discovered a new comet. He declined a fellowship to the Royal Society in 1816 as he disliked some of the rules. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in order to study law, but soon abandoned it to study medicine, taking his degree in 1819. Two years before, he had married Julia, daughter of Colonel Mark Beaufoy, and taken up residence at Spa Lodge, Tunbridge Wells. After the birth of his only daughter he moved to Hartwell in Sussex, and then spent three years abroad. During the 1820s, he converted to Roman Catholicism. After his return to England he became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and helped to found a meteorological society along with Sir Richard Phillips, which had only a brief existence. After his father's death in 1825, he took up his residence in Chelmsford in order to be near his daughter, then a pupil at Newhall Convent. Here he undertook a series of researches on the influence of atmospheric conditions on diseases, and particularly on cholera which also involved a balloon ascent in April 1831. In 1833 he again went abroad, where he spent most of his remaining years, settling finally in Bruges. He continued writing during the latter part of his life, including poetry. He also composed selections for the violin. He numbered among his friends authors and scholars of his time, such as Thomas Gray, Richard Porson, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Thomas Love Peacock, William Herschel, and William Whewell. He became a vegetarian, following a Pythagorean diet, and along with Lewis Gompertz, founded the Animals' Friend Society in 1833.Tristram Stuart, The Bloodless Revolution, W. W. Norton & Company, 2006, pp. 374-375. Forster lived in Bruges from 1842 until 1852. He then moved to Brussels, where he died. Works In 1805 Forster had compiled a \\"Journal of the Weather\\" and had published his Liber Rerum Naturalium. In 1806, inspired by Gall's works, he took up the study of phrenology. Later he met Johann Spurzheim, and studied with him the anatomy and physiology of the brain. Forster accompanied Spurzheim to Edinburgh, where he communicated a paper on the comparative anatomy of the brain to the Wernerian Society. On his return to London he published a sketch of Gall and Spurzheim's system, which, like many of his writings, appeared in the Pamphleteer, together with an essay on the application of the organology of the brain to education. He coined the term \\"Phrenology\\" in 1815. Forster was influenced by John Abernethy under whom he studied surgery. Abernethy believed in diet as being key to health and Forster in his 1813 In 1813, Forster published his Physiological Reflections on the Destructive Operation of Spiritous and Fermented Liquors on the Animal System where he traced his vegetarianism to Italian renaissance writing, Pythagorean ideas on the transmigration of the soul, cruelty to animals, and Hindu practices. He also influenced Shelley's conversion to vegetarianism. His observations and studies in Continental Europe led to the publication, in 1824, of his \\"Perennial Calendar\\". In 1830 he collected and published the letters of John Locke, Shaftesbury, and Algernon Sydney which he inherited from Benjamin Furly.

He is better known as the uncle of Maharajah Padmanabha Dasa Vanchi Pala Marthanda Varma Kulasekhara Perumal, the \\"maker of modern Travancore\\". He was born into the Royal Family of Kolathunadu, as the second son of Rajah Ittamar of Thattari Kovilakam (who in turn belonged to the Parappanadu Royal Family). It was princes from the Parappanadu family who customarily married Kolathunadu princesses. Rama Varma's entire family, including himself, two sisters and his elder brother Unni Kerala Varma, were adopted into the Venad house as members of the Travancore Royal Family by Rajah Ravi Varma, nephew of Umayamma Rani due to the failure of heirs there. Ittammar Raja's sister and her sons, Rama Varma and Raghava Varma (who were descendants of Parappanadu due to marumakkathayam), settled in Kilimanoor and married the now adopted sisters. Of the adopted sisters, one died soon after her adoption while the other was the mother of the Maharajah Marthanda Varma. Reign Rajah Rama Varma was a weak ruler during whose reign the Ettuveetil Pillamar, the Ettara Yogam and other nobles had more power than the King himself, as had been the case since the middle of the 17th century. However, on the advice of Marthanda Varma, the Rajah signed a treaty of subordination with the Pandyas at Trichonopoly and secured a Pandyan force in Venad. This frightened the disloyal nobles for sometime, who now, however, turned their attention towards killing Marthanda Varma, the heir apparent under the Marumakkathayam law. Previously, the Ettuveetil Pillamar had been responsible for the assassination of prince Kerala Varma. The Kunju Thampimar The Rajah Rama Varma had married a Bengali lady known as Abhirami alias Shrimathi Avirama Kochamma from whom he had issue, two sons, Padmanabhan and Raman Thampi, known as the Kunju Thampimar and a daughter Ummini Thankachi. On the demise of the Rajah in 1729, Maharajah Marthanda Varma succeeded to the throne under the Marumakkathayam law of inheritance. The succession of their cousin to their father's throne irked the Kunju Thampimar who allied themselves with the Ettuveetil Pillamar, Marthanda Varma's foes. On their instigation, the Thampi brothers proceeded to Trichonopoly and succeeded in making the Pandyan government there believe that Marthanda Varma was a usurper and that they were the rightful heirs to the throne of Venad. The Pandyan Government deputed a Commander known as Azhagappa Mudaliar to install the Kunju Thampimar in Venad and punish Marthanda Varma. However the Mudaliar was bribed by the King, and the Thampi brothers were severely reprimanded for their actions. Soon after this, in 1733, the Thampi brothers made a visit to their cousin while he was at Nagercoil Palace where they were both killed by Marthanda Varma. While the traditional accounts state that they attempted to assassinate Marthanda Varma and were hence killed, it is not clear as to why their sister Ummini Thankachi was also killed by Marthanda Varma. There is also another local legend that she committed suicide following the killings of her brothers. Thus the sons of Rajah Rama Varma were vanquished and Marthanda Varma became the Rajah of Venad which he expanded into modern Travancore. References * Travancore State Manual by V.

In 2001, he exhibited his work at the 49th edition of the Venice Biennale Contemporary Arts.  Works  The painting of Guerdy J. Preval, according to the art historian Carlo A. C√©lius, \\"manifests [‚Ä¶] a passion for beautiful shapes, bright colors, a drawing virtuosity and skill in a spatial environment, which, however, never form a pure formalism.\\" Indeed, there is in the painting of Pr√©val a permanent tension between the figurative and the abstract, which aims only toward one objective: to break with a certain classicism. There are so many moments that troubled areas are deaf or silent. Sometimes, they try to identify the principles of strength and fragility of humans. Sometimes, they evoke historical event of the home country, in particular. These echoes of a scarred land, Haiti, are major contributors to the aesthetics of Preval. However, Pr√©val remains \\"a painter of the body.\\" \\"It's on the body, according to Carlo A. C√©lius that prove two other main characteristics of his work: eroticism and dreamlike, the first as format and the second as layout. The body, mostly female, erotic in its posture, its forms, symbols and situations associated suggested rises, acts, moves into a dreamy space‚Ä¶ \\" He had the privilege of exhibiting, in solo and group exhibitions, his work around the world, especially in Hong Kong, Paris, Venice, Rome, Montreal, Toronto, New York City, Miami, Boston, Santo Domingo, Port-au-Prince and Lagos. His works are included in several publications, including the Canadian guide to visual arts, Le Guide Vall√©e. In addition, Guerdy Jacques Preval is pursuing research on the popular Haitian cultural expressions that he regularly publishes in the form of books and articles. The artist, who still lives in Montreal after several attempts to return home, has won several awards and grants to support his creativity from both federal and provincial levels of the Canadian government.

It is also a parasympathomimetic acetylcholine precursor which has been investigated for its potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Alpha-GPC rapidly delivers choline to the brain across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and is a biosynthetic precursor of acetylcholine. It is a non-prescription drug in most countries. The FDA determined that intake of no more than 196.2 mg/person/day is considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Research An Italian multicentre clinical trial on 2,044 patients suffering from recent stroke were supplied alpha-GPC in doses of 1,000 mg/day for 28 days and 400 mg three times per day for the five ensuing months. The trial confirmed the therapeutic role of alpha-GPC on the cognitive recovery of patients based on four measurement scales (Mathew Scale (MS), Mini Mental State Test (MMST), Crichton Rating Scale (CRS) and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)) three of which reached statistical significance. In trials utilizing alpha-GPC in vascular dementia, alpha-GPC administration was reported to improve performance on psychometric tests and to be well tolerated. Small scale studies focusing on the effects of alpha-GPC on physical performance have also reported that alpha-GPC supplementation can increase maximum power and velocity in specified tests (counter-movement jump test) and increase lower body force (isometric mid- thigh pull test). In iron deficient women, alpha-GPC supplementation has also been reported to enhance non-heme iron uptake from dietary sources.  Production  Industrially, alpha-GPC is produced by the chemical or enzymatic deacylation of phosphatidylcholine enriched soya phospholipids followed by chromatographic purification. Alpha-GPC may also be derived in small amounts from highly purified soy lecithin as well from purified sunflower lecithin.

Biography Francesco Denza was born on June 7, 1834 in Naples. He joined the Barnabites at the age of sixteen, and during his theological course at Rome studied at the same time meteorology and astronomy under Father Angelo Secchi. From 1856 until 1890 he was attached to the Barnabite college at Moncalieri where he became widely known for his work in meteorology, a science which he advanced not merely by his personal observations and studies but also by the interest which he roused in it throughout Italy. In 1859 Denza founded the Bullettino mensile di Meteorolgia (Monthly Bulletin of Meteorology), which was continued until 1894, and established a meteorological observatory at Moncalieri; it was largely through his influence that similar observatories, more than 200 in number, were gradually built in various parts of Italy. The success which attended his efforts gave him a national reputation, and in 1866 Senator Matteucci and Signor Berti, minister of public instruction, urged him to take charge of the department of meteorology at Florence. Denza did not accept the post, but in the following year, at Berti's invitation, he read a paper on meteors at the \\"Instituto Superiore\\" in Florence. In 1872 he began a series of researches on terrestrial magnetism with special reference to magnetic declination, which illness, however, prevented him from completing. In 1883 the Duke of Aosta invited him to take charge of the scientific education of his three sons. In the same year he was director of the literary and scientific section of the National Exposition at Turin and chairman of its jury of awards. He represented Leo XIII in 1884 at the Congress of Scientific Societies of France, presiding over the meteorological section. He visited England and the Netherlands on this occasion. He likewise represented the pope at the Paris astronomical congress of 1887, when the plan was formulated of making a photographic map of all the stars in the heavens down to the fourteenth magnitude; through his influence the Vatican Observatory was one of the eighteen chosen to carry out this important project. Denza was appointed director of the Vatican Observatory in September, 1890, and thenceforth lived at the Vatican. Here he inaugurated the work of this observatory in stellar photography. At the time of his death, which was due to apoplexy, he was President of the Accademia dei Nuovi Lincei.

Cornplanter (September 16, 1889 ‚Äì March 18, 1957) was an actor, artist, author, craftsman, Seneca Faithkeeper and World War I decorated veteran. The last male descendant of Cornplanter, an important 18th-century Haudenosaunee leader and war chief, his Seneca name was Hayonhwonhish. He illustrated several books about Seneca and Iroquois life. Jesse Cornplanter wrote and illustrated Legends of the Longhouse (1938), which records many Iroquois traditional stories. Cornplanter was also the first Native American to play a lead in a feature film titled Hiawatha, which was released in 1913 and a year before the notable Western The Squaw Man. Personal Jesse Cornplanter was born in 1889 to Seneca parents Nancy Jack and Edward Cornplanter on the Cattaraugus Reservation in New York. His mother was of the Snipe Clan of the Tonawanda and the matrilineal traditions of the tribe passed the Snipe Clan designation to the children. He had six sisters and three brothers, but because of childhood diseases, only two of his sisters survived, Carrie and Anna, until 1918 when Carrie perished. He was the last male direct descendant of Cornplanter, a renowned Seneca war chief during and after the American Revolutionary War. Although his formal education never progressed past the third grade, his knowledge of Seneca customs, songs and rituals made him a popular resource on Seneca information, sought both from within and also outside the tribe. During World War I, Cornplanter enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1917 and served in Europe until honorably discharged in 1919. He was wounded during the war and received the Purple Heart. While he was serving in the war, his father died. This was followed by the deaths of most of his remaining family in the 1918 flu pandemic, including his mother Nancy, sister Carrie, and nieces and nephews. Only his sister Anna and two orphaned children of Carrie survived. Cornplanter helped support and rear the surviving children upon his return from Europe.Bulletin of the New York State Museum, 1920. Section: \\"Death of Chief Edward Cornplanter,\\" pages 104 and 105. After the war, Cornplanter held many respected positions within his tribe. These included the ceremonial chief of the Long House and the chief of New Town, a traditional village. He sang for the Great Feather Dancer and was head singer for many ceremonies. Cornplanter was married to Elsina Billy (Seneca name Yoweh'sonh) of the Beaver Clan of the Tonawanda. Because Jesse Cornplanter left no heirs, his death in 1957 marked the official expiration of a treaty granting Cornplanter's heirs a perpetual Pennsylvania land grant, called the Cornplanter Tract, of about 1500 acres along the Allegheny River. Much of this land was submerged by the Allegheny Reservoir after completion of the Kinzua Dam in 1965. The US Army Corps of Engineers acquired the land and built the dam for flood control, hydropower and recreation. This was in addition to 10,000 acres along the Allegheny River the COE took by right of eminent domain from the Seneca Nation. Actor silent film Hiawatha (1913) In 1906, Cornplanter accompanied his father Edward, acting and singing in the Hiawatha pageant for many months. His travels with the troop also took him to England and Europe where his performances were favorably noted. He also played the part of Hiawatha in Frank E. Moore's silent film Hiawatha, released in 1913. The feature film is stated to be the first to include Native Americans in the cast, and was looked upon favorably when compared to other contemporary Hollywood films portraying Native Americans. Moving Picture News called Cornplanter, \\"a real matinee idol.\\" Artwork When Cornplanter was only in his teens, he was already gaining recognition for his skillful portrayals of his tribe. He never received formal art training, but became successful as an artist. Arthur C. Parker (Seneca), later Director of the Rochester Museum, commissioned Cornplanter as a youth to sketch scenes of contemporary Seneca life. This launched an eight-year collaboration between the two starting in 1901.Painting. The Iroquois Museum. (12 Feb 2009). Forty-six of Cornplanter's drawings are in collection SC12845 at the New York State Library. Wooden carved mask by Jesse Cornplanter (1936) Frederick Starr commissioned Cornplanter to illustrate Iroquois Indian Games and Dances (c. 1903), a book of sketches depicting rituals, dances and games of Iroquois life. The young artist was credited as illustrator on the book's cover as \\"Jesse Cornplanter, Seneca Indian Boy\\". In selecting the 12 year old Cornplanter for the commission, Starr recognized the talent of the artist in showing, \\"firmness of line, boldness, and good skill in grouping\\" in his drawings. The proceeds from sales of Jesse's illustrations were used to produce and award the Cornplanter Medal every two years to a person best contributing to the research and knowledge of the Iroquois. He illustrated The Code of Handsome Lake, a manuscript collaborated between his father, Edward Cornplanter (Seneca name Sosondowah), and Arthur C. Parker. Cornplanter also wrote and illustrated his own book, Legends of the Longhouse, published in 1938. Spoon-Lipped Door keeper Mask by Jesse Cornplanter (1936) His paintings are considered to be in the Iroquois Realist Style. This tradition dates to the 1820s work by brothers, David and Dennis Cusick (Tuscarora). Although best known for his illustrations, Cornplanter was also a traditional wood carver. He greatly influenced successive generations of Haudenosaunee artists. Bibliography *Cornplanter, Jesse J. (Of The Senecas), Told To Sah-Nee-Weh, Legends of the Longhouse. Philadelphia: J. B.

Biography Dodge was born around 1860 near (Fort Defiance) into the clan; his father was (Juan Anaya) of Mexican ancestry, Juan Anaya had been captured by the Navajos on one of their many raids and had been raised by them.' (obituary), √Ådahoon√≠≈Ç√≠g√≠√≠. February 1, 1947. Vol.2 No.4. There was speculation that he was born three years earlier and was the son of the US Indian Agent Henry L. Dodge at the Navajo Agency. The senior Dodge was known in Navajo as . This question was finally settled by historian David M. Brugge, in an essay titled \\"Henry Chee Dodge: From the Long Walk to Self Determination,\\" who reported that, in 1875, Augustus C. Dodge, who was Henry L. Dodge's brother, revealed that he had an eighteen-year-old nephew, the son of a Navajo woman and his brother, who lived at Fort Defiance. During the Long Walk of 1864, Dodge got separated from his mother, and was taken in as an orphan by a family who found him wandering around. He was raised by his aunt. As his step-uncle was Anglo-American, the young Chee quickly became fluent in English. Chee Dodge eventually replaced Jesus Arviso as the official Navajo interpreter to the U.S. military. In 1883, Dodge was hired as head of the Navajo Tribal Police. A year later, he was appointed \\"Head Chief of the Navajo\\" by the Bureau of Indian AffairsWilkins, David E. The Navajo Political Experience. Din√© College Press. /Tsaile, AZ: 1999. -- a position and title that had no basis in traditional Navajo concepts of governance. He was presented to the people as \\"\\". Appointed as the first chairman of the Navajo Business Council in 1922, Dodge managed to secure over one million dollars in royalties for the Navajo Nation related to mineral rights on their lands. He gave in to demands to give oil-drilling rights to Anglo-companies. Most Navajo were unaware of the council's functions. Critics said that it was simply to rubber-stamp the decisions of the local Indian commissioner of the Burea of Indian Affairs. Under the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, Dodge and many other members of federally recognized tribes were granted United States citizenship. Prior to that, members of tribes on sovereign reservations were not considered citizens. In 1942, Dodge was elected as chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council and served until 1946. During his tenure, he lobbied for improved education opportunities for Navajo children, and traveled to Washington to convince the Federal Government to secure more funding.Iverson, Peter. \\"For our Navajo people\\": Din√© letters, speeches & petitions, 1900-1960. University of New Mexico Press. Albuquerque, NM: 2002. In the subsequent election of 1946, Dodge was chosen as vice- chairman. He died in January 1947 at the age of 86 or 87 before the sixth Tribal Council convened and he could take office. Zhealy Tso was appointed Vice-Chairman in his stead. Dodge passed away in his sleep from pneumonia at Sage Memorial Hospital in Ganado, Arizona in the early morning of January 7, 1947.

After that, the R&B; group Boyz II Men performed the U.S. anthem. The presentation of the medals in the Men's Marathon followed. Unlike in previous closing ceremonies, the final lap of the race occurred earlier in the morning rather than part of, or immediately before, the gala due to the hot and humid weather conditions of the afternoon. Josia Thugwane of South Africa, Lee Bong-Ju of South Korea, and Erick Wainaina of Kenya won the gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively. Reach The spectators and athletes then performed a card trick stunt which revealed a laurel wreath similar to the Quilt of Leaves pattern. Members of the Morehouse College Glee Club performed \\"Faster, High, Stronger\\". Cuban singer Gloria Estefan then joined the Glee Club and they performed the song \\"Reach\\", one of the official songs of the Atlanta Olympic Games. Next a plethora of BMX bikers, skaters, and skateboarders performed a daring stunt show; such aforementioned sports were invented in the United States. As the show concluded, the 197 flags of the participating nations were carried into the stadium by athletes of each of their respective countries. The song \\"The Sacred Truce\\", written exclusively for the occasion, was performed by the Atlanta Olympic Band and the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra. In keeping with tradition with the 1920 Summer Olympics, the flag of a hosting nation (in this case the American flag) was raised beside the Olympic flag that had been flying inside the stadium the past 16 days. Sydney 2000 In accordance with the Olympic Charter which governs the Closing Ceremony, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch called on the youth of the world to assemble in Sydney, in four years, for the next Summer Olympics. In his speech, he denounced the Centennial Olympic Park bombing stating that terrorism cannot stop the Olympic spirit. Samaranch asked for a moment of silence to remember the victims of the bombing, as well as the 11 Israeli athletes of the Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics. He said that those tragedies will never be forgotten and said: Although this was first official IOC recognition of the Munich tragedy since 1972, commentators mentioned 1972 quite often, mainly because the next Olympics were taking place in Nagano, Japan and Japan last hosted an Olympics that year, hosting the Winter Games in Sapporo. Furthermore, Samaranch thanked Atlanta with the phrase \\"Well done, Atlanta\\", and calling them \\"most exceptional.\\" He broke with precedent and did not say they had been the best Olympics ever, as he did at every previous Olympic closing ceremony while he was IOC president. However, 4 years later he called the Sydney Olympics the best ever, suggesting that this was an intentional omission 4 years earlier. Before Samaranch declared the games officially closed, R&B; singer Stevie Wonder sang a cover of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" in memory of the victims of the Cenntennial Olympic Park bombing. This part of the program culminated in the \\"Antwerp Ceremony\\" (so called because the original Olympic flag, which was used for transfer of the Games, was first used at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp), which is the transfer of the Olympic Flag, from the mayor of Atlanta, Bill Campbell, to Samaranch, and then to the mayor of Sydney, Frank Sartor. Immediately succeeding the transition, an elaborate presentation of the host city Sydney commenced. It featured many dancers dressed up as aborigines, plants, and animals native to Australia. Four inflated balloons arose to form an imaginary Sydney Opera House while more dancers ran around to form the sea. Afterwards, Atlanta native mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore, along with the Morehouse College Glee Club and the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra sang the Olympic Hymn while the Olympic flag was lowered. This flag would be raised again in Nagano during the opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Olympics; opening ceremony there took place on February 7, 1998. Power of the Dream After the lowering of the Olympic flag and the singing of the Olympic Hymn, some 600 children from Atlanta ranging from ages six though twelve sang a rendition of \\"The Power of the Dream\\", which was performed by Celine Dion in the opening ceremony. The segment started with ten-year-old Rachel McMullin singing the first stanza. As the song progresses more children join in creating a full choir. The children line up and hold hands to form the Atlantic Olympic emblem while holding up flashlights. The spectators and athletes then sing and hold hands in unison. At the end of the song, the children shout in unison, \\"Y'all come back now!\\" a friendly gesture inviting the athletes and citizens of the world to come together at Sydney four years from that time period, though the next Olympics would happen 18 months afterward in Nagano, Japan, Olympic customs and regulations maintain that the Olympic Winter Games and the Games of the Olympiad (Summer) are separate events. Extinguishing of the Flame Highlights of the past events were once more replayed on two jumbotrons in the stadium as the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra performs \\"The Flame\\". The crowd was silenced, as Georgia native and country singer Trisha Yearwood sang an a cappella version of the same song. Upon conclusion of the song, the flame extinguished slowly. Musical finale The ceremony concluded with an all- star tribute to American popular music. A New Orleans-style funeral commenced the segment which eventually turns into a celebration with elaborate swing music. An array of performers culminated in the finale which was led by Late Show's Paul Shaffer, and conductor Harold Wheeler. As with most closing ceremonies, the athletes were invited onto the field below the stadium to sing and dance along with the music. Among the performers were: *Gloria Estefan *Sheila E. *Faith Hill *B.B. King *Wynton Marsalis *Little Richard *Pointer Sisters *Tito Puente *Buckwheat Zydeco *Stevie Wonder A fireworks display officially closed the segment, though the performers continued to play music.

He was one of the last indigenous rulers to resist the Argentine Conquest of the Desert in the late 19th century and its resultant campaigns. He did not surrender until 1884. His hospitality to Francisco Moreno during the explorer's 1880 expedition to Patagonia was recalled after his surrender, which was covered by the press.

It is found on the seaward side of mangrove swamps, often in the company of Rhizophora. It grows from the Western Pacific across Indian Ocean coasts to Cape Province, South Africa. Description A tree that can grow up to 35m, though usually smaller, around 7-20m, it has a glabrous, smoothish, trunk with reddish brown bark (the bark is sometimes fibrous, sometimes lightish brown or grey). The tree develops short prop-roots rather than long stilt-roots. The green elliptic leaves are 5-15cm long. Flowers are solitary, with white or cream petals, that soon turn brown up to 1.5cm long, pinkish-green to reddish brown calyx. The fruit are turbinate (spinning-top shaped), 2cm long, when mature, the spindle-shaped fruits drop and become embedded in the mud in an upright position, where they rapidly develop roots. The seeds, when still on tree, have a hypocotyl up to 11cm long. Bruguiera gymnorhiza Distribution The tree is found as a native on the coasts of places bordering the Indian Ocean, the South China Sea, and parts of the western Pacific Ocean. Regions that it is native to include: Caroline Island, Samoa, Tonga, Wallis and Futuna, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Gilbert Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Queensland, New Guinea, Northern Territory, Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi, Nansei-shoto, Borneo, Jawa, Hainan, Christmas Island, Southeast China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Sumatera, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nicobar Islands, Andaman Islands, India (including Andhra Pradesh), Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Aldabra, Seychelles, Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya, Mozambique Channel Islands, Tanzania, Mozambique, KwaZulu-Natal, Cape Provinces. It has become extinct in Taiwan, and is naturalized in Florida Habitat The tree grows on intertidal mud-flats and estuaries, 0-2m (the elevation range between mean sea level and highest tide), on the less exposed parts of the coast, with a rainfall of 1000-8000mm. Common associates on Pacific Island include other mangrove speices. The species grows on a wide range of soils, but does best in river estuaries, Salt water habitats on an alluvial sediment allows the tree to spread with its adventitious roots. The black mangrove is a protected tree in South Africa. Names As well as its botanical name, the tree is known by many common, or vernacular names. These include: ; Marshall Islands jon; Kosrae sraol; Pohnpei sohmw; Chuuk ong; Yap yangach; northern Australia orange mangrove; Wanigela, Northern (Oro) Province, Papua New Guinea kavela, mangrove bean.; Thyanhngayth dialect, Awngthim language nhomb; Sapek people, Supiori, Papua Province, Indonesia arouw Batjamal benmerr; Emi kunyme; Palau denges; ; ; ; Yue Chinese Êú®Ê¨ñ; Khmer pr√¢sak' nhi, pr√¢sak' toch, pr√¢sak' t√ºk; ; ; Telugu (Andhra Pradesh) thuddu ponna, uredi; ; Maldives bodu ka·πá·∏ç≈´, boda vaki.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom, Barcelona 1999, .; Kiswahili (Kenya, Tanzania, including Zanzibar, Mozambique) muia, mkoko wimbi; ; ; ; South African English black mangrove; English large- leafed mangrove, oriental mangrove; ; Uses A major use of the tree is for wood products. Its uses in agroforestry include a woodlot, mulch/organic matter production, soil stabilization, coastal protection, windbreak, wildlife/marine food and habitat and bee forage. The wood is widely used, including for firewood, building construction (including structural components such as poles, beams and rafters), canoe parts, fishingstakes, spears, copra- huskers, chips for pulp production, tool handles and digging sticks. In the Andaman Islands the trunks have been used for telephone and transmission poles, it seems rot-resistant (i.e. durable in direct contact with the ground). The wood has a high calorific values, and is used as fuel on some Pacific Islands (e.g. Kosrae), and for charcoal production in Indonesia, and Cambodia. In the Marshall Islands, it has been used for keel-pieces (maal), outrigger (kie'), and outrigger struts (kein-eon erre). Paddles are also made from the wood on some islands. The fruit (propagule/hypocotyl) is reported as being eaten after scraping/grating, washing, drying and cooking to remove tannins, and sometimes mixed with coconut in Melanesia and Nauru. The fruit is sold as a vegetable at Honiara Market, Solomon Islands. For the Sowek people, living on Supiori Island, Papua Province, Indonesia, the fruit is a staple, or primary food, of their diet, due to its high carbohydrate content. The bark is used as an abortifacient and for treating burns in the Solomon Islands. The bark is reportedd to be used for diarrhoea and fever in Indonesia. The astringent (and mildly toxic) bark has also been used to treat malaria in Cambodia. The fruits has antiviral properties, and bark extracts of the closely related Bruguiera sexangula are reportedly active against at least two types of cancerous tumors (Sarcoma 180 and Lewis lung carcinoma). The bark is used for dying, with colours ranging from red-brown to black (requires repeated dying). For working with leather, the bark has a high tannin content, but tends to colour excessively unless collected \\"at the end of each growing season\\". The green propagules/hypocotyl are also eaten by many Indigenous groups in northern Australia. For example, on northwestern Cape York Peninsula, in the Weipa region, Thaynakwithi people (also referred to as Thyanhngayth dialect, Awngthim language people) call the species nhomb and explain that the propagules could be baked, then mashed or pounded and the flesh placed into a sieve-like woven bag before being soaked in water Amongst the people of Wanigela, Northern (Oro) Province, in southeastern Papua New Guinea, the cooked hypocotyls are eaten, providing one of their staples, and used in the ethnomedicine as antimicrobial and insecticidal. The Batjamal and Emi speaker of the Wadjiginy language, who live near Anson Bay in the Northern Territory, Australia, use the durable and hard wood to make spear tips (batjagada [Batjama], ijinde [Emi], with a Bambusa arnhemica shaft. The reddish fine-textured wood used for local building in Cambodia, such constructions as huts, wharfs, fences, and fishery structures. Charcoal from the wood is excellent. The bark is used to dye fishing nets, and to tan animal skins. A decoction of the bark is taken in to combat diarrhoea. There is evidence of the hypocotyls being eaten in India, Bangladesh, and other parts of Southeast Asia. In the Maldives the propagules or green pods are eaten as a cooked vegetable. They are peeled first and then boiled, the water being discarded and renewed at least four times. The propagules of this species are more appreciated than those of Bruguiera cylindrica.

It was immediately subject to the Holy See. In 1986 the diocese of Cortona was united with the Diocese of Sansepolcro and the Diocese of Arezzo to form the diocese of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro. It became a suffragan (subordinate) diocese of the Metropolitan archdiocese of Florence.\\"Diocese of Cortona\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Diocese of Cortona\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 History Ancient Cortona was one of the twelve cities of Etruria. In the 6th century it was destroyed by the Lombards but was soon rebuilt. From that time until 1325 the city and its territory were assigned ecclesiastically to the Diocese of Arezzo. At the beginning of the 14th century, however, Arezzo and Cortona were still involved in the struggles between the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. Arezzo was Ghibelline in allegiance, supporting the emperor; Cortona, which had been conquered by Arezzo in 1258, was Guelf, and supported the papal states. In Arezzo, two aristocratic factions contended for domination, the Verdi and the Secchi, and when the latter gained control they had their leader, Guido Tarlati of the castle of Petramala, elected bishop of Arezzo. He embarked on an activist program, building a wall around the city, and creating a new silver and copper currency. His program also included military conquest: Lusignano, Chiusi, Fronzoli, Castel Focognano, Rondina, Bucine, Caprese, Lacerina, and Monte Sansovino. This expansionist activity greatly alarmed both the Florentines and Pope John XXII, who, though safely settled in Avignon, feared for the loss of church territories and the threat to the papal states. He determined to take action against Bishop Guido, who was paying no attention to his angry protests. Bishop Guido was deposed from the episcopal seat of Arezzo before Pope John XXII created the diocese of Cortona on 19 June 1325. Bullarium, p. 314 column 1: \\"et illa penes eam plene et integraliter volentes perpetuo remanere: conventiones et pacta dudum habita inter Guidonem, tunc episcopum Aretinum, et commune ac populum civitatis Cortonen.\\" Giovanni Villani, Cronica Book X, chapter 11, speaks of his deposition. In the year 1325, at the request of Guglielmo Casali, Captain (Gonfaloniere) of the People of Cortona, Pope John XXII raised Cortona to episcopal rank, as a reward for the fidelity of its Guelph populace.Mancini, p. 97. Bullarum diplomatum IV, p. 313 column 1: \\"universitas Cortonae, quae hactenus de Aretina dioecesi existebat, sinistrae parlis non declinat in devium, nec suam ponit cum indevotis eiusdem Ecclesiae portionem, sed prono et prompto animo in eiusdem Ecclesiae obsequium totaliter se exponit.\\" A month later, on 20 July 1325, the Bishop of Arezzo, Guido Tarlati de Petramala, was excommunicated.Beattie, p. 14. Eubel I, p. 104. Bishop Guido was replaced by an Apostolic Administrator, Boso Ubertini, the Provost of Arezzo. In the papal bull, \\"Vigilis speculatoris\\", dated 19 June 1325, Pope John XXII established the new diocese of Cortona by detaching its territory from the diocese of Arezzo. He created the church of S. Vincenzo, which had belonged to the monastery of Ss. Lucilla and Flora, the new cathedral.Mancini, p. 97. Bullarum Diplomatum Vol. IV, pp. 312-315. In a bull of 29 June 1325, the Pope designated Rinaldo di Guido, parish priest of S. Andrea, the new Provost of the cathedral. In another bull, dated 30 June 1325, Pope John established the cathedral Chapter, composed of two dignities (Provost and Archdeacon) and eight Canons.Mancini, p. 97. The current Cathedral of Cortona became the diocesan seat only in 1507. The diocesan seminary was founded by Bishop Francesco Perignani (1572‚Äì1577) in 1573. =Diocesan synods= A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. Bishop Giovanni Alberti (1585‚Äì1596) presided over a diocesan synod in 1588.Comerford, p. 1014. Bishop Cosmo Minerbetto conducted a diocesan synod in Cortona in 1624. A diocesan synod was held in Cortona in August 1634 by Bishop Lorenzo della Robbia. =Suppression of the diocese= On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. In Tuscany, this particularly affected three dioceses: Arezzo, Cortona, and Borgo San Sepolcro (Biturgensis). On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Arezzo, Cortona, and San Sepolcro be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Arretina-Cortonensis-Biturgensis. The seat of the diocese was to be in Arezzo, and the cathedral of Arezzo was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Cortona and San Sepolcro were to become co-cathedrals, and their cathedral Chapters were to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Arezzo, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Cortona and Borgo San Sepolcro.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1987), pp. 654-656.

It is the 47th NHK taiga drama. It aired from January 6 to December 14, 2008, and ran a total of 50 episodes. The drama chronicles the life of Tensh≈ç-in, based on Tomiko Miyao's 1984 novel . Viewership for Atsuhime was high; the series received an average rating of 24.5%, the highest rating received by a taiga drama since Hideyoshi in 1996. Background The taiga drama is based on Tomiko Miyao's novel Tensh≈ç-in Atsuhime. The protagonist is Tensh≈ç-in (Princess Atsu), the wife of Tokugawa Iesada, the thirteenth sh≈çgun of the Edo shogunate. It is the seventh taiga drama to feature a female lead, coming just two years after K≈çmy≈ç ga Tsuji in 2006. Following Yoshitsune in 2005, this is Miyao's second work to be turned into a taiga drama. Following Shinsengumi!, it is also the second taiga drama taking place at the end of the Edo shogunate. The character of Tensh≈ç-in was previously taken up in the 2003 Fuji Television series ≈åoku (starring Kanno Miho). The lead role is performed by Aoi Miyazaki, for which it is her first Taiga drama lead. She is also the youngest to play the lead role. In May 2008, she won a Galaxy Award for her work in this role.Aoi Miyzaki wins Galaxy Award for NHK drama The first half of the story predominantly takes place in Kagoshima prefecture, and as such many of the actors and music coordinators are from Kagoshima.

The novel Tensh≈çin Atsuhime depicts the life of Atsuhime, who had been lost in the flow of history, and was discovered through Miyao's own research.

While meeting his old friends and watching Sakurajima, he was touched by the warmness, toughness, and generosity of the homeland. His deep feelings for his homeland became the basis of the 47 songs created for this drama. *Titling ‚Äì Kinko Kikuchi *Historical research ‚Äì Manabu ≈åishi *Narrator ‚Äì Tomoko Naraoka *Production coordinator ‚Äì Motohiko Sano *Casting ‚Äì Mineyo Sat≈ç The usual procedure of a taiga drama production would have one-third of the expected number of scripts finished before shooting begins. Afterwards, audience reception is taken into account as the rest of the series is written. One of the sources used for an accurate portrayal of Atsuhime and life in the ≈åoku was the , a series of interviews with bakufu officials in the late-19th century. Plot The episodes largely fall into two parts. The first half of the series revolves around Atsuhime's life in Satsuma. The latter half mainly proceeds with the politics around the Tokugawa Shogunate after she moved to Edo to marry Tokugawa Iesada. =Episode 1: Child of Destiny (1/6/2008)= The episode starts off in Satsuma in 1835, 20 years prior to the arrival of the Black Ships led by Matthew C. Perry. People in Satsuma are excited by the arrival of the heir to the domain, Shimazu Nariakira, from Edo. Meanwhile, a long-awaited daughter is born in one of the cadet families of Shimazu clan, the Imaizumi Shimazu family. The father of the girl, Shimazu Tadatake, and the mother, Oyuki, name her \\"Katsu\\", wishing the child's happiness. Okatsu grew up as a tomboy, much stronger than her brothers, yet is warm-hearted and full of curiosity. Before long, the Satsuma Domain picks up its efforts at strict financial reform under the guidance of Kar≈ç Zusho Hirosato. Saig≈ç Kichinosuke (Saig≈ç Takamori), witnessing the farmers' harsh life, appeals to Tadatake. Hirosato receives this news and punishes Tadatake for allowing farmers to express their dissent, for it suggests lenient treatment of farmers on Tadatake's part. Okatsu, unable to comprehend Hirosato's action of punishing those who support farmers, recklessly decides to charge over to Hirosato's house with her close friend Kimotsuke Naogor≈ç (Komatsu Tatewaki) to demand a reason. =Episode 2: Vow at Sakurajima (1/13/2008)= By restraining himself and devoting his effort to the domain's financial reform, Tadatake manages to avoid punishment. With Kar≈ç Zusho Hirosato's reform steadily gaining results, the domain's debt, which at one point reached 5 million Ry≈ç (Japanese coin), is cleared. Meanwhile, the lives of farmers and samurai become extremely difficult, and their plight fuels animosity among young samurai like Saig≈ç Kichnosuke and ≈åkubo Sh≈çsuke (≈åkubo Toshimichi) toward Daimy≈ç Shimazu Narioki, who employed Zusho and his concubine, Oyura. Amid hostilities, Shimazu Nariakira's children have died one after another. What is more, a doll, supposedly used for a curse, is found under the room of these children. The hatred toward Oyura and Zusho peaks within the domain. With this as a backdrop, Okatsu is invited by Zusho to his house. She visits him with Kimotsuki Naogor≈ç. In his house, Zusho tells Okatsu that he wants to share ideas with her before he goes off to Edo. Subsequently, Zusho goes to Edo but is suspected by R≈çj≈´ Abe Masahiro of illegal trade. To protect Satsuma from repercussions, he kills himself by taking poison. =Episode 3: Satsuma Divide (1/20/2008)= In Satsuma, Oyura‚ÄîNarioki's concubine‚Äîis trying to make her son heir to the clan and antagonizing the group that stood by Nariakira. Okatsu is curious about the domain's politics, but Tadatake chides her that politics is not something children should be involved in. In connection with the family quarrel, ≈åkubo Tadasuke (Toshimichi) is punished by the domain. Okatsu, who heard the news from Naogor≈ç, worries about Tadasuke's family and starts to bring in food to the family from her home. Tadasuke is deeply moved by the kindness of Okatsu, Naogor≈ç, and Saig≈ç. Having seen Tadasuke's sisters busy with their side jobs, Okatsu tries to give her expensive comb and hair ornament to Tadasuke's mother, Fuku. Fuku, however, flatly refuses to accept them. To Okatsu, who is worried if her kindness hurt Fuku, Oyuki explains about the pride of women in Satsuma. Meanwhile, Nariakira, who succeeded as the head of the clan with the help of r≈çj≈´ Abe, enters Satsuma with huge ambitions. =Episode 4: A Wise Lord Angered (1/27/2008)= In the wake of the family quarrel, the new clan head Nariakira arrives at Satsuma from Edo and takes the lead in the reform of rice prices. The group who sided with Tadayuki (Shimazu Hisamitsu) fears how Nariakira is going to punish its members, but he does not punish anybody. Saig≈ç and other young samurai become frustrated because ≈åkubo, who should have been pardoned right away, has not received clemency. Okatsu and Naogor≈ç go over to Komatsu Kiyomichi and Ochika's place and ask about Nariakira's true intention. Kiyomichi, however, says that faith in Nariakira is the only way of loyalty, but this does not convince Okatsu. Meanwhile, Nariakira invites the Imaizumi family to the castle to meet members of branch families. Tadatake subjects Okatsu to practice in a ladylike manner to avoid embarrassment in the meeting. On the day of Okatsu's visit, Okatsu intensely presses Nariakira on why ≈åkubo has not been pardoned. Nariakira, who has a different purpose for the meeting, is amused by Okatsu's honest yet serious attitude and comes to have an interest in her. =Episode 5: The Best Man in Japan (2/3/2008)= Japanese history books have been sent to Okatsu's place from Nariakira. Kikumoto tells Okatsu, who were overjoyed and busily reading the books, that the happiness of women lies in marriage. Meanwhile, Shimazu Tadayuki comes with news to Tadatake that his son fell in love at first sight with Okatsu and that he wants to marry her. Fearing the risk that Nariakira might misunderstand the connection between his family and Tadayuki's family, Tadatake, however, could not view the marriage proposal in a positive light. Naogor≈ç, who heard the story from Tadayuki, is gravely shaken. He asks Okatsu her thoughts on marriage, but she only tells him that she wishes to marry the best man in Japan. In the meantime, John Manjir≈ç, who has just returned from the US, is invited to Satsuma. Naogor≈ç meets him and is inspired by his story that marriage in the US is based on the agreement between the individuals, unlike in Japan, where it is decided by the two families. This gives him courage to openly tell Tadatake about his feelings for Okatsu. But the next day finds Tadatake called up to the castle. Against his fear that the proposal news might have reached Nariakira, he is informed of Nariakira's plan for adopting Okatsu. =Episode 6: Women‚Äôs Path (2/10/2008)= Nariakira's plan to adopt Okatsu has stirred Tadatake. Kikumoto, who had raised her since she was little, is overjoyed by this honor. Taken by surprised, Okatsu, however, is hesitant, not knowing what to do. It is only certain that she could not turn down the offer. Naogor≈ç, who has learned the news, grows desperate, for it would be impossible to marry Okatsu once she is adopted. Emotionally charged, he starts to cry at Saig≈ç's home, but Saig≈ç's compassion cheers him up. In the overjoyed Imaizumi family, Oyuki detects strangeness in Kikumoto's behavior. Okatsu, in the meantime, implores Tadatake for permission to have an audience with Nariakira to plead for explanations. On the morning of Okatsu's visit to the castle, Kikumoto presses on Okatsu saying ‚ÄúA woman‚Äôs life is like walking on a long one-way path. It is a dishonor to turn back the path.\\" In response to Okatsu's straightforward question, Nariakira explains that he wants to adopt her because she reminds him of his mother. Having learned his brimming affection for her, Okatsu finally comes to a decision to become his daughter. When she returns home, however, there is news waiting that Kikumoto has killed herself. =Episode 7: The Father's Tears (2/17/2008)= Okatsu is gravely shaken from Kikumoto's taking her own life. What is more, she starts to hold ill feelings for her father, for he got rid of Kikumoto's body as if treating criminals. That night, Okatsu learns from Oyuki that Kikumoto left a will. In it, she wrote that her choice to kill herself was motivated by her wish to erase the blemish that someone of a low status like herself raised Okatsu, who is now facing a bright future. Okatsu realized Kikumoto's considerations and expectations for her future and learned the true meaning of becoming Nariakira's daughter. Meanwhile, news from Nagasaki Dejima comes into Edo that an American naval fleet demanding trade with Japan is approaching. Leaders in the Tokugawa shogunate face difficulty in how it should be dealt. Nariaki supports the sweeping expulsion of foreigners from Japan and does not yield. Facing this, Nariakira comes to a realization the urgency of adopting Okatsu to implement his political scheme in this political turmoil. While the day Okatsu moves to Tsurumaru Castle closes in, Tadatake all of a sudden started to devote himself to constructing batteries for guarding the coastlines, behaving as if he has no interest in the adoption affair. Finally, the day for Okatsu to leave for the castle arrives. =Episode 8: How to be a Princess (2/24/2008)= Okatsu moves into Tsurumaru Castle, but has a hard time fitting into its restrictive customs. She is belittled by Hirokawa and other women serving under her as a girl from a branch family and starts to take a negligent attitude. Okubo Sh≈çsuke is released from the house arrest of three years, and this makes Naogor≈ç and Saig≈ç feel relieved. Okatsu wants to share the joy but feels lonely when she finds herself at a high, distant social rank which prohibits them to even exchange words with her. =Episode 36: Satsuma or Tokugawa (9/7/2008)= While the Edo group and the Ky≈çto group inside the ≈åoku continue to antagonize to each other, little by little Kazunomiya and Iemochi became closer. Tensho- in was finally feeling relieved. Then, commanding a force of a few thousand soldiers, Hisamitsu left for Ky≈çto with the intention of receiving the Emperor's approval for reforming the Tokugawa Sh≈çgunate. Meanwhile, suspicion that Tensh≈ç-in might be involved in the plot mounted in Edo. The message that the Satsuma force headed to Edo reached ≈åoku, and distrust directed to Tensh≈ç- in further deepened. Amid this, even Iemochi, who had been on Tensh≈ç-in's side, came to suspect her. Crushed from everyone's distrust, Tensh≈ç-in started to burn her personal items that she brought with her from Satsuma. Seeing this, Iemochi realized how much she is hurt by his distrust and apologized to her that he would not doubt her from now on. =Episode 37: Parting of Friendship (9/14/2008)= The Satsuma force led by Hisamitsu entered Edo accompanying an Imperial envoy. His aim was to reform the Tokugawa Shogunate. Meanwhile, Tensh≈ç-in was anxious if Tatewaki also came to Edo accompanying Hisamitsu. Against Hisamitsu's wish, the negotiation between the envoy and R≈çj≈´ came to a dead end. Hisamitsu became extremely impatient and ordered ≈åkubo to threaten the R≈çj≈´ side by force. While Tatewaki felt awkward toward such a forceful approach taken by his comrades, Satsuma succeeded in pressing on the reform plan. Tensh≈ç-in, who was upset at Satsuma's cowardly move, sought an audience with Hisamitsu to ascertain his true intentions. With her unsuccessful meeting with Hisamitsu, she failed to exchange words with Tatewaki, who was in the company of Hisamitsu. Regretting this sour reunion with Tatewaki, Tensh≈ç-in asked Iemochi to invite Tatewaki to ≈åoku. Playing igo like when they were still in Satsuma, Tensh≈ç-in and Tatewaki engaged in friendly conversation and promised to each other that each would try their best to defend their own people: the Tokugawa clan for Tensh≈ç-in and the people of Satsuma for Tatewaki. =Episode 38: Heart of the Mother-In-Law, Heart of the Wife (9/21/2008)= A letter from Tatewaki recounting what really took place in Namamugi Incident reached Tensh≈ç-in. Having learned the truth, she maintained that the Shogunate, together with Satsuma, needed to apologize to Britain. Meanwhile, in Kyoto, the Ch≈çsh≈´ group came to dominate the political scene, defeating the Satsuma group and its leaders Shimazu Hisamitsu and Iwakura Tomomi. Amid this confusion, an Imperial Envoy came from Kyoto to Edo, demanding Iemochi to visit the capital and to implement a policy that would exclude foreigners. Upon discussing the matter with Tensh≈ç-in, he made up his mind to tell the emperor in person that the implementation of such a policy would be unattainable. Princess Kazu, however, strongly opposed Iemochi's decision. Sakamoto Ry≈çma visited Katsu Rintar≈ç. Although he initially intended to kill Lintar≈ç, after discussion, he changed his mind and asked Lintar≈ç to become his mentor. In the meantime in Satsuma, Tatewaki got promoted to the position of Kar≈ç. In Edo castle, where Iemochi's departure was looming close, Tensh≈ç-in and Lintaro argued with each other whether Iemochi should take a land route or a sea route. Meanwhile, Kazunomiya, who learned that Tensh≈ç-in pushed Iemochi to visit the capital, came to harbor strong hostility toward Tensh≈ç-in. =Episode 39: Buring Satsuma (9/28/2008)= The news that Sh≈çgun Iemochi arrived at Kyoto came to ≈åoku and lightened her mind. Kazunomiya, on the other hand, worried about Iemochi and became more restless. Her fear became true when radicals led by a Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain group supporting the expulsion of foreigners dominated the Imperial Court in Kyoto. Mired in the quandary, Iemochi was forced to promise to the court the enforcement of expelling foreigners. Tensh≈çin, who blamed herself for urging Iemochi's visit to Kyoto, asked Kazunomiya to convince his brother, Emperor K≈çmei to arrange Iemochi's return to Edo, but Kazunomiya adamantly refused it. Tensh≈çin sent Katsu Kaish≈´ to Iemochi, who fell ill from the exhaustion from the trip to Ky≈çto. Through the conversation with Katsu, Iemochi regained his spirits and learned his board perspective on the matter. In the meantime, Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain carried out the expulsion of foreigners, and word reached Satsuma. Hisamitsu and Tatewaki realized that war was imminent. In Ky≈çto, Iemochi was permitted to return to Edo with Kazunomiya's plea to the emperor. Tensh≈çin expressed her gratitude to Kazunomiya. Then, the news came in that the British Royal Navy staying in Yokohama headed to Satsuma. The Anglo-Satsuma War was about to start. =Episode 40: Son Taking the Field (10/05/08)= Saig≈ç, who had been exiled, came back. At the gathering where Saig≈ç and his old friends reunited, Tatewaki met a geisho, Okoto. The Ch≈çsh≈´ domain, which is bent on regaining its political leverage in the capital, suddenly attacked the Imperial Palace. This is known as the Kinmon Incident. Tatewaki, who led the Satsuma forces, joined forces with the Sh≈çgunate, along with Yoshinobu, and defeat the enemy forces. In the meantime, in ≈åoku, Takiyama advised Tensh≈çin to let the sh≈çgun have a concubine who could bear his heir, for she was purely concerned with the future of the Tokugawa clan and desired to consolidate the foundations of the Shugunate's rule. Tensh≈çin, however, did not want to tear up the intimate relationship between Kazunomiya and Iemochi and flatly rejected the idea. The Naval School established by Katsu Kaish≈´ was about to be shut down by the sh≈çgunate, suffering the repercussions of the Kinmon Incident. Katsu sent his disciple Sakamoto Ry≈çma to Tatewaki, who was the karo of the Satsuma domain, to ask him to take care of the students. Meanwhile, in Edo Castle, Kazunomiya showed signs of pregnancy, and the entire ≈åoku was delighted with the news. Kangy≈çin‚ÄîKazunomiya's mother‚Äîand Tensh≈çin both shared the excitement of expecting a grandchild. As it turned out, however, Kazunomiya's pregnancy proved false.  Atsuhime Travel Sketches is a series of sketches that is assigned to the last few minutes of each episode. In each sketch, a few historical sites relevant to the drama are introduced with a short video clip and brief comment. =Sketch 1: Atsuhime‚Äôs Homeland= *The : Kagoshima City, Kagoshima Prefecture, is the hometown of Atsuhime. It was a castle town of the 770, 000 koku Satsuma Domain. In 1835, Okatsu (later Atsuhime) was born in one of the Shimazu branch families, the Imaizumi Shimazu family, as the eldest daughter. Her birthhouse was located in the area close to Kagoshima Castle, where upper-class samurai lived. : Ibusuki, Kagoshima is located 40 km south of Kagoshima City. The northern section of the city was the Imaizumi Shimazu family‚Äôs territory. In the Imaizumi family‚Äôs residence site still remains a ch≈çzubachi that is known to have been used by Atsuhime. :Direction to the Imaizumi family‚Äôs residence site: JR Satsuma-Imaizumi Station =Sketch 2: Naogor≈ç‚Äôs Homeland= *Komatsu Tatewaki Statue : Kagoshima City, Kagoshima Prefecture is the hometown of Kimotsuki Naogor≈ç (later Komatsu Tatewaki). Naogor≈ç was born in 1835, the same year as Atsuhime was born. He was the third son of Kimotsuki Kaneyoshi and grew up close to the birthhouse of Atsuhime. : At the age of 23, Naogor≈ç was adopted by the Komatsu family and afterwards became politically influential in the tumultuous period prior to the Meiji Restoration as kar≈ç of the Satsuma Domain. =Sketch 3: The Strongest Samuraihood= : Izumi, Kagoshima, is the birthplace of the Shimazu clan. The first head of the clan, Shimazu Tadahisa, established the castle in the Kamakura period and built the clan‚Äôs foundation. In Kann≈çji Temple, the first five heads of the clan are resting peacefully. During that time, travelers and shipments passing through Izumi were strictly searched, for the location was on the border between Satsuma and Higo. On the foot of the hills still remain numerous residences of samurai. =Sketch 4: Nariakira‚Äôs Achievements= : Shimazu Nariakira established the first modern factories at a location called Iso 5 km northeast of central Kagoshima city. With the incorporation of western technology, great efforts were made at the development of ironworks and shipbuilding, along with the foundation of the glass handcraft industry and the cotton mill industry. In Senganen, Shimzau‚Äôs villa, Nariakira succeeded in lighting a gas lamp. He was enshrined in and is still known by many. =Sketch 5: Manjir≈ç‚Äôs Homeland= : Nakahama (Tosashimizu, K≈çchi), located on the eastside of Ashizuri Peninsula, is the homeland of Nakahama Manjir≈ç. Manjir≈ç, who lost his father when he was young, started working early to make ends meet. It was at the age of 14, when he was cast away during his fishing trip. He was saved by an American whaling ship and spent 10 years in the foreign land of America. The knowledge that Manjir≈ç brought from abroad gave a significant impact on later developments in Japan. =Sketch 6: Satsuma‚Äôs = : Kajiya Town, located on K≈çtsuki River in Kagoshima, produced many leaders of the new Meiji government such as Saig≈ç Takamori and ≈åkubo Toshimichi. The Satsuma Domain had a unique educational system named . The territory was divided roughly into 30 areas, and within each area the senior educated the junior. Saig≈ç and ≈åkubo were also educated by teachings of their seniors. =Sketch 7: The Port Town Deeply Connected to Atsuhime= : Ibusuki, Kagoshima is renowned for , a hot spring that requires the body to be covered with hot, steamy sand. The town has a good natural port and was busy in trade with China and Ry≈´ky≈´ in the past. As a consequence, however, the town was exposed to the threat of foreign ships many times. Lord Nariakira reinforced battery fortifications around the area to strengthen its defense. =Sketch 8: The Arrival of the Black Ships= : During the Edo period, Uraga was an entrance for many ships which visited the country. Back then, the port was lined with ship merchants. Many Inari shrines built for business success still remain in the city. In 1853, four black ships commanded by Commodore Matthew C. Perry appeared in Uraga Bay. Seeking the opening of Japan, he lands on Kuri Beach. The arrival of the Black Ships heralded the beginning of the turmoil leading up to the Meiji Restoration and also radically changed the fate of Atsuhime. =Sketch 9: The Castle where Atsuhime was Born= : Kagoshima Castle is called \\"Crane Castle\\" and has been cherished by many, for it is formed in a shape that appears like a crane spreading its wings. The front side has the main gate called Gor≈ç Gate. Passing through the gate, a modestly constructed main palace used to welcomed visitors. It's been said that one corner of the building was assigned to ≈åoku. The stone foundations still contain traces of bullets from the Satsuma Rebellion. In the castle that witnessed the tumultuous period of Japan, Okatsu took the name Atsuhime. =Sketch 10: Achievements of Tokugawa Nariaki= : Mito flourished during the Edo period as the castle town of the Mito Han, one of the Tokugawa Gosanke. The 9th daimy≈ç of the domain, Tokugawa Nariaki aggressively carried out reform. He also encouraged both literary and military arts and established the school K≈çd≈çkan and the relaxing place for samurai Kairakuen. Even after the family headship was handed over to his son, he remained on the political scene as a leading figure of the group, which supported the expulsion of foreigners from Japan. =Sketch 11: The Town with a Flagrance of Antiquity= : Located at the southeast of Satsuma Peninsula, in current Minamisatsuma, Kagoshima, B≈çnotsu Town had been known, inside and outside of the country, as a sea entrance to Japan. It is said that Ganjin, a renowned Buddhist monk, arrived here in 753f from China and passed on knowledge about incense. There is a historical record recounting that merchants of B≈çnotsu brought in the incense called from Agarwood to the Shimazu clan. : It has been said that the activity to burn incense for entertainment caught on and expanded to the four corners of the country during the Edo period. =Sketch 12: My Homeland, Sakurajima= : Sakurajima is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. In particular, the eruption in 1914 caused enormous damage to the region. Due to thermal effects created in the volcanic area, public bathhouses in Kagoshima, Kagoshima use hot spring water. At the foothills of Sakurajima grow local produce such as Sakurajima Daikon and Sakurajima Small Mikan. The volcano that Atsuhime adored is the homeland for people of Kagoshima across time. =Sketch 13: Atsuhime‚Äôs Journey to Edo= : In the fall of 1853, Atsuhime dropped by Kyoto on the way to Edo. During her stay, she met with Konoe Tadahiro. Konoe, a Kuge, had a strong tie with Satsuma, since he married Nariakira‚Äôs elder sister as his primary wife. T≈çfuku-ji Sokus≈çin, where Atsuhime visited for worshiping, was the temple where the Shimazu clan worshiped their ancestors tracing back to the Muromachi period. After spending roughly one week, she left for Edo with full of expectations and worries. =Sketch 14: Ii Naosuke's Homeland= *Hikone, Shiga : Ii Naosuke, who later played a significant role as a Tair≈ç in the late Edo period, was born in 1815 as a son of the head of the Hikone domain. Although he was the 14th boy, coupled with his brothers‚Äô untimely deaths, he was surprisingly chosen to head the domain at the age of 36. It was the Hikone domain that was guarding Uraga Bay when Commodore Perry came to demand Japan‚Äôs opening. Ii, who recognized the immense military power of the US, asserted the importance of opening the country. Afterwards, he antagonized with Tokugawa Nariaki over foreign policy. =Sketch 15: The Temple Remembered in Connection with Saig≈ç Takamori= * : Ry≈´senji, also known as Meguro Fud≈çson, is a temple that is closely connected to Saig≈ç Takamori. According to the temple‚Äôs historical recount, it was established in the Heian period and was bustled with visitors during the Edo period. In 1854, the Satsuma domain met with an unfortunate turn of events, Nariakira's illness and his fifth son‚Äôs sudden death. Saig≈ç wrote in a letter to his friend that he paid homage at the temple for Nariakira‚Äôs health. Under Nariakira, who recovered his health, Saig≈ç lived through the tumult years of the late Edo period. =Sketch 16: Birth Place of Yoshinobu= *The Mito Domain Edo Residence Historical Site (Koishikawa K≈çrakuen Garden) : Koishikawa K≈çrakuen Garden is a place where the Mito Tokugawa family had their Edo residence up till the beginning of the Meiji period. In 1938, one boy was born in this residence, later known as 15th Tokugawa Shogun Yoshinobu. He was a smart boy, and it caught Tokugawa Ieyoshi's eyes and was adopted to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa House, one of the Gosanky≈ç. Yoshinobu, whom even Nariakira was pushing for the next Shogun, was later going to run into Atsuhime. =Sketch 17: The Satsuma Domain Residence in Edo= *The Satsuma Domain Residence Historic Site : It has been said that central Edo has five residences of the Satsuma Domain during the final years of the Edo period. The place located in current Shiba in Minato-ward was the center of the domain's activity. Atsuhime also stayed here for close to two years. In the aftermath of the Ansei great earthquakes, however, the residence was destroyed, and Atsuhime was relocated to a residence in Shibuya. The following year, she moved to Edo castle to marry the shogun. =Sketch 18: The Port Town where Harris Stayed= * : Townsend Harris visited Shimoda as the first Consul General of the US to secure trade between Japan and the US in 1856, three years after Commodore Perry's arrival to the country. He opened the first U.S. Consulate at Gyokusen-ji, which is located close to the port and worked on negotiating the \\"Treaty of Peace and Commerce,‚Äù or the Harris Treaty, signed in 1858. Having stayed in Shimoda for nearly three years, Harris left his traces, the ‚ÄúHarris path,‚Äù where he used to take a walk, and a stone tablet that commemorates his stay. =Sketch 19: The Castle where Atsuhime Stayed= *K≈çkyo Higashigoen and ≈åtemon : K≈çkyo Higashigoen was the location where the donjon of Edo castle was located. It‚Äôs been said that the guard of the castle was tight with the main entrance, ≈åtemon, and other three gates leading to the donjon. ≈åoku, where Atsuhime was staying, was located within this donjon whose area covered 40,000 tsubo. Atsuhime faced the tumultuous end of the Tokugawa shogunate in this castle. =Sketch 40: Hamaguri Gate= *The : On July 19th, 1864, the Ch≈çsh≈´ domain attacked the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Later, this rebellion later became known as the Jinmon Incident. The Shogunate force guarding the palace was, at one point, overwhelmed by the Ch≈çsh≈´ forces. The Satsuma forces led by Saig≈ç Takamori came for reinforcement and turned the tables. : It was said that Komatsu Tatewaki, who attacked Tenry≈´-ji, where the Ch≈çsh≈´ forces‚Äô headquarters was located, distributed to commoners who suffered from fires from the war the rice that was left in the temple by the enemy forces. In the wake of this battle, Satsuma‚Äôs influence in Kyoto became further strengthened. =Sketch 41: Satch≈ç Alliance= *The Nihonmatsu Satsuma Domain Residence Historic Site : It has been said that the place where the Satsuma-Ch≈çsh≈´ Alliance was formed was this house in Kyoto owned by the Komatsu family. Since the Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, which fought with the Tokugawa shogunate in the Kinmon Incident, was unable to purchase weapons from the western powers, it sought assistance to the Satsuma domain in supplying weapons. Tatewaki's acceptance of this plea led to obtaining the trust of Katsura Kogor≈ç and other Ch≈çsh≈´ samurai. In the end, the alliance was formed between the two domains.

He was killed in a rebellion by Emperor Zhongzong's son the crown prince Li Chongjun in 707.  Background  It is not known when Wu Sansi was born. His father Wu Yuanqing (Ê≠¶ÂÖÉÊÖ∂) was a half-brother of Wu Zetian--both had, as father, the early Tang Dynasty general Wu Shihuo (Ê≠¶Â£´ÂΩ†), but Wu Yuanqing and his brother Wu Yuanshuang (Ê≠¶ÂÖÉÁàΩ) were born of Wu Shihuo's first wife Lady Xiangli, while Wu Zetian and her two sisters were born of Wu Shihuo's second wife Lady Yang. After Wu Zetian became empress to Emperor Gaozong in 655, despite previous intrafamily unpleasantries‚ÄîWu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang, as well as Wu Shihuo's nephews Wu Weiliang (Ê≠¶ÊÉüËâØ) and Wu Huaiyun (Ê≠¶Êá∑ÈÅã) were often disrespectful of Lady Yang previously‚ÄîEmpress Wu's brothers and cousins were often promoted by Emperor Gaozong, with Wu Yuanqing promoted to Zongzheng Shaoqing (ÂÆóÊ≠£Â∞ëÂçø), the deputy minister of imperial clan affairs. However, sometime before 666, Empress Wu, angry that her brothers and cousins did not appreciate the promotions, had them all demoted, with Wu Yuanqing demoted to be the prefect of Long Prefecture (ÈæçÂ∑û, roughly modern Mianyang, Sichuan). After he arrived at Long Prefecture, he, in fear that Empress Wu had further retaliation in the works, died. It is not completely clear, but it was likely that Wu Sansi went to Long Prefecture with his father Wu Yuanqing. He was later made a commanding general of the imperial guards.  During Empress dowager Wu's regency  Emperor Gaozong died in 683, and was initially succeeded by his and Empress Wu's son Li Zhe the Crown Prince (as Emperor Zhongzong), but Empress Wu retained power as empress dowager and regent. In spring 684, after Emperor Zhongzong showed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with another son, Li Dan the Prince of Yu, but wielded power even more tightly thereafter. Sometime during her regency, Wu Sansi became minister of defense (Â§èÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Xiaguan Shangshu). Both he and his cousin Wu Chengsi (Wu Yuanshuang's son) advised Empress Dowager Wu to find excuses to kill two senior members of the imperial Li clan‚ÄîEmperor Gaozong's uncles Li Yuanjia (ÊùéÂÖÉÂòâ) the Prince of Han and Li Lingkui (ÊùéÈùàÂ§î) the Prince of Lu due to their senior status. (Eventually, after two other princes‚ÄîEmperor Gaozong's brother Li Zhen the Prince of Yue and Li Zhen's son Li Chong the Prince of Langye unsuccessfully rose against Empress Dowager Wu in 688, Empress Dowager Wu took the opportunity to also force Li Yuanjia and Li Lingkui, as well as many other members of the Li clan, to commit suicide or to execute them.) Wu Sansi and Wu Chengsi were also said to be often advocating that Empress Dowager Wu take over the throne herself as \\"emperor.\\"  During Wu Zetian's reign  In 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as \\"emperor,\\" establishing a new Zhou Dynasty and interrupting Tang. She created a number of her Wu clan relatives imperial princes, and Wu Sansi was created the Prince of Liang and made the minister of civil service affairs (, Tianguan Shangshu). He did not appear to have as much power as Wu Chengsi (who became chancellor), but was nevertheless honored. For example, in 693, when Wu Zetian made sacrifices to heaven and earth, she offered the sacrifices herself first, followed by Wu Chengsi, and then Wu Sansi. It was said that he had done some studies in literature and history and was good at flattery. As the years went by, he often flattered Wu Zetian's successive lovers Huaiyi, Zhang Yizhi, and Zhang Changzong. In 694, Wu Sansi led a group of non-Han chieftains in requesting that a massive iron pillar be erected to commemorate Wu Zetian's reign with text on it to deprecate Tang and to praise Zhou, and Wu Zetian agreed, putting the chancellor Yao Shu in charge of the project. It was said that the chieftains gathered up their wealth and bought iron, but the iron they bought was not enough, and so the people's farm equipment were requisitioned and melted for the project. In 695, Wu Sansi was made the Minister of Rites and was put in charge of editing the imperial history. In 696, when Khitan attacked under the leadership of Li Jinzhong and Sun Wanrong, Wu Sansi was put in command of one of the major armies defending against the Khitan attack, assisted by Yao. In 697, Wu Sansi was given the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (), making him a chancellor de facto, but about a month later, he was stripped of the chancellor designation. It was said that he and Wu Chengsi both had designs on being crown prince, and often had their associates try to persuade Wu Zetian that in ages past, there had never been an emperor who had, as his heir, someone with a different family name. (At that time, Wu Zetian's crown prince was her son Li Dan (the former Emperor Ruizong).) In 698, however, at the suggestion of the chancellor Di Renjie, concurred in by Wang Jishan and Wang Fangqing, as well as Wu Zetian's close advisor Ji Xu and her lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, Wu Zetian recalled Li Zhe the Prince of Luling (the former Emperor Zhongzong) from exile and soon, after Li Dan offered to yield the position of crown prince to him, created him crown prince and changed his name to Li Xian and then to Wu Xian. In 698, Wu Zetian made Wu Sansi acting Neishi (), the head of the legislative bureau of government (, Fengge); the next year, he was made full Neishi. In 700, however, he was no longer chancellor and was made an advisor to Li Xian. He received the honorific title of Tejin (). In 702, Wu Zetian considered launching a major attack against Eastern Tujue and she initially put Wu Sansi in command, assisted by Jing Hui. She later changed the orders to have Li Dan in command, assisted by Wu Sansi, his cousin Wu Youning the prince of Jiancheng, and the chancellor Wei Yuanzhong. However, the army was eventually not launched. In 704, at Wu Sansi's suggestion, Wu Zetian constructed the vacation palace Xingtai () at Mount Wan'an (, near the capital Luoyang), at much expense and labor.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup in 705 led by the officials Zhang Jianzhi, Cui Xuanwei, Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, and Yuan Shuji. Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were killed in the coup, and Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne; Wu Zetian was sent to a secondary palace under heavy guard, and while she also retained the title of \\"emperor,\\" no longer had power. By that time, Wu Sansi had been carrying out an affair with Wu Zetian's secretary and Emperor Zhongzong's concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er. Through her introduction, Wu Sansi began an affair with Emperor Zhongzong's wife Empress Wei as well and also became a trusted advisor to Emperor Zhongzong who, while he was restored through the efforts of Zhang Jianzhi and his colleagues, feared them. In addition, Wu Sansi's son Wu Chongxun (Ê≠¶Â¥áË®ì) had been married to Emperor Zhongzong's and Empress Wei's daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle, who also had much power in her father's administration. Meanwhile, the coup leaders initially did not regard Wu Sansi as a threat, and they brushed aside suggestions by two lower level officials participating in the coup, Xue Jichang (ËñõÂ≠£Êò∂) and Liu Youqiu. However, they soon realized that Wu Sansi's power was on the rise, and they unsuccessfully suggested Emperor Zhongzong to kill some of the more powerful Wu clan members (which would have included Wu Sansi) or to demote them‚Äîand indeed, he made Wu Sansi Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) and chancellor again with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ, a modification of the Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin designation that Wu Zetian used), although Wu Sansi declined the titles. Meanwhile, Emperor Zhongzong designated 16 officials, including the coup leaders but also Wu Sansi and his cousin Wu Youji (the husband of Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping), as contributors to his return to the throne and gave them iron certificates that were supposed to guarantee that they would be spared of death penalties 10 times except for treason. Jing, fearful of Wu Sansi's power, retained the mid-level official Cui Shi to watch for Wu Sansi's moves‚Äîbut Cui Shi, realizing that Emperor Zhongzong trusted Wu Sansi and feared the coup leaders, instead became Wu Sansi's associate, along with Zheng Yin, who suggested that Wu Sansi find some way to remove the five coup leaders, now all chancellors, from their posts. Wu Sansi and Empress Wei, in turn, argued to Emperor Zhongzong that the five coup leaders were overpowering in the government and should be given honorific titles but be removed from office. At their suggestion, Emperor Zhongzong created the five coup leaders princes and awarded them much wealth, but removed them from governmental posts, including chancellor positions‚Äîand soon sent Zhang Jianzhi and Cui Xuanwei out of the capital. Wu Sansi, now in power, had much of Wu Zetian's policies, which the five coup leaders had reversed, reinstated. Meanwhile, to diffuse some of the popular sentiment against the Wu clan, Emperor Zhongzong demoted their titles slightly, and Wu Sansi's title was reduced from Prince of Liang to the lesser title of Prince of Dejing. As Emperor Zhongzong also trusted Wei Yuanzhong (whom Wu Zetian had exiled in 703 but whom Emperor Zhongzong recalled upon his restoration to the throne), when Wu Zetian died in late 705, Wu Sansi tried to ingratiate Wei by writing into Wu Zetian's will a provision giving Wei an additional fief of 100 households. Wei, in gratitude, did not oppose the Wu clan further from that point. In spring 706, Wu Sansi, fearful that Jing, Huan, and Yuan were still in the capital, sent them out of the capital to serve as prefectural prefects. Meanwhile, an incident occurred that allowed Wu Sansi to act further against the five coup leaders‚Äîas Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (ÁéãÂêåÁöé), himself a participant in the coup, was accused of plotting with Zhang Zhongzhi (Âºµ‰ª≤‰πã), Zu Yanqing (Á•ñÂª∂ÊÖ∂), and Zhou Jing (Âë®Áíü) to kill Wu Sansi and deposing Empress Wei. The alleged plotters were all killed, and Wu Sansi and Empress Wei thereafter accused the five coup leaders of having been part of Wang Tongjiao's plot, and the five were demoted further, to more distant prefecture, with no possibility of return from exile. Meanwhile, Wu Sansi, knowing that Emperor Zhongzong was very sensitive about any accusation of adultery by Empress Wei, intentionally had people post public accusations that she had been involved in adultery‚Äîand then framed the five coup leaders of doing so, and the five coup leaders, already in exile, were stripped of all of their titles and honors. Wu Sansi, at Cui Shi's suggestion, then sent the secret police official Zhou Lizhen (Âë®Âà©Ë≤û) to the Lingnan region, where the five had been exiled, to survey the area, but with instructions to have the five killed. When Zhou reached Lingnan, Zhang Jianzhi and Cui Xuanwei had already died, but he killed Huan, Jing, and Yuan in cruel manners. It was said that after news of the five coup leaders' deaths reached Wu Sansi, he commented, \\"I do not know who are good people and who are bad people on this earth. I only know that people who are good to me are good, and people who are bad to me are bad.\\" In spring 707, with an ongoing drought, Emperor Zhongzong sent Wu Sansi and Wu Youji to Emperor Gaozong's and Wu Zetian's tomb to pray for rain, and when rain came, Emperor Zhongzong restored Wu Zetian's ancestral temple to near-imperial ancestral temple status. Meanwhile, Emperor Zhongzong had created his son Li Chongjun, by a concubine, crown prince, as Empress Wei's only son Li Chongrun had been killed by Wu Zetian in 701, but Li Guo'er, encouraged by Wu Chongxun, had designs on becoming crown princess, and repeatedly asked Emperor Zhongzong to make her crown princess. Both she and Wu Chongxun also repeatedly insulted Li Chongjun, sometimes calling him \\"slave.\\" In fall 707, Li Chongjun, in anger, started a rebellion with the generals Li Duozuo, Li Sichong (ÊùéÊÄùÊ≤ñ), Li Chengkuang (ÊùéÊâøÊ≥Å), Dugu Yizhi (Áç®Â≠§Á¶ï‰πã), and Shazha Zhongyi (Ê≤ôÂêíÂø†Áæ©), as well as Emperor Zhongzong's cousin Li Qianli (ÊùéÂçÉÈáå) the Prince of Cheng and Li Qianli's son Li Xi (ÊùéÁ¶ß) the Prince of Tianshui. They attacked Wu Sansi's mansion and killed Wu Sansi, Wu Chongxun, and some of their relatives. Li Chongjun's subsequent attempt to reach the palace and arrest Consort Shangguan, Empress Wei, and Li Guo'er, however, were unsuccessful, and his troops collapsed; he was killed. Li Chongjun was beheaded, and his head was presented to Wu Sansi's and Wu Chongxun's caskets. Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun were buried in grand funerals, and Wu Sansi was posthumously recreated the Prince of Liang with the posthumous name of Xuan (ÂÆ£, \\"responsible\\"). After Emperor Zhongzong's death in 710, a coup led by Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi overthrew Empress Wei and restored Emperor Ruizong to the throne, and Wu Sansi's tomb was destroyed.

In that year the historic diocese of Arezzo was combined with the diocese of Cortona and the diocese of Sansepolcro, the enlarged diocese being suffragan of the archdiocese of Florence. History Arezzo was the see of a diocese in Tuscany, directly dependent on the Holy See. Tradition says it was converted in the 1st century by Romulus of Fiesole, afterwards Bishop of Fiesole, a disciple of St. Paul. Another foundation tale has it that Christianity was brought to Arezzo by S. Barnabas, and by S. Timothy, the disciple of S. Paul.Pasqui I, p. vi: E una semplice credenza, non avvalorata da prova diretta, ma potrebbe riferirsi al fatto che nella espansione del cristianesimo in Toscana avessero avuta parte gli apostoli venuti dalla Grecia anzicb√® da Roma. An equally implausible claim is that all of Arezzo was baptized during the episcopacy of Bishop Dicentius in the 5th century.Life of Saint Gaudentius, quoted in Lanzoni, pp. 571-572. The cities clerks often helped build the church for their own free time. The church helped reward these people with seats of Cardinals. Many of the seats are still there with the names of people who had helped donated and build the church. It became a bishopric about 304, under Saint Satyrus. Saint Donatus, his successor, is patron of Arezzo Cathedral, also dedicated to Saint Peter the Apostle. The diocese was originally very large, embracing most of southeastern Tuscany. In 1325, however, Pope John XXII created the diocese of Cortona out of the territory of Arezzo. In 1462, Pius II created the dioceses of Pienza and Montalcino. In 1561, Pius IV created the diocese of Montepulciano. In 1515 (1520), Leo X created the diocese of Borgo San Sepolcro.Kehr III, p. 145.

Bishop Helmpertus built new quarters for them in 1009.Pasqui I, p. 129-131, no. 94: \\"igitur quoniam domum pro necessitatis qualitate cum suo claustro fieri precepi. et fratres in ea ad statuta canonica observanda elegi, ut meo tempore illius domns et fratrum facultates in augmentum venirent penitus necessarium esse previdi.\\" In 1677, the cathedral Chapter was composed of four dignities (the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Dean, and the Primicerius) and fourteen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin V, p. 97, note 1. Bishop Theodaldus (1023‚Äì1036?) invited Guido of Arezzo to train the cathedral singers in the plainchant. He dedicated his book Micrologus to Bishop Thedaldus c. 1025. A letter of Guido to Bishop Theodaldus survives, in which he explains his methodology. Between 1480 and 1485, Luca Pacioli, O.Min., a native of Borgo San Sepolcro, which is a distance of 16 miles (25 km) from Arezzo, visited the site, and described it as \\"utterly stunning.\\" He stayed there for five years after the Pope urged them not to. While Cardinal Guadagni was Bishop of Arezzo, he was able to obtain from his uncle, Pope Clement XII, a number of privileges for himself and Arezzo. In the bull \\"Insignes Ecclesias\\" of 1 November 1737, Pope Clement lauded the antiquity, faithfulness, and prestige of the diocese as a direct subject of the Roman Church, and conceded to its bishop in perpetuo archiepiscopal insignia, the pallium (which could only be worn inside the diocese, and on certain specified feasts and holy days) and the patriarchal cross.Cappelletti XVIII, pp. 153-159. =Reorganization of the diocese= On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued by the Vatican on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. In Tuscany, this particularly affected three dioceses: Arezzo, Cortona, and Borgo San Sepolcro (Biturgensis). On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Arezzo, Cortona, and San Sepolcro be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Arretina-Cortonensis-Biturgensis. The seat of the diocese was to be in Arezzo, and the cathedral of Arezzo was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Cortona and San Sepolcro were to become co- cathedrals, and their cathedral Chapters were to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Arezzo, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Cortona and Borgo San Sepolcro.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1987), pp. 654-656.

The RS.14 was a four/five seat all-metal cantilever low/mid-wing monoplane powered by two wing-mounted 626 kW (840 hp) Fiat A.74 R.C.38 engines. It had a conventional cantilever tail unit with a single fin and rudder. Its undercarriage consisted of two large floats on struts. It had a glazed nose for an observer or bomb aimer. The pilot and copilot sat side by side with a wireless operator's compartment behind them. In the bombing role the RS.14 was fitted with a long ventral gondola to carry various combinations of anti-submarine bombs (up to ). Development The RS.14 was designed by Manlio Stiavelli at the CMASA works at Marina di Pisa. The first of two prototypes flew in May 1939. A prototype landplane version AS.14 was built and first flown on 11 August 1943. It was designed as a ground-attack aircraft and intended to be armed with a cannon and machine guns. It was not ordered and no others were built. Operational history The waist gun positions of a FIAT RS.14 The RS.14 went into service with the Italian Air Force with a number of maritime strategic reconnaissance squadrons at bases around the Italian coast and also in Sicily and Sardinia. They were used for convoy escort duties and anti-submarine patrols. Occasionally they engaged in aerial combat, obtaining unexpected victories such as when, on Saturday 9 May 1942, an RS.14 intercepted Spitfires that took off from the carriers HMS Eagle and USS Wasp, headed for Malta, and machine-gunned two. The two RAF fighters collided and fell into the sea. Both pilots were killed.Rogers 2010, p. 149. After the 1943 Armistice a few survivors were operated by the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force. At the end of the Second World War the aircraft were used for liaison duties around the Mediterranean carrying up to four passengers.

During a rehearsal, according to Miller, the producer Fred Coe dropped by and watched as Robertson and Laurie \\"played some of the most realistic drunk scenes ever seen anywhere.

Some critics observed that the movie lacked the impact of the original television production. For DVD Journal, D. K. Holm described the numerous changes that altered the original considerably when the material was filmed: > Newer does not necessarily mean better.

According to > one Lemmon biography, the actor felt a little bad about the fact that his > friend Cliff Robertson, who had appeared in the TV production, wasn't > invited to be in the movie, but the studio insisted on a certified star for > the film...

DVD Journal Revivals In 2003, Rachel Wood directed the New York stage premiere of Days of Wine and Roses, an off-Broadway production by the Boomerang Theatre Company. In 2005, the Northern Irish writer Owen McCafferty relocated Days of Wine and Roses to London in the 1960s, reworking it to focus on a young couple just arrived from Belfast. That stage version had a West End premiere at the Donmar Warehouse directed by Peter Gill, who had previously staged McCafferty's National Theatre hit, Scenes from the Big Picture.Irish Playography Legacy The Criterion Collection included the teleplay as part of a special edition three-disc box set entitled The Golden Age of Television, which was part of a PBS anthology series.

He met Harry Marshall Ward who was in Ceylon to study the coffee rust and conducted his own studies on Coccus viridis which he published in 1886 and wrote another influential paper on the Insect Pests of Tea in 1890. This led to an invitation from the Planters' Association to visit estates and provide advise. This led to travel around Ceylon and Southern India, although this was entirely voluntary and this led to him being appointed \\"honorary entomologist\\" of Ceylon in 1897. In 1899 he was made a Government Entomologist with his office in the Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya. He retired and moved to England in 1913. He moved to Camberley where he lived in Way's End and continued his research on scale insects of which he had made a large collection. Green was awarded the Barclay Medal of the Asiatic Society in 1901. Green served as a president of the Royal Entomological Society of London in 1923-24 and as a vice-president (1915, 1925). He married Edith Mary, daughter of Alfred Burnaby Antram in 1891 and they had two sons and a daughter. His specimen collections were donated to the Natural History Museum (BMNH) after he feared damage from bombing during the Second World War. The collection donated in 1940 included 6505 slides and 2172 boxes of dry specimens. He died in Camberley in 1949.  Contributions to entomology  Green's major writings include The Coccidae of Ceylon, that was published by Dulau & Co. in London (five volumes 1896‚Äì1922),Review by T. D. A. Cockerell in The American Naturalist, Vol. 31, No. 368 (Aug., 1897), pp. 701‚Äì704, retrieved on 2008-09-18. as well as over 200 other papers. The originals of his paintings are in the Natural History Museum in London. Green's collection of Heteroptera from Ceylon is in the Indian Museum in Calcutta. His Microlepidoptera and Coleoptera from Ceylon are in the Natural History Museum in London. Green collected specimens of various other taxa which were sent to experts in England and Europe. The frog species Fejervarya greenii was named after him by G.A. Boulenger in 1905 while a dragonfly Platysticta greeni was named after him by Kirby in 1891. A mite genus Greenia was named in his honour by A.C. Oudemans in 1902, however this is now treated as a synonym of Dinogamasus. The type species Greenia perkinsi was described as a symbiont found in the acarinarium of Xylocopa tenuiscapa.

He was born in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, the son of silent-film actor Rintar≈ç Fujima, and started his career as a comedian in 1952. Acting Roles Fujita appeared in both jidaigeki and contemporary roles. He starred as Nakamura Mondo, a samurai, in sixteen Hissatsu series on Asahi Broadcasting Corporation from 1973. He also portrayed Nakamura on stage and in film; for example, the 1984 film Hissatsu: Sure Death, the 1987 film Sure Death! Brown, You Bounder!, the (also released in 1987) film Sure Death 4: Revenge, the 1991 film Sure Death 5, and the 1996 film Hissatsu! Mondo Shisu. Fujita's last appearance was in 2009 Hissatsu Shigotonin 2009, although in January 2010 he had returned to the Hissatsu series as a narrator. He also starred in the contemporary detective drama series Hagure Keiji Junj≈çha (\\"Rogue but Pure-Minded Detective\\"), also on the Asahi network. Returning to jidaigeki he played the lead role in the remake of Kenkaku Sh≈çbai with Megumi ≈åji. He also took the role of Sen no Riky≈´ and in 2008 Tokugawa Mitsukuni. Makoto's film credits number at least 57 and he also starred in a number of TV commercials. Singing and writing Makoto's talents extended beyond acting. He also sang, and released nine recordings, including a duet with Azusa Mano, and with The Peanuts twins. He also published several essays, the last of which was Saigo (2006). Pacifism A committed pacifist, Fujita always carried a letter from his elder brother, who died in the Battle of Okinawa during World War II. It took him over 60 years, Fujita revealed, before he could finally visit Okinawa, where he threw rice balls into the ocean as an offering to the war victims. To convey his antiwar message, Fujita devoted all his energy into the 2007 movie Best Wishes for Tomorrow (Ashita he no Yuigon), in which he portrayed a class-B war criminal sentenced to death following Japan's surrender. Death On February 16, 2010 at approximately 9:00 P.M. in his home in Minoh, Osaka, Fujita suddenly vomited blood and was transported to the Osaka University Hospital in Suita. The following day at 7:25 am, Fujita suffered an aortic aneurysm, resulting in his death. He was 76 years old.

She was named for the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Gainsborough in 1643. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, she was renamed Swallow. By 1666 her armament had been increased to 48 guns. The Swallow, commanded by Captain Wolfran Cornewall, served as Colonel Cunningham's flagship during the expedition to Loch Foyle in April 1689. The fleet carried two battalions which should have reinforced the garrison of Derry. The town, which was loyal to King William, had already been attacked in December 1688, and was about to be attacked again as James was on his way to the town with a strong army. However Robert Lundy, the city's governor, told Cunningham to return to England as the town would surrender. The Swallow, still under the command of Wolfbran Cornewall, was also part of the relief fleet for Derry under General Percy Kirke in June and July 1689.

Plot summary The events in the novel take place in the early twentieth century, near the collapse of a war weary Ottoman Empire and the creation of the Turkish republic. Most of the novel is recounted in first- person diary format by Feride. In the first section, Feride describes her childhood, beginning from the beginning and leading to the events that led her to a strange hotel room. The second and largest section consists of diary entries describing her adventures in Anatolia. The third section is the only one written from the third person point of view, describing Feride's visit to her home. Feride is the orphaned daughter of an army officer. As a teenager, she attends Lycee Notre Dame de Sion in the winter, and stays with one of her late mother's sisters during the summer holidays. She is given the nickname \\"the Wren\\" during her time at school for her vivacity and mischief. These two characteristics considered unusual and even a bit inappropriate for Muslim girls at that time. She gets engaged to her charming cousin, Kamran, whom she leaves the night before their wedding, upon discovering that he has been unfaithful to her. She runs away from home to become a teacher in Anatolia, although she remains desperately in love with Kamran. She is forced to move from town to town several times during her first three years as a teacher, as a result of the incompetence of officials, the malice of colleagues and the unwanted attention she gets from men because of her beauty and her lively manner. Meanwhile, she adopts a little girl called Munise, finds out that Kamran has married the woman he had cheated on Feride with, and develops a friendship with Hayrullah Bey, an elderly military doctor who treats Feride with fatherly affection. At the end of these three years, Munise dies and Feride is forced to resign from her post and marry the doctor because of the rumors about her \\"indecent behavior\\". A couple of years later, Feride returns to Tekirdag to visit one of her aunts and her cousin Mujgan, where Kamran, now widowed and with a small child, also happens to be. He has never gotten over Feride, painfully regrets having cheated on her, and confesses to have married the other woman only out of pity after he heard false rumors about Feride being in love with another man. The night before her arranged departure, Feride confesses to Mujgan that her marriage to the doctor has never been consummated and he has in fact died recently. He told Feride to revive her ties to her family as his last wish, and gave her a package to be entrusted to Mujgan. Mujgan takes the package to Kamran, which turns out to be Feride's diary which was hidden and preserved by the doctor. Finding out that Feride is still in love with him, Kamran arranges to be wedded to Feride the next day without her knowledge. The novel ends with their long-awaited reunion, and Kamran's confession that he betrayed her all those years ago because of his insecurity about her love for and loyalty to him, due to her ostensible frivolity and harsh treatment of him.

Minckelers was the son of Anna Margaretha Denis en Laurens Michael Minckelers, a pharmacist in Maastricht. After finishing Latin school in his hometown at the age of 15, he went to the University of Leuven (French: Louvain), where he studied theology and philosophy at the Collegium Falconis. In 1771 he became a deacon and the next year he became professor of natural philosophy. From 1778 Minckelers focussed on the study of gasses. He worked closely with Jan Frans Thijsbaert (Jean-Fran√ßois Thysbaert; 1736‚Äì1825), director of the school of experimental physics at the university, and it was under Thysbaert's direction that he did his experiments on coal gas.Vanpaemel, Geert (1984) Jan Frans Thijsbaert (1736-1825) en de school voor experimentele fysika te Leuven, GEWINA / TGGNWT, volume 7, issue 4, pp. 172 - 182. (in Dutch) In the early 1780s the question of aerostats and Montgolfier balloons was occupying the mind of scientists, and Louis Engelbert, 6th Duke of Arenberg, a promoter of science and art, engaged Minckelers, Thysbaert en Carolus van Bochaute, a third natural philosopher at the university, to address the question of the best gas for balloon purposes. In 1784, after many experiments, Minckelers published a work entitled M√©moire sur l'air inflammable tir√© de diff√©rentes substances, r√©dig√© par M. Minkelers, professeur de philosophie au coll√®ge du Faucon, universit√© de Louvain (Louvain, 1784). As an appendix to this memoir there was a Table de gravit√©s sp√©cifiques des diff√©rentes esp√®ces d'air by Thysbaert. In his memoir Minckelers relates how he made his discovery: from the very beginning of his experiments he had had the idea of enclosing oil in the barrel of a gun and heating it in a forge. Under action of the heat the oil dissolved and gave way to a very light gas, having other advantageous qualities. Having proved that oil gas was the best for balloons, Minckelers used it for many balloons which rose rapidly and travelled great distances in the neighbourhood of Leuven in 1783. As we learn from his pupil von Hulstein, who was in his class in 1785, Minckelers at times used this same gas to light his lecture hall. Later on some students' bedrooms were lit by gas as well. Moreover, the drift of his memoir proves clearly that in its inventor's eyes the great combustibility of the gas was one of its leading qualities. When Joseph II, in 1788, transferred the Catholic University of Leuven to Brussels, Minckelers continued as professor. During the Brabant Revolution, Brussels was besieged and Minckelers was forced to flee, leaving his equipment behind. The gaslight apparatus is thought to have survived until World War I. As a supporter of the emperor, he could not regain his position when the University moved back to Leuven. He officially resigned in 1794 and was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the Central School of Maastricht. While not at a center of higher learning, he proceeded to do research, among others on meteorology and on a Mosasaurus skeleton discovered in a local limestone quarry in 1800. In 1816 he became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. He retired in 1818 and died six years later in his hometown of Maastricht. Minckelers is remembered as an inventor of coal gasification and gas lighting and as the first to do this at a practical scale. On Maastricht's market square stands a statue, created by Bart van Hove, that carries an \\"eternal\\" gas light. For sustainability and budget reasons, the flame is coin operated since 2006. Another statue of him is in Heverlee near the science buildings of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. A number of schools and streets in the Netherlands and Belgium carry his name, including a street in the center of Leuven.

It is located a few kilometres from Chora, the site of Nestor's Palace, and the seaside port of Pylos. Palaio Loutro means \\"old bath\\" in reference to the river that runs between the village and a mountain the locals refer to as \\"o koufieros\\". Before World War II, Palaio Loutro had a thriving agricultural community. It suffered immensely from the occupation of Greece between 1941 and 1944; residents fled Nazi forces and sought refuge in the nearby mountains when Palaio Loutro was set alight to avenge the death of German troops in the area as a result of battles with the Greek Resistance. The village also suffered as a result of the Greek Civil War that ravaged Greece between 1946 and 1949. In the 1950s and 1960s, many of its young people emigrated primarily to Australia but also to the United States and Germany. Others left for nearby larger Messinian towns and to the prefecture's capital, Kalamata. Many also settled in Greece's capital, Athens. Palaio Loutro is known for the river that passes near the village, its scenic views and its annual patron saint festival (panigyri) held in the summer that attracts many visitors, including children and grandchildren of the village's former residents. In recent years, former residents of the village and their descendants have begun rebuilding their ancestral homes which are used in the summer months. The town has two churches, Saint Demetrius and Saints Anargyroi (Cosmas and Damian). The latter was carved out of the mountain facing the village and many residents sought refuge there when Palaio Loutro was set alight by the Nazis in World War II.

Works  Roberto Paci Dal√≤ has developed a multi-layered language out of his background in sound and visual arts, which combines the spoken language with body and architecture. His work uses new technologies in combination with an analysis on classical tragic drama. The areas of work of Roberto Paci Dal√≤ includes robotics, cybernetics, man-machine interaction, psychoacoustics, realtime video and sound processing. He wrote, composed and directed since 1985 about 30 music-theatre works presented worldwide. He composed music for acoustical ensembles, electronics, voices and a large number of radioworks produced by European broadcasting corporations. His production of films and videos is regularly presented in international festivals.Roberto Paci Dal√≤ - Biography His dramaturgical materials are frequently re-composed in sound and video installations ‚Äì often site specific and interactive ‚Äì presented in museums, galleries, and the public space. As performer he developed extended techniques on the clarinet and with electronics and sampler.

She was one of the most talked about people of her time as the possible child of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden. Princess Sophia Albertina of Sweden investigated her birth in the 1790s and tried to have her acknowledged as the daughter of her father. The truth is unconfirmed, though it is considered likely that she was the illegitimate daughter of the king. (search for all versions on WorldCat)  Early life  Officially the child of a servant at the royal court, she was widely rumored to be the child of king Adolf Fredrik and the noble lady in waiting Ulla von Liewen. The queen, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, was said to tolerate her husband's affairs as long as he was discreet and did not take an official mistress, and the king never did have a mistress openly. Lolotte Forssberg was adopted by assistant Eric Forssberg and Hedvig Charlotta D'Orchimont. King Adolf Fredrik died in 1771. Forssberg was eventually placed in the court of the Queen Dowager Louisa Ulrika as her foster child upon the suggestion of Louisa Ulrika's French chamber maid Michelle Elisabeth d'Ivry. According to what was later claimed, she came into this position after d'Ivry, had first suggested to her foster mother that she be placed in care of a French official of the Queen Dowager, who was then able to see her at her court and given the opportunity to express her wish to take her as her foster child: d'Ivry was allegedly assigned this task by Louisa Ulrika. The Queen Dowager was quite found of Forssberg, and referred to her as La Petite. When the dowager queen Louisa Ulrika died in 1782, she entrusted Forssberg to her daughter, Princess Sophia Albertina, and asked her to see to her well-being. Forssberg was described as a person with great charm, which was often given as the reason to why she became so favored by the royal family. In 1783, for example, she accompanied Princess Charlotte on a trip to the country. Sophia Albertina was very fond of Forssberg, who became her companion.  Investigation  In May or April 1795, a letter was found during a dinner at Sophia Albertina. The letter was addressed to an unnamed woman from another unnamed woman, and described the circumstances during the birth and childhood of Forssberg, at the time unofficial companion of Sophia Albertina. (search for all versions on WorldCat) The letter claimed Forssberg was born in the seventh month as the daughter of king Adolf Frederick and was left in the care of a merchant. The mother was not clearly pointed out, but could from the wording be interpreted to be either queen Louisa Ulrika or a lover of Adolf Frederik. In 1776, on the suggestion of the French chamber maid of Louisa Ulrika, madame d‚ÄôIvry, the child was moved to the custody of the spouse of the queen dowagers French hovm√§stare, from which she was taken care of by the queen dowager herself, after which her foster mother was sworn to an oath of silence. The letter also criticized Sophia Albertina for not having made Forssberg her lady in waiting and married her to a noble, but excused her with the suggestion, that she was perhaps not aware that Forssberg was her sister. The letter was clearly written by someone with knowledge about the affairs at court, and it also contained information which seemed likely. Forssberg was indeed raised in the household of Louisa Ulrika on the recommendation of madame d‚ÄôIvry, and Louisa Ulrika was described as deeply devoted to Forssberg, whom she treated in private as her own child and promised a great future. Louisa Ulrika also took a promise from Sophia Albertina that she should always love Forssberg and take care of her when Louisa Ulrika was dead. Sophia Albertina and her sister-in- law Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp made investigations on the matter and questioned the foster mother of Forssberg, who assured them that she was the biological mother, but who behaved suspiciously enough for them to doubt that she was telling the truth. The 12 October 1795 Sophia Albertina received an anonymous letter addressed to her with her mothers handwriting and seal. The letter was written by an anonymous woman who assured her that Forssberg was her sister but that her foster mother would never reveal anything, and that Louisa Ulrika had made a promise to Adolf Frederick that this fact was not to be revealed during the lifetime of Gustav III of certain reasons, and that Louisa Ulrika would have arranged a marriage for Forssberg to a noble if she had not died before. With the letter came a package containing a pearl necklace, a diamond and a miniature of Adolf Frederick. On 30 November, Sophia Albertina advertised, in discreet wording, in the paper Dagligt Allehanda to search the identity of the unknown writer of the letter. Sophia Albertina was by now herself convinced that Forssberg was her sister and revealed the affair to the regent de facto, Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, and the royal family. In January 1799, Sophia Albertina revealed the story to the minister of justice count Wachtmeister, who told her that he believed the story but that Forssberg could not be acknowledged without proof. The king questioned the foster mother of Forssberg who refused to admit anything by saying that she had given an oath of secrecy, and an investigation was issued by the monarch and the minister of justice  Public recognition  In 1799, Sophia Albertina announced in public that Forssberg was her sister in Sweden and Germany. The announcement made a scandal in Germany and the Preussian royal court initially refused to receive Sophia Albertina and Forssberg when they arrived to Berlin Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden made a public denial of Forssberg‚Äôs birth but eventually agreed to have Forssberg made official lady in waiting to Sophia Albertina and to be presented at court. Within the aristocracy, the rumour pointed out Forssberg as the daughter of king Adolf Frederick and the lady in waiting Ulrica Elisabeth von Liewen, which is regarded as the likely truth, though unconfirmed Queen Louisa Ulrika was to have promised to keep the birth of Forssberg secret and take care of her future, on condition that the relationship between Adolf Frederick and Liewen was kept secret, as she was deeply insulted by the adultery of her spouse: at the time, Adolf Frederick recently had another child with the ballerina Marguerite Du Londel The likeness between Forssberg, Frederick Adolf and Liewen was also pointed out. The story of the parentage of Lolotte Forssberg (by then countess Stenborg) was described in 1799 by count Fredrik Georg Str√∂mfelt in a letter to Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll (though the year is here 1769 instead of 1766): > \\"Queen Louisa Ulrika had a lady-in-waiting by the name Ulla Liewen, engaged > to count Per Brahe, son of the unhappy count Erik. In 1769 she fell sick and > was delivered of \\"The Petite\\", who was the daughter of Adolf Fredrik. The > queen was informed of the secret, but out of friendship for her maid of > honor, who had a good name for virtue and good customs - perhaps also in > reference to the utter jealousy, which Her Majesty had displayed in the > matter of the charming actress and dancer m:lle Dulondel, with whom the King > had a son called Fredriksson, a jealousy which caused the exile of m:lle > Dulondel from the realm - the queen promised her husband to care for the > child under the vow of secrecy. Those, who have seen countess Stenbock in > her younger years, as well as the portrait of Ulla Liewen, can not doubt the > matter. Beside, she looks like Adolf Fredrik, and this explains, why people > have found such as resemblance between her and princess Sofia > Albertina\\".Cecilia af Klercker (1927). Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok VI > 1797-1799. P.A. Norstedt & S√∂ners f√∂rlag Stockholm. p. 290-91 Sophia Albertina admitted that she believed Liewen was the mother of Forssberg but that she would have like to have kept it a secret and that she was surprised that everyone seemed to suspect the same.  Marriage and later life  Forssberg was engaged to count Carl Edvard Gyldenstolpe, who broke the engagement in 1798 (he married Vilhelmina Gyldenstolpe, daughter of the husband of Lolotte's alleged mother Ulla von Liewen), and in January 1799 to count Gustaf Harald Stenbock, courtier of Sophia Albertina, who had assisted in the investigations. Sophia Albertina arranged a marriage between Forssberg and count Gustaf Harald Stenbock, (related to queen Katarina Stenbock), an unusual arrangement for a woman who was officially the child of a servant. Later, it was said that the story of her royal father was made up just so she could marry the count. Stenbock believed that a marriage to Forssberg made in the in-law of the royal house. Their marriage was ridiculed as a scandal by the nobility. Lolotte was officially presented at court 10 May 1799 by Augusta von Fersen. The favoritism of the princess gave rise to the rumour that Forssberg was in fact the secret child of Sophia Albertina herself.Wilhelmina st√•lberg: Anteqningar om svenska qvinnor (Notes on Swedish women) (in Swedish) Sophie Albertine continued by making Forssberg her formal and official companion in 1800, her lady-in-waiting in 1818, and her head lady-in-waiting in 1823. At the death of Sophia Albertina in 1829, Forssberg was remembered in her will. Whatever the truth of Forssberg's true identity, the stories of her birth, both that she was the secret daughter of the king, and that she was the secret child of the princess, were among the most talked about of the era. When she married in 1799, she was referred to as ‚Äùone of the most talked about people at that time‚Äù. The truth of her parentage is unconfirmed, but it is considered likely that she was the secret illegitimate daughter of king Adolf Frederick and Ulla von Liewen.  Issue  Forssberg had a child in her thirties. In 1854 her son inherited Sundby Manor at Orn√∂, which as entailed property remained in his line to the present day.

Biography Graham was born in Lancashire and studied English at Liverpool University. He worked as a mill labourer, dairy operative and psychiatric nurse before training as a teacher. He taught in schools, colleges, prisons, special education and psychiatric units before becoming a freelance writer. He gained a doctorate from the University of Glamorgan and is a Distance Learning and eLearning specialist. He has been the Director of Studies for the Open College of the Arts and is now Professor of Creative Writing and Transcultural Literature at Lancaster University, where his academic research ranges from contemporary fiction and poetry and emergent African writing and narratives of diaspora to eLearning and literature development project design. In 2014 he was appointed as a National teaching Fellow. From October 2016, he was appointed an Extraordinary Professor at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa. He has also worked in Kurdistan and visited poetry festivals and translation projects in China and Vietnam.  Crossing Borders  In 2001, Graham designed and led the Crossing Borders scheme. The project was piloted in Uganda in 2001. By 2003, the project had developed into a major British Council/Lancaster University partnership involving Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Africa South Africa and Malawi. Crossing Borders employed a team of 25 writing mentors throughout the UK and reached more than 300 African writers, bringing a budget of ¬£375,000 to the University for this Third Mission activity. The Beyond Borders pan-African literature festival in Uganda in October 2005 involved writers from the UK and 17 African countries. The mentoring project was laid down in April 2006, but the website remains active and publishes a quarterly online magazine of new African writing. Recent achievements for Crossing Borders participants include Monica Arac de Nyeko of Uganda winning the Caine Prize for African Writing 2007Michelle Pauli, \\"Love story wins 'African Booker'\\", The Guardian, 10 July 2007. and Ellen Banda- Aaku, Zambia, winning the Commonwealth Short Story Competition.  Radiophonics  Graham devised Radiophonics as legacy activity to Crossing Borders. It was piloted in Uganda in autumn 2006, when 8 Crossing Borders writers took part in workshop and online mentoring to produce short stories for radio. The stories focused on topical themes and were broadcast on Sanyu FM (Kampala) as the Under the Sun series with live audience reaction to the stories. Graham Mort devised and produced the series with Faith Kinani of Sanyu FM. Kate Horsley was the project researcher and also designed online support systems. Each whole programme was mounted on the Crossing Borders site as podcasts intended to reach a global audience. Radiophonics has now been commissioned as a major project in Nigeria and Uganda, commencing in September 2007.  Centre for Transcultural Writing and Research  Graham is the director of Centre for Transcultural Writing and Research (CTWR) which was launched at Lancaster University in 2007 in order to create a transnational and interdisciplinary environment that will promote the study of creative writing across cultures. The Centre brings together a number of intercultural research projects: Crossing Borders, Moving Manchester, Radiophonics and Trans-Scriptions.

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009, accessed 26 Jan 2013 was an English nuclear physicist. Feather and Egon Bretscher were working at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge in 1940, when they proposed that the 239 isotope of element 94 (plutonium) would be better able to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. This research, a breakthrough, was part of the Tube Alloys project, the secret British project during World War II to develop nuclear weapons. Feather was the author of a series of noted introductory texts on the history, fundamental concepts, and meaning of physics. Early life and education He was born the son of Samson Feather, headmaster of Pecket Well, where he was born. The family moved during his infancy when his father became headmaster of Holme Primary School in Yorkshire, and his wife Lucy Clayton. He was educated at Bridlington Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1925 before taking a year in the University of London gaining a BSc in 1926. He was a Fellow of Trinity College from 1929 to 1933 then Fellow and Lecturer in Natural Sciences there from 1936 to 1945. Feather received his doctorate (PhD) at Cambridge in 1931 under James Chadwick and Ernest Rutherford. His research employed a Wilson cloud chamber and focused on the problem of the long-range alpha particles. In 1932 Feather married Kathleen Grace Burke (d.1975). Career=Discovery of the Neutron= In 1929, Feather took a year-long visit to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA. During his visit, he learned that Kelly Hospital used radon tubes in the treatment of cancers, and that the expired tubes were discarded after use. The expired radon tubes were a source of polonium, a source of energetic alpha particles. Since polonium was difficult to obtain and expensive at the time, Feather acquired a large number of the discarded radon tubes. The expired radon was to be used as a source of alpha particles for experiments in Cambridge. Indeed, the radioactive polonium source used by James Chadwick to discover the neutron in 1932 was derived from these radon tubes. Feather assisted Chadwick with his investigations leading to the discovery of the neutron. He then conducted some of the earliest investigations with the neutron. Feather obtained the first evidence that neutrons can produce nuclear disintegrations. The year 1932 would later be referred to as the \\"annus mirabilis\\" for nuclear physics in the Cavendish Laboratory. =Plutonium and Tube Alloys= In 1940 Feather and Egon Bretscher at the Cavendish Laboratory, made a breakthrough in nuclear research for the Tube Alloys project. They proposed that the 239 isotope of element 94 could be produced from the common isotope of uranium-238 by neutron capture. Like U-235, this new element should be able to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. A slow neutron reactor fueled with uranium would, in theory, produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product, since U-238 absorbs slow neutrons to form the new isotope U-239. This nuclide rapidly emits an electron, decaying into an element with a mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This nuclide then emits another electron to become a new element still of mass 239, but with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be readily 'fissionable' by both slow and fast neutrons, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium and therefore could easily be separated from it. This was confirmed independently in 1940 by Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Nicholas Kemmer of the Cambridge team proposed the names Neptunium for the new element 93 and Plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans fortuitously suggested the same names. The production and identification of the first sample of plutonium in 1941 is generally credited to Glenn Seaborg, who used a cyclotron rather than a reactor. =Professor in Edinburgh= Feather was Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh from 1945 to 1975, then Emeritus Professor. He was active in nuclear physics research throughout his career, preferring small-scale, modest experiments, rather than the large experiments that became common after the war. Feather was noted for his active service to the University of Edinburgh and the city of Edinburgh. Feather was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1945. From 1946 he was also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (his proposers including C. T. R. Wilson) and was President of that Society from 1967 to 1970. Feather won the Makdougall Brisbane Prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1968-70. =Author= Beginning in 1936, Feather authored several monographs on nuclear physics and basic introductory physics, including a biography of Rutherford in 1940. J.D. Jackson cited Feather's monograph on Electricity and Matter as a good account of the history of electricity and magnetism \\"with a perceptive discussion of the original experiments.\\" Death Feather died on 14 August 1978 at Christie Hospital in Manchester.

Nazzari was one of the leading figures of Italian classic cinema, often considered a local variant of the Australian-American star Errol Flynn. Although he emerged as a star during the Fascist era, Nazzari's popularity continued well into the post-war years. Early career Amedeo Nazzari was born as Amedeo Carlo Leone Buffa in Cagliari, Sardinia, in 1907 and he later adopted as his professional name the name of his maternal grandfather, Amedeo Nazzari, A magistrate who had been the President of the Court of Appeal of Vicenza in Veneto and later took the same position in Cagliari. Although Amedeo eventually moved to Rome, he always retained a slight trace of his native Sardinian accent.Gundle p.194 While Nazzari was keen on gaining film contracts much of his early experience was in the theatre. He entered a contest organised by Twentieth Century Fox to find an Italian actor to fill the boots of the recently deceased screen star Rudolph Valentino, but lost out to Alberto Rabagliati.Gundle p.186 He was rejected after screen tests by Italian professionals, who found him too tall, thin and thought he had a too gloomy expression.Gundle p.186 Nazzari made his debut in Ginevra degli Almieri (1935), following a recommendation from Elsa Merlini.Gundle p.191 His first read role came with the 1936 film Cavalry, and he followed it up with The Castiglioni Brothers (1937). His breakthrough came with the 1938 film Luciano Serra, Pilot (1938) where he played a First World War veteran who returns to fight for Italy during the Abyssinian War. Nazzari was transformed into a matinee idol, the most bankable star of Italian cinema.Gundle p.184 Following the film, Nazzari was invited to join the Fascist Party by Benito Mussolini, but declined saying \\"Thank You Duce! I would prefer not to concern myself with politics, occupied as I am with more pressing artistic commitments\\".Gundle p.185 Stardom Despite declining to join the party Nazzari, along with a handful of other actor such as Fosco Giachetti, was considered the model of a Male Hero. Most of his film roles from this point present him as a masculine (often military) figure. His emergence as a star coincided with a major drive by the Italian government to rebuild the country's film industry which had declined since its heyday in the silent era. This policy involved large-scale government funding of films and the construction of the massive Cinecitt√† studio complex in Rome. The number of films produced each year climbed rapidly, with Nazzari a particularly prolific actor (making six films in 1939 and eight in 1941).Gundle p.191 During the era he appeared opposite most of the leading Italian actresses including Alida Valli, Lilia Silvi, Luisa Ferida, Mariella Lotti, Assia Noris, Vera Carmi and Clara Calamai, often more than once. Nazzari was almost always cast as a straightforward hero, and he closely protected his public persona to avoid any negative roles. An exception was the historical comedy-drama film The Jester's Supper (1942) in which he plays a loutish figure. Nazzari made four films with Alida Valli, including Unjustified Absence (1939). Following Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, he combined romances and comedies, with occasional more propagandistic productions. Amongst the more political was Bengasi (1942), an anti-British war film set in Libya. Nazzari portrays an Italian patriot who masquerades as a collaborator with the British occupiers of Bengazi in order to steal their battle plans. It was the only time he featured alongside the other great male star of the era, Fosco Giachetti. Later career Nazzari in the 1950 film Il Brigante Musolino Star of Italian cinema during the 1940s and 1950s. He made several melodramas with Raffaello Matarazzo, such as Catene in 1949. Nazzari acts himself in Federico Fellini's Nights of Cabiria.

Ratican began the 1922‚Äì23 season with the Fall River Marksmen, but a torn ligament in his leg prevented him from playing any games with the team. Ratican left Fall River in September 1922 to coach the West Point soccer team. He was not released from his playing contract with Fall River until December 1922 at which time he began seeking playing opportunities with other ASL teams. When those did not materialize, he left the northeast on the completion of the collegiate season to return to St. Louis to rejoin Ben Millers, scoring two goals in his debut. He then returned to the ASL later that year to play one game with the New York Giants. He then gave up playing for several years, except for guest appearances with various St. Louis teams. In 1925, Ratican began playing regularly with his team Ratican‚Äôs in the SLSL. He remained with Ratican‚Äôs until it changed sponsorship in 1927. He then continued playing with the renamed team, now known as Tablers for the 1927‚Äì28 season. Tablers won the SLSL title that season. =Managerial career= In September 1922, Ratican was hired by the U.S. Military Academy, better known as West Point, to coach the school‚Äôs soccer team. Following the completion of the collegiate season, he returned to St. Louis, playing for Ben Millers then serving as an assistant coach with St. Louis Scullin Steel F.C.. This pattern continued for several years as Ratican coached West Point then returned to St. Louis during the off season to play or coach local teams. In 1924, Ratican formed a team, known appropriately as Ratican‚Äôs, which he entered in the St. Louis Soccer League. The team performed poorly, finishing fourth out of four teams with a 2-12-4 record. They improved the next season, finishing third with a 4-6-4 record. In 1927, Ratican‚Äôs again finished last, with a 1-8-3 record. In 1927, Tabler‚Äôs took over sponsorship of Ratican‚Äôs team, renaming the squad, Tablers. Ratican was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame and St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame in 1950.St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame Baseball In addition to soccer, Ratican also played minor league baseball. He spent some time with the Quincy Gems of the Three-I League. Then played outfield for the Bethlehem Steel company team.

History Founded by a group of Chicago businessmen on March 29, 1897, it was originally the Glen View Golf and Polo Club; its name was shortened a few years later to the Glen View Club. The club was situated so as to be close to a commuter railroad from Chicago, and the village of Golf got its name from the simple sign ‚Äì \\"Golf\\" ‚Äì that directed riders from the makeshift station to the course. In 1899, Glen View Club was one of the founding clubs of the Western Golf Association and hosted the inaugural Western Open and Western Amateur tournaments that same year. Other notable founding clubs included Chicago Golf Club, Skokie Country Club, Onwentsia Club, and Evanston Golf Club. Golf The par-72 golf course at Glen View measures from the back tees, and carries a rating of 73.4 and a slope It is the second-oldest 18-hole course in the Chicago area, after Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton. Richard Leslie, the first head professional, who consulted with Herbert J. Tweedie on the design, is credited with the original layout of the golf course. In 1910, Tom Bendelow was credited with changes to Glen View‚Äôs hazard scheme. Bendelow is well known for his designs at Medinah Country Club, Skokie Country Club, Beverly Country Club, East Lake Golf Club and Olympia Fields Country Club. In 1913, two of the games most prolific architects, Harry Colt and Donald Ross, began changes to Glen View. Harry Colt, referred to frequently as H.S. or more formally as Henry Shapland, was known for participating in the design of over 300 golf courses around the globe, primarily in the United Kingdom. His most notable work in the United States was with George Arthur Crump at Pine Valley Golf Club, a course frequently ranked as the best in the country. Donald Ross is most famous for his work at Pinehurst No. 2, Aronimink Golf Club, East Lake Golf Club, Seminole Golf Club, Oak Hill Country Club, Inverness Club and Oakland Hills. In 1922, select holes of Glen View were redesigned by William S. Flynn. Flynn is most well-known for his design of Shinnecock Hills (on Long Island, New York). The course as it stands today still includes elements from each of the aforementioned architects. Glen View was the home club of the legendary Chick Evans the namesake of the Evans Scholars Program. A member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, he won both the U.S. Amateur and the U.S. Open in 1916, and a second U.S. Amateur The course has hosted several major tournaments, including the inaugural Western Open and Western Amateur in 1899, the U.S. Amateur in 1902, and the U.S. Open in 1904. Annual member events include a member-member tournament called the \\"Royal and Ancient,\\" and a member-guest tournament called \\"Twa Days.\\" Clubhouse The original clubhouse was designed by Holabird & Roche, known today as Holabird & Root, with help from consulting architect Daniel Burnham. The original clubhouse opened in 1898 but was destroyed by a fire in May 1920. The club once again turned to Holabird & Roche to design a new clubhouse that was built on the same site and exists to this day. Other activities The club also has facilities for paddle tennis, tennis, skeet and trap shooting, and swimming.

It is a continuation of historian-priest John of Fordun's earlier work Chronica Gentis Scotorum beginning with the founding of Ireland and thereby Scotland by Scota with Go√≠del Glas. Queen Scota's name means \\"blossom\\" in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Scotti was once a synonym for Irish, indicating that they (Irish and Scots) are \\"people of the blossom,\\" or descendants of Queen Scota. Importance The National Library of Scotland has called it \\"probably the most important medieval account of early Scottish history\\", noting that it provides both a strong expression of national identity and a window into the world view of medieval commentators. The text includes a reference to \\"the famous murderer, Robin Hood, as well as Little John\\", one of the earliest records of Robin Hood and Little John. The reference is found, in Latin, under year 1266. The work Bower began the work in 1440 at the request of a neighbour, Sir David Stewart of Rosyth. The completed work, in its original form, consists of 16 books, of which the first five and a portion of the sixth (to 1163) are Fordun's‚Äîor mainly his, for Bower added to them at places. In the later books, down to the reign of Robert I (1371), he was aided by Fordun's Gesta Annalia, but from that point to the close, the work is original and of contemporary importance, especially for James I, with whose death it ends. The task was finished in 1447. Criticism Bower has been described as a less competent chronicler than Fordun, with one commenter calling him \\"garrulous, irrelevant and inaccurate\\" and noting that he \\"makes every important occurrence an excuse for a long- winded moral discourse\\". Abridgments Bower engaged in a reduction or \\"abridgment\\" of the Scotichronicon in the last two years of his life, which is known as the Book of Cupar, and which is preserved in the Advocates' library, Edinburgh (MS. 35. 1. 7).
