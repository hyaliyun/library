British forces defeated the pirates in the Cape Fear River estuary which led to Bonnet's death by hanging in Charleston. Background During the end of the Golden Age of Piracy, the Royal Navy was constantly in campaign against pirates in the Caribbean and off North America. Stede Bonnet was a very successful pirate, having captured several merchant ships and assembled his own squadron of pirate ships. In August 1718, Bonnet was sailing from the Delaware Bay to the Cape Fear River. He commanded his sloop-of-war flagship Royal James and two other armed sloops, Francis and Fortune. Royal James was a former flagship of Blackbeard which was armed with eight cannon. The other two sloops were similarly armed. All together, 46 pirates crewed them. Royal James was in need of careening and the hurricane season was soon to come so Bonnet chose the Cape Fear estuary as a reliable shelter against storms. For the next few weeks, Bonnet's crew repaired the Royal James with material salvaged from a captured shallop. In late August, reports of Bonnet's sloops in the Cape Fear River reached Governor Robert Johnson of South Carolina. Johnson ordered Militia Colonel William Rhett to command an operation to destroy the pirate threat. He did not have regular Royal Navy Sailors under his command, but locally raised sailors from Charleston. At the colonel's disposal were two eight-gun sloops with a combined 130 men. Battle Colonel Rhett reached the Cape Fear River estuary on the night of September 26, 1718, and was sighted by Bonnet and his men. Believing the sloops to be that of merchants, the pirates boarded three canoes and headed for the unrecognized South Carolinian expedition. It was at this time that Rhett's flagship, Henry, ran aground on a sandbar. This allowed the canoes to approach close enough to discover the identity of the grounded vessel. Once they did they turned about and paddled back to their ships unharmed. Instead of fleeing up the small river in darkness, Bonnet decided that he would fight his way back to the sea, so the next morning at daylight, the pirates prepared to pass the two British sloops, which were now free of the sandbar. They dispersed amongst Royal James, Fortune and Francis and loaded their arms. At daylight the following morning, Bonnet raised his flag and attacked. They sailed for a few minutes until they came within range of the enemy ships, then opened fire with cannon and muskets. The British sloops returned fire and split up, but Henry ran aground again along with the other ship. To avoid enemy fire, Stede Bonnet steered his vessels close to the western shore of the river, and they ran aground on sand. A memorial in Charleston commemorating the hanging of Stede Bonnet at White Point. At this point, only Henry and Royal James were within range of each other. For five to six hours, the two sides dueled, each unable to move. Henry was grounded in a position which left her crew with minimal cover from incoming fire. The opposite was true for Royal James, whose hull provided a bulwark against enemy fire. During the fighting, Bonnet stayed on deck with his pistol in hand and warned that he would shoot any man who showed cowardice. The pirates' morale was good though; they cheered each other on and dared the South Carolinians to board. After five hours of fighting the South Carolinians had suffered 30 casualties, with nine pirates also killed or injured. The British sloops were downstream, and when the water began to rise in the early afternoon, Rhett's sloops were freed, while Bonnet's remained stranded. The British repaired their rigging and raised their sails. Soon after, Henry was in a position to fire its starboard guns directly onto the deck of Bonnet's Royal James. Bonnet ordered his gunner George Ross to light the powder magazine and scuttle Royal James, but he was persuaded not to by his surviving crewmen who had already surrendered. After another few moments of conflict, Royal James was boarded and its crew captured. Aftermath The South Carolinians suffered twelve killed and eighteen wounded, while the pirates sustained twelve casualties and all the survivors were captured. Bonnet was taken to Charleston, arriving on October 3 to await trial on charges of piracy. Bonnet was separated from the majority of his crew and held for almost a month at the home of a Charleston provost marshal. With him was his boatswain, Ignatius Pell, and the sailing master, David Herriott, all of whom escaped with the help of two slaves and a Native American and possibly local merchant Richard Tookerman. Governor Robert Johnson immediately ordered a ¬£700 bounty to be awarded to any man who could kill or capture the pirates. Herriott was shot and killed on Sullivan Island a few days later and Bonnet, the gentleman pirate, was soon recaptured after a skirmish on Sullivan's Island and hanged on December 10, 1718.

It is currently inactive. The product of Project Constant Peg, the unit was created to expose the tactical air forces to the flight characteristics of fighter aircraft used by Soviet Union during the Cold War. The declassified history of the squadron shows that it operated MiG-17s, MiG-21s and MiG-23s between 1977 and 1988, but it was not formally disbanded until July 1990. The mission of Constant Peg was to train Air Force, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps pilots and weapon systems officers, in air combat tactics against these foreign aircraft and was instrumental in the re-development of dissimilar air combat training (DACT) methods developed after the Vietnam War. Today's USAF aggressor training squadrons can symbolically trace their histories back to the 4477th, as well as the paint motifs on their aircraft, which were used by the aircraft of the squadron in the 1970s and 1980s. History The longest continuing United States classified military airplane program is the testing and evaluation of Foreign Aircraft Technology. During the Cold War, secret test flying of Mikoyan-and-Gurevich Design Bureau (MiG) and other Soviet aircraft was an ongoing mission dating back to the acquisition of the first Soviet-built Yakovlev Yak-23 in 1953. This effort has continued to the present day. Unlike the other \\"black\\" airplane programs, such as the Have Blue, Lockheed U-2, or Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, Foreign Aircraft Technology operations still remain classified. Despite the declassification of the Constant Peg program in 2006, the evaluation of foreign aircraft likely continues. It is not known exactly the actual number or types of aircraft involved, where they came from, or the complete history of the program. It is estimated that in 1985 the USAF had 26 MiGs (MiG-21s and MiG-23s as MiG-17s had already been phased out) and by the end of the program USAF had mainly MiG-21s. It is known that the activities of the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron brought about a fundamental change in United States Air Force and United States Navy / United States Marine Corps air combat tactics. They revitalized the art of dogfighting at a time when, seemingly, it had nearly been forgotten. The knowledge gained from testing the aircraft the squadron flew was reflected in the success of United States air operations during the Vietnam War, as well as the founding of the Air Force's Red Flag program and the United States Navy's TOPGUN school.http://aviationweek.com/blog/we-didn-t- know-what-90-percent-switches-did =Origins= In the late 1950s, a new generation of United States fighters was being developed. As a result of the development of air-to-air missiles, fighter aircraft, such as the U.S. Navy's F4H Phantom II, were developed. Later redesignated the F-4 in 1962, the aircraft was the first fighter designed from the start with only air-to-air missiles, carrying both radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow III and the shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared-guided missiles. With the new missiles came the new attitude that dog-fighting was obsolete. The air-to-air training given to new Navy and Marine Corps F-4 crews was extremely limited. It involved about ten flights and provided little useful information. By 1964, few in the Navy and Marine Corps were left to carry on the tradition of classic dogfighting.Peebles, Curtis, (1999), Dark Eagles, Presidio Press; Revised edition, Then came the Vietnam War. The early years of the air war over North Vietnam showed the faith placed in missiles was terribly in error. Between 1965 and the bombing halt in 1968, the USAF had a 2.15 to 1 kill ratio. The U.S. Navy was doing slightly better with a 2.75 to 1 rate. For roughly every two North Vietnamese Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17s or MiG-21s shot down, an American F-4 Phantom II, F-105 Thunderchief, or F-8 Crusader would be lost. This was far worse than the 10-plus to 1 kill rate during the Korean War. More serious, the percentage of United States fighters being lost in air-to-air combat was growing. During 1966, only 3 percent of U.S. aircraft losses were due to MiGs. This rose to 8 percent in 1967, then climbed to 22 percent for the first three months of 1968. The emphasis on air-to-air missile interception meant the fighter combat crews had only the sketchiest knowledge of dogfighting. Originally conceived as a naval fleet air defense aircraft, and later adapted as an Air Force fighter-bomber, the design of the F-4 made it ill-suited for a tight-turning dogfight. In contrast to the lighter MiG-17, the F-4 was large and heavy. When a tight turn was made, the F-4 would lose energy and airspeed. The MiG-17's superior turning capability then allowed it to close to gun range. All too often, hits from the MiG-17's \\"outmoded\\" cannons would then destroy the F-4. Under the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL programs, the first MiGs flown in the United States, were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance and technical capabilities, as well as in operational capability, pitting the types against U.S. fighters. The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) at NAS Miramar, California. During the remainder of the Vietnam War, the Navy kill ratio climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1. The reason for this difference was TOPGUN. The Navy (to include the Marine Corps) had revitalized its air combat training, while the Air Force had stayed stagnant. Most of the Navy MiG kills were by TOPGUN graduates. By 1970, the HAVE DRILL program was expanded; a few selected fleet F-4 crews were given the chance to fight the MiGs. The most important result of Project HAVE DRILL is that no Navy pilot who flew in the project defeated the MiG-17 in the first engagement. The Have Drill dogfights were by invitation only. The other pilots based at Nellis Air Force Base were not to know about the U.S.-operated MiGs. To prevent any sightings, the airspace above the Groom Lake portion of the Nellis Range was closed. On aeronautical maps, the exercise area was marked in red ink. The forbidden zone became known as \\"Red Square\\". The idea of a more realistic training program for the Air Force was devised by USAF Colonel Gail Peck, a Vietnam veteran F-4 pilot, who was dissatisfied with his service's fighter pilot training. After the war, he worked at the Department of Defense, where he heard about the HAVE DRILL and HAVE DOUGHNUT programs. He won the support of USAF General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Jr. and launched \\"Constant Peg,\\" named after Vandenberg's callsign, \\"Constant,\\" and Peck's wife, Peg. =MiGs acquisitions= Two USAF F-5Es flanking a MiG-17 and MiG-21 of the 4477th Tactical Evaluation Squadron Tactical Air Command established the 4477th Test and Evaluation Flight as the formal USAF testing unit on 1 April 1977. It began with three MiGs: two MiG-17Fs and a MiG-21 loaned by Israel, who had captured them from the Syrian Air Force and Iraqi Air Force. Later, it added MiG-21s from the Indonesian Air Force and other sources. In the late 1960s, the MiG-17 and MiG-21F were still frontline aircraft. A few Algerian MiGs-21F-13s were delivered via Israel as result of pilot error. Clandestine procurement of stored MiG-17, MiG-19 and MiG-21, all in operating condition but stored, was negotiated in the end of 1960s with Indonesia. U.S. Air Force offered $250,000 for each plane, as previously these planes had been received from Korea, Pakistan, Cambodia and Israel. Additional units were desired for testing and eventually the creation of a MiG mock training squadron. Indonesia sold in the early 1970s 10 MiG-21F-13, 1 MiG-21U and 2 LiM-5P. In mid 1970s 16 Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II were delivered to Indonesia in exchange for those stored MiG-21s which ended up in 4477th Squadron. MiGs were acquired from scrapyards, dug out of remote places where they‚Äôd crashed, recovered from warehouses where they had been left or just bought from other air forces. CIA clandestine purchase sources in Poland and Romania may have probably supplied MiG spare parts. Morocco sold some stored MiG-17s. Mig-19s were tested in HAVE BOAT program, but were not assigned to 4477th. Finland, Jugoeslavia and India could have been contacted for assistance in MiG-21 maintenance. How the MiGs were maintained in flying status is an interesting story. By the late 1970s, United States MiG operations were undergoing another change. After a decade, purchased MiGs had been superseded by later-model MiG-21s and new MiG-23 fighters. Fortunately, a new source of supply of Soviet aircraft became available in Egypt and Somalia. In the mid-1970s, relations between Egypt and the Soviet Union had become strained, and Soviet advisers were ordered out. The Soviets had provided the Egyptian air force with MiGs since the mid-1950s. Before breaking up with Soviet Union Egypt had received MiG-23 fighters and modern MiG-21 fighters, besides Soviet advisers taught Egyptian pilots how to use them against Israeli F-4 Phantoms. With their traditional source out of the picture, the Egyptians began looking West to keep their MiGs in service. They turned to United States companies for parts to support their late-model MiG-21s and MiG-23s. Very soon, a deal was made with USAF. Egyptian president Anwar Sadat is believed to have sold in 1977 12 MiG-23MS Flogger E interceptors and one MiG-23BN Flogger F fighter-bomber. Egypt may have included in the deal MiG-21MFs together with the Mig-23s. USAF supplied 36 F-4Es in exchange. The two MiG-23 variants were assigned to secret test programs HAVE PAD and HAVE BOXER. Although this was denied by Egypt on 26 April 1984 General Robert Bond died while piloting a MiG-23, and this confirmed the secret. The Egyptian planes were disassembled and shipped from Egypt to Edwards Air Force Base. They were then transferred initially to Groom Lake for reassembly and study. In November 1980, the first MiG-23 was flown by the 4477th at Tonopah when first MiG-23BN Flogger F was received after Area 51 tests ended. Other MiG-23s were received many years later from ex-East Germany stocks. Germany is believed to have sold 12 MiG-23ML, 2 MiG-23BN, 2 Su-22M4 and 1 MiG-29. In 1987, the U.S. Air Force bought 12 new Shenyang F-7Bs from China for use in the Constant Peg program. At the same time, it retired the remaining MiG-21F-13 acquired from Indonesia.\\"We didn't know what 90 percent of the switches did\\"  Ares =Operations= The mission of 4077th squadron was to train U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps pilots on the best ways to fight and win when encountering MiGs in aerial combat. During first year 1,015 sorties were done and 372 Air Force and Navy pilots took the MiG experience at Tonopah. Each training course lasted 7 days on average and included 5 mock aerial combats, three MiG-21s and two MiG-23s. \\"Red 49\\" MiG-23 on the Tonopah ramp, 1988 The United States operated MiGs received special designations. There was the practical problem of what to call the aircraft in mission logs and paperwork. This was solved by giving them numbers in the Century Series. The MiG-21s and Shenyang F-7Bs were called the \\"YF-110\\" (the original designation for the USAF F-4C), while the MiG-23s were called the \\"YF-113\\". The focus of Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) limited the use of the MiGs as tools with which to understand the performance, capabilities and qualities of the enemy. By contrast, Tactical Air Command was interested in training the front line tactical fighter pilots. Air Force Systems Command recruited its MiG pilots from the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California, who were usually graduates from either the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards or the Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. Tactical Air Command selected its MiG pilots primarily from the ranks of the Weapons School and Aggressors at Nellis AFB. Similarly, the US Navy and US Marine Corps pilots were recruited from the instructors of the Navy Fighter Weapons School. The aircraft were collected at the Department of Energy's Tonopah Test Range, where they were flown by the squadron. The squadron operated MiG-17s until 1982, but mostly MiG-21s and MiG-23s. When possible additional Soviet equipment was added to the planes and tested against USAF planes, like a flare dispenser from a Sukhoi Su-25 shot down in Afghanistan. This proved to be very important as tests with real Soviet equipment proved several times USAF equipment was designed according to American specifications, different from the Soviet ones, and results against the \\"real thing\\" were many times surprisingly different than expected. The maintainers of the 4477th made miracles to keep the MiGs in service. Considering MiGs were not built to last, no instruction manuals and technical data were available and, last but not least, no spare parts or components were easy to get they made a pretty good job. In best cases MiGs were delivered from unknown sources and were dismantled for spares. In worst cases reverse engineering was needed. Sometimes CIA sources or US manufacturers supplied components. From 1977 to 1988 the 4477th Squadron flew three models of MiGs. After being active for more than a decade the secret aggressor unit flew their MiGs in more than 15,000 sorties. To minimize risks MiGs never flew in bad weather or at night. The end of Cold War and high costs of keeping the MiGs in flight condition meant the program was ended in March 1988. =Aggressor training= The lackluster performance of USAF fighter pilots in Vietnam was studied by the United States Air Force Fighter Weapons School at Nellis AFB, Nevada during the early 1970s. Combat reports showed that the lack of training in flying basic fighter maneuvers was a major cause of the low air-to-air kill rate, as well some technical limitations in the F-4, the primary fighter in use by the Air Force in Vietnam. The 414th Fighter Weapons Squadron, part of the Fighter Weapons School had flown its F-4s against the HAVE FERRY MiG-17F, which was fundamentally different than flying against the F-105 and other United States fighters. It was considered useful to establish a squadron dedicated to Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) employing pilots trained in Soviet fighter tactics Using aircraft with flight characteristics similar to the MiGs that American aircrews would face in combat. Combat training would change from an F-4 flying against another F-4 to flying against a fundamentally different aircraft, flown by a pilot who would think and fly like a Soviet pilot.Davies, Chapter 2, A Genesis for the Red Eagles, 1972‚Äì1977 The 64th Fighter Weapons Squadron, equipped with Northrop T-38 Talons was activated in October 1972 as the USAF's first \\"Aggressor\\" squadron. Its pilots were trained against the Soviet MiGs at Groom Lake, and would use the T-38s to fly against Tactical Air Command pilots, employing known Soviet fighter tactics against them in air-to-air combat training. They were also trained to fly against acquired Soviet air defense systems similar to those that US pilots had faced over North Vietnam. The pilots of the 64th were also well- seasoned combat veterans of the Vietnam War, many with Distinguished Flying Crosses and over 100 combat missions over North Vietnam. Beginning in the spring of 1973, the squadron began deploying to TAC bases in the United States to perform DACT training against F-4 pilots. The training program was successful, and beginning in November 1975, a large-scale exercise \\"Red Flag 1\\" was held at Nellis AFB where training was held on a large scale. The acquired Soviet air defense radar was installed at several locations on the Nellis range, and simulated Soviet integrated missile and antiaircraft artillery batteries, similar to what was faced in Vietnam and by Israeli pilots during the 1973 Yom Kippur War were set up. Selected TAC pilots were taken to Groom Lake to train against the HAVE FERRY MiG-17. In the summer of 1975, the 65th Fighter Weapons Squadron was established as the second \\"Aggressor\\" squadron. With the Fall of Saigon, the United States had some 70 F-5E Tiger II fighter aircraft in storage, which were paid for by Congress to send to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. The T-38s used by the Aggressor squadrons were trainers and similar to the F-5, but were not combat aircraft and were not ideal in the role of simulating the performance of the Soviet MiG, however the higher-performance F-5E was. When South Vietnam collapsed, the T-38s were replaced by the F-5Es as the \\"Aggressor\\" aircraft. The circumstances also allowed the creation of two more Aggressor Squadrons in 1975/1976, the 26th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron at Clark Air Base, Philippines, to train PACAF pilots and the 527th Tactical Fighter Training Aggressor Squadron at RAF Alconbury, England to train USAFE pilots. =Establishment of the 4477th= During the 1970s, the number of acquired Soviet aircraft increased to include more MiG-21s and some MiG-23s. The number of aircraft and the expanded use of the facility at Groom Lake to train new Aggressor pilots was becoming more and more awkward. It was decided to move the Aggressor training program to a less secure, remote facility. The Tonopah Test Range Airport, only to the northwest of Groom Lake and on the controlled AEC Tonopah Test Range fitted the need for a new home. The AEC airport had the potential for improvement and expansion, with the only public land overlooking the base miles away. Although not as hidden as Groom Lake, the airport would be remote enough to operate the Soviet aircraft. In fact, the security surrounding the Tonopah Test Range was so effective that the new base was not publicly reported as an Air Force military airfield until 1985. On 1 April 1977 Tactical Air Command established the 4477th Test and Evaluation Flight, which assumed the personnel and equipment of the un-designated testing unit at Groom Lake and moved the program to Tonopah TRA. The unit was officially assigned to Nellis AFB under the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. \\"Red 84\\" MiG-21F-13 taxiing past the control tower, 1986 The 4477th pilots and tactical controllers were Aggressors, Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun instructors. Most were majors, a few captains, with 2000‚Äì3000 hours. Two pilots of the 4477th died flying the Soviet planes. USAF claims pilots had no manuals for the aircraft, although some tried to write one, nor was there a consistent supply of spare parts, which had to be refurbished or manufactured at high cost or procured from friendly nations. Students fighting those USAF Migs were supposed to learn enough to be able to kill a Mig, or at least to survive, in their first real dogfight with a Mig. =4477th TEF/TES Accidents= On 23 August 1979, a pilot lost control of the squadron's MiG-17F, USAF serial 002. U.S. Navy Lieutenant M. Hugh Brown, 31, of the U.S. Navy's Test and Evaluation Squadron FOUR (VX-4), \\"Bandit 12\\", originally of Roanoke, Virginia, entered a spin while dogfighting a U.S. Navy F-5. Brown recovered, but entered a second irrecoverable spin too low to eject. The plane hit the ground at a steep angle near the Tonopah Test Range airfield boundary, killing the pilot instantly. On 21 October 1982, USAF Captain Mark Postai crashed with a MiG-23. On 26 April 1984, USAF Lieutenant General Robert M. \\"Bobby\\" Bond, then vice commander of Air Force Systems Command, died attempting to eject after losing control of his MiG-23 while supersonic. A few hours after the crash, Headquarters, Air Force Systems Command, at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland issued a brief statement: \\"Lt. Gen. Robert M. Bond, vice commander, Air Force Systems Command, was killed today in an accident while flying in an Air Force specially modified test aircraft\\". Three-star generals do not generally fly test missions, so Bond's death attracted press interest. The fact that the Air Force also refused to identify the type of plane also raised questions. Early reports claimed he had been flying \\"a super-secret Stealth fighter prototype.\\" The death of a three-star general led the Air Force to reveal that it was flying Soviet aircraft.F-117A: The crash of General Robert M Bond Biographies : Lieutenant General Robert M. Bond A boulevard cut-off between Eglin Air Force Base (main base) and Hurlburt Field in Florida is named in his honor. =End of operations= Squadron members with one of the F-5E Trainers/DACT aircraft Near the end of the Cold War the program was ostensibly abandoned and the squadron was disbanded. Flight operations at Tonopah closed down in March 1988, although the 4477th was not inactivated until July 1990, according to one official Air Force history. In the interim, a handful of pilots flew 'continuation training (CT)' sorties at Groom Lake. The decision to shut down operations may have had something to do with the fact that a new generation of Soviet aircraft was entering service and also the inevitable round of budget cuts from Washington. The assets of the Squadron could not go to the boneyard at Davis‚ÄìMonthan AFB, and the fate of some of them remain classified. Several of the F-110s (MiG-21) were sent to museums or now are on static display. Some of the airplanes may have been broken up, and its rumored that some were buried in the Nevada desert. Also a few were used for target practice on Air Force weapons ranges. =Others= 4477th inventory * 1980: 1 x MiG-17F, 1 x Lim-5P (MiG-17PF), 6 x MiG-21F-13. * 1981: 2 x MiG-17F, 1 x Lim-5P, 6 x MiG-21F-13, 1 MiG-23BN. * 1982: 6 x MiG-21F-13, 2 x MiG-21MF, 1 x MiG-23BN, 2 x MiG-23MS. * 1983: 6 x MiG-21F-13, 3 x MiG-21MF, 2 x MiG-23BN, 4 x MiG-23MS. * 1984: 15 x MiG-21F-13/MF, 4 x MiG-23BN/MS. * 1985: 17 x MiG-21F-13/MF, 10 x MiG-23BN/MS. * 1986: 14 x MiG-21F-13/MF, 10 x MiG-23BN/MS. * 1987: all MiGs-21F-13 retired and replaced by Chengdu J-7B. 14 x MiG-21, 10 x MiG-23BN/MS. * 1988: 14 x MiG-21, 9 x MiG-23BN/MS.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that exploitation of foreign aircraft today has returned to the original hierarchy seen in the 1960s and 1970s when HAVE IDEA became the umbrella program for exploiting foreign tactical fighters: the 'assets' are exploited first for performance, materials and qualities by Air Force Materiel Command (the successor to AFSC), before Air Force Combat Command (the successor to TAC) is then given access to the aircraft for tactical exploitation. There have been multiple sightings of foreign aircraft over Nevada since the end of Constant Peg and the inactivation of the 4477th TES: In a March 1994 article on Groom Lake in Popular Science, a photo was published of an Su-22 fighter in flight. The plane was painted in a green and tan finish. The Su-22 is a swing-wing, light- attack aircraft. It was in frontline Russian Air Force service at the time and was exported widely to Eastern European and Third World countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Also in 1993, the United States and Germany trained with former East German MiG-23s and two Su-22s which were sent to the United States. With East and West Germany now unified, there was an ample supply of both Soviet-built planes and the spare parts needed to support them. In October 1994, Aerospace Daily reported that \\"reliable observers\\" had sighted an Su-27 Flanker on two occasions. The Su-27 is a Russian first-line advanced interceptor. It is in operation with both the Russia and People's Republic of China air forces. In 2014, it is believed that Air Combat Command (ACC) shares access to Mikoyan MiG-29s and Su-27 aircraft somewhere in Nevada (most likely Groom Lake) flying against Fighter Weapons School instructors, 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron aircrews and F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon \\"Aggressor\\" aircraft flying from Nellis AFB. =Lineage= * Established by Tactical Air Command as 4477th Test and Evaluation Flight and activated, 1 April 1977 : Status changed to Squadron and re-designated: 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron, 1 May 1980 : Inactivated on 15 July 1990Email from Daniel L.

The film is shot in several cities of Pakistan, while special shots made in Royal Park, Lahore. Premise Set in Pakistan, against the backdrop of the War on Terror and the prevalent consequences of the war stigmatizing Pakistan as a country that breeds and indoctrinates terrorism. The filmmakers intended Son of Pakistan to enlighten the masses and the world at large about Pakistan and its people against the backdrop of the War on Terror's consequences. The filmmakers intended to counter a negative prejudice about Pakistan and its people as terrorists -- and to show their perspective that the people of Pakistan follow a peaceful way of life. The movie tells the story of a dutiful police officer S.P. Islam who comes from a patriotic upbringing as does his brother. Son of Pakistan depicts uncertainty in the concept of patriotism while taking the protagonist's perspective of compassion towards his fellow citizens when he cannot be certain that everyone shares his beliefs. In a place of uncertainty being an enforcer of law where he comes across a potential terrorist every day, he can't trust anyone and has only himself to trust.

Resolution =Observations= The Security Council reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other states in the region, and particularly its sovereignty of natural resources on its territory. It reiterated its commitment to put an end to the plundering of resources in the country in support of the peace process. The situation in the country continued to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the African Great Lakes region. =Acts= There was a report from the expert panel that investigated illegal exploitation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's natural resources. It condemned the exploitation of natural resources as a major factor fuelling the conflict in the region, and all states were called upon to end the illegal activities. The Council stressed that the complete withdrawal of foreign troops and the establishment of an inclusive transitional government were important steps in ending the plundering of the country's natural resources. The resolution recognised the importance of natural resources for the future of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and urged international financial institutions and organisations to establish structures to control resource exploitation. The relationship between the illegal plundering of natural resources and the continuation of the conflict warranted further investigation, and therefore the Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to give an investigative panel a six-month mandate to further examine the issue and make recommendations. Individuals, companies and countries were invited to respond to the previous investigative report by 31 March 2003 and for the reactions to be published upon request. Finally, countries were encouraged to conduct their own investigations into the findings of the expert panel and action taken in this regard by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe was welcomed by the Council.

It is found in deciduous and mixed forests, particularly on moist soil on slopes and under beech and oak trees. A common species, it is found in northern Asia, Europe, North Africa, Central and northern South America, and eastern North America. All parts of the mushroom will stain dark bluish-black after handling. The mushrooms used to be considered edible, but a recent study has revealed this mushroom hyperaccumulates arsenic (with concentrations exceeding 1000 mg/kg in dry weight) and therefore its consumption should be restricted. Taxonomy Boletus pulverulentus was first described by German mycologist Wilhelm Opatowski in 1836. The specific epithet pulverulentus means \\"covered with powder\\" and refers to the somewhat dry powdery surface of the young cap and stalk. The fungus was transferred to the newly created genus Cyanoboletus in 2014, where it is the type species. Based on the 28S rDNA, North American collection of this fungus reported in the Genbank database (accession number KF030313) does not match that from Europe. Description The cap is convex, flat when old, dark reddish-brown becoming lighter with age, and grows up to in diameter. The flesh is yellow, with a mild taste and immediately turns blackish-blue when handled. The spore print colour is olive brown, and the stalk is long and slender, bright yellow to orange yellow at the top, and reddish-brown at the base. The mushrooms are edible, but not particularly desirable. Spores are smooth, fusoid (fuse shaped) to elliptical, and measure 11‚Äì15 by 4‚Äì6 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 22‚Äì35 by 6‚Äì9 ¬µm. The cap cuticle comprises a tissue layer of undifferentiated hyphae measuring 3‚Äì7 ¬µm wide. =Similar species= The eastern North American lookalike Boletus oliveisporus can be distinguished from C. pulverulentus by the pink to reddish colour in the center section of its stipe. Habitat and distribution An ectomycorrhizal species, Cyanoboletus pulverulentus forms associations with coniferous and deciduous trees, particularly oak. Fruit bodies appear on the ground, usually singly, in woodland. The bolete is widely distributed, having been reported from northern Asia, Europe, North Africa, Central and northern South America, and eastern North America. Reports of appearances in western North American could refer to the similar Cyanoboletus rainsii, which stains greenish-black instead of bluish-black.

The Norwegian Music History Archive states that he is the greatest dramatic tenor in Norwegian history, and that he was particularly admired for his portrayals in operas by Giacomo Puccini, Richard Strauss and above all Richard Wagner.Biography of Karl Aagard √òstvig at the Norwegian Music History Archive His voice was described by soprano Lotte Lehmann as ‚Äúa dazzling meteor.‚ÄùThe concise Oxford dictionary of opera By John Hamilton Warrack, Ewan West Although he toured internationally in concerts, operas, and recitals, his singing career was mainly centered in Austria and Germany from his debut in 1914 up until his retirement from the stage in 1933. From 1932 on he lived in Oslo where he was primarily active as an opera director and singing teacher. He made only a few recordings during his career, all for Polydor Records.Aagard √òstvig, Karl at operissimo.com Life and career Born in Oslo, √òstvig studied singing privately with Wilhelm Cappele Kloed in Germany, and at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln with Fritz Steinbach and Franz W√ºllner. He made his professional opera debut at the Staatsoper Stuttgart in 1914 where he was a resident artist for the next five years. While there he notably created the role of the Lay Brother/Giovanni de Salviati in the world premiere of Max von Schillings‚Äôs Mona Lisa in 1915.Elizabeth Forbes. \\"Oestvig, Karl Aagaard\\", The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2001. He appeared as a guest artist at Theater Basel in 1917 and at the Bavarian State Opera in 1919. From 1919 to 1926 √òstvig was the leading tenor at the Vienna State Opera (VSO). With that company he performed the role of the Emperor in the world premiere of Richard Strauss‚Äôs Die Frau ohne Schatten opposite Maria Jeritza as the Empress. He sang opposite Jeritza in many other operas at the VSO, including Bacchus to her Ariadne in Ariadne auf Naxos and Paul to her Marie in Die tote Stadt. His other roles in Vienna included Cavaradossi in Tosca, Don Jos√© in Carmen, Manrico in Il trovatore, Pedro in Tiefland, Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly, Siegmund in Die Walk√ºre, Tamino in The Magic Flute, Walther in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, and the title roles in Lohengrin, Parsifal, Tannh√§user, and The Tales of Hoffmann. While working at the VSO he married Ines Burmeister Geswein, with whom he had two childrens, Maren Ine and Olaf, Then years later he separeted from her and married the soprano Maria Rajdl. Their daughter, Lillemari √òstvig, had a career as a concert and opera soprano. In 1923 √òstvig embarked on his first extended concert tour in Europe and North America. He continued to perform regularly in recital for the remainder of his career. In 1926 he was invited to star in operetta productions at the Carltheater. However, the director of the VSO demanded that he reject this offer, and a conflict ensued which ended in √òstvig resigning from his position at the VSO. Later that year he appeared as a guest artist at the Hungarian State Opera House and at the Hamburg State Opera. He took a position at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1927, working there through 1930 and again as a guest artist for his final opera appearance in 1933. On 16 June 1928 his performance of Max in Jonny spielt auf was interrupted by Nazi demonstration. In 1932 √òstvig moved with his wife to Oslo where they both worked as singing teachers. That year he began directing opera productions in the city, and from this point on his career began to shift away from singing. In 1941, during the German occupation of Norway, he took over the management of the opera house in Oslo. After the war he was imprisoned temporarily as a collaborator, and he later lived in retirement in Oslo until his death there in 1968. One of his notable students was tenor Arne Hendriksen.

It comprises six series spread across 15 discs, all of them written and presented by David Attenborough, and together forming a comprehensive introduction to the major groups of terrestrial lifeforms. The series were filmed between 1987 and 2008, but are presented in the order in which the groups evolved, beginning with invertebrates and culminating with human beings, to tell the continuous story of the development of life on land. With a total running time exceeding 34 hours, it represents an in-depth visual survey of the living world as it exists today, at the beginning of the 21st century. Each series has been remastered to include an on-screen interactive encyclopaedia, which is indexed to provide easy reference to every species filmed, and to behavioural categories such as tool use, symbiosis and migration. The index is cross-referenced in the small hardback book which is also included in the box set. Here, an alphabetical list of species (by common name) and categories is provided along with the disc, episode and chapter number which contains the related footage. No other bonus features are included. The box set was released on 3 November 2008 in PAL format for DVD Regions 2 and 4. The series are also available individually. Life in the Undergrowth (2005) The first series, occupying discs 1 and 2, considers the terrestrial invertebrates, the first group to climb out of the sea and colonise the land. It features molluscs, worms, arthropods and insects. This was one of the later series to be filmed, as Attenborough had to wait until the available camera technology had developed to allow tiny creatures to be filmed without disturbing their behaviour. =Episode list= # \\"Invasion of the Land\\" # \\"Taking to the Air\\" # \\"The Silk Spinners\\" # \\"Intimate Relations\\" # \\"Supersocieties\\" The Private Life of Plants (1995) The second major group to develop were the plants. Attenborough's 1995 series, which is found on discs 3 and 4, featured groundbreaking timelapse photography which showed the lives of plants to be just as dynamic and dramatic as animals. Land plants evolved alongside the early insects, establishing complex interdependencies which eventually led to the emergence of flowering plants. =Episode list= # \\"Travelling\\" # \\"Growing\\" # \\"Flowering\\" # \\"The Social Struggle\\" # \\"Living Together\\" # \\"Surviving\\" Life in Cold Blood (2008) The third series in the collection features the first groups of backboned animals to leave the water, the amphibians, and their descendants, the reptiles. Discs 5 and 6 reveal how these creatures managed to survive in their new environments, and how the ability to regulate their body temperatures has enabled them to colonise even the hottest and driest deserts. =Episode list= # \\"The Cold-Blooded Truth\\" # \\"Land Invaders\\" # \\"Dragons of the Dry\\" # \\"Sophisticated Serpents\\" # \\"Armoured Giants\\" The Life of Birds (1998) Attenborough's detailed study of birds occupies discs 7 to 9. Descended from reptiles which took to life in the trees and then developed a covering of feathers, birds were able to colonise another new environment, the air. Here, Attenborough reveals not only a multitude of species from around the world, but also previously unfilmed behaviour and intimate moments from every stage of their lives. =Episode list= # \\"To Fly or Not to Fly\\" # \\"The Mastery of Flight\\" # \\"The Insatiable Appetite\\" # \\"Meat Eaters\\" # \\"Fishing for a Living\\" # \\"Signals and Songs\\" # \\"Finding Partners\\" # \\"The Demands of the Egg\\" # \\"The Problems of Parenthood\\" # \\"The Limits of Endurance\\" The Life of Mammals (2002) The fifth series in the set, spread across discs 10 to 13, surveys the mammals. They too are descended from reptiles, but kept themselves warm with a coating of fur, not feathers. As they began to specialise in different food sources, their bodies responded by adapting in ways that enabled them to exploit their chosen diet better, whether that be grazing or hunting. =Episode list= # \\"A Winning Design\\" # \\"Insect Hunters\\" # \\"Plant Predators\\" # \\"Chisellers\\" # \\"Meat Eaters\\" # \\"Opportunists\\" # \\"Return to Water\\" # \\"Life in the Trees\\" # \\"Social Climbers\\" # \\"Food for Thought\\" The First Eden: The Mediterranean World and Man (1987) The sixth and final series was the first to be filmed. Attenborough tells the story of how one species of mammal, Homo sapiens spread from Africa to the Mediterranean and began to change its relationship with the rest of the natural world. Discs 14 and 15 reveal the impacts of our ancestors on Mediterranean flora and fauna. =Episode list= # \\"The Making of the Garden\\" # \\"The Gods Enslaved\\" # \\"The Wastes of War\\" # \\"Strangers in the Garden\\" External links * David Attenborough's official website Category:Documentary films about nature Category:BBC television documentaries ","title":"Life on Land"},{"id":"28282718","text":"V√≠ctor Manuel √Åvila Haro (27 March 1977) is a Mexican professional basketball player currently with the CIBACOPA team Caballeros de Culiac√°n.V√≠ctor √Åvila en Tlaxiaco 5 Mar 2011 Since the CIBACOPA takes place for only a few months a year, Avila also plays for Halcones UV Xalapa in the LNBP.

Transportation between the two cities is high. The Otoyol 4 motorway is a major highway between the two cities, and the Ankara‚ÄìIstanbul route is the busiest domestic air route in the country. The route between Istanbul and Ankara by rail has been a single-track line, and trains usually were delayed 30 minutes to 2 hours plus the average 7 hours, 30 minutes travel time. Rail transport in Turkey was already at its lowest point, so in 2003 the State Railways and the Turkish Ministry of Transport made an agreement to build a line between the two cities. The line would be an electrified double trackline. Construction began in 2004 from Esenkent to Eski≈üehir. The line was completed on April 23, 2007.\\"Demiryolu\\" Magazine March‚ÄìApril Issue =Testing= An ETR 500 train set was used for testing the high-speed lines On February 28, 2007, TCDD requested bids for high-speed train sets from other networks to be tested on the completed portion of the high-speed line.

In 2010 one of the YHT trains was converted into a test train in order to test and measure the new lines. The Transportation Ministry spent 14 million TL (around 7 million Euros at that time) for the installation of testing and measuring equipment on the train, which it named - because it is a tradition to give a name to test trains - as \\"Piri Reis\\" after the renowned Turkish admiral and cartographer who drew some of the most accurate and detailed maps of the Mediterranean Sea and the Americas in the early 16th century. =Naming= TCDD requested bids for the name of the high- speed service.

The route has the most frequent train service of the whole YHT network, with 13 daily trains in each direction, 8 of which continue to Istanbul, while only 5 daily trains operate just between the two cities. The average journey time is 1 hour and 29 minutes. =Ankara-Istanbul= Before the YHT came into operation, average journey time between ƒ∞stanbul and Ankara was 7 hours and 30 minutes. By transferring from the YHT to intercity trains at Eski≈üehir, average journey time between ƒ∞stanbul and Ankara has fallen to 5 hours and 30 minutes.YHT Timetables TCDD Official Site After the completion of the second phase of the Ankara-Istanbul high-speed railway (Eski≈üehir-Istanbul) in 2013, some journeys between Ankara and Eski≈üehir were extended to Istanbul and YHT started running on the Ankara-Istanbul (Pendik) route on 26 July 2014. The journey is now reduced to as little as 3 hours 49 minutes. =Ankara-Konya= The route was put into service on 23 August 2011 on the second high-speed railway line being constructed in Turkey. With its inauguration, the journey time between these two cities hugely decreased (mainly because of the absence of direct railway link between the cities). =Istanbul-Konya= The line was put into service on 17 December 2014.

The Turkish State Railways plans to increase its network of high- speed rail to by 2023. =Ankara-Sivas= Ankara to Sivas high-speed rail service is expected to begin operation in mid-2020. The route will reduce travel time between the two cities from 9 hours and 30 minutes to 2 hours and 50 minutes. The railway will use a straighter route to Sivas, through Yozgat, bypassing Kayseri. Direct service from Istanbul to Sivas is also planned upon opening with an expected journey time of around 5 hours. =Ankara-Afyon- ƒ∞zmir= Ankara to ƒ∞zmir high-speed rail service has been talked about since construction of the Ankara-Istanbul high-speed railway began. The long route will reduce travel time between the two cities from around 13 hours to 3 hours and 30 minutes. The route will diverge off the Polatlƒ±-Konya high-speed railway just south of Polatlƒ± junction and head west, through Afyonkarahisar. The railway will connect to the ƒ∞zmir-Afyon railway at Manisa and continue into ƒ∞zmir together with other trains. A second route into ƒ∞zmir though Kemalpa≈üa is also planned. This route would diverge off the railway west of Turgutlu and enter ƒ∞zmir from the east. The line would run underground, parallel with the Halkapƒ±nar‚ÄîOtogar Line of the ƒ∞zmir Metro, connecting to the existing railway at Halkapƒ±nar in the city center. Service and Operation =Speed limitations= TCDD HT80000 (Siemens Velaro TR) has a maximum operating speed of The YHT operates at a maximum speed of on high-speed tracks. But the YHT also runs on non-high-speed and renewed tracks like the K√∂sek√∂y-Gebze section of the Ankara‚ÄìIstanbul high-speed railway where its top speed is . Naturally, some speed restrictions also apply in urban sections while accessing the central station, especially in Ankara and Istanbul thus increasing the journey times. The speed on these sections is expected to increase when renewal projects in urban areas (like Ba≈ükentray and second phase of Marmaray) will be completed. =Staff, operation and security= Ankara station On YHT service, there is usually 1 train engineer (2 on some trains), a train manager (absent in some trips), two train attendants and a caf√© car attendant. Business-class passengers are served meals at their seats if they applied for while buying their tickets. When accessing the trains, passengers must pass a security check like in airports. Maintenance of the sets is done at the Eryaman Yard in Ankara. Trains Currently, there are 19 sets of high-speed trains that run the YHT service: *12 sets are TCDD HT65000, manufactured by CAF *7 sets are TCDD HT80000, manufactured by Siemens, marketed globally under the brand Siemens Velaro. Turkey also signed contract for ten more Velaro trains. With this contract, the Turkish Velaro fleet will grow to 17 trains. Every sets have railroad cars with cabins in the front and rear car, cars for economy class passengers and car(s) for first class passengers. Additionally, some HT80000 sets have business class cabins with 4 seats. The seating arrangements are 3 seats in a row (1 on one side, 2 on the other side) in first class and 4 seats in a row (2 on each side) in economy class. Automatic sliding doors provide passage between cars. Baggage may be stowed in the overhead compartments above the seats, or underneath the seats. Wi-Fi service is available with power inputs for laptops in first and business classes and all sets are wheelchair-accessible (with places in economy class only). In economy class, seats are fabric-coated and have audio connectors and foldable tables. In first class, there are leather-coated seats and a visual and audio broadcasting system that can broadcast at least 4 hours on 4 different channels.

As a professional athlete, she achieved her first Professional World Title by winning the World Championships at Pipeline in 1991 and won five Brazilian National titles. She also won two National USA contests and three Australian events open to International riders = Journalism = Kozlowski began her journalism career in 1992, invited by the journalist Gilberto Conde to present the program 360, from the channel Top Sport - which later became Sportv. In the program, interviewed the Brazilian men's volleyball team, which had just won the gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics, soccer player Zico, among others. Kozlowski came to Rede Globo in 1996 to host the show Esporte Espetacular alongside reporter Clayton Conservani. She made several special reports for the station's sports programs, among them, practicing surfing on a river in Amap√° and live bungee jumping. Participated in his first international coverage by Globo in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. In 2001, she returned to the Esporte Espetacular presentation, this time beside the reporter Tino Marcos. In 2003, Kozlowski began to display the local Globo Esporte block in S√£o Paulo. In 2009, she led for the first time, along with Cleber Machado, the transmission of the parades of the samba schools of the panel of Rio de Janeiro. In 2010, she will be the main host of the second season the Brazilian stunt/dare reality television show Hipertens√£o, which is scheduled to premiere September, 2010. In 2013, Kozlowski was the post-race interviewer at the Formula One 2013 Brazilian Grand Prix, interviewing Sebastian Vettel, Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso on the podium. It was Webber's last Formula 1 grand prix before retirement.

It is threatened by hunting and habitat loss. Taxonomy From the time it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was considered a subspecies of the western red colobus (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta red colobus as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the red colobus monkeys, including the Niger Delta red colobus to be in the genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here). However, other authors consider Piliocolobus to be a subgenus of Procolobus. Description The Niger Delta red colobus is black on top from the head to the rump, becoming orange-brown on the sides and outer legs. The undersides and inner legs, and most of the arms are white. The hands and feet are black. The tail is red-brown on top and chestnut or maroon below, becoming darker towards the tip. It has white whiskers. Distribution The Niger Delta red colobus is found only in the western part of the Niger Delta. It is restricted to marsh forest, that is, forest with a high water table year round but no significant flooding. It shares this habitat with several other primate species, including the Nigerian white-throated guenon (Cercopithecus erythrogaster pococki), the red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus), the putty-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans), the mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona), and maybe also the olive colobus (Procolobus verus). Status When it was first discovered, the Niger Delta red colobus was locally common but under some pressure from deforestation, especially logging of Hallea ledermannii, which is an important food tree for the monkey. Since then, pressure from bushmeat hunting and logging has increased. Red colobus monkeys generally appear to be particularly sensitive to hunting and habitat disturbance, hence concerns that the species may be on the verge of extinction. The Niger Delta red colobus was still found in the Edumanom Forest Reserve in 2008. However, as of 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers it critically endangered, due a reduction in population of more than 80% over the past 30 years largely caused by hunting and habitat loss. In 2010, the Niger Delta red colobus was included in the list of The World‚Äôs 25 Most Endangered Primates, published by the IUCN and other organizations.

It has a fuzzy brown outer surface and an inner surface of whitish, convoluted folds of tissue. Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, the species has been recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. Taxonomy First described by American mycologist Harvey Willson Harkness in 1885, the fungus is named for the original collector, J.D. Cooper. It is commonly known as the \\"pine truffle\\" or the \\"fuzzy truffle\\". Description The outer surface is brown and felt-like. The roughly spherical fruit bodies grow underground. Ranging from in diameter, they are yellow-brown to darker brown with a fuzzy, furrowed external surface. The inside of the fruit body comprises deeply folded and convoluted tissue with some internal open spaces between them. Young pine truffles ooze a whitish juice when they are cut. The odor of the internal flesh is usually mild, but David Arora has noted the existence of a form in the Western United States that smells similar to fermented cider. Geopora cooperi fruit bodies are edible. The smooth, elliptical or roughly spherical spores measure 18‚Äì27 by 13‚Äì21 ¬µm and have an oil droplet. The asci (spore-bearing cells) are typically eight-spored. They are arranged as a palisade of cells forming a hymenium that covers the inner surfaces of the internal folds. Habitat and distribution Fruit bodies grow singly or in groups under the soil surface near conifers and Eucalyptus trees. In the field, they can sometimes be detected by the mound of soil they push up as they grow. In western North America, it is found from Mexico to as far north as Alaska. Specimens from the latter location have been found under aspen and willow trees. Geopora cooperi is a snowbank mushroom, as it commonly occurs after snow has melted. The fungus has also been recorded in China, western Asia (Turkey), Pakistan, and Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered.

It should not be confused with the Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), which has a color form sometimes referred to as the \\"Japanese giant hornet\\". While there is a history of recognizing subspecies within many of the Vespa hornets, the most recent taxonomic revision of the genus treats all subspecific names in the genus Vespa as synonyms, effectively relegating them to no more than informal names for regional color forms.A.H.

Insect Systematics and Diversity 4(3) https://doi.org/10.1093/isd/ixaa006 Biology Due to the large size of the swarm and aggressiveness of the yellow hornet, predation against them is rare. However, along with other insects in Japan and Korea, they are prey to the Asian giant hornet and nests have been known to be deserted after Asian giant hornet attacks, even though they attack in groups of only 10 to 30. Nests of the yellow hornet are sometimes attacked by the parasitic species known as the black hornet (Vespa dybowskii). In the early stage of nesting, the black hornet queen attacks the queens of other hornets, including the yellow hornet and European hornet. If the assault succeeds, it will usurp the nest to produce its own offspring, assisted by the workers of the former owner. The yellow hornet has the largest swarms of all of the hornet species, containing 1,000 to 2,000 workers. Although the yellow hornet is much smaller than the Asian giant hornet, it can be more dangerous to humans because they will attack people in greater numbers.

The fruit bodies of the fungus have slimy convex caps up to wide. The mushroom is characterized by the very distinct color changes that occur in the cap throughout development. Typically, the young cap is whitish, later becoming grayish-olive to reddish- brown or a mottled combination of these colors. The mushroom has a dotted stem (stipe) up to long, and thick. On the underside on the cap is the spore- bearing tissue consisting of minute vertically arranged tubes that appear as a surface of angular, yellowish pores. The presence of milky droplets on the pore surface of young individuals, especially in humid environments, is a characteristic feature of this species. S. pungens can usually be distinguished from other similar Suillus species by differences in distribution, odor and taste. The mushroom is considered edible, but not highly regarded. An ectomycorrhizal species, S. pungens forms an intimate mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium and the young roots of the associated host tree. The fungus‚Äîlimited in distribution to California‚Äîfruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies have investigated the role of S. pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, it is not a dominant root colonizer, and occupies only a small percentage of ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use. Taxonomy, classification, and phylogeny The fungus was first described scientifically by American mycologists Harry D. Thiers and Alexander H. Smith in their 1964 monograph on North American Suillus species. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco. Smith and Thiers classified S. pungens in section Suilli‚Äîa grouping of related species characterized by the presence of either a ring on the stipe, a partial veil adhering to the cap margin, or a \\"false veil\\" not attached to the stipe but initially covering the tube cavity.Smith and Thiers (1964), p. 67. A 1996 molecular analysis of 38 different Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The results suggest that S. pungens was genetically similar to S. collinitus, S. neoalbidipes, S. pseudobrevipes, S. luteus, S. brevipes, S. weaverae, and certain isolates of S. granulatus. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin pungens, and refers to the pungent aroma of the fruit bodies. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"pungent slippy jack\\" or the \\"pungent suillus\\".Bessette et al. (2000), p. 250. It has also been referred to as the \\"slippery jack\\", a common name applied to several Suillus species. Description The stipe is covered with irregularly shaped glandular dots. The cap of S. pungens is roughly convex when young, becoming plano-convex (flat on one side and rounded on the other) to somewhat flat with age, and reaches diameters of . The cap surface is sticky to slimy when moist, becoming shiny when dried. The surface is smooth but is sometimes streaked with the sticky glue-like cap slime when older. The cap color is highly variable in this species, and the cap is often variegated with a mixture of light and dark colors. When young it is dirty-white to olive with pale olive splotches. Maturing caps can retain the color they had when young, or become tawny to orange-yellow to reddish-brown, or a combination of these colors. The cap margin is initially rolled inward and has a cottony roll of white tissue, but becomes naked and curves downward with age. The flesh is thick, white and unchanging in young fruit bodies, frequently changing to yellow when older. Young fruit bodies are covered with milky droplets on their pore surfaces. The tubes that comprise the hymenium (spore-bearing tissue) on the underside of the cap are up to long, adnate when young, becoming decurrent or nearly so with age. In young specimens, they are whitish to pale buff, and are covered with milky droplets that become brown to ochraceous when dried. As specimens mature the color of the pore surface changes to yellowish, and finally to dark yellow. The angular pores, which are 1‚Äì1.5 mm in diameter, are not radially arranged, and do not change color when bruised. The stipe is solid (rather than hollow), long, and thick near the top. Its shape is variable: either roughly equal in width throughout, thicker at the base, or somewhat thicker in the middle. Its surface is dry and smooth, and covered with irregularly shaped glandular dots. The dots‚Äîminute clumps of pigmented cells‚Äîare initially reddish before becoming brownish. The background color of the stipe is initially whitish (roughly the same color as the tubes), but becomes more yellow with age. It does not change color when bruised, and does not have a ring. The flesh of the stipe is white, and does not change color when exposed to air. The spore print is olive-brown to pale cinnamon-brown. Individual spores are thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), and smooth. Their shape is ellipsoid to roughly cylindrical in face view or inequilateral when viewed in profile, and they measure 9.5‚Äì10 by 2.8‚Äì3.5 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are hyaline, club-shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 33‚Äì36 by 8‚Äì10 Œºm. The thin-walled cystidia are rare to scattered on the tube surface but abundant on the pores, where they usually occur in massive clusters. They appear dark brown when mounted in a dilute (3%) solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH), and are cylindric to roughly club- shaped, measuring 43‚Äì79 by 7‚Äì10 Œºm. They are usually encrusted with pigment, although some may be hyaline. The tissue comprising the tube is hyaline, and made of divergent to nearly parallel hyphae that are 3‚Äì5 Œºm wide. The pileipellis is a tissue type known as an ixotrichodermium (made of interwoven gelatinized hyphae); it stains brown in KOH, and is made of hyphae that are 4‚Äì5 Œºm wide. The stipe cuticle is made of clusters of cystidia similar to those found in the hymenium. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of S. pungens. Several chemical tests can be employed in the field to aid in the identification of S. pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray. =Edibility= The mushroom is considered edible, but not choice. Its taste is harsh, nauseating, and weakly acidic; the odor is strong and ranges from pleasant, resembling bananas, to pungent. When collecting for the table, young specimens are preferred, as older ones \\"literally seethe with fat, agitated maggots and sag with so much excess moisture that they practically demand to be wrung out like a sponge!\\" Michael Kuo's 100 Edible Mushrooms (2007) rates the mushroom's edibility as \\"bad\\" and warns that dishes cooked with the mushroom will assume an unpleasant taste. =Similar species= Suillus pungens is characterized by the very distinct color changes that occur in the cap as it develops. The range of color variation makes it possible to misidentify the species with others whose color overlaps. Suillus pungens has been misidentified as S. placidus because of the white color of the young fruit bodies and the droplets of exudate. S. placidus has a wider distribution, is usually found in association with eastern white pine, is generally smaller, with a maximum cap diameter up to , and has smaller spores, measuring 7‚Äì9 by 2.5‚Äì3.2 Œºm. It does not have any distinctive taste or odor.Bessette et al. (2000), pp. 246‚Äì7. North American S. granulatus is another potential lookalike species, and at maturity it is nearly identical to Suillus pungens. The cap of S. granulatus is variable in color, ranging from pale yellow to various shades of brown, while the pore surface is initially whitish, later becoming yellowish, and similar to S. placidus, its typical host is eastern white pine. Unlike S. pungens, it lacks a characteristic odor and taste. The Californian species Suillus glandulosipes has veil material attached to the edge of the cap when young. It also lacks the distinctive changes in cap color during development, is associated with lodgepole pine, has smaller spores (6.6‚Äì8.8 by 2.5‚Äì3 Œºm), and lacks any obvious taste and odor. Another Californian species, Suillus quiescens, newly described in 2010, may resemble S. pungens, especially at maturity. S. quiescens can be distinguished by its lack of white or olive colors when young and by a less glandular stipe when mature. Ecology, habitat and distribution S. pungens is often found growing near Chroogomphus vinicolor (pictured). Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal (EM) basidiomycete that forms symbiotic relationships almost exclusively with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and bishop pine (Pinus muricata); some collections have been made under knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), but only within the range of Monterey pine. All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to California. An EM symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant. The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in humus. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus vinicolor and Helvella lacunosa. Suillus pungens is often the most abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter, it is one of the few species of Suillus that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year, especially in wet weather. It has also been identified in the southeastern Sierra Nevada and on Santa Cruz Island. A genet is a group of genetically identical individuals that have grown in a given location, all originating vegetatively from a single ancestor. Once established, genets vegetatively spread hyphae out from the root tip into the soil and may connect two or more trees to form a network of mycorrhizae. In field studies, the approximate size of fungal genets is typically estimated by collecting and mapping fruit bodies on a site, determining which fruit bodies are genetically identical by either somatic incompatibility (a method fungi use to distinguish self from non-self by delimiting their own mycelia from that of other individuals of the same species) or various molecular techniques, and then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies. In a 1996 study, mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that S. pungens, an abundant fruiter in pine forests, would be dominant on the roots of the pine trees. However, by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to above- ground fruit bodies, they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically while occupying only a small fraction of the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage, which was otherwise dominated by Russula species and Tomentella sublilacina. Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between above- and below-ground representation may be because the fungus invests less energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting, or alternatively, because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain enough to allow abundant fruiting. A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and colleagues used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect minute genetic differences among S. pungens genets, and showed that most of the fruiting occurred from a single large genet. This result indicates that the fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth, rather than frequent establishment of new genets from spores, and that it uses carbon resources efficiently. The study also described an S. pungens genet with an area of approximately and a span greater than across, which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported. The large S. pungens genet was not detected after wildfire, demonstrating that it did not survive in the absence of a host, and suggesting that spores are the primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire.

It was a victory for the D√°l gCais and marked the end of Norse expansion in Ireland. It was also the first of three battles that highlight the career of Brian Boru. The battle took place during a military campaign led by Ivar of Limerick into D√°l gCais territory. After the battle, the D√°l gCais seized and burned the Viking stronghold of Limerick. The annals only offer the above brief report of the battle and the plundering of Limerick the following day. The only extended account of the battle, including background, mustering, and aftermath, is found in the controversial Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib.Todd, pp. 70 ff Background In the year 942, 26 years before the battle, Brian Boru was born in a D√°l gCais village in modern-day County Clare. Twelve years after his birth he was attending school at an Irish monastery. While Brian was at the monastery his village was raided by Vikings from the city of Limerick. Brian's father was killed during the raid and power shifted to his son, Latchna. In 953 Latchna died and power shifted to Brian's other brother, Mathgamain mac Cenn√©tig. In 963 Mathgamain formed an alliance with the Viking king Ivar of Limerick. In 964 Brian left with a group of followers to fight the Vikings whom his brother recently made peace with. Brian's rag-tag army used guerrilla tactics against the Vikings whenever he had the chance. Although Brian's group took their toll on the Vikings, the Vikings also took their toll on Brian's men. In Brian's journal he noted that by the year 968 his group had only 15 surviving members after four years of war. Brian's brother, Mathgamain, decided to join Brian in his fight against the Vikings and break his peace with the Vikings. War in Ireland Brian Boru and his brother king Mathgamain of Munster, were consolidating their hold on Munster by directly opposing the Vikings of Limerick and their local Gaelic allies. Their success forced Ivar into a hasty coalition with Mathgamain's rivals, including the elected king Molloy of Desmond and Donovan of Hy Carbery. In the summer of 968 Ivar and his allies gathered a large host and set about ravaging the ancestral lands of Boru and Mathgamain. The brothers called in their supporters and marched north from Cashel to meet their enemy on the wooded plain of Sulcoit. The battle was hard-fought and bloody, with fighting lasting from dawn until dusk, until Ivar's army broke. The Dal gCais pursued the broken army \\"beheading many along the way\\" back to Limerick and stormed into the city, ruthlessly sacking it and massacring most of the inhabitants. Order of battle =Irish= The Irish nobles are known to have adopted some armor, large shields and the axe by this time. They fought by making an impetuous charge following a shower of javelins and darts. Brian is known for his extensive use of light cavalry and the chronicles mention mounted troops for both armies. Cahal and his followers were renowned \\"champions\\" of unknown origin joined Brian just prior to battle. =Vikings= The Vikings are known to have fielded close to 1000 mail clad warriors. There is no mention of berserkers but a contingent of \\"champions\\" were noted as fighting from horseback. The rebel Irish, held in reserve, were swept away with the Viking rout after having played little or no part in the battle. Their leaders were later hunted down and killed by Brian in subsequent campaigns. =Battle= One day in the year 968, Brian sent out a small raiding party to bait the Vikings by having them follow the men to where the D√°l gCais were waiting. The Vikings fell for the trick and followed the men into the thick forest leaving the safety of their fortress. At a small rise called Sulcoit near the modern town of Soloheadbeg Brian's men lied in wait. Although smaller in size the Irish made up for it with the element of surprise. Confident in their numbers the Vikings pursued them deeper into the forest. Brian's men led them to Sulcoit and there Brian's men attacked. Immediately the Vikings were caught off guard by the Irish attack. Because of the tangled forest the Vikings were unable to use their best defensive tactic called the \\"Wall of Shields\\". Fighting alone a Viking was no match for the Irish Battle Ax. By mid-day the Vikings fled and scattered in disorder, relentlessly pursued by Brian's men. The battle was hard fought and bloody, with fighting lasting from dusk until dawn. The Viking line finally broke and the Irish were described as beheading whoever they captured along the way. Their disordered retreat left the Viking city of Limerick vulnerable to attack. References Notes Bibliography  Downham, Clare. Viking Kings of Britain and Ireland: The Dynasty of √çvarr to A.D. 1014.

This leguminous tree species is native to East Africa , Eastern DRC and southern Africa. History The description of E. abyssinica has been complicated, because the first specimen of Erythrina from Ethiopia (Abyssinia) brought to Europe was actually a mix of the two species. The flowers and leaves belonged to E. brucei Schweinfurth (1868) and the pod and seeds to E. abyssinica Lam. ex DC (1825). In addition, the first three descriptions were invalid, i.e. not published correctly to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (syn. E. kuara James Bruce (1790), E. abyssinica Lam.Lamarck, J.B. (1786) Encyclop√©die M√©thodique (Lamarck) 2(1): 392. (1786) and E. tomentosa Robert Brown (1814)). Furthermore, the species is variable with individuals with glabrous and hairy (tomentose) leaves which were described separately and after revision resulted in additional synonyms (syn. E. tomentosa R. Brown ex A.Rich. (1847)). The number of synonyms increased when a new genus was described from South Africa (Chirocalyx Meisn.), which later was considered synonymous with Erythrina (Ch. tomentosa Hochstetter and Ch. abyssinica Hochstetter). Finally, E. abyssinica was considered for some time the juvenile stage of E. brucei and hence synonymous with the latter species. The issue was settled in 1962 when the pods and seeds from E. brucei were collected which were different from those of E. abyssinica. Consecutively, the seeds planted revealed that seedlings and saplings of E. brucei did not resemble those of E. abyssinica.

It occurred in late June 2010 when Sanae Shimomura, a 23-year-old Japanese single mother in Osaka, sealed the door of her apartment shut, abandoning 3-year-old daughter Sakurako Hagi and 1-year- old son Kaede Hagi inside. Neighbors heard the children crying over many weeks until it suddenly subsided, but did not think anything more of this than simply children in a bad childhood phase. Since Shimomura did not come to work for several days, a colleague went to her place and noticed a strange smell beyond the door. When the police entered the apartment, they found the two children dead. Social workers had attempted to stop by the apartment several times over the course of the children's confinement, but never found anyone home. The apartment was in a lively, populated area, but nobody knew that the children were confined. Shimamura was arrested on 30 July 2010. She was reported to have wanted free time for herself and was quoted as saying that she had grown \\"tired of feeding and bathing\\" her two children.. She was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murders. As of 2020, Shimamura remains imprisoned.

It is one of four recognised species of the genus Gmelina found in Australia. Taxonomy Gmelina fasciculiflora was first described by English botanist George Bentham in his Flora Australiensis in 1870, from a collection by Dallachy. Its species name is derived from Latin and means \\"flowers in clusters\\". Description It shares characteristics with the more southerly white beech. Having pale twigs, similar shaped opposite leaves with a stem around 2 cm long. Leaves, however, are glossy and not nearly as hairy as the southern species. The leaves are 12 cm long and 7 wide. Flat glands may be seen at the base of the leaves as well as hairy domatia on the underside of the leaves. Purple spotted cream coloured flowers appear from February to May on large panicles. These attractive flowers are around 2 cm long.David L. Jones, Rainforest Plants of Australia. page 222 They later form purple coloured fleshy fruit in the form of a flattened drupe, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, ripening from September to January. As with the white beech, the fruit has a strong scent, and the aril quickly turns brown when exposed to the air. Stains on clothing from the flesh of this fruit are difficult to remove. Habitat and ecology The natural habitat is both lowland and highland rainforests of northeastern Queensland. The fruit are eaten by the wompoo fruit dove. Cultivation and uses Gmelina fasciculiflora has grown and flowered well in cultivation in Brisbane, where it has been planted in public parks. The timber is fairly soft for a hardwood and acidic. It is not resistant to termites. It is highly regarded for carving in Queensland.

Football is the most popular sport, while basketball is also very popular. Other sports such as volleyball, futsal, swimming and tennis are popular as well. Other Paraguayan sports and pastimes are rugby union, chess, motorsport, golf and rowing. Football Football, also known as Futbol, is by far the most popular sport in Paraguay to the point that it is part of the nation's culture. Football was first introduced in Paraguay by Dutchman William Paats, who moved from the Netherlands to Asunci√≥n in 1888.Cien A√±os de Historia: Sudor, Lagrimas, Sangre, y Victoria In 1900, small tournaments were held at the Plaza de Armas, a plaza located in downtown Asunci√≥n. By 1906 the number of football clubs in Paraguay had increased and the Paraguayan Football Association, the governing body of football in Paraguay, was founded. The Paraguayan Football Association joined CONMEBOL in 1921, and FIFA in 1925. Football has grown enormously since then, and there are over 1600 teams spread throughout Paraguay participating in multiple leagues.UFI Website Each of those teams try to make their way to the first division by clearing the different levels of lower divisions. The growth and evolution of Paraguayan football can be seen in the achievements made in the club level and by the Paraguay national football team. The national team has participated in eight World Cups, won two Copa Am√©rica tournaments, and earned a silver medal at the Olympic Games in 2004. All these accomplishments established Paraguay as the fourth most successful football nation in South America behind Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. At the club level, Olimpia Asunci√≥n has won a total of eight international tournaments, including three Copa Libertadores and one Intercontinental Cup. Among the most important and successful football players in Paraguayan history are Arsenio Erico, Aurelio Gonz√°lez, Julio C√©sar Romero and Jos√© Luis Chilavert.Historia de la Albirroja Basketball Basketball in Paraguay dates back to 1936, when no governing body existed, and the sport was governed by the Paraguayan Sports Association. The Paraguayan Basketball Federation (PBF, Confederaci√≥n Paraguaya de Basket) was formed as the governing body in 1947, the same year it joined the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). The PBF organizes both the National League (for teams outside of Asunci√≥n) and the Metropolitan League (for teams from Asunci√≥n), and runs the Paraguay national basketball team. The best achievements by the national team were their two second-place finishes in the South American Basketball Championship in 1955 and 1960. Volleyball Volleyball is also a noteworthy sport in Paraguay. The men's national team won a silver medal in the South American Men's Volleyball Championship in 1958, and two bronze medals, in 1956 and 1979.Volleyball: Men: South American Championships The women's national team won a silver medal at the 1964 South American Volleyball Championship, and a bronze medal in the 1967 edition.Volleyball: Women: South American Championships Tennis Tennis is also a significant sport in Paraguay. The Paraguay Davis Cup team competed in its first Davis Cup in 1931, and their best result was reaching the quarterfinals in 1983-85 and again in 1987. The Paraguay Fed Cup team competed in its first Fed Cup in 1991, and their best result was qualifying for the World Group Play-offs in 1995. Notable tennis players from Paraguay include Victor Caballero, Hugo Chapac√∫, Ram√≥n Delgado, Francisco Gonz√°lez, V√≠ctor Pecci, and Rossana de los R√≠os. Rugby union Rugby union is another sport in Paraguay. With 4,355 registered players and nineteen clubs, the country currently ranks 38th worldwide and 5th in South America.IRB retrieved 8 July 2009 The sport's governing body, the Paraguayan Rugby Union (Union de Rugby del Paraguay), was founded in 1970 and joined the IRFB in 1989.Bath, p72 South American rugby has historically been dominated by Argentina, and to a lesser extent Uruguay (both of which have qualified for the Rugby World Cup), but the sport can be found in almost all nations in South America, including Paraguay. This is partly due to massive immigration from Europe, notably the British Isles, France, and Italy. It is difficult to single out one of these nations as being primarily responsible for the birth of Paraguayan rugby, as illustrated by Asuncion Rugby Club, which was formed by two Britons, two Argentines, a Dutchman, and a New Zealander.Thau, p52 The first Paraguayan rugby player of note was Nelson Ayala, who played with the English club Saracens F.C. in the 1950s, and also played a prominent part in developing the game in his home country. In 1970, a second club was set up in Asuncion, the Club Universitario de Asunci√≥n (CURDA), which has since toured South Africa, Great Britain and New Zealand. Traditionally the stronghold of Paraguayan rugby has been Asuncion. However Since 2000 a number of Asuncion clubs have folded, combined, or struggled to field teams in both Primera (first grade) and Intermedia (reserve grade). In 2013 the teams in Primera were CURDA, San Jose, Old King Club, Luque, Cristo Rey, Universidad Autonoma de Asuncion, and Santa Clara. Las Leones de Encarnacion, from the south of the country, competed in Primera until 2009 when they switched to compete in the URNE championship of Northern Argentina. Encarnacion is a riverside city opposite the Argentinian city of Posadas. Las Leones often fielded a strong team in Primera, but they are closer to the Posadas, Corrientes and Resistencia, than to Asuncion (a 5-hour bus trip). While strong at home they often struggled to field a competitive team when traveling to Asuncion every second week for Primera. They have since won the URNE championship. Since 2010 there has been strong growth in both women's rugby and rugby outside of and in the outskirts of Asuncion. Traditionally teams such as Ciudad del Este and Coronel Oviedo played only occasionally, or fielded 1 team in Intermedia or Primera where they often struggled. In 2010 a separate \\"Campeonato del Interior\\" was established, in which developing clubs from the countryside played. Teams include Santani, Coronel Oviedo, Villarica, Ciudad del Este and Presidente Franco. All Primera teams are now obliged to field a women's team. The women play 7-a-side rugby with mini 7 a side championships held every couple of weeks. From 2013 a separate Campeonato Metropolitano (Metropolitan Championship) was also established, for new developing teams from Asuncion which could not yet compete in Primera. Teams are (Capiat√° Rugby Club), Villeta Rugby Club, Mariano Roque Alonso RC, √ëemby Rugby, Mangor√© (San Juan Bautista Misiones), Club Deportivo de Puerto Sajonia, Jararas FCM-UNA Rugby. Athletics Athletics in Paraguay in Paraguay is managed by the Federaci√≥n Paraguaya de Atletismo. The sport is mainly practiced in the throwing modalities. Golf Carlos Franco won four PGA Tour tournaments, and was the 1999 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year after finishing sixth at the 1999 Masters Tournament. Fabrizio Zanotti has won two European Tour tournaments, and earned the gold medal at the 2019 Pan American Games. Julieta Granada and Celeste Troche won the Women's World Cup of Golf in 2007. Granada has also claimed one win and six runner-up finishes at the LPGA Tour, and finished fifth at the 2014 Women's British Open. Other sports Football tennis, Chess, futsal, motorsport, and rowing are also notable Paraguayan sports and pastimes. References Bibliography * Bath, Richard (ed.)

In August 2010 reporters found that it had been constructed to hold CIA detainees classified as \\"high value\\". These were among the many men known as ghost detainees, as they were ultimately held for years for interrogation by the CIA in its secret prisons known as black sites at various places in Europe, the Mideast, and Asia, including Afghanistan. Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman reported on August 7, 2010 for the Associated Press that the \\"high value detainees\\" Abu Zubaydah, Abd al- Nashiri, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, had first been transferred to military custody at Guantanamo on September 24, 2003. They reported that CIA agents thought they had learned most of the information to be extracted from these individuals. At the time, the CIA thought the men could be held securely and secretly at Guantanamo, without any prospect of the public learning that they had been subjected to what United States courts have determined is torture, including waterboarding, one of the euphemistically termed enhanced interrogation techniques. These techniques had been specifically authorized by political appointees in the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice (DOJ), in the Bush administration, in August 2002, in what came to be known as the Torture Memos. David Johnston and Mark Mazetti also described the camp in the New York Times in August 2009. They quoted CIA officials, who said that the camp's nickname in 2003 was a reference to the Beatles' song \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", because the detainees would be held there \\"forever\\". As the habeas corpus petitions collectively known as Rasul v. Bush made their way to the United States Supreme Court for its ruling in 2004, the CIA took the four men back into their custody. Apuuzo and Goldman report the Bush government returned the men to CIA custody three months before the Supreme Court's ruling, to avoid the possibility of having to release any information about them. The Supreme Court held that detainees had the right of habeas corpus to challenge their detention before an impartial forum, and none had seen counsel. Up until that time, no detainees had been able to challenge the grounds of his detention. The Supreme Court's ruling would have compelled at least some information about the four detainees to be publicly revealed. According to Scott Horton, writing for Harper's Magazine in August 2010, the men were removed from Guantanamo on March 27, 2004. Horton described the men's covert removal as an instance of \\"Three-Card Monte at Gitmo\\". In continuing challenges to the secrecy imposed by the Bush administration, in January 2006, US District Court Judge Jed S. Rakoff ruled that the United States Department of Defense had to publish a list of all the detainees who had been held in Guantanamo by March 3, 2006. On May 15, 2006, the DOD published a list of 759 names, which included persons held at the camp from January 2002 to May 15, 2006. By 2006, hundreds had already been released without charges. This list did not include Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Nashiri, Ramzi bin al-Shibh or Mustafa al-Hawsawi. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that the Bush administration's process of Combatant Status Review Tribunals and military commissions was unconstitutional, as the executive branch had set up a separate justice system outside the federal and military systems, which was not authorized by Congress. The administration worked to gain legislation for its goals. These four men and ten other \\"high-value detainees\\" were transferred from CIA to military custody at Guantanamo in September 2006, by which time the Bush administration was assured of passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. The legislation was signed in October. Passed by Congress to authorize the military tribunals the administration wanted for trying detainees, its provisions included a restriction against detainees using federal courts for habeas corpus actions. All pending habeas cases were stayed as a result of the act. In Boumediene v. Bush (2008), the Supreme Court ruled that the MCA was unconstitutional, as detainees could not be deprived of their fundamental right of habeas corpus. It also ruled that they could access federal courts directly, which the Bush administration had sought to prevent. Numerous actions were refiled in federal courts.  Penny Lane  On November 25, 2013, Goldman and Apuzzo of the Associated Press reported that the CIA operated a second secret camp on the Guantanamo Naval Base, from 2002 to as late as 2006. This base, called Penny Lane, was used to hold captives who were under consideration for being recruited as double agents, who would surreptitiously penetrate, and inform on, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other groups suspected of being allied with them. Its name, Penny Lane, like Strawberry Fields, was taken from a song from the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour (1967) album.

It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner, and directed by Phil Abraham. It originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 25, 2010. The episode takes place in November 1964, as the advertisement agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has just started up, and Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is struggling with his divorce. The agency partners are concerned about the narrow breadth of their client base, which is not helped by Don coming across as less than sympathetic in an interview with a trade magazine. Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) attempts a viral marketing stunt to bring back a disgruntled client, with unexpected repercussions. Meanwhile, Don's ex-wife Betty (January Jones) is struggling to fit in with her new family, and Don encounters problems in his romantic life. \\"Public Relations\\" was heavily promoted in the weeks leading up to its airing, with an endorsement by President Obama and product tie-in by Mattel toys helping with publicity. Weiner expressed displeasure with what he considered a media revelation of plot details, though other journalists called his objections unwarranted. \\"Public Relations\\" was critically acclaimed by television critics, who expressed that the series returned to form. Upon airing, the episode was viewed by 2.92 million viewers and attained a 0.9 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Plot Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is being interviewed by a reporter from Advertising Age and declines to speak about his personal life. As a result, he comes across as arrogant and a cipher in the published story, a fact that senior partners Roger Sterling (John Slattery) and Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) lament, as they had hoped the interview would act as advertising for the company. The effects of the bad publicity is brought home just after Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) has sold a Jai Alai special to ABC, but it must be pulled because the client, Pete Campbell's (Vincent Kartheiser) college friend, Horace Cook Jr., nicknamed \\"Ho Ho\\", fires the agency because Draper did not mention the client in his interview. Because of the agency's narrow client base, the loss is financially detrimental. Bert suggests Don do an interview with The Wall Street Journal to make amends, but Don demurs. Meanwhile, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) comes up with an idea to regain the Sugarberry Ham account. She hires two actresses to fight over a ham in a grocery store. The plan goes awry when the fight turns real and one of the women presses charges against the other for assault, and Peggy has to ask Don for bail and hush money. Don disapproves of the stunt (which was carried out behind his back), but Peggy points out that they did retain the account. Also new part-time member of the creative team has been added: Joey, whom Peggy has a friendly relationship with. Don settles in as a bachelor after last season's divorce from his wife Betty (January Jones). Roger sets him up on a date with Bethany, a friend of his wife Jane, who is a petite blonde, like Betty. After the date, Bethany (Anna Camp) expresses interest in seeing Don again, but rejects his sexual advances. On Thanksgiving Day, Don spends time with a prostitute, and Betty has problems fitting in with the family of her new husband Henry (Christopher Stanley). At Thanksgiving dinner with his family, Betty's daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka) complains about the food. The childish action blows up into a scene when Betty yells at Sally, treats her brusquely, and causes problems by forcing food into Sally's mouth. Henry's mother later privately expresses displeasure with her son's new wife, observing that her children are clearly scared of her. However, in bed, Henry and Betty get along. The next day, Don picks up his two oldest children for an overnight visit, and Don is disappointed he can't see baby Gene, whom Betty sent to Carla's. Betty curtly tells Don to have the kids back by 9. When he returns the next evening, the house is empty and he has to wait for Betty and Henry to come back. When they return, well past 9 pm, an argument ensues about the house; Don, at his lawyer's instigation, angrily reminds them they were supposed to be out a month ago, and he demands they either buy him out, pay him rent, or leave. A minor argument later sparks between Henry and Betty when Henry agrees with Don's point. Betty stubbornly reiterates that they will leave on her timeline, not Don's. A different client, Jantzen swimwear, asks for help to maintain a family-friendly image in a field where bikinis are becoming more common and more revealing. They insist they do not sell bikinis, which they call underwear you wear to the beach; they sell two-piece bathing suits. Don Draper tries to sell a pitch wherein the model's breasts are obscured by the slogan, \\"So well built, we can't show you the second floor\\". The Jantzen representatives reject the ad as overly risqu√©, and Draper - exasperated by the clients' refusal to acknowledge a changing culture and the realities of their business - ends up throwing the men out of the meeting room. As they leave, he finally agrees to do the interview with The Wall Street Journal. As the episode ends, Don is seen telling the journalist the swashbuckling story of how he instigated the formation of SCDP by having Lane Pryce fire them. Production \\"Public Relations\\" was heavily advertised in the weeks prior to its broadcasting. Producers of the series' entered into a cross-promotional deal with Banana Republic, and Janie Bryant, the show's costume designer, collaborated with QVC to design a clothing line inspired by mod subculture. President Barack Obama, a fan of Mad Men, had sent series creator Matthew Weiner a letter to express his admiration. Attention was further boosted by the release of a series of Barbie dolls based on characters from the show by toy manufacturer Mattel. A week prior to the premiere of the episode, recurring cast member Crista Flanagan (who plays Lois Sadler) posed nude for Playboy. \\"Public Relations\\" was screened at Duffy Square in New York City an hour before it was televised. Screenings for the episode was shown in Los Angeles, California on July 21, 2010, and again five days later at Duffy Square in New York City an hour before it was televised nationwide. The designs of costumes were altered, according to Bryant, to reflect the general fashion development and changes in mainstream pop culture during the 1960s. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, she teased: \\"My characters are in an office environment in New York; it's very different from what was going on in London at the time. But there will be some progression in their costumes, just like in real life. The press were given advanced copies of the episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. He continued: \\"I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and it was nice to get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more ‚Äì but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don‚Äôt? It was all very disappointing to me. \\"Public Relations\\" features several references to media, music, film, and other pop culture phenomena. Peggy and a coworker engage in a humorous conversation, in which they subsequently refer to \\"A Dear John and Marsha Letter\\" by Stan Freberg. The episode depicts the growing acceptance of the bikini in mainstream popular culture in the United States during the 1960s. Reception \\"Public Relations\\" first aired in the United States on July 25, 2010 on AMC. It was watched by 2.92 million viewers, and attained a 0.9 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Total viewership increased 5% from the previous season premiere, \\"Out of Town\\", which was viewed by 2.76 million viewers. In contrast, ratings for \\"Public Relations\\" were constant to that of \\"Out of Town\\". Likewise, total viewership were significantly up from the previous episode, \\"Shut the Door. Have a Seat\\", which attained 2.32 million viewers. The episode was critically acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, \\"Those cues also hold out the promise that the coming season will once again pivot the story on the workplace. It‚Äôs where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race is just what the series needs.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an \\"amazing\\" rating. Goldman felt that it start of the season on a strong note, writing, \\"It's a clever beat to start out with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0.\\" Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent. In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: \\"[She's] the person who's changed most notably over the last year. She drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he‚Äôs gone too far. And she‚Äôs not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along the way. Most significantly, she‚Äôs standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fianc√© but hears about it later. And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy.\\" Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that \\"she has come a long way.\\" TV Fanatic Dan Forcella felt that \\"Public Relations\\" was a fantastic episode, and asserted: \\"All in all it was a great start to the fourth season of Mad Men.\\" In conclusion, Forcella gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars. The Wall Street Journal journalist Cheryl Berman opined that the episode had a \\"little bit of everything we love about Mad Men.\\" William Bradley wrote in The Huffington Post that the series got off to \\"a cracking start\\" with \\"Public Relations\\". Similarly, Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News found it to be \\"a very good episode and a very promising restart\\", after what he considered a disappointing third season.

It is a court of original jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases as well as an appellate court. It is governed by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (SCJA). Structure The Supreme Court consists of three judges. Under Chapter 7 of the Constitution of Belize, the Chief Justice is appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister. The PM directly appoints the other two judges, known as Puisne Justices. The Supreme Court has had Chief Justices not only from Belize and other Caribbean countries, but from as far afield as Sierra Leone (Abdulai Conteh), Uganda (Samuel Awich, acting) and Palestine (Taufik Cotran). Section 40 of the SCJA divides Belize into three districts for judicial purposes, each consisting of two political districts. Section 46 names the place where the Supreme Court shall sit in each district. The districts are: *The Northern District, comprising Corozal District and Orange Walk District; the Supreme Court sits at the Court House in Corozal Town *The Central District, comprising Belize District and Cayo District; the Supreme Court sits at the Court House in Belize City *The Southern District, comprising Stann Creek District and Toledo District; the Supreme Court sits at the Court House in Dangriga The Supreme Court holds four sessions per year in each of the three districts, for a total of twelve sessions. The court of last resort was formerly the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom; however, Belize adopted the Caribbean Court of Justice in Trinidad and Tobago as its court of final appeal in 2010. Buildings Belize's first court house was designed by Gustav Von Ohlafen and built in 1818. The first sitting of the Supreme Court was held therein. An entirely wooden structure, it was destroyed by fire on 17 August 1918; then Governor-General William Hart-Bennett, who had come to render aid in extinguishing the fire, was hit by a flagpole and died of his injuries a few days later.

It is known from a mandible and a portion of the front of the skull collected from the municipality of Monte Alto in S√£o Paulo state. Morrinhosuchus refers to Morrinho de Santa Luzia, a hill nearby the collection site of the holotype, while luziae refers to the chapel of Santa Luzia, which is located on top of the hill. Description The skull and jaws are posteriorly broad but narrow significantly toward the front. The teeth at the back of the jaw are bulbous in shape and circular in cross-section (this shape is only found in one other notosuchian, Mariliasuchus, also from the Adamantina Formation). The mandible arches upward. The symphysis, or area where the two sides of the lower jaw meet, is formed mostly by the mandibles but also partly by the splenials. The skull preserves an antorbital fenestra, or opening in front of the eyes. The nasal, a bone at the top of the skull behind the nostrils, is relatively long. There is also a small notch at the contact between the premaxilla and the maxilla near the front of the snout. Morrinhosuchus can be distinguished from Mariliasuchus on the basis of several unique features. For example, there is a gap between the maxilla and the palatine bone around the midline of the palate. The palate itself is also wider than that of Mariliasuchus. While the teeth of the two genera are very similar, their number and placement in the jaw differs slightly. Morrinhosuchus has seven post-caniniform teeth while Mariliasuchus has only six. There are also differences in the shape of the rostrum between the two genera, as Morrinhosuchus has a higher, more pointed snout with less constriction than in Mariliasuchus. Paleoecology The Adamantina Formation, which is Turonian to Santonian in age, was deposited in semi-arid conditions around 95 million years ago. Morrinhosuchus was found in an outcrop of reddish sandstone with carbonate nodules, concretions, and areas of intense bioturbation. The Adamantina Formation is part of the larger Bauru Basin, from which several other notosuchians have been found. These include Sphagesaurus, Mariliasuchus, Adamantinasuchus, Armadillosuchus, and Baurusuchus.

The trail passes through low- elevation old-growth forest that was a nationwide political issue in the 1960s and 1970s because of conflicting plans for logging and for wilderness designation, respectively. In 1978, the U.S. Congress passed a bill adding the French Pete area to the Three Sisters Wilderness. Description The heavily used trail is in an old-growth forest in the western part of the Three Sisters Wilderness within the Willamette National Forest. At the trailhead at the path's western end, the elevation is . Open for hiking from spring through fall, the trail climbs about over and ends from the trailhead. French Pete Creek flows beside the trail for the trail's first five miles, approximately. The forest is made up of \\"gargantuan Douglas firs and 1000-year-old cedars,\\" with an understory that includes sword fern, Oregon grape, and twinflower. Area history Bigleaf maple and other vegetation beside the trail In 1938, the U.S. Forest Service added , including the French Pete area, to the Three Sisters Primitive Area, which had been established in 1937. In 1957, the Forest Service reduced the size of the protected area, removing French Pete from protection, so that more land could be available for timber sales. Conservation advocates sought to regain protection for French Pete. Their frustration with the Forest Service's level of authority over timber production and wilderness areas contributed to the inception and enactment of the Wilderness Act in Congress in 1964. The law created new wilderness areas and controversy over the management for the new areas. It marked the establishment and growth of an activist environmental movement at a time when both logging and recreation were rapidly increasing. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The movement is best known for the controversy surrounding management of French Pete. The Forest Service announced a plan for logging in the valley in 1968. Conservation groups and most local citizens were opposed to the plan. U.S. Senator Bob Packwood, a Republican from Oregon, recommended that the Forest Service abandon it. Groups such as the Oregon Wilderness Coalition and the Save French Pete Committee campaigned for protection of French Pete. The latter group appealed a logging proposal in court, but the appeal was rejected, and instead the logging was only delayed, adding to political tensions. French Pete Creek The Forest Service had a history of encouraging logging in the forests of western Oregon. It planned to log at least of timber if the area was not protected to ensure that the logging industry would be able \\"to survive the mounting demands from preservationists to stop logging scenic areas.\\" There was also concern that without logging, there would be a heightened risk of wildfire, because many of the area's trees were diseased or had been infested and killed by beetles. A forester from Springfield said, \\"It will be a very short time until the happenstance of lightning once again starts a fire that will wipe out the countryside.\\" In 1972, former U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat from Oregon, hiked into the area with conservation activists and encouraged Republican U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield to do the same. Morse expressed confidence that French Pete would be protected, while Hatfield still supported the plan for logging. However, Hatfield later reversed his position and began to support wilderness designation in general. In 1978, after \\"14 years of ardent protest by hikers, students, and environmentalists,\\" the Endangered Wilderness Act protected of the French Pete forest as wilderness, effective February 28. French Pete became one of the first low-elevation, old- growth valleys to be designated as wilderness in the United States.

House Before white settlement, Fulton County was a very heavily wooded region.Howe, Henry. Historical Collections of Ohio, Vol. 1. [Columbus?]: State of Ohio, 1898, 661. Although most early settlers in this Black Swamp county cleared their lands, Peter Goll, Sr. and his wife Catherine preserved significant areas of virgin woodlands on their property.State Board Recommends 10 Ohio Nominations to the National Register of Historic Places , Ohio Historical Society, 2005-08-05. Accessed 2010-08-06. After immigrating to the United States from France in 1836, the Golls' first home in western Fulton County was a log cabin, approximately east of the present farmstead. As Peter Goll, Jr. grew to adulthood, he married and established a new farmstead; building a new house, he used a distinctively European method of massive timber construction derived from the vernacular architecture of the region's earliest French and German settlers. In 1862, one day before their child was born, Peter, Jr. and his wife moved into the new white wooden house. Soon afterward, his parents also moved into the house; in order to accommodate both households, the structure was built divided into two parts, each accessible by a different front door. Barn Three years after the house was completed, the Golls erected a barn to shelter their different types of livestock: horses, dairy cows, and possibly pigs. Like the house, the barn employed distinctive construction methods; its structure was based on wooden mortise and tenon construction, with the massive beams being made from oak trees cut on the property. In later years, the barn was modified several times; one of these renovations involved the raising of the entire structure by one story to simplify the keeping of livestock. Public ownership The house and related buildings remained in the Goll family for a full century. By the 1960s, ownership had passed to a descendant named Florence Louys, who decided to sell the farmstead and woods to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), which converted it into parkland, the Goll Woods State Nature Preserve. After the state took control of the property, the house and barn were converted for park purposes; the barn was used for storage, and park rangers lived in the house. By the 1990s, ODNR had decided to cease using the house for residential purposes, and the decision was made in the early 2000s to demolish both buildings. Some local residents reacted strongly against this proposal; by working with ODNR and the Ohio General Assembly, they were able to secure grants from the state for the property's restoration, and renovation efforts began in both the barn and the house. In 2005, the Goll Homestead, comprising four buildings spread out over an area of , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Since that time, restoration efforts have continued ‚Äî volunteer members of the nonprofit Friends of Goll Homestead have repaired the buildings and returned them to a condition more closely resembling the days of Peter Goll, Jr., while teams from Eastern Michigan University have aided in removing modifications to the house in hopes of converting it into a base from which to conduct experiments in the surrounding woodland.

Alter was best known as the original director of Family Feud from the show's origin in the mid-1970s until the early 1990s and the director of The Price Is Right from 1986 until 2000.  Early life and career  Born in Chicago, Illinois, Alter studied piano with Teddy Wilson, from the Benny Goodman Quartet. Alter became a talented musician. Later on, Alter would put his talent to use composing the 1969 theme for To Tell the Truth.  Television work  His first job as a game show director was on the original CBS version of Beat the Clock in 1950. He then began a long association with Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, where he worked on many of their shows including What's My Line?, I've Got a Secret and To Tell the Truth. Alter directed the original version of Family Feud which ran on ABC from 1976 to 1985. When Family Feud was revived in 1988, Alter directed that version as well until October 1990, when Alter left the show to direct To Tell the Truth. Another show for which he directed both versions was The Price Is Right. He first worked on the original incarnation in New York starring Bill Cullen that ran from 1956 to 1965. In 1986 he became director of the current version of the show, replacing original director Marc Breslow. Alter was relieved of his position as director of The Price Is Right in 2000 by Pearson Television due to an unfavorable deposition against host Bob Barker. Bart Eskander replaced Alter as director of The Price Is Right, though Alter briefly resumed his position as part of a special agreement with Pearson. He retired following his departure from The Price Is Right. On the E! True Hollywood Story episode on Family Feud, Alter gave some insight on popular game show hosts saying: \\"Dawson became more of the boss. That happens to any M.C. who becomes popular...he can call the shots.\\"E! True Hollywood Story. Family Feud. July 28, 2002. In his career Alter won two Emmy awards. First one for Family Feud in 1982 and the second for The Price is Right in 1996. He received 14 Emmy nominations during his career.  Honey, I Blew Up the Kid lawsuit  In 1980, Alter submitted to the Walt Disney Company a story treatment about a kid who, due to a genetic accident, grew to an enormous size, which he based on his granddaughter's knocking over toys. By 1991, it became the movie Honey, I Blew Up the Kid. Alter sued Disney that year, claiming several similarities between that movie and his treatment. His case went to trial in 1993, which resulted in the jury awarding him $300,000.  Death  Alter died of natural causes on June 11, 2011 in Los Angeles, California; he was 89.

Often erroneously described as a Bermudian passport, this is identical to the passports issued in other British Overseas Territories except for minor differences referencing Bermuda. All recipients of new or replacement British passports issued in Bermuda, prior to 2002, received this passport, whether they possessed Bermudian status or not. The citizenship of the holder was indicated by rubber stamp in the appropriate field inside the passport. Prior to 1983, the citizenship for British citizens from the United Kingdom or the colonies was Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. After 1983, when citizens in the United Kingdom became British Citizens, colonials became British Dependent Territories Citizens (as this was purely to enable the British Governments immigration authorities to distinguish and discriminate against colonials, this type of British Citizenship did not entitle the holder to right of abode in any British Dependent Territory, including Bermuda. Bermudian status was indicated by the addition of (Bermuda) after British Dependent Territories Citizen on the rubber stamp), losing the right of abode in the United Kingdom unless already settled in the United Kingdom or having been born in, or having a parent who had been born in, the United Kingdom. Prior to 2002, it was not legal for a person to hold two British passports. A person who possessed both Bermudian status and right of abode (or settled status) in the United kingdom could have both indicated in the same passport. A British citizen who did not possess Bermudian status would receive the supposedly Bermudian passport if obtaining it in Bermuda, with the citizenship stamped as \\"British Citizen\\" only (unless the holder also possessed status in another territory or held yet another type of British Citizenship). Those who held neither Bermudian status nor the right of abode in the United Kingdom, but who were entitled to a British Passport would also receive the \\"Bermudian\\" Passport in Bermuda, with the appropriate citizenship stamped inside. Before 1983, a Bermudian Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and, after 1983, a British Dependent Territories Citizen with Bermudian status who did not possess the right of abode in the United Kingdom, who obtained a British Passport in the United Kingdom, or at a United Kingdom Consulate in a foreign country, received a normal British Passport (not the Bermudian passport) with the appropriate citizenship rubber stamped inside. In 1988, when the blue British Passports were replaced with a burgundy one of a common European Union pattern, the passports issued in the British Dependent Territories were changed accordingly (entitlement to free movement in the European Union was indicated only on the passports on the United Kingdom type passports, with EUROPEAN UNION added above UNITED KINGDOM OF British Dependent Territories CitizenshipGREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND on the outside of the front cover (where the Bermudian passport reads only BRITISH PASSPORT). In 2002, British Dependent Territories Citizenship was re- named British Overseas Territories Citizenship, remaining as the default citizenship for British citizens born in what were at the same time re- designated the British Overseas Territories, and the barriers that had been put in place in 1983 to end free movement of most Overseas Citizens (excepting Falkland Islanders and later Gibraltarians) into the United Kingdom were removed. British Overseas Territories Citizens were also entitled to obtain British Citizenship by obtaining a normal British Passport with the citizenship stamped as British Citizen. The restriction against holding more than one British passport was removed. The Department of Immigration was no longer permitted to issue new or replacement passports except for British Overseas Citizenship holders. The citizenship for these was entered only as British Overseas Territories Citizen. Bermudian status was stamped in separately on one of the internal pages. Without the stamp indicating that the passport holder is registered as a Bermudian, a Bermudian Passport with the citizenship entered as British Overseas Territories Citizen is not sufficient to identify the holder as a Bermudian. The endorsement indicating the holder has Bermudian status can be stamped into any British Passport, with the citizenship entered as either 'British Overseas Territories Citizen or 'British Citizen. As the Bermudian passport still lacked EUROPEAN UNION on the front cover, and used the country code BMU indicated inside instead of the GBR indicated in the British Citizen/United Kingdom passport, it is not necessarily accepted in other European Union countries as entitling the holder to free movement within the European Union. As a consequence, the only practical reason a Bermudian would obtain the Bermudian passport, whether in addition or in preference to the normal British passport with Bermudian status stamped inside, was for the purpose of entering the United States of America, which has lower entry restrictions on Bermudians than on other British nationals, but specifies they must present a British Passport with Government of Bermuda on the front, citizenship entered as either British Dependent Territories Citizen or British Overseas Territories Citizen, and the endorsement stamped to show the holder has been registered as a Bermudian. Since the HM Passport Office in the UK became the sole issuer of all British passports in 2016, only the normal (UK-type) British Passport is issued, whatever the type of British Citizenship entered. Bermuda Immigration enters the Bermudian status stamp separately (passports applied for in Bermuda can be obtained by handing the application to the Department of Immigration in Bermuda, which forwards the it to HM Passport office and receives it back on behalf of the applicant). Application Adult applicants can apply for a standard Bermudian ePassport at a cost of US$160.

During the match, each fighter in turn scores knockdown blows. After Cooper scores what appears to be a winning blow, the sister of Donnelly's trainer exhorts him to get up, informing him that she has bet her entire estate on his victory. Donnelly rises and is triumphant. The author of the ballad is unknown. The ballad has been in circulation since circa 1845. The earliest verifiable date found in publication is 1854. The contest depicted in the song took place on 13 December 1815, at the Curragh of Kildare in Ireland. In honour of his victory, the location of the bout was renamed Donnelly's Hollow, and a commemorative monument was later erected on the site. Multiple variants of the lyrics have been published in folk music collections. In the mid 19th century, the ballad passed from the oral tradition into publication through the printing of broadsides in Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States.

Life  Chihiro Iwasaki was born the first daughter of Masakatsu and Fumie Iwasaki on 15 December 1918, in Takefu (now Echizen-city), Fukui Prefecture, Japan. The following year, her family moved to Tokyo, where they lived until 1945. As a little girl, Chihiro loved to draw pictures. When she was fourteen years old, she began to learn drawing and oil painting under Sabur≈çsuke Okada, an artist and professor of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (later Tokyo University of the Arts). In 1936, Iwasaki graduated from high school, and the next year, at the age of eighteen, she began to learn how to draw Japanese calligraphy with inkstick and ink brush. In 1939, she entered a marriage arranged by her parents, but their relationship was always very distant. She moved with her husband to Dalian, Manchuria, but their marriage soon ended with his suicide, after which Iwasaki returned to Tokyo in 1941. In 1945, the Iwasaki family home in Tokyo was destroyed in an air raid, and Iwasaki and her family moved to the home of her grandmother in Matsumoto, Nagano. In 1946, after World War II was over, she joined the Japanese Communist Party, expressing a wish for the end of all war and suffering of children. After moving back to Tokyo, she became a writer and illustrator for the Jimmin Shinbun. She also drew numerous illustration for commercial posters, magazines and school text books as much as she could. In 1949, an editor of Doshinsha, a children's book publishing company, requested her to create Okaasan no Hanashi (The Story of a Mother), a kind of educational Kamishibai which became her first children's work It was published in 1950, and was awarded the Minister of Education Prize. When this success brought her some money, she made up her mind to be a professional illustrator. In the same year, she remarried to Zenmei Matsumoto, a fellow communist seven years younger than her. She bore their only child in 1951, a son named Takeshi whom she frequently used as a model for her illustrations of babies and children for children's books and magazines. In 1952, she had a home built in Nerima, Tokyo, which became The Chihiro Art Museum Tokyo after she died. In 1956, Iwasaki authored her first picture book, Hitori de Dekiru yo (I Can Do it All by Myself). That year, she received the Juvenile Culture Award of the Shogakukan Publishing Co. for her illustration works for children's books and magazines. In 1960, her AIUEO no Hon (The Alphabet Book: A-I-U-E-O) won the Sankei Children's Books Award. In 1966, Iwasaki moved to a cottage with studio in the Kurohime Highlands, near Lake Nojiri, Nagano Prefecture. She loved the Kurohime Highlands and spent much time making illustrations for children's books in this cottage every year. In 1971, Kotori no Kuru Hi (The Pretty Bird) won the Graphic Prize Fiera di Bologna. Senka no Naka no Kodomo-tachi (Children in the Flames of War), published in 1973, won the bronze medal of the Leipzig International Book Fair the following year. In 1974, Iwasaki died of liver cancer at the age of 55. Seven years after her death, in 1981, Totto- Chan: The Little Girl at the Window, written by Tetsuko Kuroyanagi, was published with selected illustrations by Iwasaki. An English edition was published in 1984. =Style= The majority of her illustrations were water- colors, but some of her work contained Japanese calligraphy, and she also produced some oil paintings. Her style was largely influenced by two of her favorite writers, Kenji Miyazawa and Hans Christian Andersen.

(Bogart was top-billed over Sheridan in opening credits of the film.) It is based on the Louis Bromfield novel Better Than Life. Sheridan introduced the hit song \\"Angel in Disguise\\". Plot Aspiring songwriter Tommy Taylor (Jeffrey Lynn) pins his hopes on the promises of his employer, gambler and gangster \\"Chips\\" Maguire (Humphrey Bogart). However, Chips uses the gun he had registered under Tommy's name to kill Monks (Herb Vigran) when he betrays Chips to the police. It turns out Chips had Tommy carry the gun for just such a situation, to provide him with a fall guy. Needing a place to hide out, Chips blackmails Tommy into taking him to the boarding house owned by his mother, Nora Taylor (Jessie Busley), and her longtime friend, Maggie Ryan (Una O'Connor), by threatening to turn the gun over to the police. Nora is overjoyed to see her son after an absence of five years. Tommy introduces them to Chips, who pretends to be a man named Grasselli recovering from a nervous condition. By chance, Maggie's showgirl daughter, Sarah Jane (Ann Sheridan), returns the same day. The two mothers dream of their children getting married, but Tommy seems indifferent to Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane becomes suspicious of Grasselli, who does his best to avoid being seen. She eventually hides in the hall bathroom and recognizes him, having worked for him once. Unwilling to get Nora and Maggie in trouble, she agrees to keep Chips' secret. Nora starts mothering Chips, as does Maggie after a while. Tired of hiding in his room all the time, Chips emerges and becomes acquainted with the other boarders: Miss Flint (ZaSu Pitts), Mr. Salmon (Grant Mitchell), washed-up magician The Great Boldini (Felix Bressart), and Mr. Van Diver (Brandon Tynan). In the parlor, Chips enjoys an amateur show put on by Tommy, Sarah Jane, and the boarders. When Sarah Jane learns that Nora and Maggie are about to lose their house due to unpaid taxes, she turns to Chips for help, encouraging his attentions, even though she is in love with Tommy. He provides the money, but as that will only postpone their financial problem, he suggests (out of sheer boredom) that they set up the boarding house to bring in money by turning it into an exclusive nightclub, with the added advantage that Tommy and Sarah Jane can showcase their talents. Nora is enthusiastic, but it takes some persuasion to get Maggie to go along. In the meantime, Miss Flint sees Chips' picture in a crime magazine. Sarah Jane intimates that Chips will have her killed in a gruesome manner if she tells anyone what she knows. But on opening night, after drinking too much champagne, she becomes frightened by Chips' taunts and goes to the police station. Two detectives spot Chips in the nightclub, but agree to let him watch the rest of the show. Tommy sees the cops and assumes the worst. He goes to the roof to be alone. When Sarah Jane joins him there, he finally admits he loves her. She urges him to flee, but he refuses to run away. Though he can easily incriminate Tommy, Chips decides to confess to the murder, allowing the young lovers to make a clean beginning.

The episode was written by Andrew Holden and directed by Simon Meyers, and premiered on BBC One on 5 July 2005. In \\"Tuesday's Child\\", registrar Diane Lloyd (Patricia Potter) travels to Ghana in an attempt to persuade consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) to return to Holby and save Holby City Hospital's general surgery ward. Ric deals with family issues, whilst trying to secure funding for his brother's clinic. The episode was filmed entirely on location in Ghana as part of the BBC's \\"Africa Lives\\" season, exploring African culture for UK audiences. It was the second episode of Holby City filmed outside the UK, following a 2004 episode set in Paris. The serial continued to film one episode abroad annually until 2008, when BBC budget cuts curtailed further foreign filming. The Holby City crew spent five weeks in Elmina, using members of the local community in supporting roles. One crew member contracted malaria during filming, and several more were hospitalised. Both Quarshie and Potter expressed their pride at being part of the episode, with Quarshie deeming it his best work for the series. Adrian Edmondson guest-starred as surgeon Abra Durant, his first appearance in Holby City. He proved so popular in the role that he was asked to return twice more in 2005, and continued to make appearances in the series until December 2008. The episode was watched by 7.27 million viewers. It was the second most- watched programme on BBC One for the week of broadcast, and the fourth most- watched show across all channels. The episode's premise received some criticism prior to broadcast, however the episode itself was generally well received by critics, and was praised by viewers in a 2006 report on the portrayal of Africa on British television. Plot Registrar Diane Lloyd flies to Ghana, hoping to persuade consultant Ric Griffin to return to Holby and save Holby City Hospital's general surgery ward from being subsumed into an expanded cardiothoracic ward. She finds Ric at odds with his brother Kumi (Danny Sapani), who runs a clinic. Ric wants to perform free operations, but Kumi is desperate for money to keep the clinic running. Diane appeals to Ric to return to Holby, for the sake of his pregnant daughter Jess as well as the hospital, but Ric insists that he is needed in Ghana, and tells Diane to go home. She talks to Ric's mother, Paulina (Abigail Kubeka), who reveals that Ric had a strained relationship with his father, and did not attend his funeral after twenty years of estrangement. She also meets Ric's friend Percy \\"Abra\\" Durant (Adrian Edmondson), who pries as to the nature of her relationship with Ric, and flirts with Diane. Ric meets with an old school friend, Kwame Attakora (Fred Nii Amugi), now a successful local businessman. He attempts to persuade him to invest in the clinic, but Kwame, aware of Ric's family trouble in England, doubts his commitment. Ric is furious with Kumi for telling Kwame about his problems, but Kwame states that he could not deceive him, and that Ric is does not understand Ghanaian honour. Without Kwame's support, the clinic goes bankrupt and Kumi chains the doors closed. Travelling to the airport for her flight home, Diane and Ric come across a woman in labour, Joanna (Akofa Edjeani Asiedu), who is also suffering from malaria and having trouble breathing. It is unlikely she will survive a natural childbirth, and the nearest hospital is two hours away. They travel back to Kumi's clinic, collecting an inebriated Abra along the way. After Abra threatens to force entry, Kumi unchains the doors and they manage to deliver the baby and save Joanna. As Diane has missed her flight, she suggests to Ric that they visit his father's grave. At the graveside, Ric tells Diane about his troubled relationship with his father, and confesses that he has feelings for her. They see a woman nearby who Diane recognises, having seen Paulina giving her money the day before. Ric confronts her, and discovers she is Esi Griffin (Gloria Acheampong), his father's last wife and widow. She has a son who is not in school, but will not explain her circumstances and tells Ric to speak to Kumi. Ric confronts his brother about Esi, and Kumi tells him that their father died of AIDS, but the family kept it secret to avoid bringing shame on themselves. Because of her relationship with his father, Esi is also HIV positive. Ric confides in Diane, who attempts to kiss him, but Ric tells her to go home to her husband Owen. She asks him to return with her, but Ric says he must stay in Ghana. Abra takes Diane to Kwame, and she pleads with him on Ric's behalf. They go to the clinic, where Kwame tells Ric he will provide the required funding, on the condition that Ric stays in Ghana. Ric agrees, and bids Diane goodbye as she returns to Holby. Production Holby City is regularly filmed at the BBC's Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. In 2004, an episode was shot on location in Paris, and in March 2005, it was announced that an upcoming episode would be set in Ghana, as part of the BBC's \\"Africa lives\\" series, a week of programmes exploring African life and culture for UK audiences. The episode was shot entirely on location in Ghana, and was described by the BBC as \\"chang[ing] Ric and Diane's lives forever.\\" The crew stayed in Elmina, and spent five weeks in Africa. During filming, one crew member contracted malaria, and three more were hospitalised with dehydration, diarrhoea and heat exhaustion. Until 2008, Holby City continued to film one episode abroad annually, with a 2006 episode set in Switzerland, a 2007 episode in Dubai, and a 2008 episode in Cape Town. Series producer Diana Kyle stated in November 2008 that due to major BBC budget cuts, the series would not be filming abroad again for the \\"foreseeable future\\". Potter and Quarshie are the only regular Holby City cast members who appear in the episode. Discussing Ric's motivations in \\"Tuesday's Child\\", Quarshie explained that his character was born there, and was \\"always meant to return at some point\\", leading to issues with his family. He expanded that in leaving Holby, Ric aimed to escape \\"the politics and stresses in his own life\\", stating: \\"It's somewhere he can recharge himself by getting back to uncomplicated medicine. The irony is, when he gets there, he realises there's no such thing, especially when you're constantly hustling to get funding for your clinic and struggling to find qualified doctors and nurses.\\" Like his character, Quarshie is native to Ghana, though moved to the United Kingdom when he was three years old. His background had some influence on the episode's plot. While the end of the episode sees Ric choose to stay in Ghana, Quarshie remained in Holby City, with his character returning to the series soon thereafter. He explained that: \\"[Ric] has to stay in the country for the integrity of the episode, but for the integrity of the series, he must return.\\" Quarshie deemed the episode the greatest work he had done for Holby City, and \\"one of the best episodes written\\", expressing his pride for it, and commending the BBC for the season of Africa-related programmes. Potter felt \\"honoured\\" to be part of the episode, deeming it a \\"privilege\\" to work on. She was concerned about her ability to work in the 120 ¬∞F Ghanaian heat, which she described as \\"like walking into an oven\\", but through the work of the series' make-up artists, was made to seem temperate on screen. \\"Tuesday's Child\\" was Edmondson's first appearance as Abra Durant Actor and comedian Adrian Edmondson guest-starred in the episode as surgeon Abra Durant, having been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception. His character proved so popular that Edmondson reprised the role twice in 2005, and signed a six-month contract in 2006, with series producer Emma Turner commenting that: \\"He made a huge impact in the few episodes that he was involved in.\\" Edmondson returned to the series again in 2007, then 2008, making his final appearance in December 2008, when Abra returned to Ghana with Holby General nurse Kyla Tyson (Rakie Ayola). Edmondson ultimately departed from the series to pursue a full-time music career as part of the folk band The Bad Shepherds. He deemed the role of Abra a \\"dream\\", calling him a \\"great character\\", and characterising him as \\"a maverick [that] can do things the others would not be able to get away with.\\" Other guest- stars were cast locally. Ghanaian actors Kwame O. Ansah, David Dontoh and Akorfa Asiedu appeared in the episode, and a scene between Ric and Kwame involving a flotilla of boats featured real Elmina fisherman. Following the episode's completion, the Holby City production team in conjunction with the British High Commission gifted three flat-screen computers and a laser printer to the Elmina OLA Girls Boarding School. Simon Massey of the BBC stated that the people of Elmina had been \\"extremely supportive\\" and played a large role during filming, and that the donated equipment was a way of giving something back to the community. Reception The episode was watched by 7.27 million viewers, up 310,000 on the previous episode, \\"Rat Race\\", and 230,000 higher than the series average of 7.04 million viewers. Holby City was the second most-watched programme on BBC One in the week of broadcast, with only the soap opera EastEnders attaining higher ratings. It was also the fourth most-watched show across all channels, behind EastEnders, and ITV1's Coronation Street and Emmerdale. Prior to the episode's broadcast, John McKie of the Daily Record commented that in setting special editions of Holby City, Ground Force and Rolf on Art in Africa, BBC One controller Lorraine Heggessey was contradicting her desire to provide an alternative to negative coverage of the continent. The Western Mail criticised the build-up to the episode, writing that Holby City had abandoned its roots as a medical drama, concentrating instead on \\"wholly unbelievable\\" relationships between its main characters, with patient- care now incidental to inter-collegiate romances. The episode itself received positive reviews. Television critic Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror called it \\"mad but brilliant\\", and the Sunday Mercury selected the episode as recommended viewing. Sarah Moolla of The People praised the episode for strengthening her \\"growing belief that Holby is becoming by far the best medical drama on TV\\". She called Ric and Diane two of the series' \\"strongest and most likeable characters\\", commenting that with the addition of nurses Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) and Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams), it could be turned into a spin-off series. Moolla felt that the episode could have been a \\"patronising Holby Goes Ghananas farce\\", like the Paris episode which she found \\"appalling [...] toe-curlingly bad\\", but instead deemed \\"Tuesday's Child\\" a \\"powerful, haunting and believable episode which you don't have to be a fan of the series to enjoy.\\" \\"Reflecting the Real World\\", a 2006 report examining the portrayal of Africa on British television, found that \\"Tuesday's Child\\" was one of the most popular programmes amongst those shown to viewers, alongside a Channel 4 documentary on AIDS and a BBC series following teachers and pupils in Uganda. Neera Dhingra of Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), one of the organisations which commissioned the report, commented that, \\"The people who took part in our focus groups were very clear that they liked positive and transformative television, characters that they could relate to - basically good storytelling.\\" References External links * * Category:Holby City episodes Category:2005 British television episodes ","title":"Tuesday's Child (Holby City)"},{"id":"28284468","text":"The Battle of Verona was fought on 18 October 1805 between the French Army of Italy under the command of Andr√© Mass√©na and an Austrian army led by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. By the end of the day, Massena seized a bridgehead on the east bank of the Adige River, driving back the defending troops under Josef Philipp Vukassovich. The action took place near the city of Verona in northern Italy during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. In the fall of 1805, Emperor Napoleon I of France planned for his powerful Grande Arm√©e to fall upon and crush the Austrian Empire army in southern Germany. The French emperor hoped to win the war in the Danube valley. To help accomplish this purpose, Napoleon wanted Mass√©na to hold Archduke Charles' large army in Italy for as long as possible. In order for Mass√©na to grapple with his enemies, it was necessary to establish a bridgehead on the east bank of the Adige. During the battle, the French attacked across the river, cleared two suburbs, and seized some high ground on the opposite bank. The Austrians suffered considerably more casualties than the French in the encounter. This clash set the stage for the subsequent Battle of Caldiero on 29 to 31 October. Background =Austrian plans= On 5 September 1805, Feldmarschall Archduke Charles, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Friedrich von Lindenau, and General-Major Anton Mayer von Heldensfeld drew up the final Austrian strategic plan. This strategy largely conformed to an earlier plan worked out by Charles, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack von Leiberich, and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. However, Mayer convinced Charles and Lindenau to transfer troops from Italy to Germany, where Mack was pressing for an invasion of the Electorate of Bavaria. Archduke Charles The original plan put 120,000 troops in Italy, 70,000 in Germany, 25,000 in the Tyrol, and 20,000 for internal security. Mayer's revision reduced the force in Italy to 90,000, with 30,000 on the march for Germany.Schneid, 18 Archduke Charles disagreed with Mack's aggressive strategy. When Emperor Francis I asked his opinion, Charles wrote him that Mack was making a serious blunder by invading Bavaria. Nevertheless, the emperor allowed Mack to pursue his course of action.Rothenberg, 89‚Äì90 Fearing the worst in Bavaria, Charles took up a defensive posture, even though he knew he outnumbered Mass√©na. The archduke posted Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller's 22,000 troops in the Italian Tyrol, north of Rivoli Veronese. The archduke lined the east bank of the Adige from Verona to Legnago with 40,000 soldiers and he held a 30,000-man central reserve at Caldiero. Of these troops, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Count Heinrich von Bellegarde watched Verona, with the division of Vukassovich northeast of the city and the divisions of Feldmarschall-Leutnants Joseph Simbschen and Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough to the east. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Eug√®ne-Guillaume Argenteau's six divisions manned the line at Caldiero. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Paul Davidovich with two divisions defended the Adige near Legnago.Schneid, 19‚Äì20 =French plans= Emperor Napoleon I At the beginning of August 1805, Napoleon gave up his plan for invading Great Britain across the English Channel. Instead, he decided to move his army from the channel coast to south Germany to smash the Austrian army. He hoped to be at the Austrian capital of Vienna in November, before the Russian army appeared on the scene.Schneid, 20 With corps numbering I through VII, a cavalry corps, the Imperial Guard, and Bavarian allies, Napoleon committed 194,000 troops to the campaign in Germany. In training, personnel, morale, and organization, the Grande Arm√©e was the finest body of troops that Napoleon would ever command. On 26 August, he gave the order to march and a month later his troops were crossing the Rhine.Rothenberg, 90 Andr√© Mass√©na Thanks to an elaborate spy network, Napoleon was aware that the Austrians deployed their largest army in Italy. The emperor desired that Archduke Charles' army not be allowed to influence events in southern Germany. Mass√©na, whose army only counted 48,000 troops, first looked to his defenses. In 1805 the Adige was the boundary between French Lombardy and Austrian Venetia.Schneid, 20‚Äì21 On the west side of the Adige, Mass√©na placed 5,000 garrison troops in the fortresses of the Quadrilateral, that is, Verona, Legnago, Peschiera del Garda, and Mantua.Rothenberg, 94 Initially, Mass√©na held the line of the Adige with three infantry divisions. General of Division Jean-Mathieu Seras observed Hiller from a strong position at Rivoli in the north. General of Division Gaspard Am√©d√©e Gardanne held Verona and General of Division Jean-Antoine Verdier defended the Adige near Legnago in the south. Following Napoleon's instructions, Mass√©na began concentrating his army. He intended to mass his striking force of five infantry and two cavalry divisions near Verona. He planned to have Verdier's division, supported by General of Division Charles Randon de Pully's cavalry division, divert the Austrians' attention by making a probe farther south.Schneid, 22 To play for time, Napoleon authorized Mass√©na to propose a truce. He did so, and Archduke Charles accepted. On 29 September, a convention was drawn up whereby the armies would not begin fighting until six days after one side notified the other. A week later, Mass√©na sent word to Charles that hostilities would begin on 14 October. On 17 October Charles received word that Napoleon was in Munich. Foreseeing the disastrous outcome of the Ulm Campaign, the archduke made plans to withdraw from Italy. But first he would defend himself against a French attack.Schneid, 22‚Äì23 Battle =French Army= Mass√©na's order of battle on 18 October is as follows.Schneid, 161‚Äì163.

Seras and Verdier carried out successful diversions on the left and right flanks. Directly east of Verona was the suburb of Veronetta, which the Austrians had heavily fortified. In addition, the bridges between Verona and Veronetta were well-covered by Austrian artillery. Therefore, Mass√©na turned his eyes to the west side of Verona, to the suburb of San Giorgio, which was accessible by a stone bridgeSchneid, 23 known as the Castelvecchio Bridge (Ponte di Castelvecchio). Vukassovich was responsible for defending the area. The Austrian division commander had a wall built across the center of the bridge and fortified San Giorgio. However, Vukassovich only allocated two battalions to its defense. He deployed six battalions in the hills northeast of Verona, while the remainder of his division lay farther north, maintaining contact with Hiller's corps.Schneid, 23‚Äì24 Mass√©na decided to personally command the bridge assault. Stripping the 24 voltiguer (light infantry) companies from the battalions in Gardanne and General of Division Guillaume Philibert Duhesme's divisions, the French army commander formed them into a storming column. The voltiguers were supported by a sapper battalion and a light artillery company, and backed by Gardanne's division.Schneid, 24 In the early hours of 18 October, Mass√©na led his storming column silently onto the Castelvecchio Bridge. The sappers set charges which destroyed the wall, and the French column surged forward. After quickly overrunning the Austrian outposts, the voltiguers attacked San Giorgio. General of Brigade Louis Fursy Henri Comp√®re advanced to support the attack, while Vukassovich reinforced the defenders with two battalions. Sometime after 10:00 am San Giorgio fell to the French. Soon afterward, Vukassovich had the Archduke Ferdinand Hussar Regiment # 3 and General-Major Hannibal Sommariva's Grenz infantry on hand. The Austrian division commander hurled his hussars at Comp√®re's brigade. The French formed square, and with the help of artillery firing across the river, drove off the Austrian cavalry.Schneid, 27 Around noon, Verdier mounted a diversionary attack. Easily penetrating General-Major Joseph Radetzky von Radetz's screen, he crossed the Adige at Albaredo d'Adige with two battalions of the 23rd Light Infantry Regiment. Believing that the action at Verona was the diversion and the crossing at Albaredo was the real attack, Archduke Charles marched against Verdier with three columns. By the time he arrived at Albaredo, the 23rd Light had withdrawn safely to the French side of the Adige. Mass√©na also ordered Seras to mount a diversion in the north. Leaving part of his division at Rivoli, Seras demonstrated in front of Pescantina, 11 kilometers west of Verona. This action froze half of Vukassovich's division, which remained watching Seras and never got into action. In the afternoon, some of Duhesme's troops and the 23rd Chasseurs √† cheval were in action on the French side. By 5:00 pm, San Leonardo fell to the French after severe fighting, allowing Mass√©na's troops to occupy the heights and press to the east. At this time, Bellegarde appeared with Feldmarschall- Leutnants Andreas O'Reilly and Joseph Simbschen's divisions at the hamlet of San Felice in the Val Pantena, northeast of Verona. Bellegarde pushed back the French a short distance until darkness and fatigue ended the fighting. Results Johann Frimont One historian puts French losses at 77 dead and 246 wounded, a total of 323, while stating Austrians casualties as 1152, including 246 killed and 906 wounded. A second authority writes that the French counted 150 killed and 300 wounded, while Austrian losses numbered 1,622 killed, wounded, and captured, and four cannons. Mass√©na failed to capture Veronetta, but he carved out a bridgehead on the heights northeast of Verona. Angry that Vukassovich failed to stop Massena's attack, Archduke Charles dismissed him and replaced him with Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg- Orsini. The archduke believed that Vukassovich could have repulsed the first French assault if he had defended the bridge with more troops. Smith writes that Vukassovich was dismissed because he gave battle too close to the river, against explicit orders. It is impossible to reconcile the Smith and Schneid accounts so only Schneid's view is presented in the article. Even so, Charles had sufficient troops to attack the French bridgehead. Instead, he contented himself with holding Veronetta, placing General-Major Johann Maria Philipp Frimont's brigade in the suburb of San Michele, east of Veronetta, and ordering Rosenberg to hold the Val Pantena. The Austrian commander withdrew the rest of Bellegarde's Right Wing into the Caldiero lines. Massena reinforced his bridgehead with all of Gardanne and Duhesme's divisions. Both Charles and Massena later explained away their subsequent inaction by claiming that they were awaiting events in Germany.Schneid, 29 The next action was the Battle of Caldiero from 29 to 31 October.

It was invented in 1989 by neuroscientist Yiannis Laouris, with help and inspiration from his daughter Romina, and his friend George Vakanas in Tucson, Arizona. Glasnost The Game is a turn-based game for ideally four players. It is played on a board depicting a partly modified political map of the Earth, divided into territories, which are grouped into seven continents. The continents are surrounded by a path along which the token-ships of the players move. The Players move their tokens with the classical throw of dice. Players attempt to colonize bordering territories from other players. Once a player owns a territory, they may construct industries. In every round, their industries produce weapons for new armies, which eventually facilitate a player‚Äôs ability to make war and conquer new territories (again with the throw of dice). At any time, a player may unilaterally disarm any country that belongs to them. The winner is the player who has the most points when the whole world is disarmed. Equipment Each Glasnost The Game game comes with a Board, one die, 36 cards and a number of differently colored tokens denoting armies and industries: Armies are dark, industries are light colored. Both types of token come in the following numbers and denominations: 25x1, 20x2, 5x2, 5x10, 5x20 Description of the Game The game is played on a board depicting a partly modified political map of the Earth, divided into 166 territories, which are grouped into five continents. Players begin with ownership of 25 industries and 25 armies. Industries represent economic power. Armies are used to colonize/capture adjacent countries or to apply political pressure in order to achieve disarming. Players attempt to colonize territories from other players. Once a player owns a territory, they may build industries inside that territory. In every round, industries produce armies, which eventually assist a player‚Äôs capacity to make wars and colonize territories. The ultimate goal of the game is to disarm the Earth. During the process of disarming, players earn credits. At any time, a player may unilaterally disarm any country that belongs to them. When the whole Earth becomes demilitarized, the winner of the game is the player who earned the most points. Demilitarization is the only way to earn points. In the process of the game, it is necessary to negotiate disarming, colonize new countries and make wars with opponents. The game develops players‚Äô abilities to conceptualize, evaluate and implement strategies of cooperation and aggression. _The basic principles include:_ # Declaring war is the only way to colonize a territory # Nobody may ever attack a demilitarized country. # Disarming a country is irreversible and is the only way to earn points. A successful implementation of the game takes players from a phase in which aggression and war is required in order to achieve greater control on Earth, to a phase in which players compete in disarming countries. The name denotes the theoretical impossibility of achieving a state of worldwide peace without going through the devastating experiences of war. History The inventor witnessed the effects of Cold War while he was studying medicine in Leipzig, then East Germany, when the country was communist. The inventor moved to G√∂ttingen, then West Germany at the time when Mikhail Gorbachev published his Peristroika and Glasnost books. While watching deadly wars in the news, and playing board games like Anti-Monopoly and Risk with his 7-year-old daughter, she was annoyed by the suffering of people all over the planet, and she expressed a wish to ‚Äúdemilitarize‚Äù the earth. As the father used the word ‚Äúglasnost‚Äù, to explain the impossibility of a world without armies, she suggested the creation of a game that begins with wars and armies and the winner would be the player who manages to get rid of them.

(Roman copy of a 2nd-century BCE Greek original; Villa Corsini.) In classical studies the term epyllion (Ancient Greek: , plural: , ) refers to a comparatively short narrative poem (or discrete episode within a longer work) that shows formal affinities with epic, but betrays a preoccupation with themes and poetic techniques that are not generally or, at least, primarily characteristic of epic proper. Etymology and modern usage Ancient Greek (epyllion) is the diminutive of (epos) in that word's senses of \\"verse\\" or \\"epic poem\\"; Liddell and Scott's Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon thus defines as a \\"versicle, scrap of poetry\\" or \\"short epic poem\\", citing for the latter definition Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 2.68 (65a-b):Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon, 9th ed. (Oxford, 1940), s.v. . { style=\\"border: 0px;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"25px;  ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"25px;  ! scope=\\"col\\"  - border=\\"0\\" - Valign=top     A short epic (epyllion) attributed to Homer, entitled The One for the Thrushes, acquired this name because Homer was rewarded with thrushes when he sang it to his children--Menaechmus tells the story in his On Artisans. } This is in fact the only ancient instance of the word that shows anything approaching the connotations with which it is most often employed by modern scholars,Fordyce (1961) 272 n. 1. and epyllion did not enter the common language of criticism until the 19th century. Wolf was apparently responsible for popularizing the term, for two of his essays from early in that century are referred to by titles including epyllion: ' (Observations on the Shield of Heracles, an Epyllion Falsely Attributed to Hesiod) and ' (The Idylls and Epyllia of Theocritus).Most (1982). The locus classicus for the sense of epyllion as a hexametric mythological poem that is not only comparatively short, but also imbued to some extent with the characteristics of Hellenistic poetry is Moritz Haupt's 1855 study of Catullus 64,Reprinted in Haupt (1876), with the key discussion occurring at 76-79; cf. Fordyce (1961) 272 n. 1. but it is likely that Haupt was using a term that had in the preceding decades become common to discussions of the shorter narrative poems of the Alexandrians.Reilly (1953) 111. In the early 20th century the first studies specifically devoted to the concept of the epyllion were undertaken, with Leumann's work on Hellenistic epyllia, Jackson's study of the possible Roman examples, and Crump's attempt at a diachronic study of the epyllion as a single genre whose history could be traced from the Greek poems of the Hellenistic period through the Augustan period's Latin texts.Leumann (1904); Jackson (1913); and Crump (1931). The exact meaning and applicability of the term epyllion has remained a matter of dispute, and Richard Hunter's recent appraisal summarizes well the current opinion regarding epyllia: Characteristics An epyllion is, in its most basic definition, a narrative poem written in dactylic hexameters that is comparatively short. There is disagreement about whether the term should also be applied to works written in elegiac couplets. notes with incredulity that \\"some scholars even apply the term 'epyllion' to elegiac poems!\\" believes the common modern usage includes elegiacs and counts the Acontius and Cydippe episode of Callimachus' Aetia as an epyllion. The exact meaning of \\"comparatively short\\" varies among modern scholars, with some considering Theocritus, Idyll 13 (75 lines) an epyllion, while Eratosthenes' Hermes is commonly classed as an example, even though at some 1,600 lines it would probably have taken up two papyrus rolls. A similar variation in lengths is found in epyllia that form episodes within larger works. Virgil's Nisus and Euryalus digression in the Aeneid totals 73 verses and is sometimes considered an epyllion, while the so-called Aristaeus- epyllion (Georgics 4.315‚Äì558) is considerably more substantial and reminiscent of independent epyllia from the Hellenistic period. =Subject matter and tone= =Poetic techniques= Callimachus, Hecale fr. 1 Hollis = 230 Pf.: { style=\\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space: nowrap;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"400px\\"  - border=\\"0\\" - Valign=top  A certain Attic woman once resided in Erechtheus' highlands } Catullus 64.50-54: { style=\\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space: nowrap;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"400px\\"  - border=\\"0\\" - Valign=top haec vestis priscis hominum variata figuris heroum mira virtutes indicat arte. namque fluentisono prospectans litore Diae, Thesea cedentem celeri cum classe tuetur indomitos in corde gerens Ariadna furores This cloth, embellished with the figures of earlier men, showed with remarkable art the virtues of the heroes.

He started six games at fullback for the 1954 Wolverines. Baer's best game for the Wolverines came in a 34-0 win over Minnesota on October 23, 1954, as he gained 94 rushing yards on 17 carries (5.5 yards per carry) and scored two touchdowns. The following week against Indiana, he rushed for 92 yards on 22 carries (4.2 yards per carry) and scored one touchdown. In his final game for Michigan, he gained 75 yards and averaged 6.3 yards per carry against Ohio State. Baer played for the Wolverines on defense as well as offense and was considered \\"a vicious tacker and a hard runner.\\" After the 1954 season, Baer was selected as the Most Valuable Player on the 1954 Michigan football team. He was also selected to play in the Blue-Gray All-Star Football Classic. He scored the winning touchdown for the blue team on a fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Missouri's Vic Eaton. Baer graduated from Michigan in 1955 with a bachelor of arts degree in history.

Its walls are primarily weatherboard, although decorated with stone elements; the roof is made of slates; and details around the house include elements of wood and of iron., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-08-07. The two-story house is primarily frame, and its slate roof is a mansard. His house on Clinton Street completed, Clement remained deeply involved in the business affairs of Wauseon. In 1889, Clement participated in the founding of the Wauseon State Bank, and on its board of directors he sat until the end of his life. In 1983, Clement's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying for the Register for two different reasons ‚Äî its high-quality Italianate architecture and its connection to George S.

One of his goals came in a 12‚Äì1 win over Gloucester City, which remains the club's biggest-ever win in a competitive fixture. In 1948, he moved on to Corby Town and later played for Goole Town. Managerial career In 1950 he took over as manager of Corby, and led the team to the United Counties League championship in both his first two seasons in charge. He later managed Kettering Town. Notes A. Akers played three matches, scoring three goals, at the start of the 1939‚Äì40 season, but the season was abandoned due to the outbreak of the Second World War and all matches played up to that point expunged.

Morris‚ÄìLecar neurons exhibit both class I and class II neuron excitability. History Catherine Morris (b. 24 December 1949) is a Canadian biologist. She won a Commonwealth scholarship to study at Cambridge University, where she earned her PhD in 1977. She became a professor at the University of Ottawa in the early 1980s. As of 2015, she is an emeritus professor at the University of Ottawa. Harold Lecar (18 October 1935 ‚Äì 4 February 2014) was an American professor of biophysics and neurobiology at the University of California Berkeley. He graduated with his PhD in physics from Columbia University in 1963. Experimental method The Morris‚ÄìLecar experiments relied on the current clamp method established by Keynes et al. (1973). The principal assumptions underlying the Morris‚ÄìLecar model Among the principal assumptions are these: #Equations apply to a spatially iso-potential patch of membrane. There are two persistent (non-inactivating) voltage-gated currents with oppositively biased reversal potentials. The depolarizing current is carried by Na+ or Ca2+ ions (or both), depending on the system to be modeled, and the hyperpolarizing current is carried by K+. #Activation gates follow changes in membrane potential sufficiently rapidly that the activating conductance can instantaneously relax to its steady-state value at any voltage. #The dynamics of the recovery variable can be approximated by a first-order linear differential equation for the probability of channel opening.This assumption is never exactly true, since channel proteins are composed of subunits, which must act in concert, to reach the open state. Despite missing delays in the onset of recovery, the model appears to be adequate for phase-plane considerations for many excitable systems. Physiological description The Morris‚ÄìLecar model is a two-dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations. It is considered a simplified model compared to the four-dimensional Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model. Qualitatively, this system of equations describes the complex relationship between membrane potential and the activation of ion channels within the membrane: the potential depends on the activity of the ion channels, and the activity of the ion channels depends on the voltage. As bifurcation parameters are altered, different classes of neuron behavior are exhibited. is associated with the relative time scales of the firing dynamics, which varies broadly from cell to cell and exhibits significant temperature dependency.

It is situated at the base of Mount Konocti on the south shore of Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake interior to California. Its amenities included a spa, a miniature golf course, a marina, and two Olympic-size swimming pools. History The resort was founded in 1959 by Joseph Mazzola, president of United Association Local 38, a union of Northern California plumbers.. The intention behind the formation of the resort was to provide low-cost vacation housing for union members. In 1982, a federal judge took control of the pension fund of the union, which owned Konocti Harbor, over allegations of financial improprieties involving the resort; in 2004, the U.S. Department of Labor again sued the union, alleging that $36 million of pension funds had been improperly diverted to the resort.. Mazzola died in 1989, in a car crash near the resort, but the Mazzola family continues to own much of the land surrounding the resort. =Renovation= In 1990, Greg Bennett was hired as the general manager of Konocti Harbor. He renovated the resort and turned it into a concert venue. Bennett eventually expanded his concert hall, the Joe Mazzola Showroom, from 350 seats to 1000; Performance Magazine called it \\"the best small concert venue in the country\\".. As the resort's concert business expanded, Bennett also added outdoor concerts in a 5000-seat converted softball field.... =Closure= In 2007, The US Department of Labor's 2004 suit against the owners of Konocti Harbor Resort & Spa was settled. During the suit, a sale of Konocti to Page Mill Properties of Palo Alto was under way. Within that settlement Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao went on to state \\"Workers‚Äô retirement dreams, health and other benefits were jeopardized by the gross mismanagement of their benefit plans,\\" and \\"This legal action puts the benefit plans under new, independent management and restores at least $3.5 million to the pension plan.\\" Chao's Friday statement alleged that the suit's defendants ‚Äúmaintained inadequate financial controls, violated plan documents, engaged in self-dealing, and imprudently spent millions to build and maintain facilities at Konocti despite the resort‚Äôs continuing financial losses.. The settlement appointed independent fiduciaries to manage the pension funds, replaces all but two trustees ‚Äì Mazzola Jr. and Buckley Jr., who were required to attend training on ERISA fiduciary responsibilities ‚Äì and permanently barred the replaced trustees and the former plan administrator from serving as fiduciaries or service providers for pension plans. The court also appointed WhiteStar Advisors LLC as a second fiduciary to oversee the management and operation of Konocti Harbor, as well as the pending sale to Page Mill Properties (which later fell through). After multiple failed attempts to sell the property,. Larry Mazzola attempted to gain approval to convert Konocti into a gaming casino, but Lake County supervisors denied the request.. In late 2009 WhiteStar Advisors, the management company that had been hired by the court, announced that Konocti Harbor would be shut down \\"temporarily but indefinitely\\"... The closure seriously damaged the local tourist economy, already hard-hit by the global economic downturn.. =Possible Sale and Reopening= On September 5, 2013 it was reported by a local newspaper that a sale of Konocti Harbor Resort and Spa was in the works by Resort Equities.http://www.record-bee.com/news/ci_24020609/breaking-news-konocti- comeback-sales-agreement-is-signed The company plans to reopen the resort and make significant upgrades, including a \\"small waterside bar and grill at the northern terminus of the promenade, improving the functionality of the clubhouse with a port cochere and arrival court as well as creating new indoor/outdoor public spaces at the lakeside, expanding the number of concert parking spaces located onsite, and concentrating them in closer proximity to the amphitheater, relocating the boat yard building for repair and storage of watercraft away from the shoreline to a less strategic location on the property, improving the amphitheater facility with structural repairs where needed, new concession stands and landscaping, bringing the existing resort buildings into compliance with current ADA, life safety, seismic resistance and energy conservation codes, upgrading the landscaping, fountains, entrance gates and other site improvements (driveways, sidewalks, curbs, retaining walls, lighting and signage) to contemporary standards and creating a small vineyard and wine tasting pavilion on the site of an existing parking lot.\\" In May 2014 it was announced that the group which was attempting to purchase the resort had failed to obtain the necessary financing.http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=37017:breaking- konocti-harbor-sales-contract-terminated-buyers-couldnt-assemble- financing&catid;=1:latest&Itemid;=197 Konocti Harbor Resort sold on Wednesday March 21, 2018 to an undisclosed buyer.

The language of the Gurindji is highly endangered, with about 592 speakers remaining and only 175 of those speakers fully understanding the language. There are in addition about 60 speakers of Ngarinyman dialect. Gurindji Kriol is a mixed language that derives from the Gurindji language. Patrick McConvell writes: \\"Traditional Gurindji today is only generally spoken in private contexts between older people, although it is occasionally used in speeches and newly composed songs\\" Patrick McConvell also states: \\"Gurindji has been taught intermittently for short periods as a subject in the local school over the last twenty-five years but mostly has had no role in the curriculum or in official community functions\\" The Gurindji language has borrowed many words from surrounding languages such as Gajirrabeng, Ngaliwurru, Jaminjung, Jaru, Miriwung, and Wardaman.  Classification  The Gurindji language is classified under the Pama-Nyungan languages family - as opposed to the Non-Pama-Nyungan languages family, as Indigenous Australia was largely divided into these two classifications. Gurindji is further classified as a member of the Ngumpin- Yapa sub-group of Pama-Nyungan. \\"Gurindji is part of the Eastern Ngumpin branch of the Nyungan-Yapa sub-group. The Eastern Ngumpin languages are among the most northernly Pama-Nyungan languages, in contact with the Non-Pama- Nyungan languages to the north, west, and east\\" The last division of the Eastern Ngumpin branch in which Gurindji is a part of is the Victoria River branch.  Geographic distribution  Gurindji is spoken by approximately 592 people, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 Census, in Northern Territory, Australia. More specifically, in the Victoria River District where, \\"Wattie Creek or Dagaragu was chosen as the destination of the walk-off. Later, Kalkaringi was set up about eight kilometers away on the Victoria River as a town to service the nearby stations. Many Gurindji moved to Kalkaringi and now both Kalkaringi and Dagaragu are home to the Gurindji. Kalkaringi contains most of the facilities such as the Community Office, school, abattoir, garage, and shops. The CDEP office, a bakery, and Batchelor Institute facilities can be found at Dagaragu\\" = Varieties = Gurindji is part of a dialect chain going west, and includes: * Wanjdjirra * Malngin * Wurlayi * Ngarinman * Bilinarra * Kartangarurru = Derived languages = The child language of Gurindji is the mixed language Gurindji Kriol. The switching of languages was noticed by Patrick McConvell between the 1960s and 1980s, and is thought to have emerged from the establishment of the cattle stations by the non-Indigenous colonists. Gurindji Kriol is spoken by Gurindji people below the age of 35, as they understand Gurindji but do not speak it in its traditional form.  Phonology  According to the University of Melbourne School of Languages and Linguistics, \\"Phonologically, Gurindji is a fairly typical Pama-Nyungan language. It contains stops and nasals which have five corresponding places of articulation (bilabial, apico-alveolar, retroflex, palatal and velar), three laterals (apico-alveolar, retroflex, palatal), two rhotics (trill/flap and retroflex continuant), two semivowels (bilabial and palatal) and three vowels (a, i, u). Combinations of semivowels and vowels produce diphthong-like sounds. Like most Pama-Nyungan languages, Gurindji is notable because it contains no fricatives or a voicing contrast between stops. Stress is word initial, and syllables pattern CV, CVC or CVCC.\\"  Grammar  According to the University of Melbourne School of Languages and Linguistics, \\"Gurindji is a dependent marking language. Word order is relatively free, though constrained by discourse functions. The verb phrase is made up of a free coverb and an inflecting verb which contains information about tense, mood, modality. Bound pronouns also attach to the inflecting verb to cross reference subjects and objects for person and number. These pronouns inflect for nominative and accusative case, unlike free pronouns whose form only changes for dative case. The noun phrase may contain nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and free pronouns. Case marking for nouns is ergatively patterned, and generally other elements in the noun phrase must agree with noun's case.\\" = Morphology = Felicity Meakins states, \\"Gurindji is an agglutinating language which employs only suffixes and enclitics.\\" She also found the list of suffixes and case suffixes in the Gurindji language: * Ergative * Dative * Locative * Allative * Ablative = Syntax = Felicity Meakins found Gurindji exhibits all of the properties of non- configurationality. Word order is relatively free, as the ordering of constituents is flexible. For example, the Gurindji word \\"rock\\" can appear pre-verbally in clause-initial position (1) and in clause-final position (2): (1) : He throws the rock into the water. (2) : He throws the rock into the water. Felicity Meakins also determined word order is largely determined by information structure rather than phrasal structure. The left periphery of the clause is generally associated with prominent information. The second position pronominal clitic provides a transition between more and less prominent information.  Lexicon  There are many words and expressions in the Gurindji language that have a complex meaning and usage that cannot be replicated in English. An example found in National Indigenous Languages Survey Report is the Gurindji word for 'law' (yumi) \\"encompasses not just what we might call civil and criminal 'law' but the ways of behavior and social control with regard to kin and the land that was bestowed by the ancestors and Dreamings\\" Another difference in Gurindji and English vocabularies is the words used to indicate left and right. As Felicity Meakins discovered, \\"Gurindji doesn't have terms for left and right, but has 24 different words each for north, south, east and west\\" Lastly, kinship systems, or the varying words to describe familial relationships are much different than in English. There are many more words than simply 'father', 'brother' and 'sister' as Gurindji people have many fathers, brothers and sisters. This is due to the fact that anyone who is in a person's life for a long time is included in the kinship system.

Captain Jack was capable of receiving a pardon, but he did not receive a commission to attack the Spanish fleet. Calico settled in New Providence, where he met Anne Bonny, but when his money was gone he returned to his life of crime. On August 22, 1719, Jack and eight men others captured William in Nassau harbor. Governor of Jamaica, Nicholas Lawes, directed Captain Jonathan Barnet to take two privateer sloops on a mission to hunt him down. One, Snow-Tyger, was heavily armed with several guns and carried about twenty Royal Navy sailors and some British Army troops; the other was Mary Anne (under former pirate Jean Bonadvis) which carried about twenty men. Bonadvis was the first to spot Rackham, who fired on him; Bonadvis then retreated to report Rackham's position to Barnet, but did not further participate in the battle. The encounter is remembered more for its participants than the actual combat. Capture It was around 10:00 at night on October 20, 1720 when Snow-Tyger discovered William at anchor in Dry Harbor Bay near the shore. Williams crew was mostly drunk and sleeping, including Captain Rackham. Bonadvis approached William but fell back after Rackham fired a cannon at him. Barnet then ordered his men to extinguish all lights and to silently approach the resting pirates. Once his sloop was near William, Barnet ordered the pirates to surrender. Captain Rackham awoke and the pirates on deck answered with a few shots from their swivel gun. Captain Barnet then ordered his ship to return a broadside and to close in and board the enemy. The pirates immediately set sail, trying to flee, but most of the crew retreated into the cabins. William made it only a few yards before Snow-Tyger caught up with her and continued the boarding. Mary Read, Anne Bonny and another pirate remained on deck and attempted to fight off the attackers, but eventually surrendered. Angered by the cowardice displayed by her shipmates, Read killed one of her fellow pirates after witnessing the retreat into the cabin, which ultimately lost the battle. The boarding party stormed the cabins and the remaining pirates were captured along with the drunk Calico. A few British fighting men were wounded but none were killed in the quick action. Snow-Tyger sustained light damage to her sails and rigging and William suffered heavy damage to her poop. Aftermath Calico Jack and his crew were taken to Port Royal, where Jack and eleven others were tried on November 16 and hanged on November 19 and 20, 1720. Calico was disemboweled and his body placed in a cage and gibbeted on the small Deadman's Cay at the entrance of Port Royal. The remains of the other pirates were placed at various locations around the port. Mary Read and Anne Bonny avoided hanging by claiming that they were pregnant, Read died several months later before her scheduled execution, while Bonny was never heard from again. Some accounts say Bonny retired and settled in North America and others say she returned to piracy. Bonny spoke of Calico and reportedly said that \\"if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog\\", a now famous saying.

Q. Khan Research Laboratories (KRL). Trained as an applied mathematician, his contributions include differential geometry, numerical analysis, information security, CFD-DEM model, hydrodynamics (of explosions), computer science, fluid mechanics, Vacuum Technology and CFD-DEM. Tasneem Mohammad Shah was a pioneer and senior member of the Kahuta Project, and, along with Dr. G.D. Alam and Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, Dr. Tasneem Mohammad Shah have had worked out in the nuclear physics involved in gas centrifuge and the uranium based-device. As of today, he is a full professor and chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the Air University. Biography Shah was born in Pakistan and had moved to Islamabad for his studies. He attended the jubilant and newly founded university, the Quaid-i-Azam University where he received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from there. He did his MSc, M. Phil. from Quaid-I-Azam University, followed by his DPhil in mathematics from University of Oxford, United Kingdom. His doctoral thesis were written on \\"Analysis of Multi-Grid Methods, design, theory and development of Algo.\\". M. Shah came back to Pakistan, after the 1971 Winter War where he joined his alma mater, Quaid-i-Azam University. His early research were mainly focused and emphasised on Fluid and Aerodynamics. In 1972, M. Shah was introduced by Asghar Qadir to Dr. Abdus Salam, where Professor Salam had delegated M. Shah to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission where he had closely collaborated with Dr. Riazuddin and Dr. Asghar Qadir in the development of the nuclear device. At the end of 1975, Dr. A. Qadeer Khan had brought the drawings of the Zippe-type centrifuges, which according to Dr. Ghulam Dastagir Alam, were incomplete and the drawings of the centrifuge machine were incorrect. Dr. Anwar Ali then contacted Hafeez Qureshi to re-design and work out the solution of the Centrifuge machine. Hafeez Qureshi informed Munir Ahmad Khan (who later consulted with Dr. Abdus Salam) about the problem faced by the KRL scientists. Tasneem Mohammad Shah who specialised in Fluid dynamics from Oxford, was named by Dr. Abdus Salam for the gas-centrifuge project when Munir Ahmad Khan and Hafeez Qureshi consulted with him. In 1975, Anwar Ali and Dr. G.D. Alam had met with Tasneem Shah in Islamabad, and Shah, with the full backing of Abdus Salam, was accompanied by Dr. G. D. Alam to a secret project in Kahuta in 1975. The following years, M. Shah had joined Abdul Qadeer Khan's then-known as Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL) from its beginning years. Trained as an applied mathematician, Shah was an instrumental carrying out the experimental and theoretical research at KRL. He was the founder and had served as the first director of the Computational Fluid Dynamics Division at the KRL. In particular, he had developed the expertise techniques in fluid explosions‚Äîphenomena which are difficult to model mathematically. M. Shah, a pioneer in fluid dynamics, had used complex integrations, and mathematical methods to developed the sustainable method for the gas-centrifuges which he published his work at the KRL. He gained fame in the research laboratory when Dr. M. Shah had mathematically modelled the fluid system in a Zippe-type centrifuge, and have had improved the technology that was brought by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan in the mid 1970s. His developed theories and the experimental research led to an improvement in the devices, and KRL had developed the advanced and newer versions of the Zippe-type technology as P-1 and P-2. M. Shah's principal contribution to the gas-centrifuge program was the rotational dynamics of the 235U by using the complex and difficult applications of Washer and Shell integrations. Dr. T. M. Shah was one of the key scientist who had helped developing the Inertial and Thermal system of the Ghauri missile system series. He had laid down the ground work of the Liquid-propellant rocketry system and formulated the various mathematical theories of the rocket science. On 28 May 1998, with numerous other KRL and PAEC weapon scientists, M. Shah was an eyewitness to the first atomic weapons testing, at Ras Koh Hills near at Chagai Hills. He, along with other scientists, was conferred with high civilian awards in 1998, and in 1999. After serving in KRL for more than 27 years, M. Shah had begun providing training and teaching at the KRL to the field of Fluid dynamics. He established the Department of Cryptology at NUST whereas he served as its first director. He also established the first IT University in private corporate sector and become the first Rector of KASBIT, Karachi. He remained Dean, Faculty of Computer Sciences at Bahria University and established an Integrated Scientific and Industrial Software house for contract research (ISIS). He is the author of 14 Research papers. He is also working for establishment of an HEC project, \\"National Institute of Vacuum Science and technology\\".

A self-educated immigrant from England, Shields was the longtime pastor of the Jarvis Street Baptist Church in Toronto. The Baptist denomination in Canada bore the brunt of that controversy and was centered at Jarvis St. Shields stood 6'6 in height. Background Thomas Todhunter Shields was the son of Thomas Todhunter Shields, Sr., an Anglican minister and Maria Davis (m. 1865 in Swansea, Glamorganshire, Wales). In 1881 his family was living in Blaenavon, near Pontypool, Wales his father being then a Primitive Methodist minister. The family emigrated to Canada around the year 1885 his father continuing to serve in the ministry in the Baptist denomination. Thomas Todhunter Shields married Elizabeth A. Kitchen on December 6, 1899 in Delhi, Norfolk, Ontario (already then a minister). Education Young Tod, as his father affectionately called him, never received a formal education beyond high school. Early in his ministry Shields proudly related that, as his pastor and theological professor, his father taught him \\"nearly all I have learned.\\" Pastorates T. T. Shields' delivered his first sermon in 1894 in Tiverton, Ontario and obtained his first pastorate in Florence, (Lambton) Ontario beginning in 1894. He had pastorates also in Dutton (Elgin) 1895, Delhi (Norfolk) 1897, and Hamilton (Wentworth Street Baptist Church) beginning in November, 1900. He moved to Adelaide Street Baptist Church in London in 1905, where he remained until 1910. Beginning in 1910 until his death in 1955 he served at Jarvis Street Baptist Church. Accomplishments In a sense, Shields took up the mantle of orthodoxy that had been laid down by Elmore Harris in the Baptist denomination of the time. In a bit of irony, Shields (not knowing the full picture) was used by the Convention in 1910 to put forth a motion to quell the inquiry surrounding the professorship of Isaac George Matthews at McMaster University that Elmore Harris had begun. In 1917 T.T. Shields began a paper called The Searchlight which in 1927 was called ‚ÄúThe Fundamentalist‚Äù. In the same year Shields was also granted an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Temple University. In May 1918 Shields was given an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree at McMaster. In 1919, when an anonymous editorial in the Canadian Baptist attacked the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy, Shields presented a strong condemnatory resolution to the annual convention. Shields's strong motion passed. In 1920 T. T. Shields was elected to the Board of Governors at McMaster University. Shields and others were highly concerned that McMaster had conferred an honorary doctorate upon William H. P. Faunce (president of Brown University). Shortly after, Shields took action against McMaster University in Toronto for harboring the liberal theology professor Laurance Henry Marshall (from England) beginning in 1925 (served from 1925-1930) a self-confessed ‚Äúliberal evangelical‚Äù who was appointed Professor of Practical Theology at McMaster. In the spring of 1926 Shields established Toronto Baptist Seminary and was censured by the Baptists convention of Ontario and Qu√©bec in 1926, and was expelled in 1927. He took with him 70 churches (representing about one seventh of the Convention) and one college, and formed the Union of Regular Baptist Churches of Ontario and Quebec. It became affiliated with the Baptist Bible Union, based in the United States. His newspaper, The Gospel Witness, begun in 1922, reached 30,000 subscribers in 16 countries, giving him an international reputation. He was one of the founders of the International Council of Christian Churches. Shields championed British imperialism against liberal Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Shields was also the longtime editor of the Gospel Witness. In 1930 he began evening church service broadcasts over the radio. At one point a radio station was purchased and given the call letters CJBC (Jarvis Street Baptist Church.) In difficult financial times this had to be sold, but the station still broadcasts as a CBC station. Pastor Shields introduced many innovations. Of particular note was his move of the Sunday school to Sunday morning, something which had not yet been tried in Canada. Traditionally the Sunday School had been held in the afternoon. His efforts were eminently successful and hereafter a huge Sunday morning crowd of children and adults gathered for Biblical instruction. * T. T. Shields declared, ‚ÄúModernism is not Christianity diluted; it is Christianity denied. It is not a modification of the New Testament religion; it is absolutely anti-Christian from top to bottom!‚Äù * ‚ÄúAlthough fifty years have gone by since Shields‚Äôs death, evangelical Baptists in Canada, whether they know it or not, are still being shaped by his life and ministry.‚Äù Beliefs Shields was a Calvinist and was unusual among fundamentalists in being an amillennialist. He despised dispensational premillennialism. References * C.

They come in a procession that comprises a leading Guardian figure, followed by a Caregiver and an Entertainer. Figures of Dragons and Phoenixes are also common as symbols of freedom and regeneration. In Korean mythology, the dead was believed to be in angst and confusion. To ease the experience of the afterlife, a procession of helpful figures would accompany them to guide and protect them, care for them, and entertain them. These figures were symbolised by lavishly decorated wooden servant statuettes that ornated the funeral bier, and were commonplace during the Joseon Dynasty, including for commoners. The practice came in favour in the 4th century CE and endured until the early 20th century. The Guardian serves the dead by guiding him in the afterlife, and by driving away evil spirits. Traditionally mounted, fierce- looking and armed with swords or poled weapons, he later took the form of an army officer or policeman in Western-inspired attire, with a sabre. The Caregiver serves the dead as if he was still alive, providing medical and prophylactic care. This figure is often a woman, or sometimes a couple. He comes immediately behind the Guardian in the procession. The Entertainer fulfills a comforting role for both the spirit of the deceased and for the living who mourn them.

The boundaries of the area are marked by the following streets: Calzada de Nonoalco or Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n Street to the south, Circuito Interior Paseo de las Jacarandas to the north, Avenida Insurgentes Norte to the east and Circuito Interior Instituto Polit√©cnico Industrial to the west. The neighborhood is considered lower class and working class. The name is derived from a Nahuatl phrase meaning \\"where the water divides.\\" Description The colonia extends over about 144 hectares and 45 blocks with 78 inhabitants per hectare. There are just over 2000 housing units, but many of these are tenements, and illegally built shacks. The area has problems with crime, garbage, wide scale unemployment and broken family units. Many live in shacks made of cardboard and other found materials. A large number of these are concentrated in four areas, near the rail line between Mexico City and Cuernavaca. There is one primary school, Dr. H√©ctor P√©rez Mart√≠nez, meaning that many secondary and other school children must go to neighboring Colonia Guerrero and other places for their education. Atlampa ranks 15th in crime in the borough, and is located next to a number of other high-crime colonias such as Colonia Peralvillo, Tepito, Unidad Habitacional Nonoalco-Tlatelolco and Colonia Guerrero. The most serious crime problem is gangs of youths from 12 to 25, mostly involved in street drug sales and robbery of buses, pedestrians and businesses. One activity is the robbery of buses through the area by youth who use fake guns to threaten passengers. While this is a fairly common occurrence in the north of the city, one particular hotspot for this crime is the intersection of Eje 2 Norte Eulalia Guzman and Circuito Interior in this colonia. History In the pre-Hispanic period, the Azcapotzalco and Tlalnepantla Rivers forked. At the end of the 19th century, the area was empty potreros or long mesas that lead towards nearby mountains. The first houses were built there around 1880, constructed by a company called FF.CC. Central Mexicano. Railroad tracks eventually crisscrossed the area, which led to a number of large factories nearby. The foundation of the area as a colonia is around 1930. Some of these railroad tracks, such as those that connect Mexico City to Cuernavaca, still exist. Between 2005 and 2008, the Tren Suburbano, which connects downtown Mexico City with northern suburbs was built through the colonia. During construction of the tracks, local businesses lost foot traffic and business, many permanently. Construction of the train tracks have included metal walls to prevent pedestrian and other access to the tracks. This had forced many in the neighborhood to have longer local travel times, especially as there are complaints about the safety of the pedestrian bridges. The train tracks pass by on Eje 2 Manuel Gonz√°lez, dividing the colonia into two sections. This has made direct access to many places on the other side impossible. Pedestrian bridges tend to be high, and are accessible only to those who can climb the stairs.

It can be translated as \\"the large conch shell.\\" Information The use of the adjective \\"large\\" in this context is used by the church to convey the significance of the duty bestowed upon church members who attend the Davuilevu institutions, which surpasses even its physical size. It is the premier institution of the Methodist Church in Fiji and Rotuma. Indigenous Fijians use the giant conch shell (Charonia tritonis) as a horn to herald important events such as the birth and death of a high ranking chief. Davuilevu is located at Nausori, Fiji. It was the home station of Reverend Thomas Baker who was martyred and killed in 1867 by cannibals at Nubutautau in the upper reaches of the Navosa Hills. His famous words still ring true to those who enter Davuilevu. When warned of a possible plot against his missionary party, he replied in Fijian that \\"Sa yawa vei au ko Davuilevu, ka sa voleka vei au ko lomalagi,\\" meaning, \\"Davuilevu is yet far, heaven for me is closer.\\" The Methodist Church moved its Theological College for Ministers and Bible School for Catechists from Navuloa to Davuilevu in 1907. Fiji's first technical and engineering school was also established here. Later the colonial government asked the assistance of the Methodist Church to help set up the government technical school. This was named the Derrick Technical Institute, after the founder and Principal of the Davuilevu Technical School, R.A. Derrick, and who was asked to set up the government technical school at Samabula, Suva. The Derrick Technical Institute was later renamed the Fiji Institute of Technology.

The engine was designed by NASA as part of the low cost X-34 Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) and as part of the Low Cost Booster Technology (LCBT, aka Bantam) project. This engine was later known as the MC-1 engine when it was merged into the X-34 project. Design The turbopump engine was designed to be used in an expendable booster in the LCBT project. As a result this led to the use of composite materials because of their significantly lower costs and production speed; this also reduced engine complexity since the fuel was not used for nozzle cooling. Based on knowledge and experience from the Space Shuttle's Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) and the Solid Propulsion Integrity Program (SPIP), a Silica/phenolic material was chosen for the ablative liner with carbon/epoxy structural overlap. The engine fuel was a mixture of liquid oxygen and kerosene (RP-1). These propellants are used by Saturn F1 rocket engine. Kerosene does not have the same energy release as hydrogen, used with the Space Shuttle, but it is cheaper and easier to handle and store. Propellants were fed via a single shaft, dual impeller LOX/RP-1 turbo-pump. The engine was started with a hypergolic igniter to maintain a simple design. Kerosene was injected and the engine was then running. The propellants were then fed into the gas generator for mixing and thrust chamber for burning. The engine uses a gas generator cycle to drive the turbo-pump turbine, which then exhausts this small amount of spent fuel. This is the identical cycle used with the Saturn rockets, but much less complex than the Space Shuttle engine system. The engine used an inexpensive, expendable, ablatively cooled carbon fiber composite nozzle and produced 60,000 lbf (285 kN) of thrust. After use nearly all of the engine's parts are reusable. During the research phase in 1999 each Fastrac engine was costed at approximately $1.2 million.{cite web  url=http://www.astronautix.com/f/fastrac.html  accessdate=September 6, 2019  title= Fastrac}} Production costs were expected to drop to $350,000 per engine.  History  Engine system level testing started in 1999 at the Stennis Space Center. Earlier tests were on individual components at the Marshall Space Flight Center. NASA started full-engine, hot-fire testing in March, 1999, with a 20 second test to demonstrate the complete engine system. The engine was tested at full power for 155 seconds on July 1, 1999. A total of 85 tests were scheduled for the rest of 1999. As of 2000, 48 tests had been conducted on three engines using three test stands. The first engine was installed on the X-34 A1 vehicle that was unveiled at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center on April 30, 1999. The Fastrac program was cancelled in 2001. After FASTRAC, NASA tried to salvage this design for use in other rockets such as Rotary Rocket's Roton and Orbital's X-34 project. The designation of the rocket engine was changed from the Fastrac 60K to Marshall Centre - 1 (MC-1). The MC-1 project was closed by July, 2009, after the X-34 project was terminated in March, 2009. The engine never flew, but with NASA's cooperation much of the MC-1 design and technology was adopted by SpaceX for its Merlin 1A engine. Components NASA collaborated with industry partners to meet the principle objective to use commercial, off-the-shelf components. Industry partners included Summa Technology Inc., Allied Signal Inc., Marotta Scientific Controls Inc., Barber-Nichols Inc., and Thiokol Propulsion.  Legacy  The basic principles of the Fastrac design (namely, a pintle injector and ablatively cooled chamber) lived on in SpaceX's Merlin 1A engine, which used a turbopump from the same subcontractor. The Merlin-1A was somewhat larger with a thrust of versus for Fastrac. The same basic design was capable of much higher thrust levels after upgrading the turbopump. Variants of the Merlin-1D achieve of thrust as of May, 2018, though the combustion chamber is now regeneratively cooled.

LLNL RISE is a modified in situ extraction technology originally proposed by Rio Blanco Oil Shale Co. and developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It is classified as an internal combustion technology. The process was described in 1975 by Lewis A. E. and A. J. Rothman. In the LLNL RISE process a part of the oil shale deposit (roughly 20% of the total deposit) is removed by the conventional mining technique. The remaining deposit is then broken up with explosives to increase porosity of the deposit. As a result, a large underground retort chamber by square and high is created. The retort chamber is ignited at the top. The combustion zone moves downward as an oxygen gas provided, similar to the process developed by the Occidental Petroleum. The heat causes retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. Some oil is collected at the bottom of the retort, other collected at the surface as vapors. The process was never used commercially. It was tested by using experimental simulated retort with capacity of 6 tonnes of oil shale per day.

Despite the importance of archaeological objects, the museum is not an independent institution and is operated by the Regional Directorate of Durr√´s Monuments.

The highest league these teams can currently enter is the 2. divisjon, set at the third tier of the league system. The reserve teams are attached to their first teams with a \\"2\\" suffix and must play in a lower league than the first team. Furthermore, if a club's first team plays in the 1. divisjon, the reserves team cannot play in the 2. divisjon either. If a reserve team ends up at a promotion spot when it is not allowed to be promoted, the promotion is awarded to best following team in the league standings which is allowed to be promoted. Also, a reserve team is forcefully relegated, regardless of the final league position, if it is no longer qualified for playing at that level - i.e. if the first team is relegated to a league level where the reserve team's level is no longer allowed. For example, if an Eliteserien team is relegated while its reserve team in 2. divisjon ends up at a secure place (or even a promotion spot), the reserve team is forcefully relegated to 3. divisjon. In such a situation, the best placed qualified team at a relegation position in the league that the reserve team is relegated from will keep its place. If there are no qualified teams at relegation positions (e.g. only reserve teams no longer qualified for the level), one extra team from the division below (the best placed qualified one) is promoted. Controversy Reserve teams have in general been criticized for fielding uneven teams from week to week, with many first-team players one week and more youth players the next. They have also been criticized for keeping smaller clubs out of the Second Division, meaning a more centralized football culture. In 2009 manager Ivar Morten Normark proposed to throw the reserve teams out of the ordinary league pyramid, and other managers like Dag Eilev Fagermo agreed. In a survey, 19 of 31 responding Second Division clubs wanted the reserve teams out, as did 30 of the 49 responding Third Division clubs. At the 2010 congress of the Football Association of Norway, new rules were agreed to. From 2010, reserve teams in the Second Division can only field three players over the age of 21 at any time. More \\"overage\\" players can sit on the bench, but cannot enter the field unless substituted with another overage player. Sporting success From time to time, a reserves team wins its group in the third tier 2. divisjon. This is the highest sporting position a reserves team can achieve, since promotion is impossible. In the 1991 2. divisjon, Brann's reserve team won group 4‚Äîahead of Fyllingen's reserve team. Also in the 1991 2. divisjon, Rosenborg's reserve team won group 5. Rosenborg 2 won again in the 1996 2. divisjon, and the same team won group 7 in the 1998 2. divisjon. In the 1992 2. divisjon, Lillestr√∏m's reserve team won group 1.

At the same time Dunn occasionally intersperses quaint, almost chamberal touches which evoke more traditionally classical sources.Mark Lesseraux, DOA Review of Young Person's Guide DOA Review by Mark Lesseraux Background & Musical History First realized in Calgary, Alberta, Dunn started composing and arranging his music for homemade films mostly on piano and cassette tapes (audio and video) in the late 1990s. His first love was filmmaking and it was film music that initially attracted him to composing his own works. He began performing and recording under the names 'Subtract by Two' and Kyle Bobby Dunn with the first self-released album, Music for Medication around 2002‚Äì2003. In interviews he has often mentioned large admiration for classical and soundtrack composers including Arvo P√§rt, Valentin Silvestrov, John Williams, Ennio Morricone and Jerry Fielding, yet his own music often exhibits a more quiet, minimalist, and droning nature that is often compared to ambient contemporary musicians William Basinski, Brian Eno and Stars of the Lid. Releasing what he has referred to as his 'first proper full length' album, Fragments & Compositions of Kyle Bobby Dunn, on Boston's Sedimental label in 2008. The album covered several years of his earliest compositional works, mainly for strings and piano. In early 2010, a long form album that filled a double compact disc set containing five years worth of his music, A Young Person's Guide to Kyle Bobby Dunn, arrived on the UK based label Low Point, and was praised in various music journalism and considered a 'deeply affecting' work by The New York Times. He released Ways of Meaning in 2011 on Buffalo, New York imprint, Desire Path Recordings, to unanimously positive reception. The Huffington Post's Daniel Kushner wrote, \\"Dunn presents the listener with sounds that seemingly, have no beginning, nor any end. There are not so much melodies, in the conventional sense ‚Äì but rather an economical assemblage of tones, which linger in the air like the quivering brush strokes in an Impressionist still life.\\" In 2012 he released another double disc set of long form works on the Low Point label. Bring Me the Head of Kyle Bobby Dunn was recorded at the artist's Bunce Cake studio and throughout remote locations in his native Canada. The recordings revealed a most personal and deeply emotional aspect of the composer's work and reached a high standard for electronically produced and arranged music ‚Äì only utilizing an electric guitar and loop pedal for the album's 15 songs. The disc received a largely positive response and was heralded by Resident Advisor as being among his finest work. In addition to the massive double disc release of 2012, a five song vinyl record was released later in the year on the Toronto label, Komino. It was considered as \\"a tightening of the composer's sound ‚Äì the signature elements are there; cyclical patterns, drifts of spidery drones, buried static, but though they somehow seem slower and more stately than before, they seem focused, resolute\\" and \\"in a quiet master class in poised composition; constantly in motion, and in perfect stillness\\" by John Boursnell at UK's Fluid Radio. In mid 2014 his released his largest full-length release album to date, 'Kyle Bobby Dunn & The Infinite Sadness.' The album is artist's largest and most emotionally complex release with many of the previous guitar laden sounds of previous releases stretched out to long crescendos and intricate melodic development. The release is available on the triple vinyl and double compact disc formats.  Controversies  On July 3 2019, Indianapolis, Indiana-based Past Inside the Present ended their working relationship with Dunn, stating \\"We have been made aware of disparaging and hateful comments by Kyle Dunn, an artist on PITP. We have spoken with him and every artist on our roster to clarify that we do not stand by this type of behavior. PITP will no longer be working with him.\\" Past Inside The Present(2019) July 5 2019 saw two labels sever relations with Dunn. The first being Cincinnati, Ohio-based label Whited Sepulchre Records, stating: \\"Over this last week we learned some truly disturbing truths regarding Kyle Bobby Dunn.

In its first year, the party made six unsuccessful attempts to register. As of mid-August 2010 the party was still not registered, and therefore was unable to submit a candidate for the August 2010 Presidential elections. In September 2018, Frank Habineza and one other member of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda were elected into Parliament. They are the first Opposition candidates to win seats in the Rwandan parliament since Kagame's Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) came to power after the 1994 genocide. Background Habineza was born in Mityana, Uganda in a Rwandese family on 22 February 1977. He attended the National University of Rwanda from 1999 to 2004, graduating in Political and Administrative Sciences with a major in Public Administration. While at University he started a student association campaigning for environment protection. In 2005, he became a personal assistant to the Minister of Lands, Environment, Water, Forestry and Mines. He was the official correspondent of Rwanda Newsline and UMUSESO while he was a student in Butare. He also worked for the former Rwanda Herald Newspaper, whose publisher Asuman Bisika was declared 'persona non grata' in mid-2002. Habineza was for three years (2006‚Äì2009), National Coordinator for the Nile Basin Discourse Forum in Rwanda (NBDF), a civil society platform that had over 50 NGOs involved in the conservation of river Nile. He resigned in May 2009. He was also President of the Rwanda NGOs Forum on Water, Sanitation and Environment-RWASEF and founder Chairman for the Rwandan Environment Conservation Organisation (RECOR). He resigned from all the NGOs when he joined active opposition politics. In June 2010 these two organizations distanced themselves from him after a report alleged that donor funds had been diverted for political purposes. The report, issued by the Ministry of Local Government, named Habineza as one of the people behind \\"briefcase\\" NGO's that fleece donors, and named five NGOs as vehicles used by him to obtain funding for political activities. Political career Habineza founded the Democratic Green Party (DGPR) in August 2009 as an alternative to the dominant Rwanda Patriotic Front. In April 2010 three leading members of the DGPR resigned due to disagreements over Habineza's activities. They said that the party was being manipulated by foreigners, and denied statements made by Habineza that Rwanda was helping the UK and the US plunder timber from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and that Rwanda had deployed troops in the DRC. In July 2010 the Vice-President of the DGPR, Andre Kagwa Rwisereka, was found dead near a wetland in Butare with his head cut off. He had been repeatedly stabbed. Habineza was among opposition leaders who called for an independent international investigation into the murder, which may have had a political motivation.

Sub-ecoregions include: Northern Post Oak Savanna 33a Southern Post Oak Savanna 33b San Antonio Prairie 33c Northern Prairie Outliers 33d Bastrop Lost Pines 33e Floodplains and Low Terraces 33f The East Central Texas forests (33) is a small temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion almost entirely within the state of Texas, United States. The northern forests perimeter is partially within the southeast Oklahoma border. Description East Central Texas forests are distinguished from the adjacent Texas blackland prairies and Western Gulf coastal grasslands by their greater tree density. On the other hand, they are more open and have a greater concentration of hardwoods than the forests of the Piney Woods. The climate is hot and humid. Subregions =Northern Post Oak Savanna= The landscapes of this ecoregion are generally more level and gently rolling compared to the more dissected and irregular topography of much of Southern Post Oak Savanna. It is underlain by mostly Eocene and Paleocene-age formations with some Cretaceous rocks to the north. The deciduous forest or woodland is composed mostly of post oak, blackjack oak, eastern redcedar, and black hickory. Prairie openings contained little bluestem and other grasses and forbs. The land cover currently has more improved pasture and less post oak woods and forest than the Southern Post Oak Savanna. Some coniferous trees occur, especially on the transitional boundary with the Tertiary Uplands ecoregion. Loblolly pine has been planted in several areas. Typical wildlife species include white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, northern bobwhite, eastern fox squirrel, and eastern gray squirrel. =Southern Post Oak Savanna= This ecoregion has more woods and forest than the adjacent prairie ecoregions, and consists of mostly hardwoods compared to the pines to the east in the South Central Plains. Historically a post oak savanna, current land cover is a mix of post oak woods, improved pasture, and rangeland, with some invasive mesquite to the south. A thick understory of yaupon and eastern redcedar occurs in some parts. The ecoregion is underlain by Miocene, Oligocene, Eocene, and Paleocene sediments. Sand exposures within these Tertiary deposits have a distinctive sandyland flora, and in a few areas unique bogs occur. The endangered Houston Toad is associated with the deep sandy soils of this ecoregion =San Antonio Prairie= This ecoregion is a narrow, 100-mile long region occurring primarily on the Eocene Cook Mountain Formation. Upland Alfisol prairies were dominated by little bluestem and yellow indiangrass and contained a different mix of grasses and forbs than the dark, clayey, more calcareous soils of the Northern Texas blackland prairies. Since the 1830s, settlement clustered along the Old San Antonio Road (Texas State Highway 21 in the south, Old San Antonio Road in the north) within this narrow belt of prairie land. Currently, land cover is a mosaic of woodland, improved pasture, rangeland, and some cropland. =Northern Prairie Outliers= The small, disjunct areas of this ecoregion have a blend of characteristics from the Texas blackland prairies and the East Central Texas forests. The northern two outliers, north of the Sulphur River, occur on Cretaceous sediments, while south of the river, Paleocene and Eocene formations predominate. A mosaic of forest and prairie occurred historically in this and adjacent regions. Burning was important in maintaining grassy openings, and woody invasions have taken place in the absence of fire. The tallgrass prairies included little bluestem, big bluestem, yellow indiangrass, and tall dropseed. Current land cover is mostly pasture, with some cropland. =Bastrop Lost Pines= The Houston Toad (Anaxyrus houstonensis) is an endangered species occurring in the East Central Texas forests. This ecoregion is an outlier of relict loblolly pine-post oak upland forest occurring on some dissected hills. It is the westernmost tract of southern pine in the United States. The pines mostly occur on gravelly soils that formed in Pleistocene high gravel, fluvial terrace deposits associated with the ancestral Colorado River, and sandy soils that formed in Eocene sandstones (such as the Weches Formation). The Lost Pines are about west of the Texas pine belt of the South Central Plains and occur in a drier environment with of average annual precipitation. In this area, the deep, acidic, sandy soils and the additional moisture provided by the Colorado River contribute to the occurrence of pines, which are thought to be a relict population predating the last glacial period. The largest population of the Houston Toad occurs in this ecoregion =Floodplains and Low Terraces= This ecoregion contains floodplain and low terrace deposits downstream from the Texas blackland prairies and upstream from the Texas coastal plains. It includes only the wider floodplains of major streams, such as the Sulphur, Trinity, Brazos, and Colorado rivers. In addition, it covers primarily Holocene deposits and not Pleistocene deposits on older, high terraces. The bottomland forests contain water oak, post oak, elms, green ash, pecan, willow oak to the east, and to the west some hackberry and eastern cottonwoods. The northern floodplains tend to have more forested land cover, while in the south the Brazos and Colorado River floodplains are characterized by more cropland and pasture. Fauna The forests are home to a rich wildlife including Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), North American least shrews (Cryptotis parva), North American beavers (Castor canadensis) and many species of butterflies and reptiles. Larger mammals that once lived here, including jaguar (Panthera onca) and Plains bison (Bison bison bison), have now disappeared from the region. Endangered fauna found in this ecoregion include the Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis) and Attwater's prairie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri). Conservation This environment has been heavily altered by cattle ranching and clearance for farmland with only a quarter of the original habitats remaining, in fragmented patches and not in large blocks. There are no national forests in the region.

Szuty graduated with a B.A. from the University of WA and a Master of Education from the former Canberra College of Advanced Education before working in Community Services in Canberra. In 1992 she stood for the ACT Legislative Assembly and was elected as the running mate of sitting independent Michael Moore on the Moore Independents Group ticket, but sat in the Assembly as an independent. She was unsuccessful in recontesting her seat at the 1995 election on Moore's ticket, and again on an attempt to regain her seat at the 1998 election as an unaligned independent. In 1998, ACT Minister for Urban Services, Brendan Smyth claimed that Szuty made inappropriate representations to him on behalf of a client of the real estate agency where Szuty had recently been employed. Szuty made representations that her client was facing severe hardship. As a result of Smyth's complaint, made in confidence, to the Real Estate Institute of the ACT, Szuty was dismissed by her employer. Szuty asked Smyth to withdraw his complaint; which he ignored. On the basis of the complaint, Szuty claimed that she had been allegedly defamed, and Smyth's actions adversely affected her employment and had ultimately forced her to leave the ACT. Szuty commenced defamation proceeding in the ACT Supreme Court. In a finding that was handed down in 2004, Chief Justice Higgins was scathing in his criticism of Smyth, but ruled that the defamatory remarks he had made about Szuty were protected by qualified privilege.

She was a daughter of George of Podƒõbrady, King of Bohemia, and his first wife Kunigunde of Sternberg. She was the twin sister of Catherine of Podƒõbrady, wife of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. Early life Sidonie and Catherine were born on 11 November 1449 to the Bohemian king. The girl's mother, Kunigunde, died from complications of the birth. Sidonie's father eventually remarried; his second wife, Johana of Ro≈æmit√°l, bore George more children, including Ludmila of Podƒõbrady. Sidonie had four older siblings, but none of her brothers inherited Bohemia from their father. The crown passed instead to Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary. Sidonie's paternal grandparents were V√≠tek of Podƒõbrady and his wife Anna of Vartenberk. Her maternal grandparents were Smil of Sternberg and his wife Barbara of Pardubice.  Marriage  A marriage contract was signed on 11 November 1459 for Sidonie's marriage to Albert, son of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony. The couple married on 11 May 1464. Sidonie followed her husband to Meissen, and the consummation of their marriage took place in May 1464 at Castle Tharandt. Four months after their marriage, Albert's father died, and he became Duke of Saxony with Sidonie as Duchess consort. Sidonie was a pious Catholic woman who abhorred violence. She therefore refused to accompany her husband during his wars in Groningen and Friesland. In protest, she took her children to Albrechtsburg. In 1495 she founded the religious festival of the Holy Lance, after being freed from a stone disease. Many of her letters of correspondence have been preserved, in which she pleads for the release of prisoners. On 12 September 1500, Albert died, leaving Sidonie a widow. She withdrew from the Saxon court and spent the rest of her years in Tharandt. On 1 February 1510 she died there. Sidonie was buried at the cathedral of Meissen.

Six months later, having stayed over in Thailand, they view a film at an orphanage fund-raiser made by Kimberly Park, just back from the Andaman Coast, of Moken and Salone natives in the South Tanintharyi division. A restricted area only accessible by boats through a triad of Thaksin Gao who has military ties that smuggles girls to bars in Myanmar. Jeanne sees a vague figure in the distance she believes to be Josh. Discouraged by Jeanne's lead, Paul gives in to contacting the triad's leader Thaksin Gao and hiring one of his boats for an exorbitant 'one-time' fee. At first taken to a false decoy in the Mergui Archipelago where male orphans, the females not present, cast balloons at night to ward of the vinyan spirits, the French couple is further misled, as indicated by pointing on a map, to an uninhabited island south of Macleod Island (west of Zadetkale Island) where, their resources depleted, find themselves equally lost in a region of lost male orphans.

Career  Robertson initially played football for Polton Vale, a local club based in Loanhead. He soon attracted wider interest and played in one match for Football League First Division side Burnley in April 1895. He played his only senior match for the club on 9 November 1895 in the 1‚Äì5 defeat away at Derby County and was released by Burnley shortly afterwards. Peter also turned out around then for the well known St Bernard's club in Edinburgh. Peter though remained with Polton Vale before joining Cowdenbeath in summer 1898. Most of his family all moved through to Fife as well. That was a top quality Cowdenbeath side. He played in a Cowdenbeath team which won 4 trophies in 1899. He was a highly regarded left half or centre half. He then joined Cowdenbeath's local rivals Raith Rovers and spent 2 years at Kirkcaldy. In 1901, he joined city club Dundee and it was there that he enjoyed the peak of his career playing at the top level of Scottish professional football. He became club captain and achieved the great honour of being selected to represent Scotland v Ireland at Celtic Park, Glasgow on 21 March 1903. Scotland lost 2‚Äì0. In December 1903 though, injury struck when Peter was playing for Dundee against Motherwell. He badly hurt his knee and this more or less finished his football career. Peter visited Matlock down in England for treatment but struggled to overcome his injury. He did make a brief comeback with Nottingham Forest in 1904, but his injury badly hampered him. Thus he gave up football. Personal life Robertson was the son of ironstone miner Sam Robertson and his wife Elizabeth Neilson. He was one of a number of siblings including his brother Sam who was born at Rosewell on 4 April 1878. After retiring as a professional footballer, he decided to emigrate to the United States and in July 1905 he set sail on the Furnessia. He went to live and work in Benld, Macoupin County, Illinois. Peter worked there as a miner for the Superior Coal Company of Sawyerville. Peter, who never married, died aged 53 on 4 February 1929 in St Francis Hospital, Litchfield, Illinois after a long illness. Sam Robertson, his brother, joined Cowdenbeath in 1900 and also did well. In 1901, he joined Raith Rovers and then in 1902 teamed up with Peter at Dundee. Sam then came back to play for Cowdenbeath in 1903 as a full back. He was Cowdenbeath's captain. In 1905, he went down to England and played for Nottingham Forest's local rivals Notts County for a short time. He went to Benld in 1908 and accompanying Sam and his brother Willie on the trip was another ex-Cowdenbeath player, Jim Paton (who had also played with Notts County). Peter Robertson at one time lived in the US with a John Hynd who had been a goalkeeper with Cowdenbeath and Newcastle United in England. Pete Nisbet another Cowdenbeath stalwart of that era also moved to the US and settled in Benld. Sam Robertson died in Staunton, Macoupin County, Illinois on 1 November 1952.

It was first named by Walter G. Joyce, Ariel Revan, Tyler R. Lyson and Igor G. Danilov in 2009, and the type species is Hutchemys rememdium. H. rememdium is known from the holotype YPM PU 16795, which consists of a nearly complete postcranial skeleton, and from the referred specimen YPM PU 16781, found in the Ekalaka Member of the Fort Union Formation, Montana. Another referred specimen, YPM PU 14985, was found in the Cedar Point Quarry, Wyoming. The second species, H. arctochelys, is known from the holotype YPM PU 16319, a nearly complete carapace, and from the paratypes YPM PU 16320, YPM PU 16321, YPM PU 16322, YPM PU 16238\\\\. All specimens of H. arctochelys were recovered from the same quarry of the Tongue River Member, Fort Union Formation, near Burns Mine of Montana.

Aspideretes? nassau (YPM PU 11566) from the Fort Union Formation, Duffy's Ranch of Sweet Grass County, Montana was also assigned to Hutchemys sp. The generic name honors John Howard Hutchison, a turtle paleontologist. Hutchison himself named later in 2009 two new genera of extinct softshell turtles from New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming and Utah: Plastomenoides (two new species: P. lamberti (type) and P. tetanetron) and Derrisemys (new species: D. sterea (type) and new combination D. acupictus [originally Plastomenus]). In 2011, Joyce and Lyson noted that P. lamberti and Hutchemys rememdium are based on the same type specimen (YPM PU 16795) and therefore P. lamberti and Plastomenoides are objective junior synonyms of H. rememdium and Hutchemys. P. tetanetron Hutchison, 2009 is also cogeneric with H. rememdium. They also found that D. sterea is the closest relative of P. tetanetron and therefore both D. sterea and D. acupictus were reassigned to Hutchemys.

Venezuela was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty for all crimes, doing so in 1863.Roger G. Hood. The death penalty: a worldwide perspective, Oxford University Press, 2002. p10 Public law The basis for its public law is the 1999 Constitution. The 1999 Constitution made significant changes to the separation of powers. Instead of the usual three branches of government, the new Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has five: # The executive branch (the Presidency). # The legislative branch (the National Assembly of Venezuela). # The judicial branch (the judiciary). # The electoral branch (poder electoral, or \\"electoral power\\"). # The citizens' branch (poder ciudadano, or \\"citizens' power\\"). The electoral branch is headed by the National Electoral Council (CNE) and is responsible for the independent oversight of all municipal, state, and federal elections in the country. The citizens' branch is constituted by the (defensor del pueblo) (ombudsman or \\"defender of the people\\"), the Chief Public Prosecutor (fiscal general), and the comptroller general (contralor general). It is responsible for representing and defending the citizens in their dealings with powers of the Venezuelan state. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, whose 32 justices (\\"magistrados\\") are elected by the National Assembly for a single 12-year term.Antonio Ramirez, May 2006, An Introduction to Venezuelan Governmental Institutions And Primary Legal Sources Criminal Law Until 1998 Venezuelan criminal law was governed by the C√≥digo de Enjuiciamiento Criminal of 1926. The 1926 procedures \\"followed many of the traditional rules of inquisitorial tradition\\",Alguindigue, Carmen; Perdomo, Rogelio Perez (2008), \\"Inquisitor Strikes Back: Obstacles to the Reform of Criminal Procedure\\", Southwestern Journal of International Law, Vol. 15, Issue 1 (2008), pp. 101-122 with the pretrial process substantially under the judge's control. At the initial sumario step a judge would direct the police investigation; and after apprehension by police, the judge had 72 hours to decide whether to keep suspects in detention. At the second plenario step the process became more adversarial and documents of process made available to the defendant, but the judge still had \\"wide discretion to pursue charges beyond those outlined in the accusation\\". The 1926 code was established by the dictator Juan Vicente G√≥mez, and represented a substantial change from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century procedures, where Venezuela had jury trials and oral procedures in some states. G√≥mez standardised legal procedures and suppressed juries. In July 1998 Venezuela's criminal law was radically reformed, with the replacement of the 1926 code with the C√≥digo Org√°nico Procesal Penal. The old secret sumario phase was abolished, and defendants had the immediate right to a lawyer on arrest or indictment. The indictment and police investigation process was now controlled by prosecutors rather than judges, and suspects had to be charged within 24 hours. For more serious crimes, jurors would be involved. Plea bargaining was accepted, and in some cases defendants could avoid punishment by making restitution to their victims. However, the radical package of reforms, partly inspired by Germany's \\"liberal code, low crime, and notably small incarcerated population\\" ignored the dominant Venezuelan culture \\"in which the only conceivable form of punishment is prison or corporal punishment\\". Within a year of the new criminal code, commissions had been formed to consider revising it. The first reform, in March 2000, among other changes reinstated the old 72-hour time limit for judicial decision on imprisonment. The reform was presented as \\"a necessary defense of society from criminality, implying that the new code was ill-adapted to Venezuelan society and overly lenient toward criminals.\\" Further changes in November 2001 made a substantial number of changes which \\"left very little of the original spirit of the 1998 code\\". Jury trials were abolished, and among changes prosecutors were given six months to proceed with trial or drop charges. In 1999 - 2001 a high proportion of jury trials had been postponed, as a range of problems with the new jury approach remained to be addressed. However other delays were more significant contributors to postponement. Whilst the number of criminal judges more than doubled from 1998 to 2004, the number of prosecutors did not substantially increase, despite the increased importance of this office in the legal system. The Venezuelan Fiscal General estimated 2900 cases per prosecutor in 2004, rising to 4000 in 2006.

A biography of the titular French diplomat Talleyrand (1754‚Äì1838), it stars Guitry in the lead role. Originally forbidden by the French censor and turned into a play, the film went on to be released into six languages. Film =Description= The film is a 125-minute, black-and-white biography of French priest and diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1754‚Äì1838), who served for 50 years under five different French regimes: the Absolute Monarchy, the Revolution, the Consulate, the Empire, and the Constitutional Monarchy. Its title comes from one of the main historical nicknames for Talleyrand, that he shares with demon king Asmodeus and English poet Lord Byron. The movie is often noted for its opening sequence: after showing the birthplace of Talleyrand as it became in then-contemporary 1948 Paris, it moves to a bookstore window showcasing his main biographies, including a copy of Guitry's own Le Diable boiteux that creates a mise en abyme. The film then sketches Talleyrand through a dozen episodes and anecdotes, both from his public life as a politician and his private side as a womanizer. Guitry explained that he peppered the dialogues with \\"a very great number\\"Primary sources: Guitry 1948, Le Diable boiteux. of quotes from most historical figures depicted. =Production= Under French law, a film has to be presented to the Censorship Board (') in order to obtain a French film-license (). During the French Fourth Republic (1946‚Äì1958), post-war regulations mandated that a movie script be submitted for approval even before filming. As explained by Guitry in 1948, his synopsis was originally rejected by the Board: they underlined various dialogues in the script as being liable to cause public outrage. Guitry scoffed that all of them were actual quotes he had lifted from Talleyrand, Napoleon, and other historical figures, but his film being in effect forbidden, he immediately adapted it into a play, Talleyrand (1948). He then leveraged the fact that his play had received success and caused no trouble to re-submit his script to the Board, who granted its license though \\"without any good grace\\". =Reception= Le Diable boiteux was originally released on 29 September 1948 in two theaters (the Marignan and the Marivaux) in Paris, France. It has since been released (dubbed or subtitled) into at least 5 other languages, being alphabetically: English (The Lame Devil), Finnish (Rampa paholainen), Greek (Pringips talleyrandos), Italian (Il diavolo zoppo), and Portuguese (Um Homem Diab√≥lico). Positive or negative, critics have often considered Guitry's movie to be as much a historical biography as a plea for himself or a self- defense.Secondary sources: Cited in Savia, Le Diable boiteux. Because Guitry didn't stop writing and playing during the Nazi occupation of France, he had been accused of collaboration with the enemy and imprisoned two months in 1944 by a self-appointed militia; released by the new government and fully discharged in 1947, he had expressed regret at the absence of a formal trial. Thus, rehabilitating the controversial Talleyrand (often considered a traitor for serving five different regimes) was seen as Guitry also trying to rehabilitate himself and strike back at those who had criticised him: on the movie's release, both a negative review by author (in L'Ordre, 1948) and a positive one by author Ren√© Barjavel (in France Hebdomadaire, 1948) commented on it from that standpoint. Various later reviews have discussed that aspect of the movie, from TV listings magazine T√©l√©rama (1978) to author in Cahiers du cin√©ma (1988), long after the events. According to French stage director and stage historian in his 800-page monography Sacha Guitry. Cent ans de th√©√¢tre et d'esprit (1985), translated: \\"The time has come to do justice to this excellent film (very coldly received, of course, by the politicized press of the time), almost always fascinating, that rehabilitates a historical figure too often maligned and brings us back the great Sacha Guitry at the top of his game as an actor and director, if not author.\\" Data =Credits= ;Main creditsTertiary sources: IMDB, The Lame Devil.Tertiary sources: DVDT, The Lame Devil. * Director: Sacha Guitry * Script, adaptation, dialogues: Sacha Guitry (after his play Talleyrand, 1948) * Cinematography : Nicolas Toporkoff * Music: Louis Beydts * Production manager: ;Other credits * Assistant directors: , Jeanne Eti√©vant * Editing: Jeannette Berton * Film sets: Ren√© Renoux * Cameraman: Marcel Franchi * Sound: * Production company: Union Cin√©matographique Lyonnaise (UCIL) * Distributor: Compagnie Parisienne de Location de Films (CPLF) and Gaumont =Cast= ;Main cast, in credits order * Sacha Guitry as Talleyrand * Lana Marconi as Madame Grand (Talleyrand's wife) * √âmile Drain as Napoleon I of France (and one lackey) * Henry Laverne (billed \\"Henry-Laverne\\") as Louis XVIII of France (and one lackey) * Maurice Teynac as Charles X of France (and one lackey) * Philippe Richard (billed \\"Philippe-Richard\\") as Louis Philippe I (and one lackey) * Georges Spanelly as Count of Montrond * Robert Dartois as Count of R√©musat * Ren√©e Devillers as Duchess of Dino * Georges Grey as General Caulaincourt * Jeanne Fusier-Gir as Marie-Th√©r√®se Champignon (the female conspirator) * Jos√© Noguero as Duke of San Carlos * Maurice Escande as Prince of Metternich * Jean Debucourt as Baron of Humboldt * Pierre Bertin as Baron Nesselrode (later Count) * as Lord Castelreagh * Andr√© Randall (billed \\"Randall\\") as Lord Grey * Howard Vernon as Lord Palmerston * Jacques Varennes as General Lafayette * Maurice Schutz as Voltaire * Jos√© Torres (billed \\"Jos√© Torr√®s\\") as Don Juan d'Azcona * Pauline Carton as the female chiromancer * Denis d'In√®s as Don Basilio (in The Barber of Seville) * Jean Piat as Figaro (in The Barber of Seville) * Andr√© Brunot as Dr. Bartolo (in The Barber of Seville) ;Uncredited cast, alphabetically * Ren√©e Bouzy as (unspecified) * Georges Br√©hat as (unspecified) * Jean-Claude Briet as a lackey * Anne Campion as Pauline de Dino (Talleyrand's great-niece) * Daniel Ceccaldi as (unspecified) * Jane Daury as a Spanish woman * Dominique Davray as (unspecified) * as a cop * Philippe Derevel as (unspecified) * Bernard Dh√©ran as Almaviva (in The Barber of Seville) * as Rosine * Robert Favart as abbot Dupanloup * Catherine Fonteney as Princess of Chalais * as the lady's companion * Robert Hossein as a guest dressed in white * Pierre Lecocq as Count Roederer * Michel Lemoine as Prince of Asturias (later Ferdinand VII of Spain) * Simone Logeart as (unspecified) * Sophie Mallet as the maid * Michel Nastorg as a lackey * Georges Rivi√®re as Marquis de la Tour de Bournac * Robert Seller as Prince of Polignac * L√©on Walther as Dr. Cruveilhier =Release= ;Release * Original title: Le Diable boiteux * Genre: historical film * Country of origin: France * Language: French * Released: 29 September 1948 (France), 1948 (World) ;Specifications * Runtime: 125 minutes * Photography: black-and-white * Film: 35 mm * Image ratio: 1.37:1 * Sound mix: mono References =Sources= ;Primary sources * Guitry, Sacha (1948).

The parish population taken at the 2011 census was 482. It is near the city of Carlisle. It has a church called St Peter's Church, and a primary school (St. Peters CofE School). The parish includes the villages/hamlets of Kirkbampton, Little Bampton, Oughterby, Studholme, Flatt and Ploughlands. The parish Church of Kirkbampton is dedicated to St Peter, and is an ancient Norman structure and a Grade I listed building, of typical Cumbrian character. The chancel arch and North doorway, both being original and in situ, are Saxon in style and fix the dimensions of the early Church. Over the North entrance door is a sculptured tympanum. Only five examples of these tympana exist is Cumbria, and the one at Kirkbampton, with its surrounding arch, is probably the most perfect, despite suffering from the weather. It is not now easy to decipher, but appears to be a figure and animals. A Roman stone found in the walls during restoration work in 1870-1871 is now built into the South wall of the chancel. It bears the inscription \\"VEX,LEG P.F. FEC.\\", and has probably been brought from the nearby Hadrian's Wall. Kirkbampton Village Hall The first village hall in Kirkbampton came about just after the First World War in 1920, when it was decided that a regular meeting place was required in the village. This was Laurel Cottage, and each day a fire was lit, and papers were delivered to the cottage. However, in 1930, it was decided that Laurel Cottage no longer met the needs of the village, and funds were raised to purchase an ex-army building, where the village hall routine continued. The use of this hall was continued throughout the 20th century, until in 1990, when a surveyor concluded that the village hall was dangerous and inadequate for its use. It was decided by a committee in the summer of 1996 that a new hall was to be built in Kirkbampton, significantly larger than the previous structure, and with increased parking space. This project was named 'Project 2000'. After many more meetings, and the circulation of a questionnaire, the new hall was to be built in the near future. Cumbria Building and Design were chosen for the project, and the land adjacent to the school was purchased from Mr J Graham. A national lottery grant was gratefully received, and work commenced. The development started on Monday 19 February and was completed on 4 October 2001. The hall is still in regular use in 2018 and can be hired for private functions.

Early life Born to Giovanni and Rosa (n√©e Volpino), he attended the Modena Military Academy and the Cavalry School in Pinerolo, then he was commissioned as a Sottotenente in the Genova Cavalleria Regiment and later promoted to Tenente in the Piemonte Cavalleria Regiment. After six years of service he asked for a discharge and, thanks to his connections to Colonnello Girolamo Emilio Gerini, a military advisor in Siam (now Thailand), he moved there and took up the organization of the local army and the education of one of the King's sons. He also worked as a war correspondent, sending reports from China and Ethiopia (some speculate he might have taken part in the battle of Adua). In 1895 he joined General Emilio Aguinaldo as a mercenary in his struggle for the independence of the Philippines from Spain. Participation in the Anglo-Boer War In 1899 he moved to South Africa and became a trusted friend of Boer General Louis Botha. Subsequently, Ricchiardi took command of the \\"Italian Volunteer Legion\\", a 200-men-strong outfit almost entirely composed by Italians, including immigrants in the Veld and ex-soldiers who had served in the Regio Esercito or under Giuseppe Garibaldi (oddly enough his son Ricciotti supported the Boers, while his grandson Peppino found himself on the British side). Under Ricchiardi's leadership this unit (also known as the \\"Latin Brigade\\" or the \\"Italian Legion\\") became distinguished for their close-knitness and skill in performing reconnaissance and other tasks required by asymmetric warfare. It was not only the bravery of the Italian Legion that made him famous, but also his charisma and chivalric attitude toward the enemy: for instance he used to send the personal belongings of British casualties to their families along with a letter of condolences. However, some of his men were full-blown rogues and at times Ricchiardi had to reinstate discipline with stern (but not bloody) measures. The first successful operation carried out by the Italian Legion was the capture of an armoured train near Chieveley, Natal. Among the passengers who were taken prisoners there was young journalist Winston Churchill, whose life Ricchiardi spared by pretending not to see him dumping his pistol and dum-dum ammo which had been declared unlawful on pain of death. Upon his return to England, Churchill did not mention having been captured by Italians. During his stay in South Africa, Ricchiardi married Hannah Guttman, Paul Kruger's granddaughter, who he had met in the Pretoria Military Hospital while recuperating from serious leg wounds he had suffered at the battle of Tugela. Upon his return to Italy he was busy organizing pro-Boer committees and narrating his adventures in a series of books. Later life A keen businessman, he embarked in several ventures whenever he was not at war. One of his partners was Gastone Guerrieri, a grandson of King Victor Emmanuel II. He later moved to Argentina where he was appointed administrator of a colony of Boer refugees in Chubut. In 1923 he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage depriving him of the use of various bodily functions. His last years were spent with his family in Casablanca, Morocco, where he died on 21 January 1940 and where his remains lay buried.

She completed a Master of Fine Arts at the University of Newcastle (2007). Early life Sinclair was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. In high school, Sinclair became interested in various artistic endeavours, studied ballet for over ten years, and has used it as a source for the large amount of role-play in her work. Sinclair attended the National Art School where she studied drawing, painting, sculpture, and photography. Sinclair has attributed a lot of her creative success to her upbringing in her family restaurant, where she finds meditation in cooking. Career Sinclair has exhibited in numerous galleries and museums including, but not limited to, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Portrait Gallery and the Australian Centre for Photography. Her series The Regal Twelve in the Phantasia exhibition has toured to the Samstag Museum (University of South Australia, 2009), and the Biennale in Paris of 2009 where it exhibited at the Australian Embassy. Her MFA series went on to win several national awards.

Gish (August 15, 1939 ‚Äì July 28, 2010) was an American peace activist, preacher, writer and public speaker. He was known for his opposition to a number of conflicts, ranging from the Vietnam War to the Iraq War. Biography =Activism= Art Gish was born in 1939 and raised in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He left his family's farm as a teenager and declared himself a conscientious objector. Gish joined the Brethren Volunteer Service, which is part of the Church of the Brethren, and worked in Europe from 1958 until 1960. During the 1960s, Gish protested the Vietnam War and supported the Civil Rights Movement. After the publication of his book The New Left and Christian Radicalism in 1970, Gish was interviewed by the editor of the Athens Messenger. In this interview he described his relationship to early Protestant cultures of worship and dissent: \\"Working in the protest movement,\\" Gish said, \\"I have come to see that the early Brethren and the Anabaptists were not conservatives. They were the radicals of their day.... The early Brethren understood that a Christian is different from the world, that a Christian stands over against the world and is in conflict with the world. To be at peace with God means that one is in conflict with the world.\\" Much of Gish's activism since 1995 focused in the Middle East, and was channelled through the Church of the Brethren's Christian Peacemaker Team program . A ruddy and distinctive presence, Gish spent much of his time overseas working in Hebron or At-tuwani in the West Bank. A 2003 photograph by the Associated Press depicted Gish standing in front of an Israeli tank in Hebron. Gish and his wife, activist Peggy Gish, opposed the 2003 Iraq War. Art and Peggy Gish were fixtures of peace actions in Athens, Ohio, which saw them cooperating with a wide array of community members, including Ohio University faculty members. Art Gish opposed capital punishment and attended a vigil at the Athens Court House whenever a state execution was taking place. =Personal life= Gish and his wife settled on an organic farm in Amesville, Ohio, near Athens, where they grew and sold organic produce and other related products. Arthur Gish was killed on his farm in Amesville, Ohio, on July 28, 2010, when his tractor overturned and caught fire. Gish was 70 years old and was survived by his wife, Peggy Gish, who was in Iraq at the time of the accident. =Works authored= Gish authored numerous books, including *The New Left and Christian Radicalism (1970) *Beyond the Rat Race (1973) *Living in Christian Community (1979) *Wealth and Poverty: Four Christian Views of Economics (contributor) (1984) *Hebron Journal: Stories of Nonviolent Peacemaking (2001) *At-Tuwani Journal: Hope and Nonviolent Action in a Palestinian Village (2008) *Muslim, Christian, Jew: The Oneness of God and the Unity of Our Faith (2012, posthumous) =Film references= Art and Peggy Gish are the subjects of the 2010 short documentary \\"Old Radicals,\\" which screened at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival as part of the International Documentary Challenge.

It is located adjacent to Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. History Kohat was annexed by the British in 1849 from the Sikhs, along with the rest of Punjab. The British made Kohat an Army Divisional Headquarters, and the military cantonment still exists today. Reports from 1882 describe the strength of the Kohat garrison to be nearly 3,000, consisting of three regiments of native infantry, half a regiment of cavalry, a mountain battery, and a garrison battery for the fort. All these troops belonged to the Panjab Frontier Force. The Kohat Cantonment is also the place where the battle between the Sikh Amry led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh defeated the Afghan army in 1823. Raids on British Cantonments Kohat is also recorded in history books for two incidents involving attacks on British Cantonments by local raiders. In November 1920, raiders attacked the house of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Howard Foulkes who was shot dead. His wife was dragged upto some distance, but she survived. She later died in December 1920 of wounds from injuries. His house, which was located in Kohat Cantonment was also looted. Col. Foulkes was a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Another incident occurred in 1923, where the house of Major Ellis was attacked, where his wife was murdered and his daughter was kidnaped (later she was recovered). Railway Station It also has a Kohat Cannt Railway Station served by Pakistan Railways.

It is the centre of one of the most renowned regiment of Pakistan Army - The Punjab Regiment. The cantonment has a large area for training and offices. Mardan once served as a base for British troops, who never managed to fully control the region's Pashtun tribes. Now it is home to the Pakistan Air Force Academy, at the Risalpur air base; and the Pakistan Army's School of Artillery and School of Armor and Mechanized Warfare.  Overview and history  Mardan sits on a plain surrounded on three sides in 2009 by mountains controlled by the Islamic militants. Swat lies just 30 miles to the north, with the main road to that troubled valley running straight through town. Mardan has the feel of a backwater. On the edge of town is rusting ghost of the sugar mill that once powered the local economy. Billboards depict glitzy shopping malls never built. Mardan has an important historical and geographical position. A region communicating Afghanistan and India in the past, it had witnessed a wonderful history. Alexander the Great reached the valley through Kunar Afghanistan and Swat in 326 BC.This was followed by Buddhism till the 7th century AD. Towards the end of 7th century; the Afghans arrived in the region. They introduced Islam in the valley. Following this Sultan Sabuktagin, Mahmood Ghaznavi, Mohammad Ghori, Mughals till the time of Aurangzeb and Nadir Shah ruled the valley. Then came the Sikhs and finally British Raj till 1947. As of 1903 Mardan Cantonment in Peshawar District, North-West Frontier Province, was the permanent headquarters of the Queen's Own Corps of Guides. It is also the headquarters of the Mardan tahsll and the Yusufzai subdivision. Population (1901), 3,572. The cantonment is situated in 34¬∞12'N. and 72¬∞2'E., on the right bank of the Kalpani river, 33 miles north-east of Peshawar and 15 miles north of Nau- shahra, on the North-Western Railway. The fort was built by Hodson of the Guides in 1854. The civil lines lay in the southern part of the cantonment on the Naushahra road, and contained the Assistant Commissioner's bungalow, courthouse, tahslll, Government dispensary, and other public offices. An Anglo-vernacular middle school was maintained by the District board. The village of Hoti, from which the station is sometimes called Hoti Mardan, lies 2 miles from the cantonment. Sheikh Malee was a great Pashtoon Geographer. He lived about 500 years ago and was one of the reliable friends of Sardar Malak Ahmad, a famous Yousafzai leader. In those days Mardan, Buner, Swat and other Pashtoon areas were collectively known as Swat. He was a sincere and an honest man. But he is famous because of the land allocation programme called \\"Veish\\" which he introduced in Peshawar, Mardan, Buner, Swat and other areas. He introduced the Unit of the land. He classified Pashtoons into nine major subgroups and the region into nine districts. He wrote a book in nine volumes about his land reforms. This is called 'Daftar e Sheikh Malee' and has been mentioned in the poems of the great poet, Khushal Khan Khattak. The 5th (Guides) Battalion of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment had Mardan as its normal duty station. In 1857, the Guides formed part of the force that went from the Punjab to the aid of the British locked in a critical combat with Indian soldiers. When the news of the outbreak reached Peshawar, a council of war was at once held and measures adopted to meet the situation. The same night the Guides started on their memorable march to Delhi. On 21 May 1857 the 55th Native Infantry rose at Mardan. The majority made good their escape across the Indus, only to perish after fearful privations at the hands of the hill-men of the Hazara border. Delhi fell to the British on 20 September 1857 after a siege lasting five months. The victorious soldiers fell upon the city and freely indulged in loot and massacre. The Guides Memorial in Mardan was built by the British in 1892 in memory of their soldiers who sacrificed their lives in defence of Queen's Residency in Kabul in September 23, 1879. This historical memorial was built in the centre of Mardan city. It has three storey building. There is an opening arch in the center of this memorial while on both sides are staircases. There is an influence of Hindu temple on the ground structures, level with suspended leaves in well carved stone works, with marble stones, mouldings which not only support the building but secure it from earthquake shockwaves. The Gothic arches are British architecture like seen in Churches. On the second floor there are open arches from where a major part of the surroundings is visible. On the third stage there are cupolas on each corner of this memorial.

Stephens is known for founding present-day Stephens City, Virginia. Biography Peter Stephens was born Peter Steffen in Steinsfurt, then part of the Electoral Palatinate (present day Germany) on March 3, 1687. Besides his birth in Swabia, little is known about Stephens before 1699 when he and his parents emigrated to America on William Penn's second shipload of families for the purpose of populating the then Colony of Pennsylvania. Peter would then migrate to what is now Frederick County, Virginia, and settle south of present-day Winchester, Virginia (which would not be founded for several more years past Stephens arrival). After buying from Jost Hite, the act of which was challenged by land baron Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, though settled amicably between Lord Fairfax and Stephens, Peter settled and founded, then unofficially called \\"Stephens town\\", in the early 1730s. It would be later chartered by the Virginia General Assembly at the request of his son Lewis and called \\"Stephensburgh\\". Today, \\"Stephensburgh\\" is called Stephens City and celebrated its 250th anniversary, on October 12, 2008. His wife, Maria Christina, would have seven children, four sons and three daughters, six of whom would be born in Frederick County, Virginia. Only their first son, Lewis, was born possibly in New York. Stephens died at the age of 70 in December 6, 1757, just under a year before the town he founded would become chartered in October 1758.

It was last assigned to the 2d Bombardment Wing at Hunter AFB, Georgia. It was inactivated on 1 March 1960. The squadron was first active as the 318th Bombardment Squadron, an operational training unit and replacement training unit under Second Air Force during World War II. In 1945, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was activated as a demonstration unit for air ground support exercises. In 1985 the three squadrons were consolidated into a single unit. History 318th Bombardment Squadron Emblem The 318th Bombardment Squadron was established in early 1942 as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombardment squadron. It was part of Second Air Force as a heavy bomber Operational Training Unit (OTU). The OTU program involved the use of an oversized parent unit to provide cadres to \\"satellite groups\\". The squadron was assigned primarily to airfields in the Pacific Northwest training new units, then becoming a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). RTUs were oversized units that trained individual pilots or aircrews. It was transferred along with its parent group to Third Air Force in November 1943. However, standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit. In this reorganization it was replaced along with other units at Avon Park AAF by the 325th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training, Bombardment, Heavy) and was inactivated. In 1945, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was activated as a demonstration unit for air ground support exercises and served in this capacity in the early postwar era. It was disbanded in 1948.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 49 The 308th Air Refueling Squadron, Medium was activated in 1953 at Hunter AFB, Georgia to provide air refueling of United States Air Force (Primarily Boeing B-47 Stratojet) aircraft using KC-97 Stratotankers on a worldwide basis. The squadron deployed to Sidi Slimane AB, Morocco in 1956. It maintained one third of its aircraft on alert in a test of Strategic Air Command's alert plan later that year. The squadron earned an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its performance in this test.AF Pamphlet 900-2, Unit Decorations, Awards and Campaign Participation Credits Department of the Air Force, Washington, DC, 15 June 1971, p. 298 In 1959 it was reassigned to the 2d Bombardment Wing at Hunter when the 308th Bombardment Wing became non-operational. It was discontinued in 1960 as Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses supported by Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers assumed the greater portion of the strategic bombardment mission. The three units were consolidated in 1985 as the 308th Air Refueling Squadron but have not been active since. = Lineage= 318th Bombardment Squadron * Constituted as 318th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 28 January 1942 : Activated on 15 June 1942 : Inactivated on 1 May 1944 * Consolidated on 19 September 1985 with 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and 308th Air Refueling Squadron as 308th Air Refueling Squadron, HeavyDepartment of the Air Force/MPM Letter 662q, 19 Sep 85, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Tactical Squadrons (remained inactive) 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron * Constituted as 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 30 June 1945 : Activated on 15 July 1945 : Inactivated on 3 February 1946 * Disbanded on 8 October 1948 * Reconstituted on 19 September 1985 and consolidated with 308th Air Refueling Squadron and 318th Bombardment Squadron as 308th Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy (remained inactive) 308th Air Refueling Squadron * Constituted as 308th Air Refueling Squadron, Medium on 15 April 1953 : Activated on 8 July 1953 : Inactivated on 1 March 1960 * Consolidated on 19 September 1985 with 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and 318th Bombardment Squadron as 308th Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy (remained inactive) =Assignments= * 88th Bombardment Group, 15 June 1942 ‚Äì 1 May 1944 * 74th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, 15 July 1945 * 69th Reconnaissance Group, 7 November 1945 ‚Äì 3 February 1946 * 308th Bombardment Wing, 8 July 1953 * 38th Air Division, 15 June 1959 * 2d Bombardment Wing, 1 July 1959 ‚Äì 1 March 1960Ravenstein, pp. 7‚Äì9 =Stations= * Salt Lake City AAB, Utah, 15 June 1942 * Geiger Field, Washington, 1 September 1942 * Walla Walla AAF, Washington, 21 September 1942 * Rapid City AAF, South Dakota, 28 October 1942 * Walla Walla AAF, Washington, 26 November 1942 * Redmond AAF, Oregon, December 1942 * Walla Walla AAF, Washington, February 1943 * Redmond AAF, Oregon, ca.

Resolution =Observations= The Security Council reiterated its commitment to address the impact of armed conflict upon children and emphasised the responsibility of all parties to comply with the United Nations Charter and international law, and end impunity for those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes against children. It was important that humanitarian personnel had safe and unimpeded access and the coming into force of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict was welcomed. The Council further noted that enlisting children under the age of 15 into the national armed forces was classified as a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. =Acts= The resolution supported the call of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan for an \\"era of application\\" international standards concerning the protection of children in armed conflict. Parties to conflict that were using child soldiers were called upon to end such practices while a dialogue would be established with the parties to develop plans to end their recruitment and use. There was concern at the list of parties violating their international obligations attached in the annex of the Secretary- General's report and further steps would be taken. Member States were called upon to adopt measures through national legislation to control arms trafficking in states that did not respect international law (the Fourth Geneva Convention) relating to the military use of children and protection of civilians during war. The Council was determined to include provisions for the protection of children in the mandates of peacekeeping operations. There was concern at reports of sexual exploitation of women and children, particularly cases involving humanitarian workers and United Nations peacekeepers. The Security Council requested the implementation of counselling and HIV/AIDS testing services for United Nations peacekeepers, police and humanitarian personnel. All concerned parties and other states were called upon to ensure that the rights of children were incorporated into peace and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes, and to abide by commitments made to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu. Finally, the Secretary-General was instructed to submit a report by 31 October 2003 on the implementation of the current resolution, including a specific section on the protection of children in all of his future country-specific reports.

The film was shot straight-to-video, and starred Kenneth Okonkwo and Nnenna Nwabueze in their breakout roles. In August 2015, Charles Okpaleke acquired the rights to Living in Bondage for a period of ten years under his production company Play Entertainment Network. On November 2, the highly anticipated sequel, Living in Bondage: Breaking Free,Living in Bondage: Breaking Free premiered in Lagos. Plot Andy Okeke (Kenneth Okonkwo) and his wife Merit (Nnenna Nwabueze) face several obstacles ‚Äì redundancy, infidelity, the loss of their savings in a bogus investment, and indecent proposals from lecherous men including Merit's boss Ichie Million (Francis Agu) and Chief Omego (Kanayo O. Kanayo). Andy constantly compares his lack of fortune to the success of his peers, especially old friend Paul (Okechukwu Ogunjiofor). Despite Merit's support and patience, Andy is driven to near-depression, determined to obtain wealth by any means possible, and the slick-talking Paul reveals his secret ‚Äì a satanic cult where members pledge their loyalty to Lucifer and kill their loved ones in ritualised sacrifices, gaining enormous wealth in return. After much hesitation, Andy reluctantly agrees to sacrifice the person he loves the most ‚Äì Merit. She dies in hospital days after the ritual, but not before she curses her husband's betrayal. Andy's sudden affluence and subsequent remarriage three months after Merit's death raises suspicion from his former in-laws who accuse him of murdering their daughter. He also faces more problems ‚Äì the paparazzi's constant interference in his daily life, his new wife Ego (Ngozi Nwosu) fleeing with his money after he collapses at their traditional wedding, and Merit's ghost haunting and terrorising him when he least expects. Andy would later enter a common-law union with Chinyere (Jennifer Okere), another woman introduced to him by Merit's former friend Caro (Ngozi Nwaneto), but she meets her untimely death after Caro poisons her friend and attempts to escape abroad with the cash Chinyere steals from her husband. Caro is also killed by a hit-and-run driver on her way to the airport, and Paul is murdered by hitmen after Andy holds him partially responsible for his involvement with the cult. A now frustrated Andy asks the satanic cult for help, but when the Chief Priest (Daniel Oluigbo) insists he can only pacify his late wife's spirit by blinding and castrating himself, he refuses and becomes mentally deranged, living as a vagrant under a Lagos flyover until Tina (Rita Nzelu) ‚Äì a former prostitute Andy previously presented to the cult as a decoy before his deceit was exposed ‚Äì takes him to her church. He finally confesses to Merit's murder, and Andy's mother (Grace Ayozie) weeps at her late daughter-in-law's grave, pleading for her forgiveness. In the film's final scene Andy, now cured of his insanity, worships with the evangelical Christians who have assured him his sins are forgiven.

Paul's name is mentioned numerous times in part two but he never appears on-screen; his death scene is also filled in by a body double.

Early life √áolak was born in Birecik, Turkey, but was raised in Deventer, a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. He is eligible for the Dutch and Turkish national football teams. Club career =Youth career= √áolak started his career at local Deventer club IJsselstreek. He soon joined Go Ahead Eagles as a youth player. Go Ahead Eagles had a cooperation agreement with FC Twente, and he joined their youth academy. In 2007, he won the national youth championship with the FC Twente A-juniors. =FC Twente= In the summer of 2007, √áolak was promoted the Twente's reserve squad, where he captured a place in the starting lineup under coach Cees Lok. Due to some good performances, he was called up by first team coach, Fred Rutten for the match against FC Utrecht. However, he didn't manage to become a part of the squad and was a reserve. On the last days of the transfer market in January 2008, √áolak signed a loan deal with Cambuur Leeuwarden. Loan deals (2008‚Äì09) √áolak made his debut on 1 February 2008, two days after he was signed. His debut came in the home-match against FC Zwolle which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. He played the whole match. √áolak played 11 matches for Cambuur. He scored one goal. On 27 July 2008, Go Ahead Eagles signed √áolak on a one-year deal, which meant a return to his hometown of Deventer. In the first league match of the season, an away-match against VVV- Venlo, he was a 57th-minute substitute for Jeffrey Vlug. The game eventually ended in a 5‚Äì0 loss for Go Ahead. In the following match, a home game against Fortuna Sittard, √áolak was in the starting lineup and directly provided an assist. The ending result was 1‚Äì1. Some weeks after at a training session, he broke his fibula which ruled him out for a couple of weeks. On 23 November he made his comeback with a place in the starting lineup in the match against FC Den Bosch, which ended in a goalless draw (0‚Äì0). In total he played 23 matches in which he scored six times. =Go Ahead Eagles= On 24 April 2009, it became clear that √áolak would stay another season on loan with Go Ahead Eagles. A month later, the loan deal was converted into a final transition, which meant that he was now definitively a Go Ahead player. He signed a three- year contract. In the first half of the 2009‚Äì10 season, √áolak scored 10 goals in 21 matches, making him an important player for the Eagles. He also scored in the KNVB Cup, including against Eredivisie side Heracles Almelo. His good performances were not going unnoticed. It was rumoured that Galatasaray were interested in the services of the young Turkish winger. =Kasƒ±mpa≈üa= On 12 August 2010 he moved to Turkey and signed a five-year deal with S√ºper Lig side Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. On March 26, 2015, √áolak was released by Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. =Akhisarspor= On 4 July 2015, √áolak was signed by Akhisarspor on a two- year contract.

Church is an African Methodist Episcopal megachurch located in Glenn Dale, Maryland, USA to the northeast of Washington, DC. In 2008, Outreach Magazine reported that attendance was 7,500, making it the 88th largest church in the USA at that time. Reid Temple currently has a campus in Glenn Dale, Maryland and a membership of well over 17,000 persons. Background The parent AME Church is a Methodist denomination founded by the Rev. Richard Allen, Absalom Jones, and others established in Philadelphia in 1816. The AME Church now has over 2,000,000 members in North and South America, Africa and Europe, and includes other major churches such as the First A.M.E. Church of Los Angeles with over 19,000 members and the Greater Allen A. M. E. Cathedral of New York with over 23,000 members. The Reid Temple A.M.E. Church has its origins in the former Dent Chapel of Bladensburg, Maryland, purchased in 1900 from the Methodist Episcopal Church and named for its first pastor, Reverend Abraham Dent. The Dent Chapel was severely damaged by flooding in the late 1950s and the congregation was forced to find a new location. The new Reid Temple A.M.E. Church was opened on October 4, 1964 on Michigan Avenue, NE in Washington, DC, initially burdened with debt and with limited facilities. These problems were overcome, and with a congregation that had grown to 300 members. Reid Temple relocated to Good Luck Road in Lanham, Maryland in January 1989. Today The senior pastor of Reid Temple is Pastor Mark E. Whitlock, Jr., who was appointed on July 11, 2019 by Bishop James L. Davis following the retirement of Senior Pastor Emeritus Rev. Dr. Lee P. Washington.

The congregation was founded in 1829, and merged in 1911 with Park Presbyterian Church to form West-Park Presbyterian Church. The first house of worship, also known as the Carmine Street Presbyterian Church, in Greenwich Village, was used from 1832 to 1865, and the second, on West 42nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, from 1865 until 1911, when it was sold and demolished. Proceeds from the sale were used, in accordance with the merger agreement, to build and endow a church for an underserved neighborhood, Washington Heights: Fort Washington Presbyterian Church. In addition, the West Church congregation had earlier established two mission churches which eventually merged to become Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church. West-Park, Fort Washington, and Good Shepherd-Faith are all active today. West Church's most prominent pastors were Thomas S. Hastings, 1856‚Äì1881, who later became President of Union Theological Seminary, and John R. Paxton, 1882‚Äì1893, whose popular sermons attracted, for a time, many wealthy and powerful businessmen as members. Carmine Street Church Church on Carmine Street, 1831 On November 1, 1829, a Presbyterian church was organized, called the North Church, which met for worship on Sixth Avenue, near Amity (today called West 3rd) Street. In 1831, a division took place, and eighteen members moved to a nearby location. They were known as the West Church. In June of that year, the remainder were organized anew as the North Church, and on July 5, Rev. Ebenezer Mason was installed as its pastor; he resigned in February 1833. After this the North Church was scattered, and dissolved in 1835. The West Church incorporated in July 1831, holding services in a room at 273 Bleecker Street. They built a house of worship on Carmine Street, designed by Town & Davis in Greek Revival style, of brick plastered to resemble white stone. It measured 84 by 62 feet, had 136 pews on the lower floor, and was topped by a wooden turret, with heavy moldings, about 30 feet high. The church was dedicated May 27, 1832, when Rev. David R. Downer was installed as pastor, with only 32 members. By the time Downer died (of tuberculosis, age 33) in 1841, the membership was several hundred. Revs. Edwin Holt, 1842‚Äì46, and then Thomas H. Skinner, Jr., 1846‚Äì1856, succeeded Downer. In 1848, when it was estimated that New York City had 10,000 indigent children, the Carmine Street Church initiated regular \\"Boys' Meetings\\"‚Äîreligious services‚Äîfor them. The program's success inspired nine other New York City groups to establish similar programs. In 1853, leaders of these programs founded the Children's Aid Society, with Charles Loring Brace, of the West Church, as secretary. It continues today. Thomas S. Hastings Church on 42nd Street, 1876 In 1856, Rev. Thomas S. Hastings became pastor. The congregation grew steadily until in 1860 it had need of larger quarters, and Hastings moved his congregation to West 42nd Street, where there was much room and land was relatively cheap. The trustees first engaged the chapel of Rutgers Female Institute on 42nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. A new chapel, designed by Foster & Babb (George Fletcher Babb and Nathaniel G. Foster), was built and dedicated in 1862. The new church, designed by Jacob Wrey Mould in Victorian Gothic style, was dedicated in 1865 on the Rutgers site. Thomas Samuel Hastings was born in Utica, N. Y., August 28, 1827, son of the well-known church musician Thomas Hastings. He graduated from Hamilton College in 1848 and from Union Theological Seminary in 1851. His first pastorate was in Mendham, N. J., from 1852 to 1856, when he was called to the pastorate of West Church. Rev. Hastings received the Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of the City of New York in 1865. In 1881, Hastings ended his 25-year-long pastorate at West to join the faculty of Union Theological Seminary, where he remained for another quarter century, during which he served from 1888 to 1897 as the school's president. Rev. Dr. Hastings died suddenly at home on April 2, 1911, age 83. John R. Paxton The West Presbyterian Church attained its greatest success during the pastorate of Rev. Dr. John R. Paxton, who served from 1882 to 1893. His vigorous sermons gave the church a great vogue. It was crowded to the doors at every service, and his preaching attracted Jay Gould and Russell Sage. Associated with the church in its heyday were J. Hood Wright, Alfred H. Smith, Frank A. Munsey, Henry Flagler, and Gen. Horace Porter, among many rich and influential men. In the early 1890s, it was said that a score or so of members represented $750 million. John Randolph Paxton was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1843 and attended Jefferson College there. When the Civil War broke out he enlisted in the Army, fighting three years and rising to the rank of captain, following which he returned to college and graduated in 1866. He attended Western Theological Seminary, and after pastorates in Maryland, Harrisburg, and Washington, D.C., he was called to West Church. He received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Washington & Jefferson College. In 1893, Dr. Paxton's sermons, always supportive of the wealthy in the past, appeared less so. (The year had seen a bank panic and the beginning of a serious economic depression.) He also became ill. After he submitted his resignation, and later changed his mind, charges and denials of intrigue against him were reported in The New York Times. Rumors of substance abuse and odd behavior were published. Finally, his resignation was accepted, effective December 31. According to news reports, Paxton struggled frequently with health problems over ensuing years. He gave occasional sermons, lectures and dinner speeches and served several months as pastor of the New York Presbyterian Church (today a Baptist church) at 128th Street and Seventh Avenue in 1897‚Äì98, but had no other pastorates. He died at home April 11, 1923, at age 79, a very wealthy man. Anthony H. Evans After nearly two years without a pastor, West Church chose Rev. Anthony Harrison Evans to replace Paxton. Born in North Wales, he resettled with his family in upstate New York in 1870. He graduated from Hamilton College in 1882 and from Union Theological Seminary in 1888. His first pastorate was in Lockport, N. Y., where he had served for six years when called by West Church, whose leaders expressed confidence he would build up the church to its past prosperity by attracting wealthy members. By 1899, the finances of the church were deteriorating, and some leaders, holding him responsible, maneuvered to remove him. An internal battle ensued, which he ultimately won. In 1902, with new financial supporters and its finances said to be strong, the church announced an ambitious plan to build a parish house for institutional work on its 43rd Street side, to modernize the auditorium, and to replace the 42nd Street front with a better-looking one; but nothing came of it. By the early twentieth century, commercialization of the church's midtown location led to the displacement of the area's residential population and the loss of many of West Presbyterian's members. In 1911, the church and a competitor, the Park Presbyterian Church at West 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, announced their consolidation under the name West-Park Presbyterian Church. They also announced plans for construction of a new sanctuary, Fort Washington Presbyterian Church, at 174th Street and Wadsworth Avenue, to serve the Washington Heights neighborhood. The latter was designed by the son and namesake of Rev. Hastings; it remained affiliated with West-Park until 1923. The 42nd Street property was sold to the Aeolian Company for a new building to house their offices and a concert hall. The last service was held on Sunday, June 4, 1911, and a demolition permit was issued June 7. The Aeolian Hall building opened October 13, 1912. In accordance with the merger agreement, Rev. Dr. Evans and his Park Church counterpart, Rev. Dr. Anson Phelps Atterbury, served as co-pastors at West-Park. Atterbury retired in 1918, becoming pastor emeritus, and Evans was sole active pastor until his death in 1942 at age 80. Mission churches Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 2016 In 1866, West Church adopted a nearby mission founded by a Reformed Church five years earlier, and in 1870 began construction of a church for it at 423 West 46th Street, a poor, immigrant section. Designed by Edward D. Lindsey in Victorian Gothic style and dedicated in 1872, it was named Faith Chapel in 1873. Ten years later, it became fully independent as Faith Church. In 1897 it moved a few blocks away to 359 West 48th Street, and the 46th Street edifice became St. Cornelius Episcopal Church. That building, since a 1920 merger with St. Clement's Episcopal Church, formerly of West 3rd Street, has been known by the latter's name. Rev. James H. Hoadley, D.D., was pastor of Faith Chapel/Church from 1873 to 1900. Rev. Paxton began a mission Sunday School in 1886 at 1019 Tenth Avenue, a store near 65th Street, and soon initiated a fund-raising drive for a new mission church, later named Church of the Good Shepherd, at 152 West 66th Street. Designed by J. C. Cady in Italian Romanesque Revival style, it was occupied when the basement was finished in 1887 but not dedicated until February 6, 1893. Rev. Daniel E. Lorenz, Ph. D., was pastor from 1887 to 1922. The church became independent (of West-Park) in 1914. IN 1943, Good Shepherd Church merged with Faith Church, which gave up its 48th Street building, to become Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church.
