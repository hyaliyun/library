At Easter 1686 Hutchins was made serjeant-at-law by James II, and in May 1689 was chosen king's serjeant to William III, who knighted him the following October. He became Member of Parliament for in the 1690 English general election. In May 1690 he succeeded Sir Anthony Keck as third commissioner of the Great Seal, and acted until the elevation of Sir John Somers as Lord Keeper on 22 March 1693. Hutchins then resumed practice at the bar, and claimed his right to retain his former position of king's serjeant. The judges decided against him, on the ground that the post was merely an office conferred by the crown; but the king settled the question by reappointing him his serjeant on 6 May. He died at his house in Greville Street, Holborn, on 6 July 1705. Family Hutchins married, first, Mary, daughter of Sir William Leman, 1st Baronet, who died in 1695; they had at least three children. His second wife was Sarah, daughter of Sir William Leman, 2nd Baronet, and so niece to his first wife, whom he married in 1697. On the marriage in 1697 of his two daughters, Hutchins gave each of them a portion of £20,000. The husband of Anne, the second daughter, was William Peere Williams.

The fire destroyed the centre of the city. History Tartu had lost most of its major stone buildings when they were blown up in September 1708 on the orders of Peter the Great during the Great Northern War. The Russian tsar ordered that the buildings in Tartu (then called Dorpat) should be mined to prevent the Swedes from using the town as a military base. This was just one of the sieges which Tartu was subjected to during its history, but this time the city was left burning and in ruins. When the war finished, the population returned to Tartu, and the desperate need for houses created an abundance of new wooden buildings. The buildings had to be built of wood as the Tsar had laid orders that no stone buildings were to be built anywhere except in the new Russian capital St. Petersburg. The first large fire occurred in 1763. The following year Catherine the Great visited, and some rebuilding took place. The \\"Great Fire\\" occurred in 1775. It started in the backyard of Knights Street () near St. John's Church. A strong wind allowed the fire to spread from building to building, and the wooden bridges allowed the fire to cross the river to do further damage. Nearly 200 wooden buildings were destroyed and over 40 stone buildings. The city was further damaged when eighteen buildings were purposefully destroyed to create fire breaks. At the end of the fire only 160 buildings remained: most of these were to the north of the city. There were only forty left standing in the former centre of the city. Uppsala House, which is near St. John's church, claims to be one of the few buildings now remaining that date from before the fire. Some of its timbers have been dated to 1750.The Town Hall of Tartu, tartu.ee, retrieved 30 December 2013 After the fire Following the fire the city was rebuilt. After the fire the rules that had required that there be no new stone buildings were reversed and it was now required to construct not only new buildings but also fences and outbuildings without using wood. The cornerstone of Tartu Town Hall was laid in 1782 and completed under the command of Johann Heinrich Bartholomäus Walter. Catherine the Great found 25,000 rubles to ease the situation in Tartu after the fire, and the money was used to build a stone bridge across the river. The remains of this bridge can still be seen beneath the river Emajõgi but the main part of the bridge was destroyed during the Second World War.Tartu in your Pocket References Category:18th-century fires Category:History of Tartu Category:Fires in Russia Category:18th century in Estonia Category:Urban fires in Europe ","title":"Great fire of Tartu"},{"id":"41502493","title":"Modern pentathlon at the 2002 Asian Games – Men's team"},{"id":"41502499","text":"Richfield Ice Arena is an ice arena located in the city of Richfield, Minnesota.

He had a major national and international impact on rheumatology during more than six decades, and wrote more than one hundred scientific and medical papers. Engleman received his B.S. from Stanford University in 1933 and his M.D. from Columbia University in 1937. He saw military service as a major during World War II, serving as chief of the U.S. Army’s Rheumatic Fever Center at Torney General Hospital. In 1942, he was one of two authors of the first English language medical article describing the triad of uveitis, urethritis, and arthritis and coined the eponym Reiter's syndrome (now known as reactive arthritis) after Dr. Hans Conrad Julius Reiter. In 1947, he joined the clinical faculty at UCSF and spent the remaining 68 years of his professional medical career there, with a national and international impact on the field of rheumatology. From 1962-1963, Engleman was president of the American Rheumatism Association, now the American College of Rheumatology; president of the National Society of Clinical Rheumatology (1967-1969); president of the International League Against Rheumatism (1981-1985). In the latter position, he made several trips to mainland China and was influential in the creation of the Chinese Rheumatology Association. He also served as Chairman of the World Health Organization’s task force on arthritis and on several committees of the Natural Institutes of Health. From 1975 to 1976, Engleman chaired the National Commission on Arthritis, a congressional mandated task force charged with recommending remedies for the inadequate status of arthritis research, teaching and patient care in the United States. The National Arthritis Plan, which summarized the commission’s recommendations, most of which were implemented, included the creation of what is now the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and tripling of the ongoing federal budget for arthritis research. It also called attention to the surprising number of medical schools with no curriculum in rheumatology – a situation that changed quickly after the plan’s publication. In 1979, Engleman became Founding Director of the Rosalind Russell Medical Research Center for Arthritis at UCSF. Its name has since changed. Engleman served as the Director of the Rosalind Russell/Ephraim P. Engleman Rheumatology Research Center at UCSF until his death in 2015. Some of Engelman’s additional honors are recipient of the Medal of Honor at UCSF in 2002, “the most prestigious award given by UCSF”; recipient of the Presidential Gold Medal Award of the American College of Rheumatology, the highest national honor in the field of rheumatology; and recipient of Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons Gold Medal for excellence in clinical medicine in 2007, the highest honor the school’s alumni association can bestow. In 2007, while still practicing rheumatology and after Reiter's Nazi past became more widely known, Engleman went on record as calling for a replacement of the eponymous term for the disease with the name \\"reactive arthritis.\\" Engleman wrote a book of memoirs, My Century. Active until his death, he was the longest-tenured professor of UCSF . In January 2013, he was believed to be the lone surviving member of Stanford University's Class of 1933. Engleman died at the age of 104 on September 2, 2015 while at work as director of the Rosalind Russell/Ephraim P. Engleman Rheumatology Research Center at UCSF, which had been renamed in his honor the previous year. Engleman was survived by his two sons, daughter Jill Roost, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Books * The Arthritis Book: A Guide for Patients and Their Families.

Designed for walking, running, and athletics, the footwear has thin and flexible soles that are contoured to the shape of the human foot. Xero Shoes was featured on ABC's Shark Tank and gained success after the show's appearance. History A high-school sprinter, Steven Sashen got back into the sport after a 30-year break. However, after two years of injury-prone competition, he joined a local barefoot running club in Boulder, CO at the suggestion of a friend who gave him a copy of Born To Run by Christopher McDougall. As a result of running barefoot, his gait changed and injuries abated. Sashen wanted to continue the barefoot experience in areas which required foot covering, so he developed his own modern huarache-style sandal similar to those worn by the Tarahumara Indians in Mexico’s Copper Canyon, consisting of a thin rubber sole sourced from Vibram in Italy and nylon-polypropylene laces (this original style is now sold as the Xero Shoes \\"Cherry\\" in the classic kit). After making the first pair for his wife Lena Phoenix and a second for himself, Sashen got requests from friends for their own minimalist sandals. Sashen launched a website selling this DIY sandal kit at invisibleshoe.com in late November, 2009. In August 2012, the company engaged Dennis Driscoll who has previously developed products for Avia, Crocs, Dr. Martens, and Wilson Sporting Goods as a chief product officer, and renamed the brand Xero Shoes in December 2012. It has since sold shoes and sandals in various styles and designs to customers in 94 countries. The company has since moved from online-sales only to also channel marketing via select high street based North American retailers and Amazon.com, priced from $19.95 to $149.99.

She contributed to many Victorian newspapers, periodicals and children's books. Biography Waifs from the Great City = Early life = Mary Ellen Edwards was born the daughter of Mary Johnson and Downes Edwards, a farmer and engineer who had a number of successful inventions. She was born on her father’s farm in Surbiton (also known as Kingstington-upon-Thames) on 9 November 1838. She came from an artistic family. Her uncle was E. Killingworth Johnson and her mother's uncle was James Wright, both Members of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. She spent her early years with her family in Surbiton, the Isle of Man, South Kensington, and Chelsea, London. On 13 June 1866, Edwards married John Freer. Freer worked for the Peninsular and Oriental Company, a steam navigation service. Edwards and Freer had one son, John E. L. Freer, born in 1867. Edward's first husband (Freer) died in 1869. At this time and over the following decade Mary Ellen was submitting her work to the annual Royal Academy shows. In 1872 she married the artist John Charles Staples, with whom she worked on many projects until his death at the end of the century. = Education = Due to her location early on in life, she was unable to receive much formal training in art. She did, however, attend South Kensington School of Art for one term. She moved frequently as a child and even as an adult, preventing extended periods of education at one place.  Career  She started her artistic career at an early year in the medium of watercolor. At age 12, she switched from watercolor to oil. Outside of watercolor and engraving, Edwards was a successful illustrator, drawing her works on a wooden medium. In 1959, Checkmated, a self-made design was displayed on the cover of Illustrated Times, a weekly illustrated news magazine in Britain. In 1862, she sent her first two major works into the Royal Academy in London, England. Her works Idle Hours and I Wandered by the Brookside were accepted and displayed. From 1864 to 1908, she sent in work every year, missing only 1873 due to illness. By 1908, she had exhibited 38 art pieces at the Royal Academy. Her first piece that gained notoriety due to being purchased for publication, The Last Kiss, was displayed in 1865. Also purchased and subsequently engraved were her works In Memoriam and Good-bye. She established a substantial reputation for her illustrations of Trollope's The Claverings, which was serialized in the Cornhill Magazine from 1866 to 1867. She illustrated many children's books, including That Boy of Northcott's by Charles Lever, many of which were printed in Cornhill as well. From 1869 to 1880 she was on the staff of The Graphic. Throughout her lengthy career, she worked for the Cornhill Magazine, the Illustrated Times, the Graphic, Belgravia, Churchman, Argosy, and Good Works. Outside of her nearly-annual submissions to the Royal Academy, she exhibited four works at the Royal Society of British Artists, one work at the Royal Scottish Academy, eight works at the Royal Glasgow Institute, two works at the British Institution, and nine works at the Society of Women Artists. She contributed to exhibits at the Dudley Gallery in both watercolor and in black and white while her work was also exhibited in galleries in France. Her illustration Waifs from the Great City was included in the 1905 book Women Painters of the World.Women painters of the world, from the time of Caterina Vigri, 1413-1463, to Rosa Bonheur and the present day, by Walter Shaw Sparrow, The Art and Life Library, Hodder & Stoughton, 27 Paternoster Row, London, 1905  Style and influence  Mary Ellen Edwards worked and lived in both the 19th and early 20th centuries. Due to the prevailing social climate of the time, she was not very popular among a society that viewed her art through the traditional male lens. She focused more on illustrations that conveyed emotion in a social setting, and she was extremely successful at it. Furthermore, many of her works revolve around social settings with groups of people. She was exceptional at illustrating emotion in her work, and her pieces are very powerful and easy to understand. Unfortunately her style did not catch on among the broad population due to her status as a member of \\"feminine art\\"; her works were often viewed as \\"feminine\\", \\"sentimental\\", and \\"domestic\\": rarely equitably compared with her male counterparts. =Example of book illustration by Edwards= The following illustrations were painted by Edwards for Through the Meadows (1885) by Frederic Edward Weatherly (1848-1929). As well as the 24 colour illustrations by Edwards, there were as many silluoutes by John C. Staples.

In fact, the council is the highest policy body which oversees the overall petroleum and gas sector in Kuwait. History and profile The council was established on 26 August 1974 to protect the state’s natural resources along with two other major public bodies, namely the Ministry of Oil and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. In addition, the council set Kuwait's general policy of oil and energy. Saad Al Abdullah Al Sabah and Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, the current Emir of Kuwait, are among the former heads of the council. The latter served in the post between 2003 and 2010. Then the council began to be headed by the Prime Minister of Kuwait. The council members who are selected by the Amir of Kuwait serve for three years. At the initial phase, the council consisted of four ministers, namely minister of finance and oil, minister of foreign affairs, state minister for Cabinet's affairs and minister of commerce and industry. In 2010 the number of the council members was 18, eight cabinet members and ten representatives of private sector. As of 2013 the council is made up of six ministers and six representatives of private sector. The heads of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and of the Central Bank also hold a seat on the council. In theory, the council meets at least four times annually. However, it did not meet from 2008 to February 2010 due to the resignation of four council members.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Bethlehem. In 1988 it was listed as a contributing property in the Fountain Hill Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. Interior, 2020 Interior, 2020 History= Founding of the parish = The first services of the Episcopal Church were occasionally celebrated in Bethlehem beginning in 1854, in locations such as Temperance Hall near Broad and New streets, the Sun Inn, the Eagle Hotel, Central Moravian Church, and Citizens' Hall. In the early 1860s, Tinsley Jeter led worship in his home, the old Freytag farmhouse. The first Episcopal service officiated by a cleric in South Bethlehem was held in Robert Sayre's parlor on June 16, 1861, by the Rev. Mr. Tschudi, assistant minister of St. Mark's, Mauch Chunk (Jim Thorpe). A church school of 52 pupils was soon established in the North Pennsylvania Railroad station on May 11, 1862. In July 1862, the Missionary Society of the Diocese of Pennsylvania sent the Rev. Eliphalet Nott Potter (son of Bishop Alonzo Potter), as missionary to Bethlehem and Allentown. From September 7, 1862, services have been held regularly, with Holy Communion being celebrated for the first time in South Bethlehem on October 19, 1962, with the Rev. Alexander Cummins, rector of Christ Church, Reading, presiding. At a meeting in the home of Robert Sayre on November 8, 1862, a temporary vestry formed. William Heysham Sayre and Tinsley Jeter were wardens. Ira Cortright, Robert Sayre, William Sayre Jr., and John Smylie Jr. were members. At the convention of the Diocese of Pennsylvania of May 1863, the parish was received into the diocese, and on June 1, 1863, the Rev. Eliphalet Potter was called as rector. Asa Packer and Solomon Roberts joined the vestry. = Pro-cathedral and cathedral = The vestry voted to allow the church to allow the use of the church by Bishop Rulison, an assistant bishop, in 1890 (but as assistant bishops do not officially have a see the church did not officially become the pro-cathedral until 1899 under the Rt. Rev. Ethelbert Talbot, and then, in 1944, under the Rt. Rev. Frank W. Sterrett it became the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem. =Congregations planted=Trinity Church In 1869 under the guidance of then rector the Rev. Robert Nevin, a Sunday school was established on Wall Street (currently Market Street) to provide an Episcopal presence on across the river on Bethlehem's NorthSide. When Nevin left Nativity, acting rector the Rev. John Forbes took over the effort and H. Stanley Goodwin became the first superintendent. It was during this time that the name Trinity was chosen. By 1872 the first vestry established itself with members of the Church of the Nativity's vestry also serving on Trinity Church's: Charles Dodson, William Dunglison, H. Stanley Goodwin, and Robert H. Sayre. Trinity Church's first services were held in 1872, and by 1873 was accepted in union with the then Diocese of Central Pennsylvania. St. Mary's Chapel With the establishment of John Smylie's Shive Governor Works and the construction of the Lechauweki Springs Summer Resort in Fountain Hill in 1873, the Church of the Nativity planted a Sunday school which met at the resort. Robert H. Sayre was the first superintendent. By 1874 it had grown and began meeting in Salisbury Public School. Property at the corner of Lechauweki Avenue and Church Street in Fountain Hill was purchased, a cornerstone was laid on October 6, 1874, and St. Mary's Chapel was consecrated on the 10th anniversary of the Church of the Nativity, April 19, 1875. By 1895, the building had been enlarged and reconsecrated. Due to the advent of the automobile and changing demographics, by 1942 the last services were held in St. Mary's Chapel and the property and building were sold by the Cathedral Church of the Nativity in 1945. The building is currently home to Healthy Environments Child Development Center. St. Joseph Chapel An influx of workers to the iron works in South Bethlehem inspired members of the Church of the Nativity to plant a Sunday school near the No. 3 Furnace. Thus, in November 1882, St. Joseph's Chapel began under the direction of William Wharton Thurston who was then president of the iron works. In 1883 property for an edifice was purchased by Joseph Wharton of Philadelphia, ground was broken on November 6, 1883, and the cornerstone was laid on November 18. In January 1884 the first services were held in the new building, and on October 18, 1884, the building was consecrated. By 1897 the congregation had grown enough to need more space, and the building was enlarged. This larger building was consecrated in Sept 1899. By 1911, demographics were changing in the neighborhood, and St. Joseph's was given by the diocesan Italian missioner, the Rev. D. A. Rocca for ministry to Italian immigrants. By 1914 an influx of immigrants from Greece meant that the beginning of the congregation that would become St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church started using the building, and in 1917 The [Episcopal] Pro-Cathedral Church of the Nativity sold the property to St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox congregation. The building is currently home to Holy Bethel Pentecostal Church. The cemetery behind St. Joseph's building remains partially owned by St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, and partially by the [Episcopal] Cathedral Church of the Nativity. =Connections to Foundation of Local Institutions=Lehigh University 1865 Bishopthorpe School for Girls When Philadelphia music publisher Charles Augustus Fiot died in 1866, the Manor House mansion and grounds he had built in the early 1850s on the old Hoffert farm and called \\"Fontainebleau\\" in Fountain Hill came up for sale. Tinsely Jeter scooped up the property in 1867. In a meeting at Robert H. Sayre's mansion on December 11, 1867, Robert Sayre, William H. Sayre, Tinsley Jeter, H. Stanley Goodwin, James Jenkins, John Smylie, Henry Coppee, the Rev. Eliphalet N. Potter (Rector of The Church of the Nativity) and the Rt. Rev. William Bacon Stevens (Bishop of the Diocese of Pennsylvania) committed themselves to establishing a \\"young ladies' academy of the highest character\\". By 1868 the Bishopthorpe School for Girls had begun, with the property rented, and then purchased by the Vestry of The Church of the Nativity. It utilized the old Manor House as a seminary (i.e. finishing school) for girls born to the wealthy families of the burgeoning industrial class. Tinsley Jeter was the first President of the Board and the school operated under the auspices of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. Edith H. Chase was hired as first principal and held the post until 1870. By the 1880s the Diocese of Pennsylvania had purchased the school. Fanny I. Walsh succeeded her and was principal until her death in 1894. By 1902 the school had fallen on hard times and closed temporarily, until it was purchased by Claude I. Wyant in 1906. During the Great Depression, the Wyants closed the school and sold Bishopthorpe to St. Luke's Hospital in 1930, where in 1931 St. Luke's opened its School of Nursing. The buildings were demolished in 1994.

And so, on August 3, 1863 the cornerstone was laid, and construction began on the parish's first church building. It was completed the following year with the first services celebrated on Christmas Day, and was consecrated on April 19, 1865 by the Rt. Rev. William B. Stevens, then Assistant Bishop of Pennsylvania. 193x193px Enlargement 1887 170x170px The present building's nave, chancel and iconic apse were designed by architect E. M. Burns and incorporated the 1864 building as an east-west transept. Robert Packer Linderman, together with his sister Sally, and brother Garrett Brodhead Linderman Jr erected the chancel in memory of their father Dr. Garrett Brodhead Linderman, and the Altar and reredos in memory of their mother Lucy Packer Linderman, daughter of Asa Packer. Construction was completed in 1887 and the enlarged building was first used on Easter Day, April 10, 1887. The debt was paid off by the following year and it was consecrated by Assistant Bishop of Central Pennsylvania, the Rt. Rev. Nelson Somerville Rulison on All Saints' Day, November 1, 1888. Apse and Nave, c. 1888 Tower, Baptistery & Rood Screen 1899 In 1899 Robert Packer Linderman gave the iconic Rood Screen, designed by J. & R. Lamb Studios as a thank offering for the recent birth of his son Robert Packer Linderman Jr. In the same year, Robert Heysham Sayre installed the Font and Baptistery designed by E. M. Burns in memory of his first wife Mary Evelyn Sayre, four of their children who died young (Charles White, Anna Catharine, Ellen May, and Francis Rodolphus), a grandchild who died, Robert Sayre Chandler; his sister Elizabeth Kent (wife of William Reed), and their deceased grandchildren Harvey Dennison Kitchel, Gladys Kitchel, and William Sayre Kitchel; his sister Catharine Irvin; and his deceased son Cecil Nevin Sayre (from his second marriage to Martha Nevin). Warren Abbot Wilbur built the tower with its bells on the southwest corner of the building in 1899, in memory of his late wife Sallie Packer Linderman Wilbur. The set of nine bells, made by the Meneely (Troy) Bell Foundry were first rung on Easter Day, April 15, 1900. Rood Screen, Chancel, and Altar, 1900 Baptistery, 1900 Stained GlassPipe Organs * 1865 C.

Eliphalet Potter, the Vestry authorized construction of a rectory for $1500. The building, built of stone in a Rural Gothic [Revival] style was completed by 1867. Rectory, c 1866 From 1866 until 1938 the house served as the Rector's, then Dean's house. Under Dean Foust, then, the parish rented then purchased a home on Seneca Street in Fountain to be a Rectory. Parish offices moved into the first floor of the former Rectory - then restyled \\"Church House\\" - and the second and third floors were converted into an apartment for associate clergy. The Seneca Street Deanery was sold in 1955 and a house on West Market Street was purchased as the Deanery. The Parish Offices moved from Church House back to the Parish House (Sayre Hall) in 1986. For a time in the 1970s and 1980s and then again in the 2000s the second and third floor apartment housed the Sexton. KidsPeace and then a counseling center utilized the space in the late 1990s. Currently the first floor of the Deanery is home to ShareCare Faith-in-Action, the Cathedral History Room (archives), and the Sexton's Office. The second and third floor apartment is clergy housing.

Vacancy The by- election was caused by the appointment of the sitting Coalition Liberal Member of Parliament, Thomas Macnamara as Minister of Labour. Until the passing of the Re-election of Ministers Act, 1919, MPs who were appointed to certain ministerial and other offices more than nine months after a proclamation summoning a new Parliament were required to seek re-election to the House of Commons.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 pxii Electoral history The North West division of Camberwell was created for the 1918 general election and gave Camberwell an additional member. It comprised three wards from the old Camberwell North seat, which was Liberal and two wards from Dulwich which had previously been Unionist.Robin Betts, Dr Macnamara: 1861-1931; Liverpool University Press, 1999 p298 Macnamara had switched to the new seat in 1918 when, as a close associate of David Lloyd George he was a recipient of the Coalition Coupon. There is some dispute over the status of his opponent at that election, the Conservative Guy Radford. According to The Times newspaper, Radford, who had fought the seat of Chesterfield at the general elections of January and December 1910 F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885–1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p248 was described as an unofficial Unionist.The Times, 16 March 1920 p13 However another source indicates that Radford had been Conservative candidate in Camberwell since 1911 and that he was not only formally adopted by the local Conservatives to contest the general election against Macnamara but that he too had been granted the Coalition coupon.Robin Betts, Dr Macnamara: 1861–1931; Liverpool University Press, 1999 p343 This however conflicts with his statement at the time of the 1918 general election when Radford told The Times special correspondent that he had received a telegram from the Conservative agent for the London area, William Hayes Fisher which read “Greatly deplore paramount necessities of Coalition arrangements prevent your inclusion in the list of official candidates.” The article concludes that it was Macnamara who received the Coupon and that Radford did not.The Times, 13 December 1918 p10 Whatever the actual situation, Macnamara’s close connection to the prime minister, with his reputation as the Man Who Won the War, trumped whatever local or national credentials Radford possessed and Macnamara won in 1918 with 64% of the poll.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p11 T. J. Macnamara Candidates *Macnamara was duly nominated to seek re-election as the pro- government Liberal candidate in the by-election caused by his appointment to the Cabinet as Minister of Labour.The Times, 19 March 1920 p18 Macnamara had sat as MP for Camberwell North between 1900 and 1918. *As Coalition partners with the Lloyd George Liberals, the Tories did not oppose Macnamara at the by- election, although a split in the local Conservative ranks meant that for a time it was thought possible one section of Tory support might rally behind a local candidate, very possibly Guy Radford.The Times, 20 March 1920 p16 *The split in the Liberal Party which occurred when Lloyd George replaced H H Asquith as prime minister in December 1916 had resulted on many occasions in candidates from the different sides of the Liberal divide fighting each other. Macnamara did not have an Aquisthian Liberal opponent at the 1918 general election but the Wee Frees, as the Asquithian Liberals were known colloquially by analogy with the small, strict Scottish Presbyterian sect,Roy Douglas, History of the Liberal Party 1895-1970; Sidgwick and Jackson, 1971 p137 did bring forward a candidate to face Macnamara this time. Macnamara’s association with the Coalition had not been universally welcomed by Camberwell Liberals but they had stuck with him in 1918. They were not pleased however by Macnamara’s intervention on behalf of the Coalition candidate against the Asquithian former cabinet minister Sir John Simon at the Spen Valley by- election in December 1919 when Simon might have won the seat in a straight fight against Labour.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p528 The Camberwell Liberals passed a resolution informing Macnamara they no longer regarded him as their representative The Times, 13 December 1919 p16 and they soon selected John Charles Carroll, a builder and contractor at Leyton,The Times, 20 March 1920 p16 Chairman of the London Junior Liberal Association and president of the West Ham Liberals as prospective candidate in his place. Buoyed by the victory of Asquith in the Paisley by-election on 12 February 1920, Camberwell Liberals duly adopted Carroll as the official party candidate when the by- election was called.Robin Betts, Dr Macnamara: 1861–1931; Liverpool University Press, 1999 p344 *There was no tradition of candidates representing the Labour movement in any of the Camberwell seats between 1885 and 1918.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885–1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 pp7-9i But the change in the social and political landscape brought about by the First World War, the extension of the franchise and the resulting mass democracy, meant Labour were contesting ever greater numbers of seats with each passing election. It was reported on 15 March 1920 that the Labour Party was expected to fight hard to keep Dr Macnamara from re-gaining his seat. At that time, Labour were considering putting forward the mayor of Camberwell, Cllr J D Spradbrow, as their candidate.The Times, 15 March 1920 p16 Very soon afterwards however, it emerged that the Labour candidate would be Susan Lawrence, the former Municipal Reform or Conservative member of the London County Council turned socialist. Miss Lawrence was aged 48 and one of the Labour Party’s leading female members with a distinguished career in local government for Labour in Poplar.David Howell, (Arabella) Susan Lawrence; in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 20014-13 Campaign The writ for the by-election was issued in Parliament on 22 March The Times, 23 March 1920 p7 and polling day was set for 31 March. Nominations closed to confirm that the election would be a three-way contest. The chief issue in the election was the performance and record of the Coalition government. The Times reported that support for the Coalition was crumbling in the country but although the opposition parties had made gains from the Coalition in by- elections since 1918 most government defences of their seats had been successful. Even The Times conceded too that Dr Macnamara had formidable electioneering experience.The Times, 3 March 1920 p16 Macnamara and Carroll both issued election addresses on 23 March, Macnamara defending the government’s record and promising that the Coalition was doing all it could to keep the cost of living down, increase housing provision and restore the economy after the great expenses of the war. He also attacked the socialism and syndicalism of the Labour Party with great rhetorical flourish.The Times, 24 March 1920 p18 In this he may have been influenced by the behaviour Labour supporters at one of his public meetings on 26 March who rushed in and howled him down attempting to disrupt the event.Robin Betts, Dr Macnamara: 1861–1931; Liverpool University Press, 1999 p345 It was vital to Macnamara not just to retain his traditional Liberal support but also to keep the Unionist vote solidly on his side. It was important to him therefore that he received a letter of support signed by both the prime minister and by Tory leader Bonar Law in which what was described as his “close acquaintance and warm sympathy” with organised labour was highlighted. This was not simply to endorse his appointment as Minister of Labour but presumably to make a useful electoral appeal to Labour supporters.The Times, 29 March 1920 p9 This may have been a canny move as Macnamara always regarded Labour as his principal opposition and, like Lloyd George, was keen to play up the socialist or Bolshevik menace he alleged was lurking behind the apparently moderate skirts of Miss Lawrence.The Times, 30 March 1920 p16 Carroll lost no time in attacking Macnamara and the Coalition. He claimed Macnamara had ceased to be a Liberal and stated his belief that the public were disgusted with the Coalition's lack of principle and policy.Robin Betts, Dr Macnamara: 1861–1931; Liverpool University Press, 1999 p344 He said its record was lamentable and barren. The Coalition's 1918 programme was, he declared, a deception. He came out in favour of a levy on capital wealth, Home Rule for Ireland within the Empire, cooperation in industry and temperance reform.The Times, 24 March 1920 p18 Miss Lawrence was perhaps hoping for a boost from an electorate of whom half were women.The Times, 24 March 1920 p18 It was reported however that women voters still seemed reluctant to return women to Parliament,The Times, 29 March 1920 p9 although to be fair they had so far had little opportunity. Of the 17 women candidates who were nominated at the 1918 general election only one, Constance Markievicz of Sinn Féin, was returned and ironically she was one who did not wish to take up her seat.Pamela Brookes, Women at Westminster ; Peter Davies, London 1967 p14 The only woman to take up her seat so far had been Nancy Astor who won the Plymouth Sutton by-election in 1919 and no other woman had stood at a by –election since 1918. It was nevertheless acknowledged that little was known at that time of the psephology of the women’s vote and there was speculation that it might after all prove decisive in Camberwell.The Times, 29 March 1920 p9 Miss Lawrence did not however have the reputation of being an effective platform performer which was held as a factor against her. She too led on the high cost of living and she and her supporters tried to paint the Labour Party as the party of the future with the Coalition as belonging to the past.The Times, 24 March 1920 p18 It was expected to be a tightly fought and close contest all round with dozens of political meetings scheduled, many outside speakers and party workers for all three candidates coming to help from all over London. There were also motor and bicycle processions as well as a profusion of placards, hoardings and posters.The Times, 29 March 1920 p9 Result Macnamara retained the seat for the government with a majority of 1,885 votes, down from one of 3,039 votes at the general election. However this contest was three-cornered rather than the straight fight he had had in 1918. Despite all the hullaballoo of the campaign and the press focus on the significance of the election, the turnout was only 47.9%.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p11 Macnamara in his victory speech praised the electorate for understanding that the government had a massive task on its hands in the aftermath of the war but promised to take grievances against government policy more seriously in the future and try to explain the government position more clearly. He also hailed a victory against the forces of socialism. His win, he declared, “showed that the people were not going to hand over the fate of the country to hot-air artists at the street corners.” The Times, 15 April 1920 p17 Aftermath Macnamara's days as the local MP were however numbered. He held the seat at the 1922 general election standing as a Lloyd George National Liberal in a three-cornered contest with Labour and the official Liberals. In 1923, now fighting as a Liberal without prefix or suffix, he just held on with a majority of 80 votes over Labour with the Conservatives also back in the fight. At the 1924 general election however he was finally ousted with the Tories taking the seat. Camberwell North West then became a Conservative-Labour marginal until its abolition in 1950.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p11 He later tried to get back into Parliament as Liberal candidate in Walsall but without success. Carroll was twice subsequently an unsuccessful Parliamentary candidate for the Liberals, at North Lanarkshire in 1922 and West Ham, Upton in 1923. Miss Lawrence was however more successful. She served as MP for East Ham North on two occasions and in 1929 succeeded Herbert Morrison as Chair of the Labour Party.

Although forced out of Parliament through bankruptcy in 1912, Bottomley had come back as an Independent in his old seat of Hackney South in 1918. He formed the Independent Parliamentary Group and sensed the growing unpopularity of the Coalition and the reluctance of many working men and women to give wholehearted support to a Labour Party still feared as introducing the novelty of socialism to British politics. Bottomley knew from his own brand of populist, jingoistic, politics that, as Palmer put it, \\"there is an immense body of sound opinion in the working classes which ranges itself on the side of King and Constitution.\\"The Times, 21 February 1920 p14 In this climate, Bottomley understood that here was an opportunity to try add create a new third force in Parliament, anticipating the upsurge of opinion which was to produce good results for Anti-Waste candidates in the coming months.

Although feathers have been prized and feather works created in other parts of the world, those done by the amanteca or feather work specialists impressed Spanish conquerors, leading to a creative exchange with Europe. Featherwork pieces took on European motifs in Mexico. Feathers and feather works became prized in Europe. The \\"golden age\\" for this technique as an art form was from just before the Spanish conquest to about a century afterwards. At the beginning of the 17th century, it began a decline due to the death of the old masters, the disappearance of the birds that provide fine feathers and the depreciation of indigenous handiwork. Feather work, especially the creation of \\"mosaics\\" or \\"paintings\\" principally of religious images remained noted by Europeans until the 19th century, but by the 20th century, the little that remained had become a handcraft, despite efforts to revive it. Today, the most common feather objects are those made for traditional dance costumes, although mosaics are made in the state of Michoacán, and feather trimmed huipils are made in the state of Chiapas. Mesoamerican featherwork The use of feather for decorative purposes has been documented in many parts of the world in the past. In the New World, it is known to have had ceremonial use and ranking purposes, especially in attire in what are now Brazil and Peru.Castello Yturbide, p. 18Meneses, p. 22 In Mesoamerica, their use became highly developed with some of the most intricate examples coming from what is now central Mexico.Castello Yturbide, p. 17 One reason for this was their symbolic and religious use.Meneses, p. 19 Much of this symbolism arose with the spread of the worship of the Toltec god/king Quetzalcoatl, depicted as a serpent covered in quetzal feathers. Quetzalcoatl was said to have discovered gold, silver and precious stones. When he fled Tula, he released all kind of birds he was breeding.Castello Yturbide, p. 17Castello Yturbide, p. 33 The Aztec main god, Huitzilopochtli, is associated with the hummingbird. His origin is from ball of fine feathers that fell on his mother, Coatlicue, and impregnated her. He was born fully armed with an eagle feather shield, fine plumage in his head and on his left sandal.Russo, p. 3 Feathers were valued similarly to jade and turquoise in Mesoamerica. They were considered to have magical properties as symbols of fertility, abundance, riches and power and those who used them were associated with divine powers.Castello Yturbide, p. 27 Evidence of use goes back at least as far as the Mayas, with depictions of them on the murals at Bonampak. The Mayans also raised birds in part for feathers.Castello Yturbide, p. 82Castello Yturbide, p. 19 Toltec groups were making feathered items from black and white feathers of local origin. The most developed use of feathers in Mesoamerica was among the Aztecs, Tlaxcaltecs and Purepecha. Feathers were used to make many types of objects from arrows, fly whisks, fans, complicated headdresses and fine clothing.Castello Yturbide, p. 238 By the reign of the Aztec ruler Ahuizotl, richer feathers from tropical areas came to the Aztec Empire with quetzal and the finest feathers used by Moctezuma's reign. Feathers were used for ceremonial shields, and the garments of Aztec eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Feather work dressed idols and priests as well.Castello Yturbide, p. 20 Moctezuma asked the Purépecha for help against the Spanish by sending gifts that included quetzal feathers. Among the Purépecha, feathers were used similarly, for ceremonial shields, bucklers, doublets for the cazonci or ruler and feather ceremonial garments for priests, warriors and generals. To declare war, the Purépecha showed enemies wood covered in feathers and send highly prized green feathers to allies and potential allies. Soldiers who died in war were buried with feathers.Castello Yturbide, p. 143Castello Yturbide, p. 81 Aztec warriors with feathered shields and other gear from the Mendoza Codex Feathers from local and faraway sources were used, especially in the Aztec Empire. The feathers were obtained from wild birds as well as from domesticated turkeys and ducks, with the finest feathers coming from Chiapas, Guatemala and Honduras .Castello Yturbide, pp. 27, 35 These feathers were obtained through trade and tribute.Castello Yturbide, p. 35 Feathers functioned as a kind of currency along with cocoa beans, and were a popular trade item because of their value and ease of transport over long distances and a close relationship developed between traders and feather workers.Castello Yturbide, pp. 33-36 Certain areas were required to pay tribute in raw feathers and other in finished feather goods, but no area was required to provide both.Castello Yturbide, p. 65 Cuetzalan paid tribute to Moctezuma in the form of quetzal feathers. This demand was so great that it led to the local extinction of quetzals in that region, leaving only the name of a local tree, quetzalcuahuitl, where the birds used to hide to eat.Castello Yturbide, pp. 196-196 The most important of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released.Castello Yturbide, p. 28 Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún made a list of the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.Castello Yturbide, p. 207Castello Yturbide, p. 235 Skilled feather workers (amanteca). Florentine Codex, Book IV. In Aztec society, the class that created feather objects was called the amanteca, named after the Amantla neighborhood in Tenochtitlan where they lived and worked.Castello Yturbide, p. 14 The amanteca had their own god, Coyotlinahual, who had companions called Tizaua, Mamiocelotl and Mamiltochtli. They also honored the female deities Xiuhtlati and Xilo.Castello Yturbide, p. 56Meneses, p. 18 Daughters of amanteca generally became embroiderers and feather dyers, with the boys dedicated to the making of feather objects. The amanteca were a privileged class of craftsmen. They did not pay tribute nor were required to perform public service. They had a fair amount of autonomy in how they ran their businesses. Feather work was so highly prized that even sons of nobility learned something of it during their education.Castello Yturbide, p. 57 The sophistication of this art can be seen in pieces created before the Conquest, some of which are part of the collection of the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna, such as Montezuma's headdress, the ceremonial coat of arms and the great fan or fly whisk. Other important examples such as shields are in museums in Mexico City. Close up of a cloth woven in cotton and feathers at the Centro Cultural de España en México in Mexico City The Florentine Codex gives information about how feather works were created. The amantecas had two ways of creating their works. One was to secure the feathers in place using agave cord for three-dimensional objects such as fly whisks, fans, bracelets, headgear and other objects. The second and more difficult was a mosaic type technique, which the Spanish also called \\"feather painting.\\" These were done principally on feather shields and cloaks for idols.Russo, p. 25Castello Yturbide, p. 70 Feather mosaics were arrangements of minute fragments of feathers from a wide variety of birds, generally worked on a paper base, made from cotton and paste, then itself backed with amate paper, but bases of other types of paper and directly on amate were done as well.Russo, p. 5Castello Yturbide, p. 202 These works were done in layers with \\"common\\" feathers, dyed feathers and precious feathers. First a model was made with lower quality feathers and the precious feathers found only on the top layer. The adhesive for the feathers in the Mesoamerican period was made from orchid bulbs. The Huipil of La Malinche with feathered thread borders Sometimes feathers were dyed, and sometimes fine lines or dots were painted on the feathers themselves.Castello Yturbide, p. 203 In some of the most precious of Aztec art, feathers were combined with gold and precious stones.Russo, p. 27 Feather art needs to be protected from light, which fades the colors and from insects that eat them. Preservatives were made with several kinds of plants, but today commercial insecticides are used.Castello Yturbide, pp. 202-203 One other way to use feathers was the creation of garments either decorated with feathers or with thread which was created by spinning cotton and feather shreds. The garments of eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Fabric made of the latter was favored by the nobility, both men and women which distinguished them from commoners. Little is known how feathers were incorporated into fabric in the Mesoamerican period.Castello Yturbide, p. 77 The only vestige of this practice is the making of wedding huipils in the town of Zinacantán in Chiapas. Although research has shown this practice is descended from the Mesoamerican one, it is still different. The Mesoamerican feathered cloth was made with thread made of cotton fiber and feathers done on a backstrap loom, which the current wedding huipils incorporate feathers into commercially spun cotton thread.Meneses, p. 88 European discovery of featherwork When the Spanish arrived to Mexico, they were impressed with the bird species of the land and the use of feather, with Hernán Cortés receiving among his gifts feathers from Moctezuma. As early as 1519, Cortés sent feathered shields, head adornments, and fans to Spain. In 1524, Diego de Soto returned to Spain from the New World. Among the gifts for King Charles V was artwork, including that made with feathers, such as shields with scenes of sacrifice, serpents, butterflies, birds and crests. In 1527, Cortés sent thirty eight pieces of what are identified as feather work to Asia.Castello Yturbide, p. 11 After the Conquest, the art of working with feathers survived, but on a lesser scale and its uses changed. pagan ritual use ended with Christian evangelization, with some surviving works conveying Christian religious themes. Featherwork's use in war also remained. One type of feather work to remains strong was the creation of mosaics, many of which were created and sent to Europe, Guatemala and Peru.Castello Yturbide, p. 40 They were even sent as far as Asia as gifts but little is known of this trade.Castello Yturbide, p. 104 Exotic feathers themselves were exported to Europe and used to adorn hats, horses and clothing.Castello Yturbide, p. 40 The importance of feather work and the impression it made on the Spanish is documented by Spaniards such as Hernán Cortés, Francisco de Aguilar, Bartolomé de las Casas, Bernal Díaz del Castillo, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, Francisco López de Gómara, Peter Martyr, Fray Bernardino de Sahagún and Andres de Tapia .Castello Yturbide, p. 12 Feathers add chromatic and luminous feathers difficult to create with paints, although oil painting at the time had well developed techniques to play with light. Mexican expertise was valued as well. Even though there was feather art also made in Asia, it was not as valued in the 16th and 17th century as that from Mexico.Castello Yturbide, p. 103 Featherwork with Christian themes 270x270px Feather work and the conquest led to a creative exchange from the conquest to about 1800.Russo, p. 6 Evangelism added Christian themes to feather work, including the making of ritual items. Amantecas were creating Christian religious images within months after the arrival of the conquistadors, destined for Europe as well as Asia. The first known Christian-inspired pictures in feather work were made for banners, on a cotton cloth with an imprimatur, on which the design was made. They had a backing of very fine palm or rush mats bound with twine or vegetable lianas. The Huejotzingo Codex depicts the making of a feather and gold banner, the first indication of feather work with Christian images.Castello Yturbide, p. 186 At first, feather work was suppressed by the Spanish as part of their efforts to eradicate the old religion. However, they soon changed tactics and employed the feather workers to create Christian images. These new works are called \\"feather mosaics\\" because of the small pieces of feathers used, and most are in the Baroque style then favored, as the artists copied images brought from Spain.Castello Yturbide, p. 21 After the Conquest, hummingbird feathers were used to adorn images of Christ in Michoacan, such as agave yarn sandals in hummingbird feathers made in Tzintzuntzan.Castello Yturbide, p. 145 Indian craftsmen made and offered crosses and candlesticks adorned with green feathers called quezalli.Castello Yturbide, p. 175 Small scale feather images and pendants serving as protective amulets were also made.Russo, p. 17 The 16th century mosaics were made with different sized feathers combined with paper strips. Over the years, the feathers became smaller, the compositions more harmonious and the designs more subtle with the additions of gold leaf, gold foil and colored brushwork. The basic imagery was European but the edging shows traces of pre Hispanic designs.Castello Yturbide, p. 207-208 The iconography of feather art images focused on founders and patron saints, along with figures related to the various religious orders. These always followed the recommendations of the Council of Trent and often to the dominant style.Castello Yturbide, p. 125 Feathered religious items were sent to Europe, including to several popes in Rome. A number of these were re-gifted to other nobles and for this reason can be found in various museums in various parts of Europe.Castello Yturbide, p. 21-22 Feather work became a popular item in the collection of kings, emperors, nobles, clergy, intellectuals and naturalists from the 16th to 18th century, with pieces reaching courts in Prague, Abras Castle, El Escorial and various other cities in Europe. Some even went as far as China, Japan and Mozambique.The Mass of St. Gregory, feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for Diego Huanutzin, nephew and son in law of Moctezuma II to present to Pope Paul III, dated 1539, now in the Musée des Jacobins in Auch, France.In addition to the images, feathers were used to adorn priests' clothing such as chasubles, rain capes and miters. They also made feather decorations for church altars and convents. Feathered miters and other vestments were sent and gifted to European bishops, especially in southern Europe and were used while conducting Mass. Although there are no written records to indicate that this use of feathered vestments were a result of Mexican influence, they did not appear until after the mid 16th century.Castello Yturbide, p. 160 European engravings were used as a model for feather images created for miters which today can be still found in Milan, Florence and New York. However, these and other Christian images were not exact copies of the prints as elements from several prints were combined and even pre Hispanic motifs appeared in some. These miters served as an innovation in the pictoral language of the church as the vestments themselves added a kind of power through their magnificence.Russo, p. 19-20 Monastery schools in Mexico, especially those run by the Franciscans and Augustinians, taught feather work, especially the creation of feather mosaics.Castello Yturbide, p. 152 The skills of these artists remained important initially, even able to reproduce Latin calligraphy. One important example of this is \\"Sacras de Ambras\\" at the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Here, black feathers are pasted over a ribbon of small white feathers. One particularly notable area of colonial feather working was in Patzcauaro, Michoacán. These workers maintained many of the ancient privileges of pre Hispanic feather workers.Castello Yturbide, pp. 147-152 Mesoamerican feather work inspired European works such as the Libro di piume (The Feather Book) by Dionisio Minaggio, the gardener to the governor of Milan, who learned the technique and created reproductions of birds in his regions, as well as portraits of the actors of the Commedia dell'arte.Russo, pp. 5-6 Other artists such as Tommaso Ghisi and Jacopo Ligozzi used the technique as well to create works for the collections of the Medicis, Aldrovandi, Settala and Rudolf II of Prague. Ulisse Aldrovandi described the creation of feather mosaics as a \\"threshold between art and science.\\"Russo, p. 14 Featherwork 1600-1900 The \\"golden age\\" of Mexican feather work lasted until the very beginning of the 17th century, when it declined because the old masters disappeared. At this time, demand for the work declined as well, because the Spanish began to disdain indigenous handcrafts and oil painting became preferred for the production of religious images.Castello Yturbide, p. 22 In the 17th century, imagery done in feather work became more varied, including the Virgin of Guadalupe and those from European mythology, especially on fans for ladies.Castello Yturbide, p. 200Castello Yturbide, p. 128 Techniques changed to include a profusion of paper strips on mosaics, replacing the earlier use of gold trimmings.Castello Yturbide, p. 208 One image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is completely of feathers. While she is clothed in the usual way, the image lacks many of the decorations and symbols that are now standard. This may indicate that this is one of the first copies of the image. Another important 17th century piece depicts the Assumption of Mary, now in the Museum of the Americas in Madrid .Castello Yturbide, p. 130 More modification of the technique occurred in the 18th century, perhaps because it was no longer done only by the indigenous. Feather work was supplemented with the use of oil paint to depict people (especially faces and hands), landscapes and animals and tiny strips of paper were dropped along with the outer borders.Russo, p. 29 By the nineteenth century, the craft all but disappeared with only some limited activity in Michoacán. Many were done with cheap, dyed feathers, smaller works with little artistic value. They, however, still attracted attention from visitors to Mexico. In 1803, Alexander von Humboldt visited Pátzcuaro and both a feather image of Our Lady of Health, which is now in a German museum. Her hands and face are in oil but the rest is in hummingbird feathers. Count Beltrani traveled in Mexico in 1830 and mentioned Michoacan feather work in his journals, obtaining two mosaics. Frances Calderon de la Barca, with of the first Spanish ambassador to Mexico, noted that the mosaics of saints and angels were crude in drawing but exquisite in coloring.Castello Yturbide, p. 209 The nuns at the Santa Rosa Convent in Puebla were noted for their feather work in the 19th century, with several notable works still in existence. In the mid 19th century, lithography was introduced in Mexico and some prints were used as bases for feather work, which were then backed with sheet metal. In Puebla, this was a popular technique for folk figures such as the China Poblana.Castello Yturbide, p. 213 The last innovation in the craft was the use of photographs. One such work used a photograph of Juan Arriaga de Yturbe done by Monico Guzman Alvarez of Patzcuaro, done in 1895.Castello Yturbide, p. 214 Featherwork 1900-2000 By the 20th century, feather work existed as a handcraft, rather than as art. One reason for this was that the disappearance of many bird species has led to a lack of fine feathers.Castello Yturbide, p. 221 In the first half of the century feather work images were almost exclusively of postcards or other informal forms, with images of cockfights or birds made with dyed chicken or turkey feathers. Manuel Gamio tried to revive feather work's artistic nature. In 1920 he designed and supervised the creation of two mural panels, one with an Aztec serpent and the other with a Mayan serpent, copied from archeological pieces. It was done on black silk with quetzal feathers, gold, silver and silk threads. However, the fate of these works is not known. Similarly, garments made with feathers have also almost completely disappeared. The only vestige of this is the wedding huipil made by the Tzotzils in Zinacatlan, Chiapas. However, these have the feathers added to commercially made cotton thread, anchored to it as decoration. Thread spun with feathers is no longer made.Meneses, pp. 25-26 One other notable piece was a reproduction of the \\"Montezuma headdress\\" made for the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. In the latter 20th century, a number of artists tried to bring back the technique as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, she had to stop by the 1990s because of the difficulty of obtaining feathers. Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the Academy of San Carlos with the goal of applying them to feather work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using crepe paper cut outs and colored feathers. However, she, too, no longer works with this technique.Castello Yturbide, p. 222 Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.Castello Yturbide, p. 225 Headdress for the Concheros dance at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City One notable family that continues the technique as a handcraft is the Olay family. This tradition began when Gabriel Olay traveled with a mule train and hunted birds during his wanderings. Then an indigenous person taught him the basics of feather working. He developed his craft then passed it onto his children and grandchildren. Most of the family works on reproductions of pre Hispanic images. Son Gabriel Olay Olay has created a large body of work in the technique and lives in Tlalpujahua, Michoacan. Four of his pieces are part of the collection of the Morelia Cultural Center and others in various museums in the state of Michoacan. His image of the Virgin of Guadalupe was given by Mexican president Luis Echeverría to Pope John XXIII and is part of the Vatican's collection. Grandson Hans Matias Olay specializes in reproducing the birds and flowers that the Nahuas in Guerrero paint on amate paper. In 1990, the National Museum of Anthropology held an exhibit of works by Gabriel Olay Ramos and his sisters Gloria and Esperanza. Olay Ramos lives in Mexico City and mostly uses rooster and hen feathers dyed in different colors. The Olays try to maintain as much of the pre Hispanic technique as possible, avoiding peacock and pheasant feathers as they are not native to Mexico. They use Campeche wax to affix the feathers and amate paper as the backing.Castello Yturbide, pp. 222-223 Other workers with feathers include Juan Carlos Ortiz of Puebla who also creates feather mosaics, Jorge Castillo of Taxco who combines silver and feathers.Castello Yturbide, p. 226 The most common use of feathers in modern Mexico is in the creation of traditional dance costumes. These include the headdresses for dances such as the Quetzales in Puebla and the Concheros performed in various parts of central Mexico. In Oaxaca, there is the Dance of the Feather, which used dyed ostrich feathers and for the Dance of Calala, in Suchiapa, Chiapas, the main dancer uses a fan of turkey and rooster feathers. Ostrich feathers are the most common in traditional dance costumes, followed by rooster, turkey and hen feathers. Despite their bright color, peacock feathers are rarely used. In most cases, the symbolic meaning of the feathers has been forgotten. One notable exception is the Huichols, who have maintained much of their original cosmology.Castello Yturbide, p. 227 Notable featherwork pieces Despite its popularity from in the late Mesoamerican period into the early colonial period, few vestiges with this technique survive into the 21st century.Meneses, p. 11 One reason for this is the care needed to maintain the pieces. It is important to know the characteristics of each type of feather to use and preserve them correctly. The best feathers to use are those that have been molted, as they have less organic materials and less likely to deteriorate. A feather object can last indefinitely if it is preserved in a hermetically sealed case of inert gas, with a fixed humidity, darkness and low temperature. However, this renders the piece unobservable. These objects can be exhibited in galleries, museums and private collections with minimal decay if temperature and humidity are controlled and light kept to a minimum. Perhaps the best known piece is the so-called Montezuma's headdress. Despite its name, research has proven that it was not worn by the Aztec emperor. It was most likely made for an image as it looks like the one for Quetzalcoatl depicted in the Codex Magliabechiano. The original is in the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna. A replica made with authentic techniques was made for the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. Because of the sending of many fine feather mosaics to Europe, a number of important pieces are located in museums and other collections on that continent. The oldest feather piece created by Christian indigenous workers is the Misa de San Gregorio at the Museum of the Jacobins in Auch, France. It was commissioned by Diego de Huanitzin, a converted member of Moctezuma's family and Pedro de Gante. It was probably made by artisans from San Jose de Belen de los Naturales. It is dated 1539 and given as a gift to Pope Paul III by Antonio de Mendoza, according to the inscription, following the papal bull that declared the indigenous to be endowed with reason and able to fully participate in Catholic rites. It is probably the piece never made it to the Pope and its interim fate is unknown. However, it was rediscovered in 1987, when a second-hand clothes dealer took it to auction in Paris.Russo, p. 17Castello Yturbide, pp. 118-119 Another notable work is from the 19th century called San Lucas pintando a la Virgen, located in the Musée de l'Homme in Paris. It is attributed to painter Juan Correa. The clothing is done in feathers but the face and hands were done in oil.Castello Yturbide, p. 138 However, a number of important feather mosaic pieces remain in Mexico. San Pedro is a work from the 16th century, found at the archbishopric of Puebla and shows Roman influence in the style.Castello Yturbide, p. 120 Another piece in Puebla is a portrait of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, who protected the Indians in Puebla.Castello Yturbide, p. 126 La Piedad is from the 17th century at the Franz Mayer Museum. It depicts Mary with Jesus dead on her lap. Another piece in this museum is the Virgen del Rosario, from the 17th century, with the imagery of the Rosary important to counter Islam and Protestantism.Castello Yturbide, p. 135 One important 16th century image is Salvator Mundi at the Museum of Tepotzotlan. It shows influence from Byzantine iconography including Asian features. In the four corners there are Cyrillic characters repeated that have not been deciphered. The inscription FILIUS appears on the right when it should be on the left. No examples of pre Conquest feather fabric survive, and only a few survive from the colonial period.Castello Yturbide, p. 85 Important cloths of this type include two mantles from San Miguel Zinacantepec, the Huipil of La Malinche at the Museum of Anthropology, the Tlamachayatl at the Ethnographic and Historical Museum in Rome and the Paño Novohispano at the Museo Textil de Oaxaca.Meneses, pp. 11-12Castello Yturbide, pp. 88-89Meneses, p. 24 All have feathers or feather pieces either embroidered onto or twisted into cotton. The Paño is a remnant of a huipil with feathers woven into the cloth, and is of a very similar design to the Malinche huipil.Meneses, p. 12-14 Church vestments, especially miters can be found in various collections in Europe including the Vatican. The church of Santa Maria in Vallicella, Rome preserves two 18th century sets of vestments which were gifts from Mexico. These include two miters with a base of flax paper and silk with white feathers glued onto it. Against this background are small pieces of paper sewn on, then with colored feathers glued to these to form floral wreath patterns.Castello Yturbide, p. 98 NotesBibliography  Category:Arts in Mexico Category:Featherwork Category:Mesoamerican art ","title":"Mexican featherwork"},{"id":"41503106","text":"Nicola Mónti or Niccola Monti (August 28, 1780 - 1863) was an Italian painter, active in a neoclassical style, painting mainly historical subjects.

He was an advocate for justice and equality in The Republic of South Africa and served South Africa and several Southern African Development Community countries, in the highest capacity in the fields of law and development. In recognition of his service he was awarded honorary doctorates from five South African universities. Raised within the Afrikaner volk, he became a fierce opponent of apartheid, contributing towards it demise through active lobbying, working towards development for all and the creation of democracy. His working life was characterised by service for the creation of a just and democratic society in South Africa. He believed strongly that all were equal before the law and that development is essential for the creation of a sustainable democracy. He served as a judge in the Cape High Court, was President of the Appeal Court of Lesotho and served on the Courts of Appeal of Botswana and Swaziland. He also headed up the Urban Foundation and the Independent Development Trust (IDT), served on several commissions of enquiry, as Ombudsman for the Long-Term Insurance Industry and on the boards of non-profit organisations such as NICRO, and Communicare as well as companies such as Anglo American and Barclays Bank. Early history and family life Jan Steyn was born in Cape Town to Zerilda (née Minnaar) and Hendrik (HPM) Steyn on 4 March 1928. His mother was a pioneer of social welfare in South Africa, founding the Urban Housing League. His father, HPM Steyn, joined the Boer commandos during the Anglo-Boer War at the age of 13, and thereafter finished schooling when he was 24 years old. He became a gifted scholar in literature and theology at Victoria College, Stellenbosch, and later Princeton. He joined the Dutch Reformed Church ministry from 1917 to 1922. From 1922 to 1955 he was the tireless secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society and due to his extensive work in this regard was also known as \\"Bible Steyn\\". According to one of the key translators of the Bible into Afrikaans, dr J D Kestell, HPM Steyn was the real force behind this translation process. He also facilitated the translation of the Bible into many other languages, including Xhosa, Herero and Tswana.A P Smit \\"God het laat groei - Geskiedenis van die Bybelgenootskapsbeweging in Suider-Afrika 1820-1970\\", Die Bybelgenootskap van Suid-Africa, Cape Town, 1970, pp138-141. Both Jan Steyn's parents were awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Stellenbosch for their work and were dedicated to philanthropy. Jan Steyn attended Jan van Riebeeck High School and graduated from Stellenbosch University with a BA LLB in 1949. He married Audrey Steyn (née Tarleton) in 1951, and they had four children. In 1981 he married Ann Steyn, who later became the president international of Reach to Recovery, an international volunteer breast cancer NGO. Legal career Jan Steyn was admitted to the Cape Bar in 1950, after clerking for the late chief justice Newton Ogilvie Thompson. He was appointed as a Judge of the then Supreme Court of South Africa (Cape Provincial Division) at the young age of 36 in March 1964. He served permanently on the bench until March 1977 when he was called to head the Urban Foundation, resigning from the South African bench in 1981. His approach to the law was described as follows by Jeremy Gauntlett, a senior advocate who served under him as judge of appeal in Lesotho: :\\"His interest in law was not for law’s sake; throughout his life it was for what law could do. He adhered to the aphorism that civilisation in a society is marked by the way it treats its criminals. He abhorred corporal punishment, especially when imposed for transgressions of prison rules. He felt strongly that bail should be fixed with proper regard for an accused’s means, to avoid breadwinners languishing in jail when they could remain in employment. :\\"It was his conviction that as a departure point in sentencing, every effort should be made to keep first offenders out of prison. He was a pioneering advocate of non-custodial sentences rather than short prison sentences, which he considered both damaging and ineffective. He thought the death penalty repugnant, executing his duty to impose it only in the most exceptional cases, and he pressed for its abolition. :\\"... Steyn was concerned that future lawyers should know the social realities outside panelled courtrooms. In his years at the Cape High Court he assiduously took university students to see prisons from the inside. He also saw the need to educate the public, and to help former prisoners make new lives. He played a leading role in setting up the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Reintegration of Offenders.\\" In 1990 he was appointed to the Lesotho Court of Appeal where he served eight years as a member and subsequently 11 years as president. He also served for seven years on the Botswana Court of Appeal and until 2007 as a Judge of Appeal of Swaziland’s highest Court. In Lesotho Steyn presided over many hearings that affected the quality of good governance in the Kingdom. Under his leadership, judgments of the Court of Appeal have spoken against corruption, unacceptable delays in the administration of justice, the constitutionality of the military justice process and the need for the judiciary to serve the public diligently by delivering reasoned judgment expeditiously. When he retired as president of the Court of Appeal of Lesotho in 2008, Steyn was accorded a knighthood by King Letsie III. He chaired several Commissions of Enquiry. These included the Commission on the Remuneration of Political Office Bearers in South Africa, which advised government on the remuneration for all political office bearers including that of the president, the Cabinet and all branches of government, including traditional leaders. Development work Steyn \\"chafed at the confinement of the office [of judge]\\" and therefore left his post as judge for a period, involving himself directly in development work. His work beyond the confines of the law is described below under \\"Public interest bodies and boards of directors\\", but core to this was his involvement in the Urban Foundation and the Independent Development Trust. =Urban Foundation= After the Soweto uprising of 1976 Jan Steyn was instrumental in organising a summit of black urban leaders such as Nthato Motlana and industrialists led by Harry Oppenheimer and Anton Rupert. From this the Urban Foundation was born. Steyn headed up the Urban Foundation from 1977. The Urban Foundation was a non- profit organisation founded and funded by business-leaders who were determined that the country avoid the collision course it was on. It identified initiatives which could facilitate access to housing, quality education and business opportunities for urban black communities. Funding was provided by domestic and international business. In this way the Urban Foundation played a major role in improving the day-to-day lives of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged South Africans. \\\\- press release issued by the FW de Klerk Foundation, 31 December 2013. At the time, black people in South Africa had no claim to land title in \\"white\\" urban areas: \\"their very residence there was on sufferance\\", under section 10 of the Bantu Urban Areas Act. \\"The fiction was that they were mere sojourners, with home and heart in the archipelago of Bantustans, to which (from 1976) 'independence' was being granted.\\" The Urban Foundation successfully lobbied for the abolition of racially discriminatory enactments including the infamous pass laws, influx control and the Group Areas Act and invested large amounts of money in housing, education and associated developments, such as the electrification of Soweto. According to Jeremy Gauntlett, \\"[i]t grieved Steyn to see that a decade later, matric history textbooks claimed that the Urban Foundation and its successor [the IDT] had been an instrument to modernise racial domination.\\" =Independent Development Trust (IDT)= When making his now famous address on 2 February 1990 the then President FW de Klerk, when announcing the release of Nelson Mandela and the lifting of political restrictions, also announced the allocation of R2 billion for development to be administered by the Independent Development Trust (IDT) chaired by Jan Steyn. This initiative was launched after he obtained the unequivocal support of black leadership at the time, especially and including the late former president Nelson Mandela. Steyn insisted that government (which at the time was the National Party government) would have no say as to how the money would be spent. The IDT Board was led by people such as Mamphela Ramphele, Stanley Mokgoba, Harriet Ngubane, Wiseman Nkuhlu and Eric Molobi. It delivered development programmes such as incremental housing, national student loan financing, public works programmes to create jobs, infrastructure for the poor and the building of schools and clinics. In 1996, Steyn handed over the reins to Nkuhlu. Public interest bodies and boards of directors Steyn was also involved in several public interest bodies as chairperson, trustee and/or member, among them the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Re-Integration of Offenders (NICRO), the Legal Resources Centre, the Old Mutual Unclaimed Shares Trust,The trust is explained in this press release: Communicare, the Community Chest of the Western Cape, the Abe Bailey Trust, the National Botanical Institute (now the South African National Biodiversity Institute), and the Media Council. He served on the Board of Directors of Anglo American plc, Barloworld Limited, First National Bank, Metropolitan Life and Vergelegen and founded the Institute of Criminology at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in 1970. Jan Steyn received honorary doctorates from five South African universities, namely UCT, Stellenbosch University, the University of Witwatersrand, the University of Natal and the Medical University of South Africa (MEDUNSA), the latter of which he was chancellor for 10 years. He also served on the Councils of UCT and the University of South Africa. He was an active sportsman. As a young man he was first league rugby referee, and served as President of the Western Province Cricket Club and Rondebosch Golf Club for many years. Link to Nelson Mandela During his time as a judge Steyn regularly visited prisons, including those used to detain political prisoners by the then government interceding with the authorities for improved conditions. It was through such visits to Robben Island that he first met Nelson Mandela. The outcome of one such visit (together with Judges Michael Corbett and Martin (ME) Theron), as well as the head of the prison service, General J C Steyn (unrelated to Judge Steyn), was the removal of the commanding officer (a Colonel Piet Badenhorst) and an immediate improvement in the conditions in which political prisoners were detained. This incident created a bond between Mr Mandela and Steyn. This is likely to have contributed to Steyn being called upon to chair the Commission on the Remuneration of Political Office Bearers in South Africa, as well as other assignments.

It co-existed, without any clear boundaries, with the citizens of the city and with the somewhat later colony of German Palatines. Its residents were Huguenot refugees, under the protection of the Elector of Brandenburg-Prussia. The colony had its own church, town hall, mayor, court and even its own home guard, and spoke French every day in all of them and on its streets.  History  In 1661, France was moving away from the previously practiced religious tolerance of the Huguenots living in the country. The Huguenots, the people of the Calvinist and Reformed Churches, were exposed to increasing persecution. On 22 October 1685, the King of France, Louis XIV, issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, proclaiming the Catholic Church as the state religion of France. The practices of other religions were banned and the Reformed churches were destroyed. = Edict of Potsdam = The Edict of Potsdam On 29 October 1685 (in the Julian Calendar, 8 November 1685 in the Gregorian Calendar),Protestant Prussia did not adopt the Gregorian Calendar until 1700 because it had been created and mandated by Catholics. the Elector of Brandenburg-Prussia, Frederick William, issued the Edict of Potsdam, inviting the French religious refugees to come to the lands and cities of his Electorate and settle. The Edict was secretly brought to France and distributed as a leaflet among the Protestants. The aim of the Brandenburg- Prussian government was to establish as many professionals, entrepreneurs and craftsmen as possible to make an immediate impact on the national economy on the local level. The asylum seekers were offered considerable privileges, such as ten-year exemptions from the taxes, exemptions from military service and financial support for homes and workshops. A total of nine cities, including Magdeburg, were recommended as potential residences. At that time, Magdeburg was the capital of the Electorate's newest province, the Duchy of Magdeburg, which had been Brandenburger since 1680. It would develop, with the help of the Huguenot refugees, into the second largest and richest city, behind only Berlin, in the whole Electorate. Already, in the autumn of 1685, a few assorted families of Huguenots were arriving. The date of the founding of the French colony could be set as 1 December 1685, when the City Commander of Madgeburg, Ernst Gottlieb von Borstel ( 1630-1687 ) received the order from Berlin to make it happen as soon as the preacher Banzelin came with the first French families. The first troop of 50 Huguenots then met on 27 December 1685 in Magdeburg. = The settlement = However, the settlement of the religious refugees in Magdeburg met with considerable resistance from the residents and the local authorities. The city was predominantly Lutheran and the Calvinist newcomers were seen as heretics. The Elector's commands for the facilitation of the settlement, which was to make the houses and abandoned plots available in return for compensation, were ignored. So the Elector’s civil and military authorities of the city had to take over most of the supply functions. Three years later, when the refugees arrived from the Palatinate to establish their own colony in Magdeburg with the same privileges, they were met with a much friendlier reception. But, although they spoke only German, they were still lumped with the French refugees as the \\"Walloons\\". By 1703, the population of French colonists had grown to 1,350 people. However, the economic situation of the French colony turned out to be bad; at least, it was significantly worse than that of the Palatine colony. The proportion of craftsmen to the colonists was relatively low. Because of the circumstances of their flight, the Huguenots had to leave their assets, especially land, behind in France. Many of them were poor. Also, unusual for that time, 34 female heads of households were listed for Magdeburg. They and their families earned their money from sewing with great difficulty, to the annoyance of the long-established craftsmen. As the Elector had hoped, new workshops and factories also began in Magdeburg. Approximately 200 to 250 refugee families worked there. However, it soon became apparent that the large numbers of the goods produced in Magdeburg at that time could not be absorbed with ease by the numerically and economically weak Brandenburg-Prussia. Even exports to other countries were also difficult to achieve, because these countries could also make the same products. Therefore, there were bankruptcies and business closures, each of which endangered the economic livelihood of the workers. = The end = On 8 November 1806 the city and fortress of Madgeburg fell to Napoleon and his Grande Armée \\"Die Zeit von 1880 bis 1899 \\", Magdeburger Chronik, retrieved 22 December 2013. but they were not welcomed with open arms by the French Colony. Its residents even refused to speak to them, especially after the French soldiers tried to loot the city a few days later, on 11 November. In 1808, the City of Magdeburg abolished all the privileges and rights of the French Colony. So, on 18 November 1808, Tollin, Französischen Kolonie, Volume 1, page 385. the Colony was annexed and became, at long last, thoroughly Prussian, especially after the fall of Napoleon and the evacuation of his garrison in the spring of 1814.Until 1815, the church registers of baptismals, marriages and burials were kept in French but, after 1815, they were kept in German (Tollin, Französischen Kolonie, Volume 1, pages 472-473). The services were held in German at the French Colony's churches for the first time on 30 June 1819 (Tollin, Französischen Kolonie, Volume 1, page 466) but the sermons were continued to be preached in French from the pulpit until 1822.

It concerned the Frostating, which covered large parts of Norway, and derives its name from the ancient court at Frostating. The most famous quote from this law is \\"at lögum skal land várt byggja en eigi at ulögum øyða\\" (with law shall our land be built, and not desolated by lawlessness) which also appears in a number of Norse laws, and is inscribed on the illustrated memorial.  History  It was not the oldest law, which are the Heidsævisthinglaw (or Eidsivathinglaw) and the Gulating law. Later came the Borgathinglaw of Olaf II (1015–1028) but the Frostathing law has been much better preserved, the earlier laws only preserving that which pertained to church law.Laurence Marcellus Larson (trans.) The Earliest Norwegian Laws: Being the Gulathing Law and the Frostathing Law. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., 2011 Together with the Bjarkøy law, these are collectively referred to as the provincial laws.Hans Jacob Orning. Unpredictability and Presence: Norwegian Kingship in the High Middle Ages. BRILL, 2008. The version that has come down to us dates from around 1260 in the time of Håkon Håkonsson (1217–1263), who inscribed the first chapter with introductory amendments, although portions of the law are likely to be several hundred years older than that. originally they existed only in oral form at meetings of the Thing. It is first mentioned in the collection of old Norse Sagas by Snorri Sturluson known as the Heimskringla, specifically the Saga of Håkon Håkonsson. Snorri also refers to the later role of Olaf II. In 1280 the Thing more formally adopted the law and Magnus the Good (1035–1047) asked that it be written down. It became known as \\"Grágás\\" (Gray Goose), but was quite distinct from the Icelandic Gray Goose Laws (Grágás). This law was progressively modified over time, one of the more important developments in the evolution of Norwegian law being the work of Magnus VI (1263–1280), for which he was nicknamed 'lawmender'. The Håkon Håkonsson version is also known as the Codex Resenianus, after the historian Peder Hansen Resen who gave the only surviving version to the University of Copenhagen (unfortunately later destroyed in the 1728 fire at the Copenhagen Library). In Norwegian it is found in the Norges gamle Love (I, 121–258) as Den ældre Frostathings-Lov. A modern Nynorsk edition was published in 1994.  Church law  The sections dealing with Church law appear to be derived from an older compilation known as the Gullfjǫðr (Goldfeather) by Archbishop Eystein, who sought to bring Norwegian church law in line with the canon law of Gratian.

As an historical region, the Teltow was one of the eight territories out of which the March of Brandenburg was formed in the 12th and 13th centuries. As a result of the (1239–1245) the question of territorial lordship of the newly created heart of the expanding march was finally decided here. Between 1835 and 1952 there was also a county, ; in addition a town immediately south of Berlin, in the present-day county of Potsdam-Mittelmark, bears the name Teltow. Typical old sand avenue in the Teltow  Geography and geology = Boundary = The natural regional location of the Teltow: the plateau is highlighted by a red border, the wider region by a red dotted line The Teltow is not a unified region, either from a historical or a landscape perspective. The present-day term is defined by an ice age plateau that consists mainly of ground moraine elements. Its natural northern border is defined by the range of the Tempelhofer Berge, among them the Kreuzberg rising to , along the southern bank of the Spree. To the east the borders are formed by the rivers Dahme, as well by the Havel and Nuthe to the west. To the southwest, the countryside around the Pfefferfließ is also counted as part of the Teltow, although it has no clear boundaries. The regional border in the south is unclear, because the ground moraines here were often eroded by urstromtal processes. For example, there are many small island plateaux. The boundary of the cultural landscape is general seen as the Baruth Urstromtal. Further south is the heathland of the Fläming. The Havel river separates the Teltow from the Nauen Plateau to the northwest. The Nuthe- Nieplitz Lowland, an urstromtal feature, separates it from the sander plateau of the Zauche in the southwest and the Berlin Urstromtal forms the boundary with the Barnim Plateau in the northeast. It is, however, disputed whether the Müggelberge hills, which are up to above sea level (NN), in southeast Berlin are part of the Teltow. From a geological standpoint they certainly are, because the hills have a similar development history. However, these upland remnants are completely isolated within the Berlin Urstromtal. If the River Dahme is taken as the eastern boundary of the Teltow the Müggelberge are neither part of the Teltow geologically nor from a cultural landscape perspective. = Geology, geomorphology and soils = Bedrock  One geological feature is the 80 metre-high Sperenberg hill on the northern rim of the Baruth Urstromtal. Uniquely for Brandenburg, the hill is made of gypsum. The rising column of Zechstein-age salt has pushed through all the more recent deposits here to form a salt dome. Because all the readily soluble salts have been leached out, only a solution residue has been left on the surface of the gypsum. Rock salt is only found at a depth of 45 m (about 0 metres above NN). The gypsum hill is also of historic scientific interest, because it was here, in 1867, that the first borehole in the world to reach a depth of 1,000 metres was drilled. The geothermal gradient was found to be about 3 K/100 metres; this was also a first. Sperenberg gypsum was mined from the Middle Ages to 1957 in several quarries. Other salt domes, which do not quite reach the surface, occur under Mittenwalde and the Blankensee lake. For the geological structure of the Teltow, they are of secondary significance, however.  Saale glaciation  While the deeply buried sediments of the Elster Ice Age have virtually no impact on the current appearance of the Teltow, the subsurface, sandy, gravelly sediments of the so-called Berlin Elbe course occur over a wide area. These deposits formed between the Elster and Saalian ice advances, when the Elbe flowed northwards from the location of present-day Torgau and crossed the area of the Fläming which did not yet exist. These sediments are of great economic importance, both as groundwater conduits and for the building materials industry. But they only outcrop at a small sand pit at Lindenberg near Jühnsdorf. The old Elbe strata are overlain by the very thick (40 metres or more) sediments of the Saale ice age. These are usually the depositions of proglacial lakes or glacial till. At several points they even break through the Weichselian deposits and are immediately on, or at least very close to, the earth's surface (for example, in Glienick near Zossen). Because the Saale ice shoved the underlying sediments strongly, Tertiary deposits are found at the surface in places. For example, in Schenkendorf near Königs-Wusterhausen in the second half of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, brown coal was extracted.  Weichsel glaciation and post-glacial development  Geological overview map of the Teltow Today's Teltow plateau in Brandenburg-Berlin was formed around 20,000 years ago during the Brandenburg stage of Weichsel glaciation. The Weichsel ice sheet pushed southwards right over the Teltow before reaching the northern edge of the Baruth Urstromtal, the limit of its expansion to the south. Terminal moraines can be found there, for example, around Dobbrikow in Luckenwalde (Weinberg) and near Sperenberg. However, the line of terminal moraines is very patchy and is traces out an ice front. To the north are ground moraines that have been deposited over a large area. Only south of Ludwigsfelde, does the contiguous ground moraine plateau of the Teltow begin.  Literature  * Theodor Fontane: Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg. Teil 4. Spreeland. Blankensee.

W. Griffith. It was released by the Biograph Company and copyrighted on August 6, 1908. The film introduced the first extended use of parallel editing in Griffith's work. Plot The film begins as Jose, a young Mexican man, leaves his home in the Sierra Madre Mountains in order to make his way in the United States. Before he leaves, his mother presents him with a pair of gauntlets embroidered with a cross, which are intended to be a reminder of her love as well as what she has taught him: \\"to be temperate, honest, and dispassionate; to bear the burden of life's cross with fortitude and patience.\\" The film then moves on a tavern on the border, populated by cowboys, miners and railroad construction employees. Tom Berkeley is the engineer of the construction company, and his fianceé Mildred West has just arrived from New York. Bill Gates, an assistant engineer, secretly loves Mildred, though she rebuffs his unwanted advances. Mildred and Tom's entry in the tavern draws everyone's attention, during which a Chinese servant steals money from a group of cowboys playing poker and plants the cowboy's bandanna at Jose's feet. Jose mistakenly picks it up, thinking it is his own, and exits. The robbery is subsequently discovered and blame is placed on Jose. An angry mob subsequently drags him out to be lynched, despite his pleas of innocence, which Mildred believes. Jose is dragged off to the woods and a rope placed around his neck, and he asks for the chance to say a final prayer. The film then cuts back to Mildred at the hotel, feeling pity for Jose. As she comes out of her hotel room, she suddenly spies the Chinese servant hiding the money he has stolen, revealing that he is the real thief. She snatches the money and runs to the site of the lynching, arriving just as Jose is raised into the air. She causes the mob to drop the rope, and Jose is released uninjured. After she explains what truly happened and returns the money to the cowboy, the mob leaves to chase after the servant, leaving Mildred and Jose alone. As a gesture of his deep gratitude he gives her one of the gauntlets and swears that if she ever needs his help, he will come to her rescue. Time passes by, during which Jose falls into drinking. The railroad contracts have finally been completed, and a party is thrown in honor of Tom Berkeley. Bill Gates attends and continues to make advances on Mildred, now Tom's wife. After he does not give up, she screams and calls Tom to her side, who attacks Bill and ejects him from the party, who swears to get his vengeance. Bill heads to the tavern and finds Jose, drunk, who with another accomplice helps Bill attack Tom's carriage on its way home from the party. They knock Tom out, then abduct Mildred and take her to the tavern. Jose leaves to continue drinking, during which time Mildred unsuccessfully attempts to escape and is blocked by Bill. When Jose returns, he suddenly sees the gauntlet on the floor, which Mildred dropped in her struggle with Bill. Realizing who she is, he attacks Bill and kills him as Tom and his friends burst into the room to save her. Mildred thanks Jose for aiding in her rescue, and Jose resolves to return to his mother in the mountains. The film ends with Jose fulfilling this promise and returning to his loving mother's arms.

It contains a medallion by Matthew Noble, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Matthew Henry (1662–1714) was a Presbyterian minister, preacher and writer, who founded the Presbyterian Chapel in Trinity Street, Chester. In 1858 a public meeting was held, chaired by the Mayor of Chester, to invite subscriptions to a memorial fund in the name of Matthew Henry. This was intended to provide a statue near Chester Castle, to produce a cheap edition of Henry's commentary on the Bible, and to create a scholarship in his name at Oxford University. However, there was a problem because after Henry's death, in about 1750, the Trinity Street Chapel had become Unitarian, and it was decided that the Unitarians should be excluded from taking part in the fund raising. As a consequence, subscriptions came in very slowly, and it was decided that, rather than a statue, the memorial should consist of an obelisk. The obelisk was to be erected in the churchyard of St Bridget's Church, the site being provided free of charge by the rector. The architect was Thomas Harrison, and the sculptor of the bronze portrait medallion was Matthew Noble; both gave their services free. The mason was A. McDonald of Aberdeen, and the total cost came to £267 (equivalent to £ in ). The obelisk was unveiled on 22 August 1860. St Bridget's Church was demolished in 1892, but the obelisk remained in the churchyard until the building of Chester's inner ring road in the 1960s. It was then moved to a roundabout opposite the castle. Description The obelisk is in polished granite and has a height of about . The portrait medallion in bronze is about high, and is signed \\"M.NOBLE SC 1860\\". The obelisk stands on a square base of three sandstone steps. The inscription on the obelisk reads as follows. The statue was designated as a Grade II listed building on 6 August 1998. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\".

After schooling at Ramsgate and Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, he entered Merchant Taylors' School in 1758, and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 1 April 1762.

In 1779 he transferred the patent-medicine part of the business to the northeast corner of St. Paul's Churchyard, leaving the book publishing at the old spot. The firm was subsequently known as Newbery & Harris, for the partner John Harris (1756–1846); in 1865 it became Messrs. Griffiths & Farran.

Born in Ontario, Canada, Marsh developed an early harvester prototype on the family farm in DeKalb County, Illinois, United States. With help from businessman Lewis Steward, Marsh, Steward & Company became an early leader in harvester production. The company later merged with others to form International Harvester. Marsh lived in Sycamore, Illinois from 1873 until his death, serving as a longtime alderman. Biography William Wallace Marsh was born near Trenton, Ontario on April 15, 1835 to Samuel and Tamar Marsh. Samuel Marsh was a Patriote in the Rebellions of 1837, captured and jailed for five months. Samuel became a follower of Millerism and left his family to await the predicted Second Coming. W. W. Marsh moved with his mother to Cobourg when he was eight and attended St. Andrews School. Two years later he enrolled at Victoria College, where he studied for three years. In 1849, after Samuel returned to the family, they decided to move to a farm in Clinton Township, DeKalb County, Illinois near Shabbona Grove. The farm proved difficult for the family to manage. In 1857, William Wallace Marsh began to expierment with grain bundling methods. Marsh discovered he could bind grain while another was being cut if the cutting apparatus could move. His brother, Charles W., joined the effort the next day. For the next few years, the brothers worked together to perfect their harvester. In 1859, the Marsh brothers unveiled the completed product during a reaping contest north of DeKalb. The success of the Marsh's design was owed to the fact that anyone could use the implement—during demonstration, the Marshes had young girls and hoboes operate the machine with ease. The Marsh design was deemed the most effective reaper, and the brothers set to manufacture the product. Woodcut of an early Marsh Brothers harvester Marsh Brothers was founded in 1858. William Marsh was the inventor of the company while his brother Charles handled the financial aspects. Marsh's inventions were responsible for thirty-five approved patents, expanding the company line with products such as corn huskers, wire stretchers, and plows. The first company factory was opened in Plano, where they met prominent settler Lewis Steward, who invested in the company. Oringially capable of producing 100 harvesters in a year, Steward's capital allowed the company to expand to 10,000 per year. The produced their goods essentially unrivaled until 1871. Marsh's house in Sycamore, Illinois Marsh married M. J. Smith on January 8, 1871. Marsh, Steward & Company moved to Sycamore in 1873. Marsh was elected alderman of Sycamore that year, a position he held for decades. Two years later, William Deering purchased the company and moved most of its operations to North Chicago. It merged with the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in 1902 to form International Harvester. Marsh operated the Sycamore division until his retirement in 1906. He died there on May 12, 1918.

He is sometimes numbered \\"Anscar II\\" to distinguish him from his grandfather, Anscar I of Ivrea. Described by Liutprand of Cremona as courageous and impulsive, he died in the battle of Spoleto. Family Anscar was a member of the Anscarid dynasty, a younger son of Margrave Adalbert I of Ivrea by his second wife, Ermengarde of Tuscany, a daughter of Adalbert II of Tuscany by his second wife, Bertha. He was a nephew of King Hugh in two ways. He was married to Willa, daughter of Margrave Boso of Tuscany, Hugh's brother, and thus Hugh's nephew by marriage. His maternal grandmother was also Hugh's mother. According to Valerie Eads, he was born around 915, a date at odds with Margherita Bertolini. There is no reliable record of Anscar fathering any children. He is most likely the father of one Amadeus of Mosezzo. According to the speculations of some, he is the likely father of the counts of Pombia, Amadeus and Dado, which would make him, by the latter, the grandfather of King Arduin of Italy. Count of Pavia Anscar was probably the count of Pavia—the historical capital of Italy—during his father's lifetime. Like the rest of his family, he supported the claim of Rudolf II of Burgundy to the Italian throne in opposition to Berengar I, and supported Rudolf's invasion in 922. A document of 18 August 924, issued at Pavia, Anscar is a \\"beloved follower\\" (dilectus fidelis) of Rudolf and an \\"illustrious count\\" (inluster comes), probably of Pavia itself. This charter was issued to the church of San Giovanni Domnarum di Pavia, which had been ruined by the invading Magyars. On 5 December at Pavia, Anscar and his elder half-brother, Berengar interceded with Rudolf on behalf of Oberto, the viscount of Asti. In this charter Anscar also bears the Latin title comes (count). At the brothers' request, Rudolf granted the old castle of Asti and some other properties there to Oberto. Margrave of Ivrea At his father's death in 929, Anscar acceded to the march of Ivrea. He and his family abandoned Rudolf in favour of Hugh, who allowed Anscar to keep Ivrea. Hugh probably took the initiative in cultivating ties between him and the Anscarids by marrying his niece, Willa, to Anscar around 931. Hugh may even have expanded the territory of Ivrea in 933–34 by adding the area between the Ticino and Adda rivers, taken from the march of Lombardy. In May 933 Anscar purchased the castle of None in the region of Asti, calling himself \\"its margrave\\" (ipsius marchionis). In June 936 he purchased the old castle that had belonged to Oberto from the viscount's son, Guido, then a cleric of the church of Milan. Among his responsibilities as margrave would have been the defence of the region against Magyar incursions from the east and Saracen incursions from the west. It is possible that Anscar took part in Hugh's assembly of bishops and laymen that met at Verona on 12 February 928 to reorganise the dioceses affected by the Magyar invasions. He was certainly present in Pavia, along with the king and his heir, Lothair, on 15 September 935 at a placitum held by the count of the palace Sarlio to recognise the new possessions of the diocese of Parma, including some at Loculo in Tuscany that once belonged to Anscar's grandfather Adalbert. Duke of Spoleto After the death of Duke Theobald I of Spoleto, a nephew (nepos) of the king, on 15 February 936, Hugh removed Anscar from Ivrea in favour of his half-brother and re-posted him to Spoleto. This move, coming at the same time the Hugh removed his brother Boso from the march of Tuscany, may have been spurred by the king's poor relations with Alberic of Rome, whom he accused of conspiring with Boso. By installing his own son, Hubert, in Tuscany and Anscar in Spoleto, Hugh could contain Alberic. A different, but contemporary, interpretation from Bishop Liutprand of Cremona, considers Anscar's transfer a sign of royal disfavour with the Anscarid family, since Anscar would be far removed from his own properties in Spoleto. In 939, Hugh began occupying the former Exarchate of Ravenna, which had been under Roman control. Since the Spoletan dukes were traditionally autonomist, it is not unlikely that this move that brought the domain of royal control closer both to Anscar and to Alberic drove the two into an alliance. Whatever the case, by the spring of 940 Hugh had turned against Anscar. According to Liutprand, he gave money to Sarlio to raise opposition to Anscar. With the support of the widow of the previous duke, Sarlio obtained information and followers in Spoleto. At a date unspecified, Sarlio raised a revolt against Anscar, who left the city of Spoleto to engage him. Outnumbered, his troops were defeated at the battle of Spoleto and Anscar killed while leading them in the second attack. Sarlio was put in charge of the duchy of Spoleto.

Sarlio married the widow of the previous duke, Theobald I, a nephew (nepos) of Hugh's, and obtained information and followers in Spoleto.

Established in 2008, Lionsgate Academy is open to students of all abilities. However, their program is inclusively designed to meet the unique needs of students on the autism spectrum. A second location opened in Shoreview, Minnesota in 2018, to accommodate more families living on the east side of the Twin Cities.  History  Started by Bernadette Groh and Tamara Phillips, with the aim to educate students with autism. The first meetings regarding the school's founding were held in July 2006, which launched the school's first board. Following the creation of the mission regarding impacts on both the lives of teenagers with autism during the high school days, as well as an adult, the founders wanted a name that would reflect to their mission as well as their particular needs. The name Lionsgate Academy originated from the translation of the founders' children's names, Ari, which translated to 'lion' in Hebrew and Arabic. Soon after, an application to the Minneapolis Board of Education was written and completed by July 2007, with acceptance announced in October 2007. With the announcement of the acceptance, word of the school was spread via the Star Tribune and other newspapers. First opening on September 2, 2008, to seventy students in grades 7 up to 10, the school began rapid growth, reaching 151 students by the school year of 2012 to 2013. In 2011, the school saw its first graduating class, which resulted in the formation of the AIM Program, which is a transitions program for students seeking to become more independent in the areas of Independent Living, Employment, and Post Secondary Education. The program AIM serves students from 18 to 21 years of age, and is located off site. For the school's first eight years, it was located at 3420 Nevada Avenue North in Crystal, Minnesota, in a shared building with the local Cornerstone Church. The building, which is now Beacon Academy, was originally Crystal Heights Elementary School, before its purchase by the church, making it particularly suitable for Lionsgate Academy. In November 2015, Lionsgate leased a former office building at 5605 Green Circle Drive in Minnetonka, and moved there starting in the school year of 2016 to 2017. Wellington Wealth Management, Inc. owns the building.  Shoreview location  At the Ribbon Cutting for the school's Green Circle Drive location in November 2016, Lionsgate announced an expansion on the east side of the Twin Cities.

Early life William Gage was the elder son of Sir John Gage and his wife Eleanor St Clere. Three sources give slightly inconsistent indications about when William was born. His age was stated to be 25 years in evidence given about Easter 1473 in connection with a legal dispute relating to the manor of Lullingstone Castle, indicating that he was born in 1447 or 1448. An inquisition post mortem held in November 1486 following the death of Thomas Hoo stated that William was \\"aged 40 or more\\",Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 2nd series, Vol. 1, No. 205 which points to his year of birth being no later than 1446. The Visitation of Northamptonshire 1618-19 states that William was “30 yere old at the deth of his father” (which took place in 1475). Marriage and family In 1472 he married Agnes, daughter of Bartholomew Bolney, who was lord of the manor of Firle, Sussex. William’s will refers to an agreement between the couple at the time of their marriage that Agnes should enjoy various properties including the manor of Heighton St Clere during her life. On 13 June 1472, a settlement of Heighton St Clere and other lands in Sussex was made by John Gage on his son William and Agnes (William’s wife), which indicates that the marriage took place on or close to that day.

Property and Pardon Evidence of how Hedgecourt Manor was managed by William Gage and his forebears has been extensively analysed by the Felbridge & District History Group.The Early History of Hedgecourt Manor and Farm In the autumn of 1483, a rebellion erupted against the rule of Richard III, who had been crowned King on 6 July that year. This insurrection, known as \\"Buckingham’s rebellion\\", lasted for only a few weeks. William Gage was one of the rebels who were pardoned by the King, the relevant document being dated 16 December 1483.East Sussex Record Office: SAS/G 57/308 Inquisitions post mortem that were held after William’s death established that his landed holdings at that time included: * In Sussex: The Manors of Heighton St Clere and Tarring St Clere, 50 acres of land in East Grinstead, 350 acres of land at Worth.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 2nd series, Vol. 1, No. 1160 * In Surrey: The Manors of Burstow, Hedgecourt and Marden, 114 acres at Tandridge and 100 acres at Wolkested (now Godstone) and Horne.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 2nd series, Vol. 2, No. 209 * In Kent: The Manor of Wodelond.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 2nd series, Vol. 2, No. 210 “Woodland alias Week” was a manor in the parish of West Kingsdown.'Parishes: Kingsdown', The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 2 (1797), pp. 475-493.

Death and legacy William made his will two days before he died on 16 February 1496/7 and it was proved at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 24 October 1497. William directed that his body be buried in the Church of the Greyfriars in London next to the tomb of William Chambleyn. He stipulated bequests to St Michael’s church, Burstow; Greyfriars church; the church and priory of St Elyne, London (presumably St Helen’s Bishopsgate) and to a number of named individuals, with the residue of his chattels to go to his wife Agnes. William's will directed that Agnes should have \\"the custodye, guyding and rule\\" of their son John during his minority. However, in 1499 Robert Tate, an alderman of London, acquired the young man's wardship and the associated control of lands in Buckinghamshire, Sussex, Kent and Gloucestershire.

As a young child, Cepeda herself lived in the Dominican Republic before returning to New York in 1981. There, in the Inwood/Washington Heights section of Upper Manhattan, she resided with her father, who was abusive, and her Scandinavian stepmother. Cepeda's relationship with her mother was essentially nonexistent after 1981. As a student, Cepeda frequently found herself at odds with the authority figures at the schools she attended. This contentiousness stemmed from Cepeda's belief that the system mis-educated students about American history and their own respective ethnic histories as well. Like many other young and disenfranchised people, Cepeda found community in 1980s hip-hop culture. It was hip-hop, she says, that fueled her passion for exploring the issues of race, identity, and social justice through journalism, writing, and filmmaking. Career During the past 20 years, Cepeda has written about music, culture, fitness, politics, race and identity for such publications as People,\\"The Next Great Wonder?\\" People, July 25, 2005, http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20143911,00.html Time Out New York,\\"HILL FIRE: After killing everyone softly with her song, the Fugees' Lauryn Hill goes solo,\\" Time Out New York, June 4–11, 1998 The Village Voice,\\"The N-Word is Flourishing Among Generation Hip-Hop Latinos,\\" Village Voice, Oct. 22, 2008, http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-10-22/music/the-n-word- is-flourishing-among-generation-hip-hop-latinos/ CNN.com,\\"Commentary: 'But what's a Latino?'\\" CNN.com, October 22, 2009, http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/10/22/cepeda.latino.census/index.html The New York Times,\\"My Caribbean: 5 Vignettes,\\" New York Times, November 7, 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/my-caribbean-5-vignettes.html and many other outlets.

Featuring the American rappers Raekwon and Paul Wall and the Puerto Rican rapper and reggaeton star Tego Calderon, the film was described by Catherine Clyne in Satya magazine as \\"a unique documentary that draws together American hip-hop, its trappings of glittery bling-worship and the recent civil war in Sierra Leone, which was fueled by diamonds mined under brutal conditions.\\"Clyne, Catherine, \\"Where the bling comes from,\\" Satya magazine, June/July 2007, http://www.satyamag.com/jun07/cepeda.html A shorter version of the film, edited for content and time, aired on VH1 in February 2007 under the title Bling'd: Blood, Diamonds and Hip-Hop. Cepeda's autobiography, \\"Bird of Paradise: How I Became Latina,\\" was published by Atria Books in March 2013. In a review for NBC Latino, Claudio Remeseira suggested that readers should see the book as \\"the non-fiction, female-gender companion to Junot Díaz's 'The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao'. Both are tales of self-discovery through the many racial, ethnic, and linguistic conflicting forces that lie at the heart of U.S. Latino identity, as well as the story of a personal struggle against a supposed fukú or ancestral curse that has haunted the author's families for generations.\\"Remeseira, Claudio I., \\"Latinas and the African presence in the Caribbean – 3 fascinating reads,\\" nbclatino.com, August 5, 2013, http://nbclatino.com/2013/08/05/latinas-and- the-african-presence-in-the-caribbean-3-fascinating-reads/ The Huffington Post's Dr. David J.

Vacancy Sir Gilbert Parker had been Conservative MP for the seat of Gravesend since the 1900 general elections. In 1918, Parker resigned his seat. Electoral history Parker had encountered few problems in holding the seat for the Conservatives, even in the Liberal landslide year of 1906. At the previous general election in 1910, Parker had a comfortable majority. Candidates Alexander Richardson was chosen to defend the seat for both the Unionist Party and the Coalition Government. He was a 54 year old engineering journalist and editor.‘RICHARDSON, Sir Alexander’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 22 May 2017 He was standing for parliament for the first time. Due to the war- time electoral truce, he faced no opposition from either the Liberal Party or the Labour Patty. He faced two opponents, Alderman Henry Edward Davis running as an Independent Unionist and Harry Hinkley running as an Independent Labour candidate. Alderman Davis also supported the Coalition Government. Campaign Polling Day was fixed for 7 June 1918. Result The Unionists held the seat with a reduced share of the vote.

George Oliver Life He was eldest son of Samuel Oliver, rector of Lambley, Nottinghamshire, by Elizabeth, daughter of George Whitehead, of Blyth Spital in the same county. He was born at Papplewick, Nottinghamshire, on 5 November 1782, and, after receiving a liberal education at Nottingham, he became in 1803 second master of Caistor grammar school. Six years afterwards he was appointed to the headmastership of Grimsby grammar school. Oliver was ordained deacon in 1813, and priest in 1814; and in July 1815 Bishop George Pretyman Tomline collated him to the living of Clee, when his name was placed on the hoards of Trinity College, Cambridge, by Dr Bayley, subdean of Lincoln and examining chaplain to the bishop, as a ten-year man. In 1831 Bishop John Kaye gave him the rectory of Scopwick, Lincolnshire, which he held till his death. A Lambeth degree of D.D. was conferred on him 25 July 1835. From 1834 to 1846 Oliver was perpetual curate of St Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton. He was also domestic chaplain to Lord Kensington. He had been appointed Deputy Provincial Grand Master of Lincolnshire in 1832, and in 1840 he was appointed an honorary member of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, with the rank of deputy grand master.Masonic Dictionary Entry on Oliver from Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, accessed 30 December 2013 In 1846 Lord Lyndhurst, the Lord Chancellor, conferred on Oliver the rectory of South Hyckham, Lincolnshire, in return for vacating the curacy of Wolverhampton. In 1854 his voice began to fail, and, confiding the charge of his parishes to curates, he passed the remainder of his life in seclusion at Lincoln.

It is composed of 17 distinct branches stemming all the way from Mims to Micco, with the central administrative and largest of these libraries being the Catherine Schweinsberg Rood Central Library in Cocoa, Florida. It is governed by a board of trustees appointed and funded by the Brevard County Board of Commissioners. Its missions statement is \\"Brevard County Libraries enables people of all ages to improve their quality of life by providing information and enrichment through traditional resources and new technology.\\" Its vision statement is \\"We will be recognized as a Library System that excels in providing efficient, modern, accessible and customer oriented services.\\"  History  The first library in Brevard County was founded in 1895 in Cocoa, FL. One room was rented for five dollars a month, and women in the community would take turns volunteering to run it. The books and supplies were donated by local citizens. By 1959, four other libraries were established in the county, and Florida Statute 150 gave funding to these libraries in agreement that they would serve all residents. With the Space Program boom in the 1960s, Brevard County's population grew, and the five libraries were expanded to nine. By November 1972, it was necessary for voters to approve a tax referendum that would establish a Library Tax District to fund the growing library system's budget. Currently, there are seventeen libraries within the Brevard County Library System. In 1989, the Central Brevard Library moved to a building contributed by Florida Today. It was the first library in the county to discard the print card catalog and move to an electronic card catalog. In 2017, the Central Brevard Library, in Cocoa, FL, was renamed the Catherine Schweinsberg Rood Central Library, in honor of Catherine Schweinsberg Rood. Rood was a former county library director with a 32-year career in the Brevard County Library System, who dedicated her life to improving the community libraries. She passed away in September 2016.  Programs and Services  Each library has meeting rooms which are available for library programming, and community meetings. These rooms are vital to the community, as they offer space for free programs for all patrons. Youth programs are an important part of each library and a variety of programs are offered, including summer reading programs, story hour programs, toddler times and bedtime story programs. Each library branch has a different set of programs for children ages infant to young adult. Talking Books/Homebound Services provides library materials to residents with visual and physical impairments and to those with limitations associated with age. A special collection of Talking Books is provided by the National Library for the Blind to serve the visually impaired and physically disabled population. Homebound patrons are served by a mail service which provides standard library materials to patrons through a mail order catalog.Brevard County Library Systems Operation Manual DVDs and Blu-ray discs are also popular items available for loan. Downloadable audio books and ebooks are available through Brevard County Libraries in a program called OverDrive with online instructions and selections for compatible audio and eBook devices. Books are now also offered in a MP3 format as well, compatible only on MP3 enabled devices. In a more modern effort to reach patrons, some libraries in Brevard have created Instagram accounts, including the Eau Gallie Public Library, the Titusville Public Library, and the Satellite Beach Public Library. These social media accounts market library programs online, reaching younger patrons especially. In addition, the official website for the county system includes an extensive array of free online resources for patron use. This includes access to investment research databases such as Morningstar, digital microfilms of the Florida Today newspaper, and access to the complete language learning software, Rosetta Stone.  Genealogy Collections  Three of the seventeen library branches within the Brevard County Public Library System have special genealogy collections available to the public for use within the library during regular hours. The Central Brevard Library in Cocoa, FL has the largest collection, staffed full-time and employing a certified genealogist.

Many of the other test subjects had stopped training after leaving university. Lash, however, had continued, and at age 49 was still running an average of 45 minutes a day.

The state security forces responded, killing around 54 of the attackers. An additional 47 of Mukungubila's supporters were killed in separate clashes in the cities of Lubumbashi and Kolwezi and around 100 people were arrested.  Attacks  Attacks by men armed with knives were made against the state broadcaster's studios, N'Djili International Airport and the Colonel Tshatshi Military Camp from around 7.00am local time. Religious leader and former presidential candidate Paul Joseph Mukungubila claimed responsibility for the violence. An army colonel was killed during fighting at the military base but the information minister, Lambert Mende, claimed the government would preserve order \\"at any price\\" and stated that there was no chance of the attackers \\"maintain[ing] their positions, even for a single hour\\". Mende stated that 54 of the attackers had been killed. A Congolese civilian working for the United Nations' MONUSCO programme was injured by gunfire at the airport. Mukungubila's men had forced two of the broadcaster's staff members to read a political statement critical of President Joseph Kabila on television. The statement said that \\"Gideon Mukungubila has come to free you from the slavery of the Rwandan\\", an apparent reference to the installation of Kabila's father as president by Rwandan-backed troops in a 1996-1997 rebellion. The government was able to shut down the broadcasts.  Aftermath  Mukungubila denied he was launching a coup and stated the violence was in response to government harassment of his followers. In response to the attacks police and military checkpoints were set up throughout Kinshasa. A separate exchange of fire between security forces and gunmen in Lubumbashi in Katanga Province was initially said to be sparked by a disarmament programme and not related to the attacks in Kinshasa. However, later sources stated that the Lubumbashi engagement occurred when security forces assaulted a church linked to Mukungubila, killing 45 people. A number of arrests were made in Lubumbashi. One further person died in a related incident in Kolwezi. Mai Mai rebels also seized the airport in Kindu, Maniema Province prior to being driven back by UN and government forces on the same day but it is not known if this was related to the events in Kinshasa.

Magdi Youssef (born 22 July 1936 ) is an Egyptian professor of comparative literature and culture studies. He has taught at various universities in Europe and Egypt until his retirement.Cf. Franca Sinopoli’s editorial note in her book “European Literature, seen by others” which mentions: “Magdi Youssef insegna Letteratura comparata all’ Università de Il Cairo (Egitto)” (Franca Sinopoli (ed.), La letteratura europea vista dagli altri, Roma (Meltemi) 2003, p.67). Al-Ahram (according to the Middle East Institute the equivalent of the New York Times in the Arab World) called Youssef “the renowned culture critic.”Mahmoud El-Wardani, “At A Glance” (book reviews), in: al Ahram Weekly, Issue No.538, June 14–20, 2001, culture page. - Also accessible in the online edition. He is widely noted in the Arab world for his analytic interventions that focus on cultural alienation and unequal exchange in the sphere of culture.Mahmoud El-Wardani, “At A Glance”, ibidem. His book Critical Battles received wide attention.In the Al Ahram Weekly article “Battle of the mind,” Assem El-Dessouqi writes that “real problems begin when a writer automatically discards criticism on the grounds that the critic is merely out to slander him, instead of offering corrections or enhancing readers' knowledge of the subject at hand. […] What a relief, then, to come across Magdi Youssef, a writer who knows that the true value of criticism lies in its capacity to promote original thought and to raise literacy standards. Moreover, having an extensive sociological background and, thus, a thorough familiarity with the jargon, Youssef is alert to misappropriations of sociological terms. As a result, in his new book Critical Battles, Youssef is well placed to address many of criticism's central concerns.” (Assem El-Dessouqi, “Battles of the mind,” in: Al Ahram Weekly, Issue 630, 20–26 March 20–26, 2003. Culture page. – Also online. ) Youssef has contributed to the proceedings of comparative literature congresses in Latin America, Asia, Europe and the US., and to such journals as Al-Hilal, the International Journal of Middle East Studies (Cambridge Univ. Press) and Theatre Research International (Oxford Univ. Press). He is also the founding president of the International Association of Intercultural Studies (IAIS) and still actively involved in theoretical debates related to intercultural relations and comparative literature.Cf.

Youssef is a member of the Association pour l'avancement des études islamiques, Collège de France (Paris).See for instance his “Intervention sur la méthodologie de la recherche,” in: Discours, écriture et société dans le Monde Islamique Contemporain, Actes du Colloque de l’Association pour l’Avancement des Études Islamiques, Collège de France, Paris, 1982, pp.70-71, that he contributed as an active member of the association. He is also listed as a member of the International Sociological Association (ISA), L'Association Internationale des Sociologues de Langue Francaise, the International Brecht Society, based in the USA, the Egyptian Association of Plastic Art Critics and the International Comparative Literature Association (ICLA).See the Egyptian Who is Who, the Who is Who in the Middle East, and the International Who is Who in Asian Studies (H.K.). Magdi Youssef adheres to the Egyptian writers' union and the German Schriftstellerverband.See the biographical note in: Intercultural Studies http://www.intercultural-studies.org/biography/biography.shtml. Outside academe, Youssef was widely noted as a critic of contemporary developments and a culture critic by such daily newspapers and weeklies as The Irish Times, Al- Masry Al-Youm, Al Qahira, Al-Ahram Daily, Al-Ahram Hebdo, Al-Ahram Weekly, as well as other media in the Arab World, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, and the US.The Irish Times mentioned Youssef, for instance, as the leading figure of the writers and artists who protested in 1991 against the impending Gulf War. The Irish Times gave the following list: “Professor Dr Magdi Youssef (Egyptian writer on sabbatical in Dublin), Gabriel Rosenstock (writer), Nuala Ní Dhomnaill (poet), Hugh Maxton (poet), Brendan Kennelly (poet), Robert Ballag (artist), Jennifer Johnston (writer), Kader Asmal (lecturer), Aodh O'Chanain (writer in Irish).” See: “Open Letter to Mr. Bush: No to War / An appeal by writers and artists as the UN deadline looms,” in: The Irish Times, Jan. 15, 1991, p.5. – The reference, in the open letter, to the Arab philosopher and poet Abul-Alaa who, by relying on reason, convinced a commander-in-chief not to destroy his native place called “al-Maara,” suggests that Youssef took the initiative of writing this open letter and asking other writers and artists to join in signing it. The play \\"Draussen vor der Tür\\" (Outside the Door\\" mentioned in the petition, that was written by the German author Wolfgang Borchert in the aftermath of World War 2, and became an icon of anti-war literature, had been translated from German into Arabic by Youssef when he was in his early twenties and performed since by youth companies in four Arab countries, among which the Lebanon in 1994 while being projected on the Lebanese civil war of the time. Background and academic formation Magdi Youssef is a native of Cairo. After completing his social scientific studies at Ain Shams University in Cairo and pursuing advanced studies in Germany, he acquired in October 1975 the degree of Dr. rer. soc. from the Faculty of Social Sciences of Bochum University (recognized by the Supreme Council of Universities of Egypt as the equivalent of a Ph.D.). From 1963 till 1971, he collaborated with the German ‘orientalist’ Annemarie Schimmel, translating literary and philosophical texts and contributing to the periodical Fikrun wa Fann (Thought and Art). In her book Morgenland und Abendland: Mein west-östliches Leben [Orient and Occident: My West-Eastern Life], Prof. Annemarie Schimmel, remembers walking through a quarter of Cairo with her old collaborator Magdi Youssef, the “früheren Hauptübersetzer für Fikrun wa Fann” (main translator for Fikrun wa Fann ), a journal that she edited. (Annemarie Schimmel, Morgenland und Abendland: Mein west-östliches Leben. Munich (C.H.Beck Verlag) 4th ed. 2003, pp.221f. He has two children. Academic career Youssef taught at German universities since 1965. After intensive debates with conventional Orientalists, he established and taught the hitherto contested subject of Modern and Contemporary Arabic Literature and Culture at Cologne University. Modern and Contemporary Arabic Literature had been widely ignored in German academe (which specialized in Classical Arabic and the Islamic Legacy). Youssef continued to teach this subject at Cologne University until 1971. From October 1971-76, Youssef taught Modern Arabic Literature and Culture at the Department of Philology at Bochum University. Since then he has lectured on the Interactions between the Arab and Western Socio-Cultural Formations in Modern Times, at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Bochum University, at post-graduate level.See the announcement of Youssef's lectures and seminars in the printed Vorlesungsverzeichnisse (teaching programs of Cologne and Bochum Universities of that period. From 1979-81, Youssef continued to commute between Bochum and Tanta, teaching Methodology of Research at the Department of Sociology and the Department of Philosophy at Tanta University (Egypt).Cf. an editorial note appended to an article contributed by Youssef that appeared in: General problems of literary history. / Problèmes généraux de l'histoire littéraire. (Proceedings of the Xth Congress of the International Comparative Literature Association Congress), edited by Douwe Wessel Fokkema; Edward C Smith (ICLA), New York (Garland Pub.) 1985. He was Professor of Methodology of Research at the Academy of Arts in Cairo from 1983-84.Cf. Asian journal of economics and social studies: Volume 9, Jan. 1, 1990 (ed. by Prof. R.L. Goel on behalf of the Society for Asian Development, Delhi, India), p.88. Until his retirement, Magdi Youssef was Professor of Comparative Literature and Drama Studies at the Faculty of Arts at Cairo University (from the mid-1980s-2005).See the state- sponsored Who is Who in Egypt, 1989, first edition, p. 278; see also: Mme. Sosostris, “Pack of Cards,” in: Al-Ahram Weekly, Issue No.511, 7–13 December 2000, culture page. From 1988-91 he was simultaneously a visiting Professor of Methodology of Research at the Faculty of Mass Communication at the same university.See the state-sponsored Who is Who in Egypt, 1989, first edition, p.278. Youssef has also been a visiting Professor at Trinity College Dublin.Cf. Mme. Sosostris, ibidem. And he taught at Bonn University in the context of Gastprofessur.See the catalog of Bonn University which lists his Hauptseminar “Arabische Verflechtungen in der Moderne” in 2009. More recently, he has been offered a research fellowship at the Free University of Berlin (in 2014 and 2015). A culture critic focused on intercultural studies In 1976 Youssef published a study on “Brecht in Egypt” that reveals his main methodological focus. In this study which elucidated the influence of spontaneous actor-public interaction in popular As Samir performances on advanced, Egyptified stagings of Brecht's plays, he already emphasized the active rather than passive aspect of reception as a socio-culturally ‘situated’ process that typically occurs in a context of specific interests, needs, etc.M. Youssef, Brecht in Aegypten: Versuch einer literatursoziologischen Deutung, Bochum (Brockmeyer Universitaetsverlag) 1976. [Brecht's Theatre in Egypt: A Socio-literary Interpretation.]. The value of this study was noted by Prof. Stéphane Santerres-Sarkany.Santerres-Sarkany writes: “En Egipto esta clase de teatro tiene un gran pasado. El teatro ‘As Samir’ hacía la parodia, sin duda, de la gente de las localidades de provincias, con motivo de las bodas, a las que se invitaba a los actores para entretener a los demás, pero que no dejaba, además, de denunciar los problemas políticos del momento. Este teatro egipcio utiliza una multitud de lenguajes simbólicos, y lleva al espectador a un movimiento común, global, de la dinámica de la representación, lo que lo hace un participante activo –como recordó juiciosamente Magdi Youssef.” (Stéphane Santerrers-Sarkany, Teoría de la Literatura. México, D.F. (Publicaciones Cruz O., S.A.) 1992, p. 80. - ) Other scholars saw the study as very valuable, too, notably Martin Franzbach.Franzbach, Martin (1976), Review of M. Youssef’s Brecht in Aegypten, in: Germanistik, Internationales Referatenorgan mit bibliographischen Hinweisen, 17. Jahrgang 1976, Heft 3, p. 843. The book was also praised by the Brecht scholar Reinhold Grimm. Grimm wrote that \\"Youssef's approach is highly enlightening, and in fact, exemplary for any future investigation of Brecht's influence in the Third World.\\"Reinhold Grimm, “Brecht. A Polemical Assessment”, in: Monatshefte, vol. 69, No.3, 1977, p.346. Recognizing the relevance of Youssef's approach to modern theater, the Goethe Institute in Tunis invited Youssef in 1972 to deliver lectures about Brecht's theatre in the Arab World. At the time, his Arabic translation of Brecht's play \\"Der Jasager und der Neinsager\\" was performed in the Tunisian province Al-Kaf; it was directed by Monsef Al-Souissi. Due to Youssef’s continuous focus on the theater as an effective medium of socio-cultural interaction, he was invited to address the Colloquium organized in the context of the international theater festival in Carthage, Tunisia, in 1995. On this occasion, he was also a member of the jury of the Festival International de Carthage.In that year [1995], the Daniel Sorano National Theatre production of a play by the late Congolese dramatist Sony Labou Tansi, Le Coup de vieux (Sudden Aging) – an on- stage production that “represent[ed] Sénégal” at the 1995 Carthage Theatre Festival” had been “awarded First Prize” by the jury. See the article entitled “SÉNÉGAL,” in: Don Rubin, Ousmane Diakhaté and Hansel Ndumbe Eyoh (eds.), World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Africa. Abingdon UK and New York NY (Routledge) © 1997; 2001, pp.243 .- . For many years, Youssef has been engaged in testing his methodological approach, re-formulating it where necessary. Intercultural studies and comparative literature research have never been a purely literary concern for him. He situated both in social and political contexts. As Peter Horwath mentions, it was enlightening that Youssef critically discussed “[e]conomic and cultural contacts between Arab and European nations during the modern era” (p. 129) at the XVth Triennial Congress of the Fédération Internationale des Langues et littératures modernes.Proceedings of the XVth Triennial Congress of the Fédération Internationale des Langues et littératures modernes, Tempe, AZ (Arizona State University) 1983, p.129. That he saw the link between economics and culture was not accidental. An editorial commentary in the Proceedings of the Tenth Congress of the ICLA (published in 1985) asserted that “references to neo- Marxist explanations and ideological analysis” could be found in the paper that Youssef presented at this Congress.“[…] Several papers have taken up this suggestion, but very few answers were found to the question how to describe literary communication. Among the papers of our section we find the phenomenological approach (Lois Oppenheim), references to neo-Marxist explanations and ideological analysis in papers by M.-Pierette Malcuzynski, Livia Wittmann, and Magdi Youssef; semiotics of culture in a paper submitted by Jurij M.Lotman […]” (See: General problems of literary history. / Problèmes généraux de l'histoire littéraire. (Proceedings of the Xth Congress of the International Comparative Literature Association Congress), edited by Douwe Wessel Fokkema; Edward C Smith (ICLA), New York 1985) Whether this label suggested by either D. W. Fokkema or E. C. Smith or both is appropriate, is subject to further debate.Douwe Fokkema is above all a sinologist. His Ph.D. thesis on “Literary Doctrine in China and Soviet Influence 1956-1960” was published in 1965. Other, more careful commentators defined Youssef as a sharp critic of “Eurocentrism” (respectively “West[ern]-Centrism”).See for instance: Armando Gnisci, Una storia diversa. Roma (Meltemi) 2001. Youssef described himself as “a theorist of intercultural studies” who is mainly interested in analyzing the interaction between “modern and contemporary Arab vs Western socio-cultural formations. […] His publications […] deal with the study of the mechanisms of socio-cultural relations between different societal formations.”This information was provided by Google search, searching for “Magdi Youssef AND LinkedIn”. See: http://de.linkedin.com/pub/magdi- youssef/13/277/740. Here several persons named “Magdi Youssed” are listed but only one “Prof. Dr” with the added information “professor emeritus, Cairo University” and “visiting professor: the University of Dublin, Bonn Univer[s]ity etc.” In the late 1990s, a critical study entitled “The Myth of European Literature” caught the attention of such scholars as Franca Sinopoli, Armando Gnisci and Peter Caravetta. Caravetta noted especially Youssef’s epistemological critique of Edward Said: Because of Said’s indebtedness to Auerbach and Curtius, Youssef found his critique of orientalism ambivalent.“Magdi Youssef trova la critica orientalistica di Said “ambivalente”, perché vi riscontra delle involuzioni epistemologiche … (Peter Caravetta: Del postmoderno.Milano (Studi Bompiani / RCS Libri S.p.A.) 2010, p.291. ) According to Caravetta, Youssef critiqued the fact that Edward Said, very much like Auerbach and Curtius, could not help but comprehend ‘realism’ as an ‘intra-literary’ phenomenon. Youssef held that literature, in so far as it is a human product, and in so far as it works or functions in an interactive way, is a process which takes place inside society, however.[In Italian:] “Youssef mette in rilievo come l’“idea” di letteratura di Auerbach e di Curtius, che avrebbero avuta una sottile influenza su Said, sia basata sul presupposto che la letteratura e la realtà siano due dimensioni separate, e che il “realismo” sia meramente un fenomeno “intraletterario” […]. Per Youssef, invece, “la letteratura in quanto prodotto umano è innazitutto interattiva, è un processo che ha luogo all’interno della società e in quanto interattivo può essere al servizio delle relazioni sociali dominanti, reiterandone le illusioni e le ideologie di stabilità assoluta o essendo funzionale a esse, oppure è veramente critica verso tali omnipresenti illusioni e delusioni dominanti.”[...]” (Peter Caravetta, ibidem, p.291.) Armando Gnisci saw in Youssef’s Myth of European Literature an important theoretical contribution to a “poetics of decolonization” that challenges dominant Western literary concepts of literature and the Western literary canon.Gnisci refers to a discourse focused on a poetics of decolonization (“il discorso di una poetica della decolonizzazione”), adding, “Lo stesso discorso mi ha portato all'incontro colloquiale con l'egiziano Magdi Youssef, il cubano R. F. Retamar, il coreano Cho Dong Il, la cinese Yue Dayiun, il camerunese Paul Dakeyo, l'haitiano Louis-Philippe Dalembert, il brasiliano Julio Cesar Monteiro Martins, il serbo Predrag Stanojevic e tanti altri “amici” dei vari mondi.” (Armando Gnisci Una storia diversa Roma (Meltemi) 2001, p. 47). - See also the first lines of Gnisci's article “Letteratura Globale e Letteratura dei Mondi,” in: Franca Sinopoli (ed.), La letteratura europea vista dagli altri, Roma (Meltemi Editore).2003, p. 107). – Gnisci's Una storia diversa and a book by Franca Sinopoli were also translated into Arabic. See the programme of the 30th International Cairo Book Fair that lists the “[p]resentation of the Arabic translation of the books European Literature in the View of the Others by Franca Sinopoli & A Different History by Armando Gnisci – in the presence of the authors with Magdi Youssef & Fawzi Issa.” See: Al Ahram Weekly, issue no. 830, Feb. 1-7, 2007, culture page. http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/830/cu11.htm. Youssef's reflections on Arab Comparative and General Literature were widely noted and they were accorded a considerable reception, as they appeared in English, in Italian, and in Irish.See: Magdi Youssef, “Arab Comparative and General Literature: A Socio- Cultural Perspective,” in: Leerssen, Joep; Syndram, K.-U. (eds.), Europa Provincia Mundi, Amsterdam-Atlanta (Rodopi) 1992, pp. 105-117; Italian version: “Il Contributo Arabo alla Letteratura Generale e Comparata,” in: I Quaderni di Gaia (Revista di Letteratura Comparata), Roma, April 1994, pp.87-95; abridged Irish translation in: Cohmar (Dublin), September 1994, pp.21-23. Likewise, a summary of his research and his methodological considerations with regard to “Literary and Social Transformations” (pertaining to the relationship of European and Arabic Literatures) were noted also outside the English-speaking world.See: Magdi Youssef, “Literary and Social Transformations: The Case of Modern European and Arabic Literatures,” in: Proceedings of the Xth congress of the International Comparative Literature Association, edited by Anna Balakian and James J. Wilhelm. New York (Garland Publishing) 1985, pp.51-7; Portuguese translation: “Transformações literarias e sociais: o caso das literaturas europeias e arabe,” in: Revista de Estudos academicos UNIBERO (Sao Paulo, Brazil) 2000. And so was his analysis concerning the (lacking) balance of translation from Western into Non-Western languages and conversely, from languages rooted in the so-called Third World into English and other main languages of the Northern hemisphere.See the Brazilian version: M. Youssef, “Balança de traduções e dominaçao linguistica (The balance of translations and linguistic domination). Traduçao direta do arabe para Jubran, S.A.A.C e Jarouche, M., in: Cadernos de Literatura em Tradução (São Paulo, Humanitas) 3/1999, p35-41. Intervention in the Arab, Egyptian, and international debate about globalization and cultural hegemonism In 2001, the critic Mahmoud El-Wardani called Youssef’s new book “From Sociocultural Interference to Cross-cultural Interaction” [M. Youssef, Min Al-Tadakhul ila Al-Tafa'ul Al-Hadari. Al-Hilal Book, Dar Al- Hilal, 2001] a “valuable book” that “deals with the challenges globalization posits for Third World countries. The main concern of the book is how people of the Third World could be not merely consumers of knowledge but also producers. It is divided into three sections; the first dealing with theoretical approaches to the dialectics of the self and the other in the present time, the second attempts an application of the theory elaborated in the first section on selected works of literature and art. The final section engages in critical debates with a number of well-known figures in Arab culture.”Mahmoud El-Wardani referred to Youssef as “the renowned culture critic.” See: Mahmoud El-Wardani, “At A Glance” (book reviews), in: al Ahram Weekly, Issue No.538, June 14–20, 2001, culture page (also accessible online). As an article in Al-Ahram Weekly notes, “Youssef describes his life's work as a single, protracted attempt at establishing, in the Western academic mentality, the existence of a contemporary Arab culture -- in the widest sense of the word. And it is on the vitality, creativity and \\"objective difference\\" of such a culture, he insists, that every successful step on the way to demystifying Orientalist preconceptions about the Arab world has depended.”N.N., “No one listened: Science, independence and grassroots art: a German-based Egyptian scholar offers critical insight into the Arab presentation at the Frankfurt Book Fair” (an article largely based on interviews with Magdi Youssef) in: Al Ahram Weekly, Issue No. 707, Sept. 9-15, 2004, culture page. Also in Al Ahram online. Al-Ahram Weekly repeatedly noted Youssef's critique of the hegemony of Western media, including televised and printed cartoons of the Walt Disney type.Cf. for instance Mme. Sosostris, ibidem. In this context, Youssef's essay “Arab Fairy-Tales in Disney-Times” deserved attention.This paper constituted originally a plenary address to the Congress of the Fédération Internationale des Langues et Littératures modernes on children's literature, held at Regensburg University in Germany in 1996. It has also been translated into Italian and is frequently quoted in scholarly papers in Italy and elsewhere. See: Magdi Youssef, “I racconti di favole nel mondo arabo contemporaneo,” published on the website of the University Roma 1, Rome, Italy: http://www.disp.let.uniroma1.it/kuma/decolonizziamoci/Magdi_Youssef.html. According to Youssef, “the West's subtle psychological barriers complicate the process of intercultural exchange,\\" a staff writer of Al Ahram Weekly noted.N.N., “No one listened: Science, independence and grassroots art: a German-based Egyptian scholar offers critical insight into the Arab presentation at the Frankfurt Book Fair” (an article largely based on interviews with Magdi Youssef) in: Al Ahram Weekly, Issue No. 707, Sept. 9-15, 2004, culture page. Also in Al Ahram online. Youssef was also rather critical of the cultural bureaucracy of the Mubarak regime and of the Arab League's cultural bureaucracies when the Arab World was Guest of Honor at the International Frankfurt Book Fair in 2004.N.N., “No one listened: Science, independence and grassroots art: a German-based Egyptian scholar offers critical insight into the Arab presentation at the Frankfurt Book Fair” (an article largely based on interviews with Magdi Youssef) in: Al Ahram Weekly, Issue No. 707, Sept. 9-15, 2004, culture page. Also in Al Ahram online. He has generally been critical of dictatorships, including that of Mubarak. His commitment to democracy motivates him to comment regularly on the state of affairs in Egypt in the Arab version of the Egypt Independent, i.e. in Al- Masry Al-Youm.Articles by Magdi Youssef that appeared in Al-Masry al-Youm include: Jihad min sunع almanya wa 'beit al-Taa'a min beritanya ( Islamic Jihad 'made in Germany' and the 'House of Obedience' from Victorian England ), Al-masry Al-Youm, October 18, 2013, “Alfikr wa'l Irhab (Thoughts and Terror),” Al-Masry al-Youm, Sept. 20, 2013; “Shatat al mithaliyya wa -waqi'iyat al- Hayah” (The Groundlessness [or: Erroneousness] of Idealism and the Realism of Life), July 26, 2013; “Al-Amn am'l Iqtisad awallan?” (What has Priority: National Security or the Economy?), Sept. 6, 2013; “Idarat albilad bayna al- Shoyoukh wa'l Shabab” (The State Administration between the Young and the Old), June 28, 2013; “Hajat al-Jamahir bayna al-Dakhel wa'l Kharij” (Meeting the Needs of the Egyptian Population.

Some of his articles in Al- Masry al-Youm aroused controversies in the Arab-Egyptian media, for instance in the weekly journal al-Qahira. Here, one of the most renowned Egyptian and Arab columnists, al-Sayed Yasin, commented for instance on Oct. 9, 2012 in his weekly column entitled Meditations on M. Youssef's article What is Reading and What is Illiteracy? (published in Al-Masry al-Youm, Sept. 28, 2012). Al-Masry al-Youm refers to him (in Arabic) as “Magdi Youssef · Top Commenter · Professor of Comparative Literature and Methodology of Research at Cairo University.” According to an interviewer, one of his goals as a scholar is to “help place Arab culture on an equal footing with the West.”N.N., “No one listened: Science, independence and grassroots art: a German-based Egyptian scholar offers critical insight into the Arab presentation at the Frankfurt Book Fair” (an article largely based on interviews with Magdi Youssef) in: Al Ahram Weekly, Issue No. 707, Sept. 9-15, 2004, culture page. Also in Al Ahram online. Reflecting on the shortcomings of the Arab League’s cultural program during the 2004 Frankfurt Book fair, “comparative literature professor Magdi Youssef's, stress[ed] scholarly issues” – most notably “the programme's failure to take account of Arab achievements in the natural sciences, an omission that [in Youssef’s view] confirms the [false] notion that Arabs have made no contribution to material knowledge for centuries.”Youssef Rakha, “Great expectations / Youssef Rakha wraps up the debates surrounding the Arab world's guest-of-honor contribution to the Frankfurt Book Fair opening this week” in: Al Ahram Weekly, Issue No. 710, 30 September - 6 October 2004, culture page. Also online. The Congress of the IAIS in 2009 (organized by Youssef) that took place at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris has sought to correct this perception, as scholars from various disciplines, both from the West and the Arab world, evaluated the Arab contribution to “world culture” in a wide range of fields that include the natural and social sciences as well as literature and the arts (e.g. the architecture of Rasem Badran and of the late Hassan Fathi).Youssef […][f]ounded the International Association of Intercultural Studies (IAIS) which is geared towards studying [...] socio- cultural interactions via a host of disciplines ranging from the humanities, the arts to the natural sciences. To this end he organized [...] two major conferences of the IAIS: The Socio-Cultural Interaction Processes Between the West and the Arab World in Modern Times” and a second conference “in 2009 [...] in Paris on: The Contemporary Arab Contribution To World Culture: A Western-Arab Dialogue in a host of disciplines. Magdi Youssef has been short listed for the Egyptian State Award for significant contributions to the Social Sciences. ” This information was provided by Google search, searching for “Magdi Youssef AND LinkedIn”.

Editorial activities Youssef is listed as an adviser to the editorial board of Sotour (a monthly literary and cultural review based in Cairo and London). He is also an adviser to the editorial board of the Yearbook of Comparative Literature (published by Cairo University). He is currently the general editor of the book series: Towards a Really Rational World Culture, published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing in the U.K. This series aim at presenting the contributions of the so far marginalized socio- cultures to World Culture thus to make for a real cultural exchange worldwide, instead of the prevailing one-sided globalized Western 'World culture'.See the imprint of these journals.

He is the leader of the \\"Church of the Lord Jesus Christ\\", established in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Kolwezi , Kalemie, Brussels, Paris and Washington DC area. He declared himself \\"prophet of the Lord\\" for \\"the Ministry of Restoration from Sub-Saharan Africa\\". His disciples declared that he is the leader announced by the prophecies of Simon Kimbangu and the Bitawala (or Kitawala) on the advent of the true independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Candidate in the 2006 presidential election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he is opposed to Joseph Kabila because Joseph Kabila would be a foreigner from Rwanda. In his speeches in the media, and through open letters to the international community, he regularly denounces the \\"Rwandan occupation\\", the attempts to Balkanize the DRC, the daily mass rapes of Congolese children and women by men from Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, the massacre of the civilian population, the selling-off of the raw materials, the looting of the Natural resources of the DRC by neighboring countries, including Rwanda. On April 18, 2016, he addressed directly an open letter to the French President François Hollande. His involvement in politics caused him and his followers a lot of tragic events. On May 11, 2010 a demonstration of his followers is repressed in the blood. Several of his disciples came to demand the release of three of them arrested the day before and detained. A press release from the Voice of the Voiceless (La Voix des Sans Voix)], a Congolese human rights NGO, speaks of shots \\"at close range in the crowd, without any warning\\" by \\"soldiers of the former DEMIAP\\". There were reports of one dead, six wounded and five missing among the demonstrators. On Saturday February 5, 2011, the prophet of the Eternal Paul Joseph MUKUNGUBILA was awarded the diploma of Excellence and civil merit by the Association of Political Journalists of the Congo (AJPC), for having particularly made himself famous in Democratic Republic of Congo and in the concert of the nations by the work, the virtue, and actions of large scale (political, social, cultural, diplomatic, spiritual, sportive, military, police, philanthropic and others ...) in favor his nation. With this diploma, the entire civil society has thanked, applauded and rewarded all of the work accomplished by Joseph MUKUNGUBILA since 1959, when he will be given the Bible, a moment synonymous of the beginning of the suffering that he endures until this days for the true independence of the Democratic Republic of Congo. On Wednesday, March 2, 2011, the Patriotic Congolese Journalists Network awarded Paul Joseph Mukungubila a diploma and a trophy of merit and patriotism to celebrate a rich enough past in favor of the populations of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was after a severe criterion and an objective analysis that the selection of the jury was unanimous in Paul Joseph Mukungubila, prophet of the Lord. On December 30, 2013, bloody events took place in several towns in the DRC, including the capital (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Kolwezi, Kindu and Kisangani). Several demonstrators claiming to be the prophet Mukungubila followers are investing several strategic sites, including the RTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) headquarters to express their anger in response to attacks earlier in the morning by the security forces against two residences of Joseph Mukungubila in Lubumbashi where several adepts were gathered. These residences also serve as a place of worship. An investigation report, published in May 2014 by the League of Voters (la Ligue des Electeurs), a Congolese human rights NGO affiliated to International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), speaks of serious violations of human rights perpetrated By the Congolese army towards the \\"followers of the Ministry of Restoration from Sub-Saharan Africa \\", notably by referring to \\"massacres\\", \\"summary executions\\", \\"arbitrary arrests\\" committed, in particular, by elements of The Republican Guard. About a hundred followers are arrested and detained in prison in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. Joseph Mukungubila went into exile in South Africa when an international arrest warrant was issued by Interpol at the request of the Congolese government for his arrest and extradition. On 15 May 2014 he was arrested, brought before the Magistrates Court in Johannesburg and released on bail during his trial. A year later, on May 15, 2015, the trial ended, the South African justice decided to abandon the prosecution against him and thus to reject the extradition request made by the Congolese government because of \\"insufficient evidence\\". Since the end of 2013, Mukungubila has sent numerous letters to the international community to address the political and humanitarian crisis in the DRC. In his open letter to François Hollande dated April 18, 2016, he asked the latter to stop receiving Joseph Kabila at the Elysée interpellate him out about the \\"tragedy\\" in the DRC, saying: \\"To conclude Mr. President, It would be for us a big consolation that you cannot endorse this incomparable tragedy that taking place in the DRC, caused by the Rwandan invasion.

Live cells are shown as green and dead cells as white. Each of the 16 possible 2 × 2 blocks (outlined in blue) is transformed as shown. The rule alternates between using the blocks outlined in blue and the blocks outlined by the dashed red lines. Critters is a reversible block cellular automaton with similar dynamics to Conway's Game of Life,.. first described by Tommaso Toffoli and Norman Margolus in 1987.. Definition Critters is defined on a two-dimensional infinite grid of cells, which may be identified with the integer lattice. As in Conway's Game of Life, at any point in time each cell may be in one of two states: alive or dead. The Critters rule is a block cellular automaton using the Margolus neighborhood. This means that, at each step, the cells of the automaton are partitioned into 2 × 2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. The center of a block at one time step becomes the corner of four blocks at the next time step, and vice versa; in this way, the four cells in each block belong to four different 2 × 2 blocks of the previous partition. The transition function for Critters counts the number of live cells in a block, and if this number is exactly two it leaves the block unchanged. If the number of live cells is zero, one, or four, the transition function flips the state of every cell in the block. And finally, if the number of live cells is exactly three, the transition flips every state and then rotates the whole block by 180°. Because the function that combines these operations is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible cellular automaton. An alternative version of the transition function flips the states only in blocks with exactly two live cells, and in alternating time steps rotates either the blocks with three live cells or the blocks with one live cell. Unlike the original transition function, this preserves the number of live cells in each step, but leads to equivalent dynamic behavior to the original version of the function. Dynamics In the Critters rule, as with any reversible cellular automaton, initial states in which all cells take randomly chosen states remain unstructured throughout their evolution. However, when started with a smaller field of random cells centered within a larger region of dead cells, many small patterns similar to life's glider escape from the central random area and interact with each other. It has been conjectured, but not proven, that for periodic boundary conditions (so that the entire space of the cellular automaton is finite) initial fields of random cells that are sufficiently smaller than the whole space will lead with high probability to states in which a single glider follows a random walk through a field of oscillating debris.. In Conway's life, collisions of gliders may result in a completely dead state, a stable pattern, or an oscillator, but this is not possible in Critters. Instead, because of the reversibility of the rule, every collision of two or more gliders must result in a pattern from which at least one glider emerges, and when two gliders collide symmetrically, the result must also be a symmetric collection of two or more gliders leaving the collision site. With an initial state that carefully arranges the sites of these collisions, the Critters rule can be made to simulate a billiard-ball computer and thus, like Life, it can support universal computation. The Critters rule can also support more complex spaceships of varying speeds as well as oscillators with infinitely many different periods. Despite the complexity of its behavior, Critters obeys certain conservation laws and symmetry rules. For instance, the parity of the number of live cells along certain diagonals of the grid is not changed by the update rule, and remains unchanged throughout the evolution of any Critters pattern. Additionally, if a pattern starts out with a finite number of live cells, then after any even number of steps it will have the same finite number of live cells. (After odd numbers of steps, this number will instead count the dead cells of the pattern.) Unlike many of the other reversible block cellular rules studied by Toffoli and Margolus, the Critters rule is not its own inverse, so Critters patterns do not obey time-reversal symmetry; however, it is instead symmetric under a combination of time reversal and state complementation.

They are situated in the historic centre which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994. The complex was contiguous to the former Caliphal Palaces of the Umayyads (now the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos), whose inhabitants it served. Today the baths have been partially reconstructed and are open as a museum. History alt= Entrance to the Caliphal Baths museum today (photo from 2016); the remains of the baths have been covered from the outside but their interior is now accessible to visitors = Construction and development under Muslim rule = The baths were constructed in the 10th century under the reign of Caliph Al-Hakam II (961–976) to serve the inhabitants of his palace. Bathhouses (hammams) of this type were a common feature of Muslim cities across the Muslim world, serving both a social and religious purpose. They assisted Muslims in the performance of ablutions, especially the full-body ablutions or ghusl, which were required for certain situations. They also served the general purpose of hygiene as well as being a place for socialization. Their layout and function was modeled on the Roman bathhouses which preceded them and which had already been part of urban life in the region for generations. The caliphal baths in Cordoba consisted of the usual sequence of cold room, warm room, and hot room. After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate in Cordoba in the 11th century, Cordoba came under the control of the Taifa (kingdom) of Seville. During this period the Alcazar (royal palace) still served as the governor's residence in the city, and a reception hall was added to the bath complex, still present in the reconstructed remains today. The Taifa kingdoms were soon conquered by the Almoravids at the end of the same century, and they in turn were conquered by the Almohads, who ruled over al-Andalus until the early 13th century. The Almohads constructed another bathhouse attached to the original caliphal complex, sharing some of the same facilities but with a new sequence of cold to hot rooms. = Christian era (after 1236) = Following the Christian conquest of the city by Ferdinand III in 1236, he donated one part of the Alcazar to the bishop of Cordoba (today the Episcopal Palace) while the rest continued to be used as a royal residence. The baths continued to be used by the new Christian rulers and a water basin for bathing was added to the more recent Almohad baths. A century later, in 1328, King Alfonso XI decided to build a new set of baths within the royal palace for his favourite mistress, Leonor de Guzmán, which can still be seen today in the Christian Alcazar. At the same time, the old Arab baths were buried in order to create a small square known as the Campillo del Rey. In 1588 the square was renamed Campo Santo de los Mártires after Ambrosio de Morales erected a monument here in memory of honour of Christian martyrs killed by Muslims. In 1691 the remains of the baths were accidentally uncovered during building work around the square. It's possible that at this time parts of the bathhouse's masonry, especially the vaulted ceilings, was reused for the construction of the Church of San Pedro de Alcántara to the north. The baths were covered up again and were not uncovered again until 1903, when they were accidentally discovered during gardening work in the square. At this point they were studied by Spanish historian Rafael Ramírez de Arellano, who dated them back to al-Hakam II's reign. The bath complex was then covered up yet again until 1961, when they were excavated and more thoroughly studied by archeologists Félix Hernández and Rafael Castejón between 1961 and 1964. This led to the site being declared a Cultural Heritage Property of Spain a few years later. Eventually, the remains were converted into a museum which opened in 2006. Architecture Model of the reconstructed baths, on display at the museum today = Entrance areas to the bath complex = The caliphal baths were entered from the south (the direction of the palace) and visitors first arrived at a large changing room (the bayt al-maslah or bayt al-maslakh), equivalent to the Roman apodyterium. By the Taifa period (11th century), the entrance was fronted by a sunken garden leading to a portico, which in turn led to a decorated reception hall built in this period. The garden was likely planted with orange trees, lemon trees, and myrtles, along with other plants. Water was brought to the baths from the aqueduct along the city walls and also stored in a cistern. File:Banos califales entry area DSCF6914.jpgThe area of the former portico entrance of the bath complex from the palace gardens File:Banos califales taifa reception room DSCF6932.jpgRemains of a former decorated horseshoe-arch gateway in the Taifa-period reception hall = Baths of the Umayyad Caliphate period = The original caliphal baths consisted of three main rooms arranged in sequence parallel to the changing room, from east to west: the cold room (bayt al-barid), the warm room (bayt al-wastani), and the hot room (bayt al-sajun). These corresponded, respectively, to the Roman equivalents of the frigidarium, tepidarium, and caldarium. Latrines were also accessible near the cold room, with underground running water evacuating washing away the waste. Bathers visited the cold room first, then moved progressively to the warm room and then the hot room, whose purpose was to induce perspiration as part of the cleaning or purification process. Visitors were also cleaned with vigorous rubbing and massaging by bathhouse staff. As was common to other Muslim hammams, and in contrast with other versions of steam baths, bathers did not actually immerse themselves in water but instead washed themselves at the end of the process by having warm water poured onto them. In the caliphal baths, the largest room was the warm room (bayt al- wastani), occupying roughly 40% of the total area of the bathing rooms. This feature of the layout was also common to many other bathhouses in al-Andalus. It was covered by a large central vault ceiling surrounded by smaller barrel vault sections, all of which rested on marble columns with decorative capitals between horseshoe arches. The ceilings were pierced with small skylights, often star-shaped, in order to provide some lighting. The flooring and lower walls were also covered in marble, the upper walls were clad with some kind of steam-proof lining (like plaster), and the room featured some geometric decoration, though not much of this survives today. The smaller hot room to the west was a rectangular space covered by a barrel vault and marked at either end by a column between two horseshoe arches. On the west side of this, behind a marble lattice wall, was the service area of the baths which was set lower than the other rooms and contained the furnaces. These furnaces provided hot water for the steam rooms, and also generated hot air and smoke which was then channeled through pipes and conduits under the floors of the hot and warm rooms (similar to the Roman hypocaust system) before being evacuated through the walls and up to the chimneys.

These occupied a smaller area than the original caliphal steam rooms and they reused the service area and furnaces of the original baths. The hot room here is of a very similar form to the hot room of the caliphal baths, but the warm room is much more modest than its caliphal counterpart. They also featured decorative plasterwork with floral and interlacing motifs, fragments of which have been preserved at the Archeological Museum of Cordoba.

Sarlio had been paid by King Hugh to cause unrest in Spoleto, to give cause for the removal of Anscar. Liutprand of Cremona is the only source for the battle and he specifies neither the day nor the place. Perhaps exceeding his instructions, Sarlio moved on an unspecified city, probably Spoleto, with six acies (units, literally \\"spearheads\\") of experienced troops. Since Anscar had only one unit (acies) available at the time, his standard-bearer, Wikbert, advised him to remain in the city. He initially took the advice and sent messengers for reinforcements, but a certain Arcod—who is described as a Burgundian, like Sarlio—pressure him into assaulting Sarlio's camp. The attack was premature. Anscar personally led his acies in a charge, while Sarlio countered with only three of his acies. Sarlio himself led from the rear, watching the battle from across a river, possibly the Tessino or Clitumno. Liutprand describes him as afraid of facing Anscar in battle. When the first charge by the defenders was successful, Sarlio sent a further two acies into battle under Count Hatto, who had once supported Anscar. At this point, Wikbert, mortally wounded, advised Anscar to flee and save his life. Instead, the duke made a second charge against Sarlio's reinforcements. According to Liutprand, he rebuked Hatto for treachery before sending a broken lance through his mouth, killing him. The Burgundian Arcod fled the fighting. Anscar fought with his sword until his horse was too tired to continue: both Anscar and horse fell into a ditch. Pinned beneath his mount, Anscar was killed by \\"missiles\\" from a distance.

She founded the Women and Children's Hospital in Jiujiang. Life Born to a Chinese Christian family in Jiujiang on May 1, 1873, Stone's father was a Methodist pastor and mother was the principal of a Methodist school for girls. She attended Rulison-Fish Memorial School, established by American missionary Gertrude Howe, in Jiujiang for ten years. Inspired by the American medical missionary Dr. Kate Bushnell, her father hoped to train her as a medical doctor. In 1892, she was brought to Ann Arbor, Michigan by Gertrude Howe, together with Ida Kahn (Kang Cheng), for professional training in the west, where she and Kahn became \\"not only the first Asians to earn degrees at the University of Michigan, but they were also among the very first Chinese women ever to become Western-trained physicians\\" in 1896. In the Fall of 1896, she and Ida Kahn returned to Jiangxi, China as medical missionaries of the Women’s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Two years later, with donations from Dr. I. N. Danforth of Chicago, they established Elizabeth Skelton Danforth Hospital in Jiujiang, named after Dr. Danforth's wife, which later became the Jiujiang Women and Children's Hospital. Between 1918 and 1919, she received the Rockefeller Foundation scholarship to do postgraduate work at Johns Hopkins University, where her sister, Phoebe Stone, was a medicine graduate. During her time in Hopkins, Phoeber was in charge of the Elizabeth Skelton Danforth Hospital. Stone was not only well known as a medical professional, but also for her Christian missionary work. Between 1920 and 1937, she was involved in starting multiple hospitals, schools and churches in China. In particular, she partnered with the former American Methodist Episcopal missionary Jennie V. Hughes and established the Bethel Mission in Shanghai in 1920, which would later be the basis for Andrew Gih's Bethel Worldwide Evangelistic Band. She is also a member of the China Continuation Committee of the National Missionary Conference after the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference of 1910. She returned to California after World War II, where she later died on December 30, 1954, in Pasadena at the age of 81.

It competed in the 1961 German National gliding competition, coming sixth, and led directly to two further GRP aircraft. Design and development The 1961 SB-6 Nixope was one of the earliest gliders with a glass-fibre structure following two other German designs, the 1957 Akaflieg Stuttgart FS-24 Phönix and the 1958 Hirth Hi 25 Kria. Like the Phönix, the Nixope was designed and built within a university aeronautical engineering department but the NIxope team was a traditional undergraduate one, headed by Björn Stender then in his final year. At a time when GRP techniques were novel and evolving, the Nixobe was very ambitious, with a wing of aspect ratio 25, compared with 17.8 for the Phönix and 14.3 for the Kria. Stender had visited Nabern to learn about GRP construction, though the Braunschweig group developed some techniques of their own. The Nixope was mostly constructed from GRP and balsa. Its cantilever shoulder wing was built around a broad GRP and balsa box spar, with closely spaced () balsa and GRP ribs. Balsa skinning was followed by a GRP outer layer, without the use of female moulds. The wings were straight tapered, with greater taper on the outer sections. At the tips the leading edges were rounded off. Its simple wooden ailerons were quite short, filling only about 25% of the span. To keep the wing structure simple there were no flaps or airbrakes. The wing was mounted with 1.5° of dihedral. The fuselage was built in a similar way, with thick planking. It had a very smoothly streamlined and small cross-section shape, tapering to the tail. The pilot was in a fully reclining seat, allowing a long, detachable, single piece, blown plexiglass canopy which did not interrupt the fuselage profile. A retractable, fully enclosed monowheel, with a brake, was fitted. The empennage was conventional and simply wooden, with an all moving tailplane mounted on a broad, tall, straight edged fin just above the fuselage. The rudder, straight edged, forward swept and hinged well clear of the elevator, extended down to the keel where there was a small tail bumper. The elevator but not the rudder was balanced. As the Nixope had no wing mounted airbrakes, a diameter ribbon parachute was mounted in the tail. Operational history The Nixope first flew on 2 February 1961. It proved to have good performance and later that year Stender flew it into sixth position in the German National Championships, even though it was not easy to fly and despite his lack of competitive experience. After Stender had graduated he received funding and facilities from Heli Lausch, an affluent South African pilot, to build a new aircraft closely based on the Nixope and known as the BS-1 from Stender's initials. After his death in 1963 in the first prototype and the non-fatal loss of the second, the BS-1 underwent major structural redesign, becoming the successful Glasflügel BS-1. The next Akaflieg Braunschweig glider, the SB-7 Nimbus, was also strongly influenced by the Nixope. The Nixope was lost in August 1964.

Early life and education Eugene Winslow was born on November 17, 1919, in Dayton, Ohio. Both of his parents were college graduates who encouraged all seven of their children to pursue education and the arts. Winslow attended Froebel High School in Gary, Indiana, and then received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Dillard University in New Orleans in 1943. After graduating from Dillard, Winslow entered the 477th Bomber Group of the Air Force, making him a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. He attained the rank of Second Lieutenant. He later served in the Air Force Reserve, becoming a First Lieutenant before he left in 1957. After the War, Winslow's lifelong interest in art drew him to do post- graduate work at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. He studied at these institutions concurrently from 1948 to 1951.Eugene Winslow Finding Aid at Vivian G. Harsh Research Center. Throughout his early career, Winslow supplemented the income from his art by teaching and working as a newspaper cartoonist, advertising designer, and engineering draftsman. Afro-Am Publishing In 1963, Winslow joined two friends to start Afro-Am Publishing where he was able to create his own projects. David P. Ross, a graduate of the Art Institute of Chicago, became Afro-Am's president. Winslow was treasurer and, later, vice president.Donald Franklin Joyce, Black Book Publishers in the United States: A Historical Dictionary of the Presses, 1817–1990, 1991. Also in 1963, as a part of the celebration of the emancipation centennial, Afro-Am published Great Negroes Past and Present, which Winslow illustrated. The book was an immediate success and became the pioneer supplementary text for Black Studies programs for students. By 1972, the book was in its third edition and had been adopted by the Board of Education for Social Studies in California. In 1978, Winslow was nominated to serve as president for Afro-Am Publishing. As company president, Winslow changed Afro-Am's marketing strategy from direct selling to a mail-order operation utilizing a catalog of hundreds of black interest educational materials. He directed his catalog sales to educators, schools, and libraries. Winslow wrote Afro-Americans '76: Black Americans in the Founding of Our Nation and contributed to several works about African- American history while serving as Afro-Am's president. He sold the publishing company in 1993 and died in 2001. Archival collection The Eugene Winslow Papers (1851–1994) are located at the Chicago Public Library's Vivian G.

It is part one of the Ava Curzon trilogy. The novel's premise involves the infamous ancient Hebrew magical text, The Sword of Moses, and features Dr Ava Curzon, an archaeologist working in the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad reassembling the collections looted during the 2003 invasion.  Plot summary  When former MI6 agent turned archaeologist Dr Ava Curzon is engaged by American intelligence to track down an African militia claiming to hold the Ark of the Covenant, she is plunged into a world where nothing is what it seems. Her breakneck descent into the shadowy realm of dark biblical texts hurls her across continents and deep into the opaque worlds of the Knights Templar and neo-Nazis, pushing her mentally and physically to the limits. Her initial compulsion to find the Ark soon becomes more urgent when she discovers that Marius Malchus, the man holding it, was responsible for her father’s murder years earlier. As she pursues Malchus across Europe and the Middle East, she is repeatedly thwarted and placed in ever greater physical danger, experiencing his extreme ruthlessness at first hand. When an informant in Malchus’s group sends her photographs of a coded medieval lead medal, she begins unravelling a series of arcane clues that take her to the heart of an ancient mystery buried by the medieval Vatican, but now driving Malchus towards an apocalyptic endgame. As Ave penetrates deeper into the shadows, the Vatican medal leads her to the sacred biblical seven-branched Menorah candlestick buried in an ancient Mithraic Temple deep under Rome and to a series of ever more challenging puzzles. Harnessing all her mental and physical skills, the danger levels increase as she solves a clue related to the enigmatic Voynich manuscript, and closes in on Malchus and his prize: a powerful ancient Hebrew magical manuscript called The Sword of Moses. She is helped by David Ferguson, a former British soldier, Peter DeVere of MI6, Anna Prince of American intelligence, and a group which is eventually revealed as the outlawed medieval Knights Templar, still active and all-powerful in the shadows. As her relationships turn out to be more complex and treacherous than she ever imagined, she is repeatedly betrayed and realizes she can trust no one. While she moves inexorably closer to Malchus and the evil he is planning, Uri, an agent from Mossad’s infamous Metsada assassination unit is also chasing Malchus and the Ark, infiltrating Malchus’s neo-Nazis and placing himself on a collision course with Ava. Having solved the final clue, the climax takes Ava to Malchus’s isolated house on the shores of Loch Ness, where the English occultist Aleister Crowley once conducted his dark rites. Ava is captured and subjected to a horrifying ordeal, before being betrayed again and taken to the former Nazi SS ‘grail castle’ at Wewelsburg, where she becomes the centrepiece of a sadistic ritual in which her fate is entwined with the dark contents of The Sword of Moses, the Ark, the Menorah, and a terrifying plan to launch the Fourth Reich. After a climactic and action-charged showdown with Uri and Malchus, Ava finally comes face-to-face with the Ark, and with the opportunity to avenge the death of her father. In a last scene, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar takes her to the breathtaking Templar chapel of Montsaunès, where he reveals an age-old secret that explains what has been driving the dramatic events, and draws them to a resolution and conclusion.

He initially had difficulty establishing his authority within the province, due to the presence of the rebel 'Isa ibn al- Shaykh, and was forced to fight the latter in the vicinity of Damascus. Despite having a much smaller force, Amajur won the engagement, routing 'Isa's army and killing his son Mansur. Shortly after the battle, 'Isa abandoned Syria for Armenia, thereby securing Amajur's position as governor.Gil, p. 300; Cobb, p. 39; al-Ya'qubi, pp. 618, 620, 621; al-Tabari, pp. 116-17; Ibn al- Athir, p. 226; al-Kindi, p. 215 Over the course of the next several years, Amajur administered the province with a firm hand.

The expedition, however, stalled at Raqqa and came to an end when Musa's troops revolted against him, forcing him to return to Iraq; as a result, Ibn Tulun remained in control of Egypt.Lewis, p. 179; al-Kindi, pp. 217-18 Amajur died in ca. 878.

The first addition to the house was made shortly after it was moved in 1868, when a dining room connected to the rear kitchen house, separated by a breezeway, was constructed. A second addition in 1886 expanded the front parlor and rear dining room and also created a covered side entry porch, a bathroom on the north side of the house and added new fireplaces serve the new rooms. A third addition was made in 1904 which expanded the front porch to include a covered driveway as well as enhancing the interior living spaces with Victorian trimwork and drywall. A wood parapet was added to the porch and the fluted Ionic columns were added, creating the Classical Revival style of the house that still remains. The house was owned by James Earle Hagood, a clerk for the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina until his death in 1904.

He was the first to play for the Yugoslavian team at the International Lawn Tennis Challenge, and later the Davis Cup in 1927. He was also the first and only Yugoslavian tennis Olympian until the reinstatement of tennis to the Olympic programme in 1988. Apart from that he was a three-time Swiss champion. Early life and family Đorđe Dunđerski, better known by the nickname Goga, belonged to the prestigious Serbian family of Dunđerski, the roots of which go far back to Herzegovina from where his ancestors moved to Srbobran in the 17th century, fleeing from the Ottoman occupation. The most prominent members of the Dunđerski family lived in Vojvodina before the First World War, and up to the Second World War occupied important positions in small businesses. Dunđerski was born in 1902 in Srbobran to father Jaša and mother Vera, the latter being the daughter of a lawyer in Novi Sad a town to which they had moved in 1907. The young Dungyersky was well educated and spoke French better than his mother tongue; he spoke Serbian with a French accent. For high school, he attended the in Szeged to learn Latin and Hungarian. To avoid conflicts in the First World War, the family escaped to Geneva where he graduated in 1922. It was in Switzerland where he began playing tennis, becoming a high school champion. The family returned to Novi Sad immediately after the war. Dungyersky embarked on law studies at the University of Zagreb, but left during the second semester to focus on tennis. Tennis career Dunđerski 's first breakthrough achievement was winning the Geneve International Championships. After that he became the best non-national player in Switzerland and held the Swiss International Championships title consecutively between 1924 and 1927. During this period he played for the national team of Switzerland. He played occasionally in his home country and was a member of the HAŠK, the Croatian Academic Sports Club. He participated in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris where he lost to John Gilbert in the first round. In doubles, he and Iván Balás advanced to the second round but lost to Jacques Brugnon/Henri Cochet (France). In 1925, he was a finalist at the Campel doubles tournament partnering Jean Wuarin but came short against Jean Borotra and his Swiss partner, a man named Kyburz. In 1926, he was a runner-up at the Nice L.T.C. tournament, only losing to Umberto de Morpurgo in straight sets. He participated in the first official Davis Cup match in 1927, teaming up with Balás from Bečkerek to represent the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team in Zagreb against India. Personal life After retiring from tennis, Dunđerski became a tennis instructor in Geneva, and acted as sparring partner to many famous diplomats including Arthur Balfour. In 1939 he returned to Novi Sad but was never able to enter elite society because he was considered a foreigner and an extravagant person, although he had inherited a large estate from his father and thus had the status of a landowner. After World War II he was stripped of all of his assets in Srbobran by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He could not get a job as he had done no work apart from playing tennis full-time. He was only permitted occasional access to tennis clubs in exchange for his part-time assistance to the Tennis Association when it needed to tap on his ability to speak, write and read in five languages as an international liaison. Dunđerski married in 1951 but divorced in 1969. He supported himself by selling parts of his estate until the remainder was nationalized. He was permitted to keep two apartments and lived in them until he sold them, whereupon he became homeless. He moved from town to town, finding shelter in the homes of old friends. Eventually, his social security expired and he died in a poorhouse in Futog in 1983.

Just Mayo was first released in Northern California Whole Foods Markets on September 19, 2013. Just Mayo comes in original, wasabi, truffle, sesame ginger, garlic, chipotle and sriracha flavors. It is described as \\"a vegan spread that has rattled the egg industry.\\"  History  Just Mayo was formulated in 2011 by Josh Tetrick, who invested $37,000 into the business of finding a cheaper alternative to eggs. The company was named Hampton Creek, then renamed to JUST, inc. in 2017. Bill Gates and Li Ka-shing became backers of the company. Just Mayo does not contain eggs; the formula took approximately two years to create. The research and development team at Hampton Creek screened 1,500 plants before discovering eleven that were suitable for the emulsification purposes in a mayonnaise. The plant that replaces the egg in Just Mayo is a specific variety of the Canadian yellow field pea (a type of split pea).  Production and distribution milestones In October 2013, Just Mayo was produced by a copacker located in Seattle and Tennessee and distributed to Whole Foods across the United States by distribution company United Natural Foods. In October 2014, Just Mayo was available in at least six grocery store chains in the United States, including Whole Foods, Kroger, Safeway, ShopRite, Target and Costco. By early 2019, the product was extremely hard to find and not carried in any of these retailers, but distribution improved in the second half of the year. Labelling controversy On October 31, 2014, Unilever (parent company of competing brand Hellmann's/Best Foods) filed a lawsuit against Hampton Creek for false advertising, arguing that Just Mayo cannot be marketed as mayonnaise because it does not meet the definition of the product specified by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA requires that \\"mayonnaise\\" contain 65% vegetable oil and at least one egg yolk-containing ingredient; Just Mayo contains ingredients such as pea protein, beta-carotene, and modified food starch, none of which are used in mayonnaise according to FDA standards. Unilever also noted the use of egg-oriented imagery in its promotional materials, and stated that its false claims were \\"part of a larger campaign and pattern of unfair competition by Hampton Creek to falsely promote Just Mayo spread as tasting better than, and being superior to, Best Foods and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.\\" Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick denied any wrongdoing, believing that Unilever's lawsuit was meant to solely hinder competition. On December 18, 2014, Unilever dropped the lawsuit so Hampton Creek could work with \\"industry groups and appropriate regulatory authorities\\" on resolving its labelling, while also complimenting the company for its \\"commitment to innovation and its inspired corporate purpose.\\" In August 2015, the FDA sent Hampton Creek a formal warning that Just Mayo's labeling was misleading due to the product not meeting the standards for \\"mayonnaise\\", and because of wording on the packaging and promotional materials that contained an \\"implied health claim that these products can reduce the risk of heart disease due to the absence of cholesterol,\\" which cannot be included as it contains too much fat to be promoted with such statements. In December 2015, Hampton Creek announced that it had agreed to revise its packaging for Just Mayo in order to comply with the FDA's recommendations. The new label contains more prominent statements surrounding the nature of the product, and contains an explanation that the word \\"Just\\" in the product's name is defined as being \\"guided by reason, justice, and fairness.\\" In October 2016, it was reported that the American Egg Board and its affiliates \\"launched a secret two-year war against the vegan mayonnaise competitor\\", spending at least 59,500 to counter publicity about Just Mayo's products. This led to a federal investigation by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, which condemned the American Egg Board \\"for overstepping its congressional mandate.\\" See also * List of brand name condiments ReferencesExternal links * Category:Veganism Category:Brand name condiments Category:Sauces of the mayonnaise family Category:Hampton Creek ","title":"Just Mayo"},{"id":"41504968","text":"Iván Balás ( ; ; 1894 - 1971) was a Yugoslav tennis player of Hungarian ethnicity. He was the one of the first to play for the Yugoslavian team at the International Lawn Tennis Challenge, and later the Davis Cup in 1927. Technically his match was the second rubber of the tie. Apart from team competitions, he clinched international championships for Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Romania and Slovakia in various events. Early life and family Iván Balás was born in 1894 in Elemir, Bečkerek (renamed Zrenjanin in 1946), Banat, then part of Austria-Hungary and now Serbia. He was born into a wealthy landowner family of ethnic Hungarians, the son of Iván Balás, Sr. (1866, Tápióbicske – 1909, Budapest and Erna Koronghy (1874, Baracháza – 1850, Budapest). Hs family's wealth contributed to his rapid growth in tennis. His Hungarian father ), built two tennis courts in Elemir where his son Iván learned tennis. Iván attended the Nagybecskerek high school. He continued his studies in Budapest. Tennis career In college Balás played tennis as well as basketball, hockey, football and athletics. He began to win club and international tournaments in Nagybecskerek. Balás' first public triumph was recorded in 1922 in the men's singles of the National Championship in Novi Sad. At the 1924 Olympics in Paris, he played both singles in doubles. In the men's singles, he was defeated in the first round by Jack Nielsen (Norway). And in doubles, he and Đorđe Dunđerski advanced to the second roundbut lost to Jacques Brugnon/Henri Cochet (France). In 1926, he was crowned the champion of Yugoslavia. He was drafted into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team for the first-ever Davis Cup match against India in Zagreb in May 1927, joined by Đorđe Dunđerski. Although they didn't win a game or set, both of them provided strong resistance. Balás even had two balls to have a chance to serve out the first set in the match against Hassan-Ali Fyzee, but did not succeed, as the Indian player came back to claim the match. On the third ball, the game was suspended due to bad weather, and so the match was decided after the first two days' results. The organizers agreed not to wait on Monday but to pass the remaining two dead rubbers and the victory to India. Balás next represented Hungary, debuting in a match against Austria. At the time he was fifth/sixth on the Hungarian rankings. In 1930 he earned the second place in mixed doubles at the Bucharest International Championship (lost to Ghica Poulief and Nini Golescu) In Cluj-Napoca he lifted the doubles trophy with partner Béla Kehrling, defeating Romanian champion Constantin Cantacuzino and Alexandru Botez; he also finished third in singles and mixed contest. In 1931 he reached four doubles finals, including the Hungarian Covered Courts tournament mixed and men's doubles, and the Warsaw International Championships doubles and mixed doubles. Personal life In 1928, Balás was engaged in Hungary, and he was no longer in the Davis Cup team of Yugoslavia. He mostly played and practised in Budapest and joined the Magyar Atlétikai Club. In 1944 he moved to Austria, where he continued his tennis career and married Zita Kremmel in 1950. On April 11, 1951 their daughter Charlotte was born. As of 1951 he lived and worked in France, where he was a devoted tennis player and coach for the rest of his life. Balás died in Paris in 1971.

The club was founded in 1887 and is a dual club fielding teams in both hurling and Gaelic football. Location The club is situated in the parish of Pallasgreen/Templebraden and is a member of the East Board of Limerick GAA. The club is centred on the villages of Pallasgreen, Old Pallas, Nicker and Barna. The parish is roughly 22 km southeast of Limerick City and just 8 km from the border with County Tipperary. Neighbouring clubs are Kilteely/Dromkeen, Caherline, Caherconlish, Cappamore, Doon, Oola and Knockane. Knockane is the other GAA club situated in the southern half of the parish around the townlands of Knockane, Garrydoolis, Templebraden, Ballyneety and Sarsfield's Rock. Knockane fields Junior B hurling and football teams and has no underage structure. All juveniles therefore play with Pallasgreen and anyone living in the Knockane area can still play with Pallasgreen under the parish rule. History The club was founded in 1887 in an area where Gaelic games were very strong well before the foundation of the GAA in 1884. A Pallasgreen team beat Abbeyfeale in a tournament final at Corcanree. They competed in tournaments at various locations in County Limerick and many from the parish played with Knockane which had already been founded in 1884. The club was formed as 'New Pallas Milesians' and its founding chairman was William Kennedy. During those early years Pallas, Knockane and Oola were all quite strong and players often interchanged between clubs. In 1898 Pallas contested their only County Senior Football Championship where they were easily defeated by the Commercials. Glory however did come in 1911 when they beat South Liberties in the County Intermediate Football Championship final. The club almost solely played football up to 1914 when a junior hurling team was formed. That team tasted success the following year when they won the County Junior Hurling Championship beating Granagh in the final.

The formula has been widely adopted on account of its simplicity and predictive accuracy. Career Riegel gained a BS in mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 1959 and his masters from Villanova University in 1966. He was a research engineer at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, researching the development of deep-sea diving equipment as well as air flow in coal mines. He published numerous articles on waste-water treatment, underwater life support, motorcycle mechanics and distance running. Riegel founded and edited Measurement News, the newsletter of the Road Running Technical Council of USA Track & Field. He helped in the creation of the RRTC when USATF was first being organized, and served as its chairman until 2002. He headed the US team to design and measure the marathon courses for the 1984 and 1996 U.S. Olympics, as well as the U.S. Men's Olympic Marathon Trials race held in Columbus in 1992. He was also a founding member of the Association of Road Racing Statisticians. He held a patent for an automatic trip fill nozzle and another for an exhaust regulator valve for push-pull diving system. Race time prediction In a 1977 article for Runner's World Magazine, Riegel proposed a simple formula for comparing relative performances at different distances. The formula is most commonly quoted as: > T2=T1×(D2÷D1)1.06 Riegel expanded on his thesis in a 1981 article for American Scientist, stating that the formula t=axb concerns activities in the \\"endurance range\\", namely lasting between 3.5 and 230 minutes. The analysis deals with running, swimming and walking. The simplicity of the formula and its predictive accuracy has resulted in it being adopted widely by websites such as Runner's World. Some sites have modified it, stating that the value of 1.06 given for the exponent b in the formula results in seemingly unachievable predictions for longer distances.

Biography Aleksandar Popović was born in Belgrade. In 1926 he was invited to a non Davis Cup match against Greece, which Greece won. He became the Yugoslavian national champion in singles in 1927. His final lasted only 24 games, with a final score of 6:2, 6:3, 6:1. Popović was one of the early baseliner players who hit a dozen cross-court shots before converting a point a strategy that suited him well. He was triumphant in the doubles with the same easy manner, which took him only one game more to finish the final (6:2, 6:3, 6:2). Fortunately for Popović, György Dungyersky, the original line-up member for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team in their 1928 Davis Cup first round match against Finland, got sick. As he was a reserve player he stepped in to replace him. Rain was a constant factor during the match and the meeting lasted seven days instead of the usual three. The Yugoslavians didn't have much expectations on the doubles as this marked the first time Popović paired with Franjo Šefer, while the Finnish enlisted the seasoned duo of Arne Grahn and Bo Grotenfeld to oppose them. Less than a month later, at the championship of Yugoslavia in Zagreb, Popović retained his title in the international field. In the semifinals he had a tough duel with Podvineć, which he won in three sets. In the final he won with Dr. Müller as his partner. After World War II he emigrated to Switzerland, where he no longer played tennis and changed his surname. Notes *According to the Tennis Association of Serbia, the Davis Cup website is incorrect. Thus, the outcome of these matches are unsure. The dates marked are the originally scheduled three days and the players field is also incomplete.

Early life and family Franjo Šefer was born in 1905 in Vienna to a Jewish family. They moved to Karlovac in 1910, where he made his first steps on the tennis court. Šefer was often trained with another prominent player from Karlovac, Alexander Podvineć. Šefer joined HAŠK, where Krešimir Friedrich and Nikola Antolković played. Tennis career Franjo Šefer played for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team starting in 1928. In 1933 he also became the team captain. Three times in a row he was a champion of Yugoslavia (1929, 1930, 1931). He won seven titles altogether, counting the men's and mixed doubles, and he scored a victory over Franjo Punčec at the international tournament in Bled with 6:4, 6:1. In addition to the many years he spent at the forefront of the rankings, Šefer supplied the Yugoslav national team its first individual victory in the Davis Cup. It was in Zagreb, the second appearance of the Yugoslav National Team in the Davis Cup against Finland in 1928. Šefer's fourth Davis Cup appearance came in 1930 against Sweden in Belgrade, where he was the real hero of the match, in which he achieved the first Yugoslavian team victory in this competition. He parted ways with the national team in Budapest in the Davis Cup match against Hungary, where he sealed the 3-2 team victory, partnering Punčec and winning the doubles. In coaching, he is credited with discovering Dragutin Mitić, helping him in the early stages and introducing him to the Davis Cup team. He set to tour India in 1934 and 1935 along with Josip Pallada, Franjo Punčec, and Franjo Kukuljević. In 1935 he won the All-India Lawn Tennis Doubles Championships with Kukuljević, after which he returned to his country to actively play until the beginning of World War II. He won one of his last titles in mixed national doubles in 1939. In the beginning of World War II he emigrated first to the United States and then to Canada, where he died. His last known whereabouts were in Montreal in 1980.

Early life and family Krešimir Friedrich was born in Koprivnica into a family of 11 children, all brothers. He and his brother Ferdo began visiting the local tennis courts in Koprivnica in their youth, frequenting the same club where contemporary painter and eventual fifth-ranked national player and subsequent Davis Cup captain Fedor Malančec trained at the time. They were occasionally hired as ball boys, and thus had a chance to play a bit sometimes. Football career Friedrich and his brother Dragutin began playing at the NK Slaven Belupo but soon left for the HAŠK club in 1923 although Krešimir was mostly a reserve player in the latter team. Tennis career Friedrich had minor local achievement in the 1920s, including the third place at the VIII HAŠK tournament doubles competition, partnering his brother; the match was won by Ivan Balás and Franz Wilhelm Matejka. In 1930 he won the Ljubljana tournament in doubles and mixed doubles. That same year, he reached third place in the Serbian International Championship in singles and was a runner-up in doubles, pairing with Emil Gabrowitz of Hungary; they only lost to the eventual champions, Franjo Šefer and Ivan Radović. Friedrich was a national doubles champion in 1928 and 1931 with his brother, Dragutin. He was drafted into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team in 1929 in Athens, where his team lost to Greece 4 to 1. Friedrich won the only rubber when he defeated Costas Efstratiadis. He was called up twice more, but both meetings resulted in love- match loss for his team. In 1935, in the first international tournament of SK Ilirija in Ljubljana, the Friedrich brothers fell in three straight sets to the well-known duo of Franjo Šefer and Franjo Kukuljević. He was coached by František Koželuh.

Early life and education Ivan Radović graduated from the Teacher's College in Sombor, where he finished as a drawing teacher. He went to Budapest in order to continue his studies at the Hungarian University of Fine Arts. He attended the class of Hungarian painter István Réti. He spent his student years in Hungary between 1917 and 1920. He then spent the 1921 school year visiting Munich, Prague, and Venice, and stayed in Prague and Paris. He moved to Belgrade in 1927. He taught at a school in Stanišić. Afterwards he taught at the young girls' high school in Sombor. In 1929 he organized his breakthrough third exhibition in the Belgrade Pavilion of Arts, \\"Cvijeta Zuzorić\\". Tennis career In 1929 Radović participated in the National Championships in Zagreb. The same year, he was ranked third behind Franjo Šefer and Krešimir Friedrich. Thus he was invited onto the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team and travelled to Athens with them to face Greece. The Yugoslavian team lost and Radović remained a reserve player. In 1930 the Yugoslavian squad hosted a first-round match against Sweden and celebrated their first and flawless victory in the Cup. Radović also won in the doubles, partnering Šefer. He retired from the team after the next match against Spain, in which he was defeated in the doubles. Radović represented his country once more in a friendly match against Hungary in Szeged in June 1930. The team was composed of him and Šefer. Although he lost both of his singles matches, Šefer made it a tie with two victories and they claimed the doubles to close the meeting three to two rubbers. In October he became a Yugoslavian doubles champion, pairing with Šefer, after successfully defeating Emil Gabrowitz of Hungary and compatriot Friedrich in the Belgrade International tournament final. He and Šefer met in the mixed doubles final as well, where the latter teamed with Lili Schräger and beat the duo of Radović and Magda Baumgarten of Hungary. In 1931 Radović reached the doubles semifinal of the international Balkan Cup tournament at the Bob Club in Belgrade. Personal life Radović enlisted into the Royal Yugoslav Army in April 1941, during World War II. He was soon taken prisoner and transported to a German concentration camp. He was released just before the end of the war. Radović became a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1970. He died in 1973 and was buried in Belgrade's Novo groblje cemetery. Painting style Three Graces by Radović on a 1975 Yugoslavian stamp Radović's art is described as \\"evocative of the works of Le Douanier Rousseau, Gauguin and Chagall went through several stages which often overlapped as parallel research does, from contemplative rationalism to the emotional, instinctive and irrational\\". His two main eras are the neoclassicism style in 1922–1926 and the abstract style between 1923–1924. He was strongly influenced by Venetian renaissance and German Expressionism. Radović's naivism is characterized by \\"violet and greenish- yellow colours, with a gradual lightening of the gamut, with the introduction of new and recreation of old themes in a different way: portraits, interiors, nudes, still-lifes and landscapes\\".

Despite never winning a Group One race, Bellypha was one of the highest-rated racehorses of his generation in Europe at both two and three years of age. In eleven racecourse appearances, Bellypha won six races including the Prix Thomas Bryon, Prix de La Jonchere, Prix Daphnis and Prix Quincey, but produced his best effort in defeat when narrowly beaten by Irish River in the Prix Jacques Le Marois. He later became a successful breeding stallion in France and Japan. Background Bellypha was a grey horse bred in Ireland by the Head family's Societe Aland breeding organisation. During his racing career Bellypha was a dark grey with a lighter face: like all greys his coat lightened as he aged and later appeared almost completely white. He was from the third crop of foals sired by Lyphard, an American-bred, French-trained horse who won the Prix Jacques Le Marois in 1972. At stud, Lyphard was very successful, siring champions such as Three Troikas, Dancing Brave and Manila. Bellypha was the third, and best foal of his dam Belga, a moderate racehorse, but a descendant of the broodmare Malcolmia, making her a distant relative of the Coronation Cup winner Oncidium. As a yearling, Bellypha was sold for 410,000 francs (approximately £48,000) and entered the ownership of Jacques Wertheimer. The colt's breeders retained some control over his career, as he was trained by Alec Head at Chantilly. Racing career=1978: two-year-old season= After finishing fourth on his racecourse debut Bellypha recorded his first success at Deauville Racecourse in August when he won a maiden race over 1400 metres. He then won a minor race over the same distance at Longchamp Racecourse. On 10 October, Bellypha was moved up in class to contest the Group Three Prix Eclipse over 1300m at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. He started the 5/2 second favourite in a field of ten runners, but finished fourth, three and a half lengths behind the Aga Khan's colt Ramanouche. On 4 November Bellypha started at odds of 9.6/1 for the Group Three Prix Thomas Bryon over 1500m at Saint- Cloud. He produced his best performance of the year, taking the lead early in the straight and drawing away in the closing stages to win by four lengths from the François Boutin-trained Sharpman, with the filly Water Lily half a length away in third. =1979: three-year-old season= Bellypha was regarded as a potentially top-class middle distance performer and made his first appearance as a three-year-old in the Prix de Guiche over 1950m on soft ground at Longchamp on 16 April. He produced a strong late run but failed by half a length to catch the favourite Top Ville. He was brought back in distance for the 1600m Prix de La Jonchere, a Group Three race at the same course on 10 May. Starting the 3/10 favourite against seven opponents he won easily by four lengths from Maraway. Despite doubts about his stamina, Bellypha was given another chance to prove himself over middle distances on 3 June when he started the 8/1 third favourite for the Group One Prix du Jockey Club over 2400m at Chantilly. Freddy Head moved the colt into a challenging position in the straight but could make no further progress, finishing fourth behind Top Ville, Le Marmot and Sharpman. Jackie Taillard took over from Head when Bellypha reappeared in the Prix Daphnis over 1800m at Evry Racecourse at the end of the month. The colt started at odds of 1/5 against moderate opposition and won by four lengths. While Top Ville and Le Marmot appeared the best of their generation in France over middle distances, the leading miler was Irish River, who had won eight of his ten races including five at Group One level. Bellypha met Irish River for the first and only time in the weight-for-age Prix Jacques Le Marois on 12 August at Deauville Racecourse. The two colts dominated the closing stages, drawing away from the other runners before Irish River prevailed by a neck. Head lodged an objection to the winner for causing interference but the racecourse stewards allowed the result to remain unchanged. Thirteen days after his defeat in the Marois, Bellypha started 1/2 favourite for the 1600m Prix Quincey in which his main rivals appeared to be the British runners Camden Town (Jersey Stakes) and Topsy (Prix d'Astarte). Head tracked the pacemaker River Bank before accelerating 300m from the finish and won easily by two and a half lengths from Topsy. Assessment In 1978, Bellypha was given a rating of 124+ by the independent Timeform organisation, the \\"+\\" indicating that the horse might be rather better than the rating suggested. In the inaugural International Classification, a collaboration between the official handicappers of France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, Bellypha was rated the seventh-best two-year-old colt in Europe, seven pounds behind Tromos. In the following year the colt was rated 130 by Timeform, one pound behind Irish River and seven behind the top-rated Troy. In the International Classification he was rated the sixth-best three-year-old colt in Europe and the tenth-best horse of any age. Stud record Bellypha was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Alec Head's Haras du Quesnay stud. He was exported in 1989 to Japan where his last foals were born in 2000. He was \\"put out of stud\\" in Japan on 15 September 2001. Bellypha's major winners included: *Boreale, 1981, Prix des Réservoirs *Mendez, 1981, Prix du Moulin, Prix Jean Prat, Prix des Chênes, Prix de Fontainebleau *Bella Colora, 1982, Prix de l'Opéra, Waterford Candelabra Stakes, Lupe Stakes *Silvermine, 1982, Poule d'Essai des Pouliches *Daloma, 1984, A Gleam Handicap, Monrovia Handicap *Lady Bentley, 1984, Oaks d'Italia *Malaspina, 1984, Prix Perth *Val des Bois, 1986, El Rincon Handicap, Prix La Force, Prix Edmond Blanc, Prix du Muguet, Prix de Guiche *Osumi Point, 1990, Keisei Hai *Makiba Silent, 1992, Queen Sho *Hoshu Saloon, 1993, Zen-Nippon Nisai Yushun PedigreeReferences Category:1976 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 16-b ","title":"Bellypha"},{"id":"41505089","text":"Calle Asell (born February 27, 1994) is a Swedish ice hockey player.

Rinehart was a son of mystery writer Mary Roberts Rinehart, a brother of publisher Stanley Rinehart, Jr., and a brother of producer and playwright Alan Rinehart. Early life, education, and career launch Rinehart was born on 14 September 1902 in Allegheny, PA (which has since merged with Pittsburgh, PA). He graduated from the Morristown School in Morristown, NJ (now Morristown- Beard School) in 1920. Rinehart then completed his bachelor's degree at Harvard University in 1924. \\"I was born September 14, 1902 in Allegheny, now a part of Pittsburgh, Pa., of two parents. I went to public and private schools there and in Sewickley until, in 1917, I went to Morristown School in New Jersey...and then to Harvard, which I entered on condition, remained at on probation, graduated from without honors. This was in 1924. ... I started with George H. Doran in 1924, working in the shipping room as long as Mark Weisman could stand.\\" Rinehart began his career in publishing as a worker in the shipping room at George H. Doran. He later served as a book salesman for the company. Farrah and Rinehart In 1929, Rinehart co-founded the publishing house Farrar & Rinehart with Stanley Rinehart and John C. Farrar. Rinehart then served as a vice president. In just a few weeks, Rinehart and his associates began announcing a slate of upcoming publications: * Myron Brinig's Singermann * Paxton Hibben's The Peerless Leader: William Jennings Bryan * Du Bose Heyward's Half-Print Flask * Jacob Zeitlin and Homer Woodbridge's Life and Letters of Stuart P. Sherman * Herbert Gorman's The Incredible Marquis: Alexandre Dumas * Mary Roberts Rinehart's The Romantics Under the leadership of Rinehart and his colleagues, Farrar & Rinehart achieved notoriety for publishing the works of Hervey Allen, Katherine Brush, and Mary Roberts Rinehart. The company also achieved recognition as one of the first publishers of dollar fiction. After Farrah & Rinehart acquired the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation from William Randolph Hearst in 1931, the company began a new division to publish college textbooks. Publishers Weekly awarded Farrah & Rinehart its first Carey–Thomas Award in 1943 for its publication of the Rivers of America Series by literary figures. Rinehart & Co After Farrah left to start Farrar & Straus (now Farrar, Straus, and Giroux in 1946, Farrar & Rinehart changes its name to Rinehart & Company. The new name reflected joint corporate leadership of Rinehart and Frederick Rinehart. Rinehart served as the vice president and Stanley Rinehart served as the president. Rinehart & Company achieved recognition for publishing the first books in Charles Schulz's Peanuts series, as well as works by Faith Baldwin, Stephen Vincent Benet, Norman Mailer, and Erich Fromm. In 1953, the company published The Wonderful World of Insects as the first book printed by the Photon (known as the Lumitype in France), a photographic type composing machine invented by René Alphonse Higonnet and Louis Moyroud. The Photon machine (known as the Lumitype in France) used a photoengraving process to print text and images on paper, which made hotel metal typesetting obsolete. Seven years later, Rinehart & Company merged with Henry Holt and Company and John C. Winston Co. to form Holt, Rinehart, and Winston (now the Holt McDougal Division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). Rinehart served as a vice president at the new company before retiring from publishing in 1963. Philanthropy Rinehart served as President of the Mary Roberts Rinehart Foundation. Incorporated in 1958, the foundation provides grants and editorial advice to promising writers. It also annually awards the Mary Roberts Rinehart Award to a woman writer of non-fiction. Family Rinehart married Elizabeth Sherwood from Geneva, NY. They had one child, Cornelia.

It features an ensemble cast including Shota Sometani and is based on the play of the same name by Shiro Maeda. Playwright Shoji Kokami has referred to the story as an outstanding example of the study of dying in the Theatre of the Absurd. It was released in Japan on February 18, 2012 and was featured at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in June 2012. Plot The film follows 18 individuals in separate but sometimes related groups on the campus of a Japanese university hospital. These groups include a mother and father of an unborn child; a group of friends during a dance rehearsal; staff at the university hospital and a team of students researching urban legends. Ostensibly, the plot is concerned with a mysterious outbreak resembling a viral pandemic which causes the film's protagonists to suddenly die one-by- one. It is suggested during the film that this is due to secret experiments being conducted by the United States Armed Forces in the hospital. However, rather than attempting to resolve the mystery of the outbreak, the focus of the film is largely devoted to the relationships between the characters and their reactions to their own and each other's impending deaths. Ishii has stated the film is made to show the absurdity of the characters not knowing when or why their deaths will occur and highlights the importance of drama and dialogue within the film, in contrast to his previous works.

He creates sculptures from natural materials and through processes of oxidation, burning, and decay, Drew transforms these objects into massive sculptures that critique social injustices and the cyclical nature of existence.  Early life  Leonardo Drew was born in Tallahassee, Florida, but was raised in the projects of Bridgeport, Connecticut, where the city dump occupied every view of his apartment. During his early childhood, Drew often found himself there mining through and creating works from discarded remnants, giving them new meaning. In Existed, “Dust to Dust by Allen S. Weiss\\", Drew stated, “I remember all of it, the seagulls, the summer smells, the underground fires that could not be put out… and over time I came to realize this place as ‘God’s mouth’…the beginning and the end…and the beginning again [sic]… Though I do not use found objects in my work (my materials are fabricated in the studio) what has remained from my early explorations are the echoes of evolution…life, death, regeneration.”  Career  Leonardo began his artistic career at a very young age, exhibiting his work publicly for the first time at the age of 13. His initial work in drawing drew the attention of talent scouts from DC Comics, Marvel Comics and Heavy Metal magazine. After being introduced to abstraction through reproductions of works by artists like Jackson Pollock and receiving inspiration from the process-based work of post-war American and European artists, Drew decided to focus on his fine arts training and immersed himself in exploring his own sense of abstraction. He then went on to attend Parsons School of Design in New York, and received his BFA from Cooper Union in 1985. Number 133 His works are part of several major public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY; The Tate, United Kingdom; The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, NY; Saint Louis Museum, Saint Louis, MO; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, AR; and Pérez Art Museum Miami in Miami, FL. He has also collaborated with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, on a production entitled 'Ground Level Overlay,' and has participated in several artist residencies including those at Artpace, San Antonio and The Studio Museum of Harlem in New York City, among others.  Work  In 1988, Leonardo Drew found his artistic voice when creating his seminal work Number 8, which he believes began everything that followed. It was made of wood, paper, rope, feathers, animal hides, dead birds and skeletal remains. Number 8 was first exhibited at Kenkeleba House in New York City in 1989 where it was \\"immediately recognized as an aggressive assertion of an artistic identity wrought from personal experience and cultural heritage.\\"Schmuckli, Claudia, \\"Being and Somethingness,\\" Existed: Leonardo Drew, D Giles Limited, 2009. Its ominous allure embodies \\"the cyclical nature of existence,\\" a reality that reveals the resonance of life, the \\"nature of nature,\\" a theme that is still prevalent in all of his work. In the early 1990s, Drew began to incorporate the element of rust in many of works by producing it chemically in the studio as well as using collected pieces of scrap metal collected from the streets of New York. These early works from the 1990s were exhibited in several spaces including The Carnegie International. In 1992, Drew had his first major solo exhibition at the Thread Waxing Space in New York, which included a published catalogue with an essay written by writer and critic Hilton Als. The exhibition included many large-scale abstract sculptures made from various materials including wood, rust and cotton. Later on that year, Drew was invited to display work in the Senegal biennial. During his time in Africa, he visited an African slave trading post. Viewing the catacombs and dungeons, he realized first hand of the \\"horrific and claustrophobic conditions\\" that captured Africans had to endure before being shipped out to a life of enslavement. This experience deeply affected the execution and meaning of his work. Number 43 is an example of one of the sculptures he created after visiting Africa. The repetition of hundreds of closely packed rust-encrusted boxes filled with rags and debris referencing and symbolizing the horrid living conditions of the slave. New York Times art critic Roberta Smith describes his large reliefs as “ pocked, splintered, seemingly burned here, bristling there, unexpectedly delicate elsewhere. An endless catastrophe seen from above. The energies intimated in these works are beyond human control, bigger than all of us” Drew is known for creating reflective abstract sculptural works that play upon the dystopic tension between order and chaos. Leonardo Drew’s work is reminiscent of Post Minimalist sculpture that alludes to America’s industrial past. The materials also reference the plight of African Americans in U.S. history. One could find many meanings in his work, but it seems that he is ultimately concerned with the cyclical nature of life and decay, which can be seen in the grid and the transformation of raw material - lumber, steel, canvas, paper - to resemble debris. This method generates an articulation of entropy and a visual erosion of time. Number 43 The mid-career survey exhibition, Existed: Leonardo Drew, was inaugurated in 2009 at the Blaffer Gallery, the Art Museum of the University of Houston and later traveled to the Weatherspoon Art Museum in Greensboro, NC and the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, MA. A monograph of his work was published in conjunction with the exhibition by Giles, Ltd., London, with critical essays written by museum director and curator Claudia Schmuckli and professor and cultural historian, Allen S. Weiss. In 2012, Drew had his fourth solo exhibition at Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in New York that included the publication of a catalogue that chronicles his artistic production from 2007 to 2012 produced by Charta Books. The exhibition featured several large scale installations and works that have been described as imbued with \\"the kind of energetic core typical of many of Drew's sculptures, as is the blurring of distinctions between what's swallowing or bursting from what's natural or constructed.\\"Proenza, Mary. \\"Leonardo Drew,\\" Art in America, January 18, 2013.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Idaho. History Christ Chapel, the first St. Michael's Church. The first services of the Episcopal Church were celebrated in Boise in August 1864 and St. Michael's Church was organized that year by the Rev. Saint Michael Fackler. Two years later the first church building was constructed. It was the first Episcopal church in what is now Idaho, Montana and Utah. The building, later renamed Christ Chapel, stands today on the campus of Boise State University. The women's auxiliary staged concerts, dances and socials and the proceeds went toward the building of the present church building. Construction for the cathedral began on September 7, 1899 and it was completed the following year. The debt was paid off in 1902 and the church was consecrated on May 25 of that year. In the past St. Michael's parishioners supported two other Episcopal institutions in Boise. St. Margaret's Hall, a school for girls, was founded in 1892. Because of the Great Depression the Rt. Rev. Middleton Barnwell converted the school into Boise Junior College in 1932. The school became independent in 1934 and is now Boise State University. St. Luke's Hospital was founded six months after the cathedral's dedication. It is now run by an independent non-profit board. The cathedral tower was part of the original design by architect Henry Martyn Congdon, but it was not completed until 1949.

The Paxtons were part of the Boston School, a prominent group of artists known for works of beautiful interiors, landscapes, and portraits of their wealthy patrons. Her paintings were widely exhibited and sold well. Early life Elizabeth Vaughan Okie was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of Dr. Howard Okie (1846–1902) and Elizabeth Vaughn and had one sister Adele. Education Okie Paxton studied painting at the Cowles Art School, with Joseph DeCamp and Ernest Major. She also took instruction from William McGregor Paxton, who had been a student at Cowles, during his brief tenure teaching at the school. Marriage She was engaged in 1896 to William McGregor Paxton, one of her art instructors, and married him on January 3, 1899. Beginning in 1901, they traveled to Europe together. They often spent their summers on Cape Cod and Cape Ann, and lived in Newton, Massachusetts. As a great beauty, she served as his muse before and during their marriage, modeling for many of his works, like the painting in which she was dressed for the ball. The couple had no children, instead focusing their creative energy on their work. Okie Paxton put her emphasis on her husband's career, managing it before and after his death at the expense of her career. She moved to Boston's Fenway Studios after her husband died. William McGregor Paxton's papers—including sketches, correspondence, and photographs—are held at the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The papers include Okie Paxton's correspondence about her paintings, exhibitions, and sales of her husband's works. It also contains sketches of her by Paxton. Career Continental Breakfast, 1907.The Breakfast Tray, circa 1910, private collectionRed Apples, oil on canvas, . Of the Bostonian women artists born in the 19th century, most came from families that provided sufficient financial means to open their own studios and pay for their education. Fortunately, Boston was a city that had a number of great teachers who would teach women, including her husband, William Gregor Paxton; Edmund C. Tarbell; Philip Hale; and William Morris Hunt. Education for women occurred in separate classes and at a higher cost than that for men. Women often went on to study in Europe. Generally women stuck to domestic and still life scenes. Many women married late, regardless of when they married, they often struggled with managing the traditional roles of wife and mother with their career as an artist. Okie Paxton, considered by one art critic to be a better painter than her husband, \\"painted ravishing still lifes of moments in time\\". But like Lilian Westcott Hale, who was also a talented artist married to an artist, her career was less important than that of her husband. Okie Paxton utilized light, texture, and color like that of other artists of the Boston School. Her painting, Continental Breakfast, was shown at Rowland's in Boston and described on May 17, 1907, The Breakfast Tray is a provocative bedroom scene. Rather than show pristine interiors typical of the Boston School, however, Okie Paxton depicted a sensual, messy environment, indicating a modern sensibility and sexuality of the occupants. Her work resembled Modernism, rather than the more traditional Boston School. Another modern bedroom scene was used in a Wamsutta sheet advertisement. Her work provided insight into a new emerging woman in the intimate details revealed in the painting: By shifting from interior scenes to still life works, Okie Paxton avoided competing with her husband's subjects. Copper Jug with Apples is a still life of a table dressed with a white tablecloth upon which a copper-handled jug, three apples and a green cup and saucer. The painting was priced at $4,600 in 2011. Exhibitions and collections The Open Window, 1922, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Okie Paxton exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia in 1916 and 1917. She showed in six Corcoran Gallery of Art biennials between 1912 and 1941 and ten exhibitions at the National Academy Museum and School. In 1913, she exhibited The Breakfast Tray, which was called a \\"dainty yet sound canvas\\", at the National Academy. She also exhibited at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 and won a silver medal for In the Morning. Okie Paxton exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair. She was awarded the Ann Vaughan Hyatt (later Anna Hyatt Huntington) gold medal at the American Artists Professional League, New York, and the National Gold Medal at the Council of American Artists' Societies, New York, 1964. Her works are held in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Maryhill Museum of Art, Goldendale, WA; and the Concord Art Association, Concord, MA. Because her works sold quickly to private collectors when exhibited, she is not well represented in public collections. Legacy * On an April 25, 1943 broadcast, Barbara Walker said of Okie Paxton's work: * Her work, The Breakfast Tray,—along with that of William Merritt Chase, Alice Neel, John Singleton Copley and Roy Lichtenstein— appears in Art and Appetite: American Painting, Culture, and Cuisine, edited by Judith A. Barter. * Okie Paxton's work was represented in a 2001 exhibition of women artists at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts entitled \\"A Studio of Her Own:Women Artists in Boston 1870–1940\\". The works of Polly Thayer, Gertrude Fiske, Gretchen Rogers, Lilian Westcott Hale, and Ellen Day Hale were shown. Three of Paxton's works were exhibited: The Breakfast Tray (); The Open Window (1922), reminiscent of Johannes Vermeer; and the subtly hued Breakfast Still Life ().

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is significant as the home of prominent civic leader George Newton, the son of Cass County pioneer Col. James Newton. History James Newton was born in England in 1777, and emigrated as a boy to the United States. His family settled near Morristown, New Jersey; later Newton moved on to Pennsylvania, and then, in 1804, Ohio. He commanded a regiment of Ohio militia, earning the rank of Colonel, and served in the War of 1812, commanding at times both Fort Black and Fort Meigs. James Newton's son George Newton was born in 1810 in Preble County, Ohio in 1810. Both George and his father James moved to Cass County in 1830 and settled down to farm. James Newton served as a member of the 1835 Michigan Constitutional Convention, and as a member of the Michigan House in 1837/38 and 1838/39. James Newton died in 1844. George Newton married Esther Green in 1837; the couple had two children. He followed his father into public service, and was elected to multiple local offices. In addition, he served as a member of the Michigan House in 1858/59. In 1865, Newton commissioned architect Christian G. Haefner to design this house. George Newton died in 1883. In 1931, Fred Russ purchased the house and the surrounding 580 acre parcel of timberland. In 1942, he gifted the land to Michigan State University. The University Forestry School used it as the Fred Russ Experimental Forest. The house was restored by the Cass County Historical Commission. As of 2013, the house operated as a public museum, the Newton House Museum. Description The George Newton House is significant as an unusually well-preserved example of an Italianate country villa. It is a two- story house clad with clapboard and a hip roof topped with a belvedere. A veranda runs across the front of the house and a hip roof ell projecting to one side. Overhanging eaves and a classical cornice run under the roof.

Writing under the pseudonym \\"Cholly Knickerbocker\\", he coined the term \\"Café Society\\". The name \\"Cholly Knickerbocker\\" was owned by the Hearst Newspaper Syndicate, and Paul was the first, writing under the nom de plume from 1917 until his death in 1942. Early years and career Paul was born in Philadelphia to William Henry Paul and the former Eleanor Virginia Biddle, who were members of the Social Register. He was a member of the Sons of the Revolution and the Society of the War of 1812. He attended the Episcopal Academy and later graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1914, he began his career as a newspaperman at the Philadelphia Times. His apprenticeship was brief, and he was soon hired by the New York Press as society editor. In 1917, he moved to Hearst's New York American, where he took over the \\"Cholly Knickerbocker\\" gossip column that focused on members of high society. In addition to coining the phrase \\"Cafe Society\\" to describe the people who frequented tony night clubs and expensive restaurants, he also invented the expression \\"The Old Guard\\" (the \\"Four Hundred\\") for the venerable New York families. Paul focused on the very well-born and extremely rich. In addition to his daily column, each week he wrote three features for the Sunday edition of the American. The column and features were carried by the over 60 newspapers of the Hearst syndicate. Death On July 17, 1942, Paul died of an illness caused by a heart condition at his New York City home. He was 52 years old. He was succeeded as Cholly Knickerbocker by Igor Cassini. His funeral was held on July 20 at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Manhattan. His remains were later shipped to Florida and interred at the Caballero Rivero Woodlawn Park North Cemetery and Mausoleum in Miami where Paul owned a summer home.

The certification program’s emphasis on strategic supply chain integration, along with procurement and supply management, prepares the practitioner to move beyond tactical thinking in order to generate strategic solutions and to evolve continually in the rapidly changing supply management environment. Since the certification program's inception, ISM has granted nearly 13,000 CPSMs and has current CPSM holders in 68 countries. History Up until 2008, the highest credential that ISM offered was the Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) designation, which the organization first offered in 1974. The C.P.M. required qualified applicants to pass four exam modules that measured their aptitude in areas such as purchasing, supplier relations, quality issues, business law, personnel challenges, diversity and more. As respected as the C.P.M. was in the procurement profession, ISM determined that a new level of certification was needed to address the evolving needs of the supply management professional and the increasing complexity of business, including the intricacies of globalization. ISM’s development of the CPSM qualification allowed it to move beyond a narrow focus on purchasing to roles that require a broader knowledge of supply management and leadership. With the introduction of the new qualification, ISM discontinued testing for the C.P.M. designation and transitioned it to a recertification-only status. During a transitional period that ended in 2015, ISM offered those holding a C.P.M. qualification the opportunity to take a bridge exam to qualify for a CPSM certification. Criteria To obtain a CPSM designation, the association requires candidates to have three years of full-time, professional supply management experience (nonclerical, nonsupport) with a regionally accredited bachelor's degree or international equivalent or five years of supply management experience (nonclerical, nonsupport) without a degree. Before qualifying for the CPSM designation, candidates must pass three exam modules. Exam Focus Each of the three required CPSM exam modules has a different focus. The exam modules can be taken in any order. Exam 1: Foundation of Supply Management * Cost & Finance * Contracting & Negotiation * International * Social Responsibility * Sourcing * Supplier Relationship Management Exam 2: Effective Supply Management Performance * Forecasting * Logistics * Materials & Inventory Management * Organization/Department Assessment * Planning * Project Management * Product Development * Quality Exam 3: Leadership in Supply Management * Leadership * Risk & Compliance * Strategic Sourcing Maintaining Certification To maintain the integrity of the credential, ISM requires CPSM holders to continue learning and developing their skills throughout their career. The CPSM certification is valid for three years, and the holder must apply for recertification to maintain the designation. To be eligible for recertification, CPSM holders must earn 60 hours of approved continuing education through any combination of: * Taking semester-long college courses. * Attending seminars, conferences, and educational programs; teaching courses; and publishing journal articles. * Participating in work-related training (either taken or taught) involving business-related topics. * Contributing to the profession (holding certain offices in ISM or an ISM affiliates). * Retaking CPSM exams (during a certain time frame) or obtaining a Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD) certification from ISM. After a designated one-year grace period, a professional whose certification has lapsed must retake all three exams.

The novel tells the story of an Australian doctor haunted by memories of a love affair with his uncle's wife and of his subsequent experiences as a Far East prisoner of war during the construction of the Burma Railway. Decades later, he finds his growing celebrity at odds with his feelings of failure and guilt. The title is taken from the 17th century epic Oku no Hosomichi, the travel diary and magnum opus of Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō.  Plot summary  Dorrigo Evans has found fame and public recognition as a war veteran in old age, but inwardly he is plagued by his own shortcomings and considers his numerous accolades to be a “failure of perception on the part of others”. He knows that his colleagues consider him a reckless and dangerous surgeon, and he has habitually cheated on his faithful and adoring wife, though his public reputation has been undented by the air of scandal that trails him in his private life. Flashbacks describe Dorrigo’s early life in rural Tasmania, and his love affair with Amy Mulvaney, the young wife of his uncle and the love of his life. Dorrigo meets Amy by chance in an Adelaide bookstore and he finds that \\"her body was a poem beyond memorising\\". Despite the fact that she is married to his uncle, Dorrigo felt the affair was justified because \\"the war pressed, the war deranged, the war undid, the war excused\\". In a metaphor for the novel's theme of fatalism, Amy observes while swimming a group of fish trying \\"to escape the breaking wave’s hold. And all the time the wave had them in its power and would take them where it would, and there was nothing that the glistening chain of fish could do to change their fate.\\" After the end of the affair, he joins the Australian Imperial Force. His regiment is captured during the Battle of Java and is sent to labour on the notorious Burma Death Railway. One out of every three workers engaged on the Burma Death Railroad died during its construction. During the construction of the railroad, he is reluctantly bestowed the leadership over his fellow prisoners and fights a losing battle to protect his charges against disease, malnutrition and the violence of their captors. Dorrigo sadly observes as the bodies of his fellow POWs break down and disintegrate with \\"eyes that already seemed to be little more than black-shadowed sockets waiting for worms\\". The camp's commander, Major Nakamura, a methamphetamine addict who pushes his prisoners harder and harder out of the fear of failing the Emperor, is in his own way just as much a prisoner of the railroad project as the men he brutalises. A major theme of the novel concerns the Australian value of \\"mateship\\"-a sense of camaraderie and loyalty-or the absence of \\"mateship\\" on the Burma Death Railroad. Among the POWs is the energetic and hardworking Tiny Middleton who wants \\"to show them little yellow bastards what a white man is\\" by overfilling his work quotas, thereby inspiring the Japanese to set higher work quotas that lead to the deaths of the weaker POWs. Other POWs include the artistic Rabbit Hendricks who secretly makes drawings of camp life; the white supremacist Rooster MacNeice who has trouble accepting he is now a prisoner of the Japanese; and the defiant Darky Gardiner who is repeatedly beaten by the guards and finally drowns himself in a latrine full of excrement rather than endure another beating. The Burma Death Railway today in Thanbyuzayat, Burma After the war, the fates of the prisoners and captors are shown. The \\"Goanna\\", a Korean man renowned for his brutality in the prison camp who was himself forced into the Japanese army, is hanged for his crimes. His superior officer, Major Nakamura, returns to Tokyo and avoids capture as a war criminal by hiding among the ruins of Shinjuku. After a conversation with a Japanese doctor who served with Unit 731 in Manchukuo reveals to him the country’s human experimentation program during the war, he gradually absolves himself of any sense of guilt for his actions. Other Australian soldiers imprisoned with Dorrigo live through the trauma of their experience as prisoners. Dorrigo’s own acts of heroism, and the reverence of his fellow soldiers, fail to assuage his sense of shame and self-loathing. Dorrigo comes to \\"feel the more people I am with...the more alone I feel\\". Background Flanagan wrote that his father's experience as a Japanese prisoner of war influenced him to write the book. The character of Evans was also partially based on the Australian hero Edward “Weary” Dunlop, an Australian Army doctor who struggled despite overwhelming odds to care for the men who suffered and died during the construction of the Burma Death Railroad. Like Dorrigo, Dunlop bargained with the Japanese officers in attempts to improve conditions for the \\"living skeletons\\" that were his fellow POWs. And like Dorrigo, Dunlop found that many of the Japanese and Korean guards were sadists who thoroughly enjoyed inflicting misery on others. Domain Parklands, Melbourne. The character of Dorrigo Evans is partially based on Dunlop.  Reception  The novel was critically acclaimed both in Australia and internationally on its release, with Man Booker judge chair AC Grayling praising it as a \\"remarkable love story as well as a story about human suffering and comradeship\\". It was shortlisted for the 2014 Miles Franklin Award. The Australian critic Daniel Herborn praised the book as: \\"A story that is both harrowing and deeply humanist, The Narrow Road to the Deep North has been billed as Flanagan's most personal work, inspired by his father's stories of his POW experience. It is also perhaps his most ambitious, a deeply felt attempt to come to terms with the almost unimaginable horror of the Death Railway.\\" The Australian critic Roger Pulvers felt that the novel was well written, but misleading about the Burma Death Railroad, as he noted that 90% of the people who died building the railroad in 1942-43 were Asian while the novel gives the impression that it was primarily Australians who died constructing the Death Railroad. Pulvers also felt that the novel's Australian characters were better drawn than the Japanese characters, noting what the novel presents as a peculiar \\"dichotomy\\" of the Japanese between a delicate, graceful and poetical sensibility vs. a tendency to enrage in outrageously savage cruelty that is almost incomprehensible could be just as easily said of other peoples such as the Americans and the Germans as well. The Australian novelist Thomas Keneally wrote the book was \\"..a grand examination of what it is to be a good man and a bad man in the one flesh and, above all, of how hard it is to live after survival\\".

It is similar to collectible card games (CCGs) in that each player has their own deck. However, unlike CCGs, the cards are not sold in randomized packs, and the majority of the deck is built during the game, instead of before the game. Typically, the cards provide a type of game currency that allows players to buy more cards to add to their decks.  History  The original deck-building game was Dominion, whose popularity spurred the creation of many others: notably Thunderstone, Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, Legendary (based on Marvel superhero comics) published by Upper Deck and Clank! published by Renegade. The term \\"deck- building game\\" has come to be more commonly used for a broader range of games that combine deck-building with other elements; some games, such as the Mage Knight board game, include deck-building elements but do not feature them as the primary focus of gameplay.

For example, Dominion can be played online via a web browser, and Star Realms.  Roguelike deck-building games  A novel version of the tabletop version of deck-building games are roguelike deck-building games. Typically single-player games, these games combine the deck-building aspects of Dominion and others with procedurally generated scenarios and rewards, a fundamental principle of roguelike games. These games require the player to build out their deck on the fly, usually having to add cards from a random selection as a reward for completing objectives. While the first known example of such a game was Dream Quest, the genre gained momentum with the release of Slay the Spire in 2017.

Intermittent motion cam follower-mechanism. A dwell mechanism (either a linkage or cam- follower type) is an intermittent motion mechanism that alternates forward and return motion with holding position(s).Uicker, J. Pennock, G. & Shigley, J. (2010). Theory of Machines and Mechanisms (4th ed.). Oxford University Press, p. 201. Single vs. double dwell=Single dwell cam mechanisms= In a single dwell cam mechanism, there are three motion functions that follow each other and then repeat: a dwell, a rise, and a return function. It is sometimes desired to use a rise function such that its acceleration does not become zero at its end. To maintain continuity of acceleration, the return function should begin with a non-zero acceleration that matches the end of the rise function. There are a number of functions that can provide these motion requirements. A double-harmonic function is a common example used for single dwell.Norton, R. (2008) Design of Machinery (4th ed.), McGraw Hill, p.427 =Double dwell cam mechanisms= A typical arrangement of a double dwell Cam mechanism will contain the sections rise-dwell-fall-dwell and will be a piecewise function. The position of the follower remains stationary during the dwells causing velocity, acceleration, and jerk to equal zero.Doane, J. (2015) Machine Analysis with Computer Applications for Mechanical Engineers (1st ed.), Wiley, p299 Dwell with linkage mechanisms Stephenson III dwell mechanism with prismatic joint. Simulation done with MeKin2D. Linkage mechanisms can only provide approximate single dwell, and require a minimum of six links. A four- bar linkage mechanism must be picked first to provide the appropriate coupler curve with a circular region (or approximate circular region). A two-link dyad is then added to provide the output link with the desired dwell motion.Norton, R. (2008) Design of Machinery (4th ed.), McGraw Hill, p.147 The concept for linkage dwell mechanisms is that a node located at the center of the circular arc segment of a coupler curve will remain relatively stationary. Therefore, actual dwell time will depend on the length of the approximate circular arc in the coupler curve. Initial designs may need optimization to improve the dwell characteristics.Doane, J. (2015) Machine Analysis with Computer Applications for Mechanical Engineers (1st ed.), Wiley, p167 Applications Cam-follower dwell mechanisms are used in pairs in sewing machines to operate the four motion feed dogs, with one cam moving the dog up and down, and the other cam moving the dog forwards and backwards. The cams in this application are usually phased 90 degrees apart allowing a pause in the up/down movement of the dog while it is being moved forwards/backwards. A separate adjustable sliding block or link is used to control the amount of forwards/backwards movement of the dog. Industrial applications include loading and unloading parts, or transporting a part to a machine and holding it in place for a manufacturing process.Doane, J.

He exerted tremendous influence as an educator, notably at Juilliard where he transformed the teaching of musical theory; and later as the author of books including the popular \\"Fundamentals of Sight Singing and Ear Training\\" (co-authored with Arnold Fish). He continued to influence and champion the arts as creator of the Rockefeller Foundation's arts program and its first director. He was the son of David Lloyd, a steel mill worker and minor league baseball player, and grandson of William Lloyd, a coal miner who immigrated to the United States from Wales in 1845. His professional career began as an 11-year-old piano accompanist for silent films in the early 1920s. He received both his bachelor's and master's degrees from NYU, where he studied musical composition under Aaron Copland. It was also at NYU that Lloyd met fellow piano accompanist Ruth Dorothy Rohrbacher, whom he married in 1933 and with whom he collaborated on books and musical projects throughout his life. They had two sons, David and Alex. In the mid-1930s, Lloyd was hired to work as a pianist and composer in the newly created summer dance program at Bennington College, alongside legendary choreographers Martha Graham, José Limón, Doris Humphrey and others. During the summers at Bennington, he scored many enduring works for dance, including \\"Panorama\\" for Graham and \\"Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias\\" with Humphrey choreographing for Limón. The Bennington collaboration of artists during those years is considered by many to be the foundation of modern dance as an American art form. Lloyd went on to serve as Director of Education at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City from 1946 to 1949, where he established a new dance division with Martha Hill as director, and invited Graham, Limón and other Bennington choreographers to join the faculty. During this period, he and Juilliard president William Schuman designed a new and innovative approach to the study of musical theory entitled, \\"The Literature and Materials of Music,\\" which shifted the emphasis away from textbooks and rigorous ear training to discussion and direct pedagogy by composers in the classroom. He and Schuman were committed to teaching music from a more holistic approach that would \\"make responsible adults of musicians.\\" The new curriculum was intended to disrupt what the two men considered to be an overly insular culture and rigidly formal training regimen at Juilliard, and effectively altered the course of American musical education towards the more comprehensive and progressive path on which it remains today. Lloyd also continued to compose works for leading choreographers, including José Limón's 1947 work, \\"La Malinche,\\" as well as chamber works for the piano and violin. He worked tirelessly as a teacher and educator and his influence can be felt in the works of the many students who passed through Juilliard during his tenure. He eventually left Juilliard in 1963 to serve as Dean of the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music; he received a Doctorate of Music from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music the same year. In 1965, he left Oberlin to create the Rockefeller Foundation's arts program, serving there as Director of Arts Programming until 1972. He published a number of books during his career, including the beautifully written and illustrated \\"Golden Encyclopedia of Music,\\" \\"Fireside Book of Favorite American Songs\\" and \\"Fireside Book of Folk Songs.\\" He played a pivotal role in the re-emergence and popularity of Scott Joplin's ragtime tunes some 30 years after the Depression when he persuaded Vera Brodsky Lawrence to edit, \\"The Complete Works of Scott Joplin.\\" Lloyd died of leukemia at his home in Greenwich, CT in 1980. His legacy is a varied one, with his impact felt in diverse aspects of the arts over four decades. His overall impact on American music is considerable, though, and continues to resonate today.

She was launched in 1888, and remained in service until 1935. Constructed in the United Kingdom, Stanley was deployed along the East Coast of Canada for use as a ferry and lighthouse and buoy supply vessel and was used for icebreaking during winter months. Description Stanleys design was based on icebreaking vessels of Swedish design for use in the Baltic Sea. Of Siemens- Martin steel construction, Stanley had a bowsprit and a clipper bow. The ship had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 914 tons and was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The ship was powered by steam from a triple- expansion engine driving a single screw. This created (nominal) and gave the vessel a maximum speed of . The ship was certificated for passenger service in Canada. Service history Stanley was ordered by the Government of Canada following complaints by Prince Edward Island that Canada was not following through on its constitutional commitments to the province. The existing icebreaker, , was found to be in poor shape and was withdrawn from service. The construction of an icebreaker was ordered from Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow, Scotland at their yard in Govan with the ship's launch on 16 October 1888. Stanley was named for Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, and completed in November 1888\\\\. Upon entering service in 1888, Stanleys primary function was to provide winter passenger ferry service to Prince Edward Island, making daily trips from Charlottetown and Pictou, Nova Scotia until the ice forced the ship to work from Georgetown, Prince Edward Island. Even though she was capable of breaking ice, the ship sometimes remained caught in it when the ice became too thick. During the spring, once regular ferry service could be resumed, Stanleys duties were shifted to lighthouse and buoy supply. During the summer months, the ship was used as a fisheries patrol vessel in the Atlantic fisheries. During autumn, Stanley reverted to lighthouse and buoy supply. In 1910 Stanley and sailed to Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait to survey the routes to Churchill and Port Nelson, Manitoba, returning to the area in 1912. On 2 May 1922, Stanley rescued an American steamer, , when she was disabled off the coast of Cape Breton Island. In July 1927 a scientific expedition based on the aboard Stanley and the commercial vessel was tasked to determine the safe navigation season for vessels using the new port facilities at Churchill, Manitoba, the only port on the Arctic Ocean connected to the North American railroad grid. The Aviators of Hudson Strait, a 1973 Canadian short documentary film produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) for the Department of National Defence, was made of the 1927–1928 expedition. The ship was withdrawn from service in 1935. The ship was sold in 1936 for scrap and the scrapping was completed first quarter of 1937.

Rinehart was a son of mystery writer Mary Roberts Rinehart and a brother of book publishers Stanley Rinehart, Jr. and Frederick Roberts Rinehart. Early life and education Rinehart was born in Allegheny, PA (which has since merged with Pittsburgh, PA) in 1900. He graduated from the Morristown School in Morristown, NJ (now Morristown-Beard School) in 1919. During his time at the school, Rinehart wrote stories and poetry for The Morristonian, the student newspaper. After studying at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Rinehart received his bachelor's degree from the School of Mining at the University of Pittsburgh. During the period between his studies at the two universities, Rinehart worked as a cowboy in the Western U.S. Career and military service Rinehart joined the Story Department at Paramount Pictures Corporation in 1931. He worked as an editor and producer for Paramount. Rinehart also worked as a correspondent and national affairs editor at Time Magazine during its early years in the 1920s. During World War II, Rinehart served as a special assistant to the War Shipping Administration's East Coast Director. He worked as a convoy truant officer. Rinehart also served in the U.S. Marines during World War I. In 1930, Rinehart penned the play Volcano. Messmore Kendall, owner of the Capitol Theatre, acquired it in November of that year. He tasked Robert Milton with staging the play. Farrar & Rinehart, the publishing company run by Rinehart's brothers, published the play's text in wide release. Purchase of Cabbage Island In 1936, Rinehart bought Cabbage Island, a 100-acre island located five miles from Pine Island, Florida.

Known for its futuristic design, it featured 40 wood-floor bowling lanes, a game room, a lounge, and a coffee shop that eventually became a Mexican diner. Built during the advent of Googie architecture, its Polynesian Tiki-themed styling extended from the large roadside sign to the building's neon lights and exaggerated rooflines. When Kona Lanes was demolished in 2003, it was one of the last remaining examples of the Googie style in the region; its sister center, Java Lanes in Long Beach, was razed in 2004. Much of Kona's equipment was sold prior to the demolition; the distinctive sign was saved and sent to Cincinnati, where a portion is on permanent display in the American Sign Museum. Costa Mesa's planning commission approved a proposal to build a department store on the site; following public outcry, those plans were scrapped. In 2010, the still- vacant land was rezoned for senior citizens' apartments and commercial development. Construction on the apartments began ten years after Kona Lanes was demolished. History=Early years= Kona Lanes before (top) and after a remodel taming its \\"ostentatious rooflines\\" (Scott Martelle, Los Angeles Times) Kona Lanes opened in 1958, featuring the Tiki-inspired signage and architecture that became popular following World War II, including what the Los Angeles Times called its \\"flamboyant neon lights and ostentatious rooflines meant to attract motorists like moths\\". The building on Harbor Boulevard near Adams Avenue was one of three in the Googie style that architects Powers, Daly, & DeRosa designed at around the same time; Kona Lanes and its sister center, Java Lanes, used names that suggested South Pacific island locales. Author Andrew Hurley called them \\"expensive and attractive buildings that screamed, 'Have fun here, and Kona retained much of that atmosphere over the years. Its massive neon-lit street sign remained for the life of the building, and Kona was the only bowling establishment in the area to reject automatic scoring equipment throughout its existence. Kona Lanes hosted the Southern California PBA Open twice in 1964; Billy Hardwick won in April and Jerry Hale in December. Longtime general manager Dick Stoeffler,During the PBA Southern California Open finals on December 21, 1964, ABC-TV announcer Chris Schenkel referred to Stoeffler as \\"general manager, part-owner and resident pro\\". known at the time as the producer and host of TV Bowling Tournament on KTLA, finished third during the televised finals in his own building in December, behind Hale and Hardwick. When Stoeffler rolled back-to-back 300 games in one league session at Kona in 1968, he was one of only four men in the United States to have managed the feat. =Peak years= Champions who bowled at Kona Lanes during its 45-year history include three- time Professional Bowlers Association Tour winner Jack Biondolillo; six-time male Bowling Writers Association of America Bowler of the Year and future PBA Hall of Famer Don Carter; John Haveles, an Orange County Bowling Hall of Fame inductee who began a stint as Kona's manager in 1974; future Michigan Women's Bowling Association Hall of Famer Cora Fiebig; two-time female BWAA Bowler of the Year Aleta Sill; repeat bowler of the year and WIBC Hall of Famer Donna Adamek; and Barry Asher, the multiple PBA Tour champion and Hall of Fame inductee who later ran the pro shop at Fountain Bowl in nearby Fountain Valley.. Kona Lanes and Tustin Lanes hosted nearly 10,000 teams of five players each taking part in the United States Bowling Congress Women's Championships in 1986. Under Dick Stoeffler's management, Kona Lanes kept busy 24 hours a day, which made him one of the most successful proprietors in the country. Stoeffler met his future wife there; other couples had similar experiences, including at least one wedding. Kona was often so busy that customers had to make reservations to get a lane during open (non-league) bowling hours. At its peak, Kona Lanes averaged more than 80 lines on each of its 40 lanes. Bowling as a participation sport flourished in the early 1960s, but its popularity was diluted due to overbuilding; the number of bowling alleys sanctioned by the then-American Bowling Congress peaked at about 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was one of more than 30 in southern California alone. A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the customer base remained steady because an increase in open bowling made up for fewer league bowlers. Kona Lanes in 1960 (top) and in 2002 Jack Mann bought Kona Lanes in 1980 and re-branded it New Kona Lanes the following year. Mann's family owned several bowling centers in the region; he was behind the creation of Fountain Bowl in 1973 and the short-lived Regal Lanes in Orange in 1974. He also owned Tustin Lanes before selling it to his youngest son, Alex. Mann bought Kona not because he loved bowling, but because it would continue to pay dividends if he was no longer able to work.Pignataro, \\"Goodbye, Nude Bowling\\". \\"[Mann:] Ironically, nobody in my family is a bowler.\\" He later sold Kona to his son Jack Jr. =Music= The center's lounge, the Outrigger Room, hosted many local artists over the years. Jazz quintet The Redd Foxx Bbq released four songs recorded there, and Roscoe Holland recorded a set of eight live performances for his album Beyond the Reef. In later years, much of the bowlers' area was taped off for rock concerts and weekend promotions like Club Crush, which proved popular among teenagers and also led to album recordings. A planned event featuring a local punk rock group was shut down by the Costa Mesa Police Department, leading to negative publicity. =Decline and demolition= Kona Lanes continued to lose business to newer centers, despite efforts to appeal to a more diverse customer base by hosting local music acts, supporting a Polynesian-themed restaurant called Kona Korral, and promoting gimmicks like \\"nude bowling\\". Eventually, the property became more valuable than the business. The landowners, C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, gave Jack Mann Jr. a choice: spend $10–20 million to update the center, or give it up. Mann chose the latter rather than spend such a sum on a site without a long-term lease. Plans to build a Kohl's department store on the site occupied by Kona Lanes and the already-closed Edwards Cinema Center and Ice Capades Chalet were approved by the city's planning commissioners, but they were met with resistance by neighbors who did not believe the store was a good fit for the area. Then-mayor Karen Robinson complained that Costa Mesa's policy-makers were discarding recreation as part of the quality of residents' lives, and appealed the commissioners' decision in February 2003. The city council later rejected the proposal. The continuing efforts to save Kona Lanes failed; it closed for good in May 2003 and was demolished soon after. =Rezoning and new use= The 7.5-acre parcel was rezoned in 2010 for senior housing that was expected to provide a new customer base for the restaurants and retailers already in the area and for commercial developments still to come. The lot had sat unused for about ten years before construction on the 215-unit complex began; Azulón at Mesa Verde opened in 2014. Several dozen palm and eucalyptus trees were saved and replanted on the site. Legacy=Closure and community response= The surviving KONA LANES section of the sign on display in the American Sign Museum in 2014 Activity at Kona Lanes increased in its final days, due to the nostalgic value of potential keepsakes. Manager Juanita Johnson said people were asking to buy furniture, office equipment, and more. \\"Some of that is older than I am.\\" The more substantial items, including the original wood lanes, had been sold off prior to demolition, while dumpster divers hit the parking lot each day, looking for any items of interest. The loss of Kona Lanes was a repeated topic at political events. One Costa Mesa city council candidate said he made a commitment to public service when the building was torn down with little resistance. Another would-be council member agreed that the demolition should never have happened. In 2012, Costa Mesa made plans to upgrade The Triangle, a retail space along Harbor Boulevard two miles south of the Kona Lanes site. Those plans featured a 10-lane bowling alley that opened in 2014. One city official said the center answered residents' longtime call for a new, upscale bowling facility. =Historic roadside sign= The huge, neon-lit KONA LANES BOWL sign was featured in publications by the Costa Mesa Historical Society, along with The Book of Tiki and Tiki Road Trip;; ; . it also inspired professional paintings, and was one of several Costa Mesa landmarks memorialized in a mural painted on the local Floyd's 99 Barbershop. In 2003, Costa Mesa Planning Commissioner Katrina Foley led an effort to save the sign from the scrap heap. Thanks in part to a private donation, the marquee was trucked 2,500 miles to Cincinnati, one of the first 20 signs accepted by the American Sign Museum. The \\"Kona Lanes\\" portion was refurbished and put on permanent display; the larger \\"Bowl\\" section buckled and tore during the unloading process and could not be saved.

Sir Walter Raleigh was the owner of the charter for the Roanoke/Virginia Colony. Roanoke Colony was financed by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who drowned in 1583. Sir Humphrey Gilbert's half brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, attained his brother's charter to colonize North America from Queen Elizabeth I on March 25, 1584, and proceeded to fulfill the charter through Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville, Raleigh's distant cousin. On August 17, 1585, Ralph Lane, along with 107 men, built a fort on Roanoke Island as Grenville sailed back to England for supplies. By April 1586 conditions on Roanoke Island had decayed; the expedition had destroyed a nearby village occupied by indigenous people resulting in retribution against the fortifications on Roanoke Island. As luck would have it, Sir Francis Drake visited the Roanoke Colony on his way back to England in April 1586. Recognizing the dire conditions of the expedition he rescued the remaining members of the Roanoke Island expedition. One of the men in this expedition was named Joachim Gans, a Jew from Prague who was the best metallurgist in all of Europe at that time and the first Jew to set foot in the New World under the British Flag.

II, Nr. 7, Pg. 29 Trabant was shot and killed by East German border guards during a crossing attempt, one of only eight women victims of the Berlin Wall, and was the only escapee victim known to have a record of loyalty toward the East German regime. Biography Hildegard Trabant's former residence at Richard-Sorge-Straße 64 (then, Tilsiter Straße 64), in Berlin-Friedrichshain, taken in 2014 Richard-Sorge-Straße 64, in Berlin. This is the front door to the former residence of Hildegard Trabant, in Berlin- Friedrichshain, taken in 2014 Hildegard Trabant's grave at the Friedhof Nordend, in Berlin-Rosenthal. Marked as UH Him – B102, taken in 2014 Map of the Friedhof Nordend, in Berlin-Rosenthal. The location of Hildegard Trabant's grave is highlighted in yellow. Hildegard Pohl was born on 12 June 1927 in Berlin, Weimar Republic, and grew up in the city. She was loyal to the East German regime, having joined the governing Socialist Unity Party in 1949 at the age of 22, where she was valued as an active party member. In 1954, she married Günter Horst Trabant, a People's Police officer who was employed in the passport and registration division; the couple had no children due to a lower abdomen operation that rendered Hildegard unable to bear children.Stasi Records Agency (BStU), Ministry for State Security (MfS) File AS 754/70, Bd. II, Nr. 7, Pg. 40 The Trabants lived in an apartment complex on Tilsiter Straße 64 (now Richard-Sorge-Straße), in the Friedrichshain district of East Berlin, near U-Bahnhof Frankfurter Tor.Annett Gröschner, \\"Aus Anderer Sicht/The Other View\\" (pg 625), July 2011, Hatje Cantz, Page 48 of the registry from – the Friedhof Nordend, Berlin-Rosenthal. Possibly facilitating their residence there, Trabant was a property manager in the Kommunale Wohnungsverwaltung Friedrichshain, a municipal housing administration in Friedrichshain.Stasi Records Agency (BStU), Ministry for State Security (MfS) File AS 754/70, Bd. II, Nr. 7, Pg. 6 Death On 18 August 1964, Günter Trabant reported to his office that he had not seen his wife since 7:00 in the morning the day prior, 17 August, and that some of her clothes were missing. At 6:50 in the evening the same day, Hildegard Trabant was shot trying to cross the border between East Berlin and West Berlin. Trabant had attempted to leave via a disused S-Bahn line between S-Bhf Berlin-Gesundbrunnen and S-Bhf Berlin-Schönhauser Allee, and had managed to overcome the inner wall, but was discovered by East German border guards as she was hiding behind some shrubs before reaching the other side. She ignored verbal challenges to come out from behind the shrubs and surrender. Instead, she ran back towards the inner wall and East Berlin, to avoid arrest. One of the guards fired a warning shot to get Trabant to stop, but when she continued to run, a second shot was fired, hitting her in the back. Trabant died about an hour later at the \\"Police Hospital\\" (\\"Krankenhaus der Volkspolizei\\" – now known as the \\"Army Hospital\\" (\\"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus\\"); she was 37 years old. In the presence of his superiors, as well as in the presence of the Stasi case worker, Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant) Horst Hase, her husband Günter was either unable or unwilling to comment on circumstances which led to her attempted flight from East Germany. It is unknown why Trabant decided to flee East Germany. Evidence suggests her motives may have been of a personal nature, possibly involving domestic violence. The Trabants were known to have had several major domestic clashes, which caught the attention of Günter's supervisors within the police force. Trabant had no other known relatives in East Germany at the time of her death, as her mother was deceased, her father was in a nursing home in West Berlin, and her only other known relative, a Günter Pohl, was in Marl-Drewer, North Rhine-Westphalia, in West Germany.Stasi Records Agency (BStU), Ministry for State Security (MfS) File AS 754/70, Bd. II, Nr. 7, Pg. 5Bericht der DDR- Grenztruppen über den Fluchtversuch und die Erschießung (Report of the GDR border troops about the escape attempt and the shooting) Hildegard Trabant was one of only eight women killed at the Berlin wall, among the total of at least 140 victims, and one of only four women who attempted this crossing alone. Further, of the at least 101 Berlin Wall victims that were classified as escapees or attempted escapees, she was the only one who had a record of loyalty toward the East German regime. Burial Hildegard Trabant was buried on 23 September 1964 at the Frieden-Himmelfahrt Cemetery (now the Evangelischer Friedhof Nordend), north of Pankow, in Rosenthal. She was buried in a \\"linear grave\\", i.e., a grave which expired after the 20 years allowed under East German law without becoming a \\"family grave\\" which the family continued to maintain, or another family member was buried more recently there. This period of resting \\"expired\\" in 1984, and this particular section of the cemetery was rearranged. Her urn is still there, like all urns buried there, but it is now under another grave number, and under another name on the tombstone. Her previous grave number was UH Him – 234a and the \\"new\\" grave number is UH Him – B102. Aftermath Unlike almost all other deaths at the Berlin Wall, Hildegard Trabant's death went totally unnoticed in West Berlin. It would only be 26 years later, after the reunification of Germany in 1990 when the 1964 East Berlin files were given to the German federal judiciary in October 1990. After a lengthy trial, Kurt Renner, the guard who shot her, was found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to one year and nine months in prison, which was commuted later to probation.Comparison of the Crime Scene Sketch and the Report on Escape Attempt and Shooting of the GDR Border Troops at Chronik der Mauer.de Also unlike almost all other deaths at the Berlin Wall, it was obvious that when she was actually shot she had abandoned her attempt to escape East Berlin, and was merely fleeing back towards the inner wall to avoid arrest.

Construction commenced on 27 December 2013http://szdaily.sznews.com/html/2013-12/30/content_2738108.htm and public testing started on 30 June 2017, with the system fully opening on 28 October 2017. The tram system integrates the north side of Longhua into the city's rail network and is expected to significantly ease commuting difficulties, especially since the northern extension of Shenzhen Metro Line 4 is still being planned. The initial system consists of 11.7 km and three lines. The tram links Qinghu Station on Line 4 of the Shenzhen Metro with central Guanlan, with service to Longhua areas including Automobile Industry City, Guanlan Strategic New Industries Park and the Science and Technology Service Center. It will eventually connect with Shenzhen Metro Line 4 at Xinlan Station. There are 21 stations, constructed at a cost of about 1.38 billion yuan (US$226 million). It is expected to help residents commute and relieve traffic congestion in the local area. A 3.8-kilometer spur links Guanlan New Industry Park with Dahe Road. The spur is expected to cost 218 million yuan.  Lines  There are 2 lines in operation; line 1 (Qinghu – Xiawei) & Line 2 (Qinghu – Xinlan). Lines 1 and 2 share tracks between Qinghu and Dahe, where they branch off. Line 3 formerly connected Xiawei with Xinlan, passengers travelling between Xiawei and Xinlan are now required to transfer at Dahe for a connection. Services formerly ran at a 20-minute frequency on each of Line 1, Line 2 and Line 3 with the parallel section between Qinghu and Dahe receiving a 10-minute frequency. To meet demand, services on Line 3 were withdrawn on 27 December 2017, and a 12-minute frequency was provided on Line 1 and Line 2, with a 6-minute frequency on the parallel section as these flows accounted for 94% of the demand. This provided an 87% increase in transport capacity. From 28 June 2018, an 8-minute frequency is applied on Line 1 and Line 2, with a 4-minute interval on the parallel section to meet increasing demand during peak hours. To meet the desired density, all the trams are put into service, the first in railway transport industry. * Line 1: Qinghu – Xiawei. 8.6 km. * Line 2: Qinghu – Xinlan. 6.8 km.  Rolling stock  Rolling stock consists of 4 section trams constructed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive, using technology from Siemens. The system does not use overhead wires, with trams recharging an onboard capacitor from fixed power bars above the tracks at each stop.  Discussion  Zhao Pinglin, deputy director of Shenzhen Rail Construction Headquarters, said tram systems have shorter, cheaper construction periods than metro and light rail. Modern tram systems also have lower energy consumption, more flexibility and quieter operations, Zhao said. Longhua is planning three tram lines totaling 51 kilometers. Construction of metro projects can take four to five years and cost 600–700 million yuan per kilometer, while tram lines can cost about 100 million yuan per kilometer and be used for 30 years. The tram has been criticized for roughly following the path of the under construction north extension of Shenzhen Metro Line 4 rendering the project redundant. However, given that the goal of the tram project was to improve short distance transport and serve as a feeder line to the metro, the tram project will complement the Metro extension rather than compete with it.

The Tunisian Constitution of 2014 affirmed Tunisia as a civil state founded on citizenship. It also declared Islam as Tunisia's religion.2014 Constitution of Tunisia adopted on 26 January 2014 The following religious festivals are recognized as national holidays: the Islamic New Year, the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha.Country profile: Tunisia, The United States Department of State, September 2012.  History  In 1956, Tunisia achieved formal independence from France. In 1956–1987, under the leadership of Habib Bourguiba, the first President of the Republic of Tunisia, Tunisia’s post independence government pursued a program of secularization.Elizabeth Shakman Hurd. Secularism and Democracy in the Middle East, Center for the Study of Islam & Democracy (CSID), May 16, 2003. Bourguiba, \\"who has been one of the most avowedly secularist political strategists in the Arab world\\",Nazih N. Ayubi. Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World. Routledge, 1991. modified laws regarding religious endowments (habus), secularized education and unified the legal system so that all Tunisians, regardless of religion, were subject to the state courts. He restricted the influence of the religious University of Ez-Zitouna and replaced it with a faculty of theology integrated into the University of Tunis, banned the headscarf for women, made members of the religious hierarchy state employees and ordered that the expenses for the upkeep of mosques and the salaries of preachers to be regulated.Nazih N. Ayubi, p. 113. Moreover, his best known legal innovation was the ‘Code du Statut Personel’ (CSP), the laws governing issues related to the family: marriage, guardianship of children, inheritance and most importantly the abolishing of polygamy and making divorce subject to judicial review.Laurie A. Brand. Women, the State and Political Liberalization: Middle East and North Africa Experiences, p. 178. Bourguiba clearly wanted to undercut the religious establishment’s ability to prevent his secularization program, and although he was careful to locate these changes within the framework of a modernist reading of Islam and presented them as the product of ijtihad (independent interpretation) and not a break with Islam, he became well known for his secularism. Following increasing economic problems, Islamist movements came about in 1970 with the revival of religious teaching in Ez-Zitouna University and the influence which came from Arab religious leaders from Syrian and Egyptian Muslim Brotherhoods.Nazih N. Ayubi, p. 114. There was also influence by Hizb ut-Tahrir, whose members issued a magazine in Tunis named Azeytouna.Azeytouna Magazine Government-induced secularization triggered the formation of the Islamic Tendency Movement; the movement and its leader Rached Ghannouchi turned into a rallying point for government opponents.An Introduction to International Relations, ed. by Richard Devetak, Jim George, and Sarah Percy. Cambridge University Press, p. 365. In the aftermath, the struggle of Bourguiba and then Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who succeeded him, with political Islamists went out of control, and in order to suppress the opposition the Islamist leaders were harassed, tortured, and exiled.John L. Esposito, p. 167.  Post-Arab Spring developments  The Arab Spring changed government in Tunisia and resulted in adoption of the Tunisian Constitution of 2014 following a considerable debate between Islamic and secular political groups and movements.George Sadek, Senior Legal Information Analyst. The Role of Islamic Law in Tunisia’s Constitution and Legislation Post-Arab Spring, The Law Library of Congress, May 2013. On 1 March 2011, after the secularist dictatorship of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali collapsed in the wake of the 2011 Tunisian revolution, Tunisia's interim government granted the Ennahda, a moderate Islamist movement in Tunisia, permission to form a political party. Since then, the Ennahda Islamic Party has become the biggest and most well- organized party in Tunisia, so far outdistancing its more secular competitors. In the Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011, the first free election in the country's history with a turn out of 51.1% of all eligible voters, the party won 37.04% of the popular vote and 89 (41%) of the 217 assembly seats, far more than any other party.Tunisia's New al-Nahda Marc Lynch 29 June 2011 In 2016, Ennahda rebranded itself as the post-Islamist political party of Muslim Democrats drawing a line between religion and politics.Monica Marks.

The new law also includes provisions on harassment in public spaces and economic discrimination. It also abolished “marry-your-rapist law”.https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/27/tunisia-landmark- step-shield-women-violence Since September 2017, Tunisian Muslim women are allowed to marry non-Muslim men. The ban has been in place since 1973. Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi argued that the ban “violated Tunisia's constitution”, and that he wants to create \\"total, actual equality between men and women citizens in a progressive way\\".https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/tunisia-muslim-women- marry-non-muslims-first-time-decades-islamic-sharia-religion-a7948916.html Under Islamic law, as per Quran, a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry outside the Islamic faith (a non-Muslim).Quran 2:221, 60:10 In addition to the afromentioned, Tunisian parliament is working on changing inheritance rights to make them equal for men and women. In addition to codifying equal inheritance, the Parliament advocates abolishing the death penalty, decriminalizing homosexuality and annulling dowries. Such rapid changes provoked a backlash from Islamists, conservatives and even some moderates who view it as “an unwelcome departure from Islamic values.”https://www.al- monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/08/tunisia-president-women-equal-inheritance- rights.html  Civil state  A compromising notion of a Civil state that merges concepts of a Secular state and an Islamic state was suggested by Rached Ghannouchi.Nader Hashemi.

He was the son of mystery writer Mary Roberts Rinehart, the brother of publisher Frederick Roberts Rinehart, and the brother of producer and playwright Alan Rinehart. Early life, education, and career launch Rinehart was born on August 18, 1897 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (which has since merged with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). After studying at Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh, he graduated from the Morristown School in Morristown, New Jersey (now Morristown-Beard School) in 1915. Rinehart then studied at Harvard University before leaving school to serve in the U.S. Army during World War I. During his days at Harvard, Rinehart served on the Editorial Board of the Harvard Lampoon, a humor magazine. Following his war service, Rinehart began a career in publishing as a worker in the advertising department at George H. Doran. After taking on the position of advertising manager, he also served as the company's secretary and as a member of its Board of Trustees. Farrar & Rinehart In 1929, Rinehart co-founded the publishing house Farrar & Rinehart with Frederick Rinehart and John C. Farrar. Rinehart then served as the company's founding president. In just a few weeks, Rinehart and his associates began announcing a slate of upcoming publications: * Myron Brinig's Singermann * Paxton Hibben's The Peerless Leader: William Jennings Bryan * Du Bose Heyward's Half-Print Flask * Jacob Zeitlin and Homer Woodbridge's Life and Letters of Stuart P. Sherman * Herbert Gorman's The Incredible Marquis: Alexandre Dumas * Mary Roberts Rinehart's The Romantics Under the leadership of Rinehart and his colleagues, Farrar & Rinehart achieved notoriety for publishing the works of Hervey Allen, Katherine Brush, and Mary Roberts Rinehart. The company also achieved recognition as one of the first publishers of dollar fiction. After Farrah & Rinehart acquired the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation from William Randolph Hearst in 1931, the company began to publish college textbooks. In 1943, Publishers Weekly awarded Farrah & Rinehart its first Carey–Thomas Award for publication of the Rivers of America Series by literary figures. Rinehart & Co After Farrah left to start Farrar & Straus (now Farrar, Straus, and Giroux) in 1946, Farrar & Rinehart changes its name to Rinehart & Company. The new name reflected joint corporate leadership of Rinehart and Frederick Rinehart. During this period, Rinehart & Company achieved recognition for publishing the first books in Charles Schulz's Peanuts series, as well as works by Faith Baldwin, Stephen Vincent Benet, Norman Mailer, and Erich Fromm. In 1953, the company published The Wonderful World of Insects as the first book printed by the Photon (known as the Lumitype in France), a photographic type composing machine invented by René Alphonse Higonnet and Louis Moyroud. The Photon machine (known as the Lumitype in France) used a photoengraving process to print text and images on paper, which made hot metal typesetting obsolete. Seven years later, Rinehart & Company merged with Henry Holt and Company and John C. Winston Co. to form Holt, Rinehart, and Winston (now the Holt McDougal Division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). Holt, Rinehart, and Winston named Rinehart and Charles F. Kindt Jr. (president of Winston) as the company's senior vice presidents. Rinehart served in that role until retiring in 1963. During his career, he also served as a president of the National Association of Book Publishers. Military service Rinehart enlisted in the U.S. Army as a private. Rising to the rank of lieutenant, he trained troops in the tactics of trench warfare. Rinehart later requested a transfer to the front lines to see his mother, who then worked as a wartime correspondent for The Saturday Evening Post. Rescuing motorists on Bronx River Parkway On April 1, 1940, Rinehart rescued two individuals from a dangerous driving situation on the Bronx River Parkway. A defective muffler in the car of Fred Lindsey and his wife had begun leaking carbon monoxide fumes during their drive from Scotia, New York. After the fumes knocked Lindsey semi-unconscious and his wife fully unconscious, their car began swerving from one side of the Parkway to the other, and it narrowly missed several head-on collisions. Risking a collision himself by driving alongside, Rinehart shouted to Lindsey to turn off the car ignition and steer the car toward the grass shoulder. The shouting aroused Lindsey from his semi-conscious state, which enabled him to do the actions requested by Rinehart. Running to the now halted car, Rinehart pulled Lindsey and his wife to the safety of fresh air. The New York State Police later drove them to Ossining Hospital. Family Rinehart married Mary Noble Doran on June 24, 1919. After they divorced, he married Frances Alice Yeatman. Rinehart had three children: George, Stanley III, and Mary.

It regroup various evangelical churches, parachurch organizations, and foundations, and is one of five Christian groups legally recognized by the Thai government. History Following World War II, many evangelical missionary groups began missionary work in Thailand, including OMF International, the Southern Baptists, WEC, New Tribes Mission, Finnish Free Foreign Mission, Marburger Mission, Presbyterian Church in Korea (K.I.M.), Child Evangelism Fellowship, Christian and Missionary Alliance and Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada. Alex Smith, Siamese Gold, A History of Church Growth in Thailand: An Interpretive Analysis 1816-1982 (Bangkok: Kanok Bannasan (OMF Publishers Thailand),1982) 222, 226. These groups chose to not work under the existing national church, the Church of Christ in Thailand (CCT), due to concerns about that denomination’s ecumenical activity and ties to the World Council of Churches and the mainline American denomination Presbyterian Church (USA). These varied evangelical groups worked independently from both the CCT and each other, but in the mid-1950s a number of them decided that inter- denominational and inter-organizational co-operation and fellowship was needed. This desire on the part of both evangelical missionaries and Thai Christian leaders led to the formation of the Evangelical Fellowship of Thailand (EFT). The EFT was formally recognized as a legal entity on June 19, 1969, and its first moderator was Rev. Suk Phongnoi.

Its aims are the promotion of the Irish language as a living tongue in America and throughout the world, and the re-establishment of the Irish language as the spoken language of Ireland with English as a supplement. History The society was one of several that had their genesis in letters published in the Irish-American journal The Irish World in 1872 by Mícheál Ó Lócháin, recommending that Irish language classes and Irish language organizations be established. Ó Lócháin, a teacher by profession, started the first such class (instruction for adults) in Brooklyn in 1872.Ó Buachalla, p. 38 Formal societies followed: the Boston Philo-Celtic Society in 1873 and the Brooklyn Philo-Celtic Society in 1874.

O'Donovan was an honorary member of the Boston society. In 1881 Ó Lócháin founded An Gaodhal, the Society's bilingual monthly magazine.Ó Buachalla, p. 38 He died in 1899. In the period 1878 - 1899 other Philo-Celtic Societies were founded, though their activities had little to do with the language. After 1904 most declined and vanished, a fact attributed to a general view among the Irish that the language was irrelevant to their economic and social advancement in America.Ó Dochartaigh, p. 87 The Brooklyn and Manhattan societies had merged into the New York Philo-Celtic Society by 1945. By the 1970s promotion of the language was practically dormant. An attempt was made in 1993 to re-organize the Society so as to place more emphasis on Irish. This attempt failed, but in 2004 language activists succeeded in returning to what they regarded as the original aims of the Society.Cumann Carad na Gaeilge/The Philo-Celtic Society: History: http://www.philo-celtic.com/history.html Activities The Society’s members offer support to other Irish language groups and to students throughout the world, supply CDs and books, and provide teaching materials and classes.

When the Scottish Executive looked at reorganising rural health care in 2004 there were local protests: following this there were calls to work more closely with the Belford Hospital in Fort William. A new audiology unit was opened by Rhona Brankin, deputy health minister, in 2005.  Services  Since this facility opened it has been possible for a number of services to be run from one location, where previously they had been provided from some smaller facilities located across the district. A range of services are provided and the hospital has 66 inpatient beds and a multi-purpose day hospital. There is also a midwife-led service to provide maternity care. In September 2009 it achieved stage 1 of the baby-friendly accredition programme. A multi-disciplinary team treats patients who are admitted to the hospital following a stroke. The stroke team offers continuity to patients from admission to the point of discharge and even into the community, where appropriate.

It is located in Kericho in Kenya.  History  The ideological heritage of educational instruction at the Kenya Highlands Bible College, which became the University, dates back to 1932 when missionaries of World Gospel Mission saw the need for training their converts. This instruction not only needed to cover biblical and ministry-related subjects, but also teacher training. Teachers were prepared for the sixteen primary schools the mission had started. These first teachers also served as preachers in their communities. A school first started in 1936 in the Sotik area as a Teacher's Bible School and met in various locations. In 1944, the school was officially opened as Sotik Bible School and courses continued to combine training techniques in primary school teaching and Bible. The following year, the Bible School students were separated from the teacher training group as the need for trained leadership for the church grew. In 1950 the school was relocated from Sotik to Cheptenye in Belgut area. Due to the need for more space to develop classrooms, dormitories, library and chapel facilities and staff housing, another plot was sought which would be separate from the established mission stations. The present site was acquired in 1953, and in 1955 Kenya Highlands Bible School was begun, offering a two-year Bible programme leading to the Christian Workers Certificate. In 1957 the course was upgraded to include a three-year programme leading to a diploma in Bible. In 1962, the level of admission and training was again elevated to provide training on a secondary level in both biblical and secular subjects, and the name was changed to Kenya Highlands Bible College. In 1967 the college started offering secondary school education up to 1973 when it ceased offering “O” level. In 1970 the Bible College Council was constituted, drawing its membership equally from the church and the mission, and charged with the responsibility of managing the institution and improving the academic standards. In 1971 the college admitted its first class of post-secondary students into a four-year curriculum, modeled after degree-granting Bible colleges in North America, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Religion in Biblical Studies. Accreditation In 1989 the college was registered by the Commission for Higher Education to operate as a private College and is now a candidate for accreditation. The College Council and the Administration have been meeting regularly with the Commission to bring facilities and academic programmes up to recognized College standards. Throughout their history, the Africa Gospel Church and World Gospel Mission have sought to respond to the needs of the church and community by developing and upgrading their educational training programmes. The current phase of upgrading to Kenya Highlands Evangelical College is a product of this development as the college continues to strive to be faithful to scriptural truth and relevant to its culture by its educational objective of equipping students for ministry through academic excellence and practical experience.

He has described how his body was discovered to be different or \\"incomplete\\" in his teens; after two surgeries he had to undergo several years of invasive procedures. Cabral Grinspan describes how homophobia is a driving force in the normalization of intersex children, and how surgeries send a message to children that their bodies have to be changed to be acceptable. Cabral Grinspan defines the social challenge of intersex histories as a need to be open to the experience of body diversity without the need to medicalise that experience.

The genus contains a single described species, Afromyrma petrosa. Afromyrma is known from a single Upper Cretaceous fossil, which was found in Orapa in the Central District of Botswana.  History and classification  Afromyrma is known from a solitary fossil from Orapa, the holotype, specimen number BP/2/26501 tentatively identified as a female, though there is a possibility this is incorrect. The holotype specimen is mostly complete but is rather poor in details, and is preserved as a compression fossil in shale. The shales and mudstones of the Orapa site were rapidly deposited in a crater lake formed as the result of a large volcanic eruption in the Cretaceous. The sediment originated as an epiclastic kimberlite and derives from rapid weathering and decomposition of the sides of the kimberlite crater. Of the four major sedimentation types that have been observe at Orapa, fossils are found in only two, the granular mass flows and the fine-grained sediments: woody debris fossils are found in the granular mass flows, but well-preserved fossils are only recovered in the fine-grained sediments. The fossil-bearing stratum was uncovered during mining of the underlying diamond-bearing rocks at the site. radiometric dating of the kimberlite pipe reported on in 1977 gave a general age between . Further dating utilizing zircon crystals reported on in 2004 gave more defined age of approximately placing the date in the Turonian age of the late Cretaceous. The fossil was first studied by Russian paleontologists Gennady M. Dlussky and Alexandr Rasnitsyn with South African paleontologist Denis Brothers. Their 2004 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal Insect Systematics and Evolution. The genus name Afromyrma is a combination of Africa, where the fossil was found, and the Greek myrmex which means \\"ant\\". The specific epithet petrosa, a derivation of the Latin word petra meaning rock is a reference to the fossil status of the species. Description The solitary Afromyrma specimen is incomplete and shows poor preservation in general with portions of the legs and antennae missing or very indistinct. Overall it is estimated the full body would have been around long. Overall the shape of the head capsule is shorter than it is wide, with eyes located slightly to the rear of the heads midpoint and having an oval shape. The mandibles are triangular in outline with distinct teeth on the chewing margin. The specimen has a waist divided into two segments and the petiole shows a weakly developed node. The abdomen segmentation and general form of the abdominal apex are suggestive of a male ant, but the soft nature of the abdominal tissue makes this interpretation problematic, in contrast the harder head capsule is more reminiscent of a female and thus the fossil is interpreted as such.

Partially constructed in 1869, the planned two-story structure was never completed and the mint was never put into operation. Located in the downtown area of the city, the building was given to the state before it was sold to the public. The Mint building was most recently home to the Erin Glenn Winery. History In 1860, gold was discovered in Idaho, and this along with a gold rush in Eastern Oregon created a need for a mint in the Pacific Northwest.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 167. Although the American Civil War was underway, 80,000 prospectors headed for the gold fields in 1862. Raw gold dust was used as currency in The Dalles because gold had to be shipped to the San Francisco Mint for processing. Demand grew for a mint closer to the mines. Oregon U.S. Senator James W. Nesmith introduced an unsuccessful bill in 1862 to create a mint in Portland, Oregon. On July 4, 1864, Congress passed a bill to authorize a new branch of the mint at The Dalles (then known as Dalles City) for minting gold and silver coins. The next year another bill unsuccessfully attempted to change the location for the mint to Portland. William Logan was appointed as superintendent of the planned mint, but he died in the shipwreck of the S.S. Brother Jonathan en route to The Dalles. Mary Laughlin donated a block of land on June 6, 1865, as a site for the mint and in 1869, construction finally began with Harvey A. Hogue as the superintendent of construction. However, the project was repeatedly delayed, and as the gold rushes waned and the Central Pacific Railroad opened, the mint become obsolete before the building could be completed and the minting equipment could be installed. The basement and first floor were completed in 1869, but in 1870 the construction was suspended, and officially abandoned in 1873. A fire destroyed much of the city in 1871, but the fact the mint was in the middle of the city block served as a firebreak and helped stop the fire. In 1875, the federal government gave the structure to the State of Oregon, who in turn sold it to private interests in 1889. By 1940, the building was being used by the Columbia Warehouse Company. A fire in 1943 damaged the mint building, which in 1947 was repaired. The structure was also owned by Ralph's Transfer & Storage Co. before becoming the home of the Erin Glenn Winery in 2007 after a $1.5 million renovation. Structure The single story, high granite building also has a basement. The building has a flat roof, with arched windows. Stone for the building was quarried from Mill Creek and shipped by wagon to the site. The building measured by and cost $105,000.

He was the co-founder of the Ringling Bros. World's Greatest Shows, which eventually became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He was called the \\"Lieutenant General\\" of the Ringling family. Upon his death, the New York Times described him as \\"a man of great ideas and ambition, and an executive of force and character.\\" He was nicknamed \\"The King\\" in the circus business. Early life William Henry Ringling was born in 1858 in Baraboo, Wisconsin. He was nicknamed \\"Otto\\". His parents were Marie Salome (Juliar), of Ostheim, France, and Heinrich Friedrich August Ringling (1826–1898), of Hanover, Germany. He was the third of the Ringling brothers to be born, following Albert and Augustus. He was born into a musical family, with each member of the family being able to play an instrument. Baraboo became an economically unstable town, and the family relocated to Iowa. Ringling, along with his brothers, made horse harnesses in McGregor, Iowa. Eventually, the brothers started touring in Iowa, playing music. Circus career and mid- life Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus Kings: Otto Ringling (pictured top) After concert tours, the brothers got involved in the circus. During the early days of the Ringling Bros. circus, Ringling took tickets and money, and served as publicist. He was called the \\"Lieutenant General\\" by his brothers, becoming the head of the family and the family business. He was responsible for bringing the talents of his brothers, and eventually blending the merged Barnum & Bailey shows, into solid performances. He was the primary decision maker regarding the company finances and business decisions. Ringling was described as recluse, and remained single his entire life, never marrying. He cared for horses, loved books, and studied mathematics. His favorite books were history, classics, and contemporary literature of the day. When he traveled with the circus, he had his own private train car, equipped with his own library. Later life and death Starting in 1909, Ringling suffered from Bright's disease. In 1910, he sent John Ringling his will and testament. Ringling trusted John more than any of his brothers, as John showed the least interest in the monetary and business aspects of the family business. Ringling died suddenly, in 1911, at the home of John, located on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York. He was buried in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Legacy Upon his death, he left trust money to his sister and numerous nieces and nephews. He also left money to staff members. Among his brothers, he left money and his Renault. He also requested that his portrait be removed from future promotional materials. The brothers did not remove his image, instead, they stopped using the group portraits in any of their advertising.

In May 1884 just 3 months after its registration the Kate was put forward to the Colonial Treasurer in a tender for the \\"supplying and maintaining an efficient steam tug for use at the Cape Hawke River\\". Mr. F. Buckle submitted the tender describing the Kate as a steam tug of 25 hp and asked for a subsidy of £600 per annum a £250 per annum greater than the steam tug Forster which also entered the tender and hence the Kate stayed in Sydney Harbour Over the summer months the vessel was also used for Harbour cruises in February 1885 following the Kirby-Moore Trophy sculling race whilst in October 1886 > Capt.

Two of the Prince of Wales crew found themselves able to climb on board the Peterborough at the moment of the catastrophe, whilst the steamer Kate, which had by this time come up and searched for the two others, who were missing with the assistance of the Kate's lifeboat. The Peterborough was later taken in tow by the tug Kate and brought into Sydney Harbour =Later career with the Mercantile Explosives Department 1887 - 1914= On 4 February 1887 at 3:15pm Richard Manning sold his 64/64 shares in the vessel to the colonial government of NSW and the vessel was placed into service with the NSW Mercantile Explosives Department The Mercantile Explosives Department was formed within the Treasury Department to manage the mercantile explosives formerly the responsibility of the Ordnance Storekeeper. This was eventually to evolve, in 1902, into the Explosives Department. In 1922 this Department transferred to the Department of Mines. It managed the explosives hulks in Middle Harbour, and later the Bantry Bay magazines. Captain Bellett February 1887 - October 1902  Captain Henry Denham Bellett was a veteran pioneer of Sydney Harbour Ferry Service and was then appointed to the Mercantile Explosives Department, firstly as the master of the steamer Sea Breeze, and then to the Kate. He remained master of the Kate for 17 years until he entered upon his retirement in October 1901 In October 1888 Captain Bellett saw the body of Henry Meyer floating in the water near Milsons Point who was a 50 years of age a native of Germany, and a butcher by occupation who had been drinking to excess lately, and appeared to be depressed in spirits whose dead body was found floating face downward From early 1891 to late 1895 the Kate made monthly trips to Barrenjoey towing powder barges In early January 1891 the officers of the Colonial Secretary's Department held their annual picnic on board the steamer Kate they steamed to various noted spots in the harbour, and eventually lunched at Fig Tree Point. In August 1891 Thomas Crawley (Jr.) was appointed to be engine driver of the steam launch Kate on the death of his father Thomas Crawley (Snr.) In April 1895 the launch Marvel left for Sydney from Barrenjoey and sank. The Government steamer Kates crew witnessed the foundering, but seeing that the crew were rescued by the ketch Theresa, the steamer kept on her course. =1898 Collision and sinking with the Manly Ferry Narrabeen (I)= the Paddle Wheel Manly Ferry Narrabeen which sunk the SS Kate Raising of the SS Kate after its collision with the Paddle Wheel Manly Ferry Narrabeen On 22 August 1898, the ferry Narrabeen left Manly at 07:15 and ran into a dense bank of foe shortly after leaving, and had to slow down and proceed cautiously up the harbour. After leaving the lightship nothing was seen till the lookout called 'full speed- astern,' and then was seen the stone wall of Garden Island a few yards ahead. Speed had just been got on the boat again after backing out, when the cry again came to go astern. This time it was too late, as there was seen coming around the corner of the island the Government steamer Kate towing a powder lighter bound for Broken Bay. The Narrabeen struck the Kate just forward of amidships, tearing a large hole in the woodwork. The engines of both steamers were going astern. The captain and crew, of the Kate scrambled aboard the Narrabeen with the Kate soon disappearing stern first. The Powder Lighter Me Mel was being towed, with four men on board, after the collision, let go the tow rope, and was within an ace of going ashore on the island. The Kate sank in about , of water, and is not in the main fairway between Garden Island, and Fort Denison or Pinchgut about to the east ward of the No. 6. naval buoy, which is just inside the point of Garden Island. The Kate was then raised later that week by Messrs. Sheehy and Sons and towed it to near Farm Cove to be patched before being put on a slip At the time of the collision, the Kate was estimated to be worth about £1500. The subsequent Marine Board inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the collision found that the collision was due to the dense fog, which prevailed at the time, and to the fault of James Drewette, the master of the Narrabeen =Continued Service after Re floating= at around the time that SS Kate was used as a powder boat in training exercises In April 1889 the Kate assisted with the New South Wales Naval Brigade in training exercises (as a powder boat) for , which had been formed in 1863 and consisted of five companies, four of which were in Sydney and with an overall strength of 200 men. A year later in August 1899 the Kate was again assisting the four Sydney based Companies of the Naval Brigade Naval Artillery Volunteers, when they rowed a race in whalers over the harbour for £10 in prizes subscribed by the officers of the corps. A Company was allowed 45 seconds start, and rowing well were never caught, winning by over a length from B Company, which had 10 seconds start C Company was scratch, and D Company had 30 seconds allowance the steamer Kate and launch Gladys followed the race, which caused considerable intend A very fine crew was out for practice from the IS Naval Brigade It is reported this crew will shortly tackle the men-of warsmen in a whalers race for a fairly large stakes On 14 August 1901, acting master of the Kate, William John Weldon, went alongside the ship Wray Castle in Watson's Bay and asked the master of the ship, Thomas Doran, if he had any explosives aboard. Doran said, 'Only safety cartridges and fuses'. The acting master of the Kate asked again, 'Are not the fuses electric detonators?' and Doran replied, 'They are only fuses'. Weldon again hailed the captain, and told him to get cases up for examination and ten cases were taken out. They contained electric detonators, and were passed into the powder boat. Captain Doran was informed of a bench for having ten cases containing detonators on the ship while it was in Port Jackson, and to the westward of Garden Island, contrary to the provisions of the Gunpowder and Explosives Consolidation Act of 1876. Doran was given a fine of £2 and 6s 6d costs ofcourt was imposed Captain Jeremiah Collins November 1902 - April 1914 On 12 March 1906 the brothers, William Edward and Peter Henry Dessaix were anchored off Pine Point in Middle Harbour, at about 7.15 a.m. in the skiff Toreador they saw the steam launch Kate, with a powder barge in tow, coming from the powder hulks in the direction of the open harbour. The launch got within two or three lengths of the skiff, and as the brothers Dessaix saw that she was not altering her course, Peter Dessaix called out, 'Look out! Alter your course, or we will be run down.' At this time, so the brothers say, there was no one at the wheel of the Kate. Again and again Peter yelled out, and then someone rushed to the wheel, and attempted to alter the course The Kate, almost immediately struck the skiff on the bow, and the powder barge coming along also hit the boat. The brother went overboard, and the collision bloke the bow of the boat, which half-filled During the marine court of inquiry into the collision with the skiff Toreador shortly after the evidence had been opened a point arose as to whether the Court had jurisdiction to hold tho inquiry as \\"nothing in this Act shall apply to any ship belonging to or in the service of the crown\\" and the Kate was a ship within the meaning of that section and additionally as the Toreador was a skiff and was propelled by oars it was not a ship within the meaning of the Act causing the inquiry to close The Explosives Department budget for 1 July 1910, to 30 June 1911 also show that Captain Collins wage increased from £168 to £174 per annum On 25 May 1911 there were a hundred or so of passengers on board the tourist steamer Kookaburra owned by Sydney ferries late in the afternoon when the vessel was between the Bluff and Green Point Middle Harbour in close proximity to the powder hulks. The passengers became aware that something was wrong, it became known that a fire had broken out just over the boiler. In a short space of time many small boats were around the Kookaburra the steam launch Kate moored close by was the first to make fast alongside and the crew of the Kate to assist in extinguishing the flames.  Collision and sinking  Bellubera which struck and sunk the SS Kate off Dobroyd Head On 2 April 1914, the Kate after having left middle harbour and had then taken a lighter to Manly earlier in the morning, and had landed at the Manly cargo wharf. The tug then left and was towing the lighter up the harbour to Woolloomooloo Bay, when just past Dobroyd Head the master of the Kate saw a half-sunken boat out to seaward of him, some away. Thinking there might be someone in her, he \\"starboarded\\" the helm to go over, and after swinging about four points to port, straightened up, and then saw the ferry Bellubera forward of his port beam, or yards away, and coming straight for him. The ferry had left Manly at 07:45, and when off Dobroyd she approached the Kate, which was towing a small lighter from the hulks in Middle Harbour. The Bellubera was overtaking the Kate, and when just about up to Dobroyd, heading south by west, a little out of its usual course, the Kate was on his starboard bow, some ahead, and to the eastward. Suddenly the Kate \\"starboarded\\" across the bow of the Bellubera, which was going at about 12 knots. In a few moments the Kate was almost under the ferry boat's bow. The Bellubera's engines were put full astern, and 20 seconds later the collision occurred. The Kate was heading about due east, and the Belluberain the same direction as when she left. The Bellubera struck the tug almost amidships, and cut right into her. The captain Bellubera saw that the tug was sinking, and immediately ordered the Bellubera's lifeboat to be launched to pick up the occupants of the tug. Lifebuoys were also thrown to the men, two of whom had scrambled onto the bottom of the lighter, which had been capsized by the collision. the members of the Kate's crew, consisted of Captain J. Collins, Thomas Crawley Jnr.(engineer), A. Webb (deckhand), and H. Arnemann (steersman on the lighter) The Bellubera was very little the worse for the bump, and, apart from having some paint scratched off, did not suffer any serious damage. On her arrival at the Quay, however, she still bore traces of the collision, as pieces of wreckage from the sunken tug were hanging from her belting for a distance of about . A piece of copper piping, apparently from some part of tho tug's boilers, was found twisted and jammed In between the rudder and the vessel. This was removed, and the Bellubera again took up her running after having missed only one trip. At the marine court it was found that the collision was caused by the master of the Kate in altering his course to investigate the sunken boat. It was held, however, that the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with a Government vessel; but it was added that it was questionable whether, under the circumstances, even if it had the power, it would penalise tho master In any way, as he was obviously acting with the very best intentions Further reading Only image of the Kate that can be found very poor quality http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114332711 Manly Council also has a document on the Powder Hulks at Bantry Bay which Kate was used in conjunction with http://www.manly.nsw.gov.au/DownloadDocument.ashx?DocumentID=1546 References Category:Shipwrecks of the Sydney Eastern Suburbs Region Category:Ships sunk in collisions Category:Ships built in New South Wales Category:1883 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1886 Category:Maritime incidents in 1898 Category:Maritime incidents in 1906 Category:Maritime incidents in 1914 Category:1871–1900 ships of Australia Category:1901 – World War I ships of Australia Category:Wooden steamships of Australia Category:Tugboats of Australia Category:Steam tugs ","title":"SS Kate (tug)"},{"id":"41508250","text":"Call of the Shofar was an organization based in Baltimore, US, focusing on personal and relational transformation.

History The book was published in 2010 by Harvard University Press and is licensed under the Creative Commons license by-nc-sa (Attribution–Noncommercial–ShareAlike). Synopsis Boon has dealt with the issue of copies, imitations and the concept of the original. Starting from the observation that copying is a universally popular, but often criminal practice, he developed a point of view which holds that the distinction between copy and original is for practical purposes only. Boon argues in the book that for everything in the universe there already is a copy, as much as everything is original. Therefore, it is impossible under ethics to ban the copy, since it is impossible not to copy. The distinction between originality and copy creates an artificial boundary which in truth does not exist. Copies are the principle on which the universe rests, even at the molecular level all the things are made by copying. Learning itself cannot occur without copying from others. The distinction between (legitimate) original and (illegitimate) copy developed in Western Europe. It goes back to philosophical concepts that Plato and Aristotle created. In particular, Boon sees at work the nominalism of Plato, who introduced the idea of an unchanging and unattainable original in Western philosophy. The distinction between original and copy is in its modern incarnation represented by copyright but is actually a consequence of industrial capitalism. This distinction is threatening to undermine the culture of the world and thus to marginalize other systems of reproduction. Boon uses examples from non-European cultures and especially from Buddhism to question the existence of the original in itself. Reception The book has generally received positive reviews. * The book has been praised by the New Yorker. * It has also received praise from New Republic. * The book has received accolades from the University of Chicago. * The book has received great reviews from Goodreads. * The book has also received praise from the American E-Journal. * The book has been favorably reviewed by UK's The Wire magazine. * The book has received glowing reviews from Pop Matters and Rorotoko.

Announced by Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio on December 30, 2013, she was the first New York City chancellor to have had schools supervision training and experience since Board of Education chancellor Rudy Crew. Fariña had been a teacher, principal, superintendent, and the Deputy Chancellor of Teaching and Learning from 2004 to 2006. In December 2017, Farina announced she would leave her position after a replacement was named. She finished her term alongside the new Chancellor, Richard Carranza. Early life and education Fariña was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Galician parents who fled Spain during the Spanish Civil War, Fariña was the only Spanish-speaker in her kindergarten class and learned English in school. The language barrier was so severe, that Fariña's \\"teacher marked her absent every day for six weeks because Carmen then surnamed Guillén, did not answer when the teacher, who was of Irish background, called Quillan during roll call.\\" She was the first person in her family to attend college. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree from New York University and three master's degrees from Brooklyn College (bilingual education), Fordham University (gifted/arts education), and Pace University (administration and supervision). Career Fariña started her career at P.S. 29 in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where she flourished as a classroom teacher specializing in the social sciences. Throughout her 22 years there, \\"she was beginning to make a name for herself across the city, pioneering a curriculum that blended social studies and literacy.\\" One of her students there was future novelist and professor Jonathan Lethem, who called her the \\"perfect\\" teacher and dedicated his first novel, Gun, with Occasional Music, to her. As District 15's Core Curriculum coordinator, Fariña published her multicultural and interdisciplinary program, \\"Making Connections\\", a model the-then Board of Education replicated in every district in the city. From 1991 to 2001, Fariña served as principal of P.S. 6, replacing 80% of the staff there. Under her leadership, that school's ranking among public elementary schools on the citywide reading test rose from 76th to fourth from 1988 to 1997, with 91.8 percent of students classified as reading at grade level. During this time, she was also an adjunct professor at Bank Street College: P.S. 6 served as a model site for prospective principals, hosting more than 500 visitors a year. She left P.S. 6 in 2001 after being elected community superintendent of Brooklyn's District 15. She later served as superintendent of Region 8. From 2004 to 2006, Fariña served as Deputy Chancellor for Teaching and Learning at the New York City Department of Education, where she invested $40 million to expand programs for middle school students, including Saturday classes, organizational and study skills workshops, and parent counseling. She also improved services for students with disabilities. In the summer of 2014, she announced her support of \\"balanced literacy\\", an English curriculum that emphasizes free reading and writing at the expense of teacher-led instruction. =School Chancellor= In March 2018, after Alberto M. Carvalho publicly turned down the job, Mayor de Blasio announced Richard Carranza would succeed Fariña as the next chancellor, with Fariña departing at the end of April. =Criticisms= The New York Post condemned Farina in 2017 for restoring levels of bureaucracy that her predecessor, Joel Klein, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had eliminated, and for presiding over \\"diploma mills\\", referring to her \\"proudest achievement, boosting city high-school graduation rates to 72 percent\\" as \\"hollow\\" as \\"only 37 percent of those [high school] 'graduates' are ready for college.\\" StudentsFirstNY, an independent pro-student public advocacy group, determined that “Diploma Mills are a serious problem”, that “College remediation in New York City is off the Charts”, and that the “de Blasio administration has no clear plan for schools with the worst college readiness rates”. Personal life Carmen Guillén married Antonio Fariña Jr., an accountant, in 1965, in New York City. They have two daughters.

Plot Two young men, Agoes and Badjoel, travel from Palembang to West Java and are told of the beauty of two sisters, Zaenab and Djoeleha, who live in Cicadas village with their father. The friends decide to visit Cicadas. Meanwhile, a local bandit leader named Ramelan has asked for Zaenab's hand in marriage. She and her father Ardi refuse, and Ramelan is forced to leave. Through an old letter found on Ardi, Ramelan learns of a buried treasure containing some 30,000 gulden. He decides to dig it up, kidnapping Zaenab and Djoeleha in the process. Seeing this, Agoes and Badjoel follow Ramelan to his gang's hideout in a cave and fight to save the treasure and girls. After rescuing the girls and defeating the bandits, Agoes and Badjoel are allowed to marry Zaenab and Djoeleha. The treasure, meanwhile, is divided amongst them. Production Poesaka Terpendam was produced by Tan's Film and starred Roekiah and Rd Djoemala. It also featured Titing, Kartolo, Ismail, Ramli, and Wolly Sutinah. Shooting for the film, originally titled Poesaka Pendeman, began in June 1941. Scenes for this black-and-white film were shot in Banten, including Lake Tasikardi in Serang and Lake Tikoro in Rajamandala. The film featured several kroncong songs, some sung by Roekiah. Release and reception Poesaka Terpendam was released on 22 October 1941, on the Eid ul-Fitr holiday. It was debuted simultaneously at the Sampoerna Theatre in Surabaya, the Luxor Theatre in Yogyakarta, the Centraal Theatre in Buitenzorg, and the Rialto Theatre in Senen, Batavia. A preview in Poestaka Timoer promised a great performance from Roekiah as well as an extraordinarily comic one from Kartolo. Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film wrote that it was the only film to date in which Djoemala seemed out of place; the reviewer wrote that Djoemala seemed overly stiff and unnatural during the fight scenes. A review in De Indische Courant praised the film's scenery. The film is likely lost, as are all Indonesian films from before 1950 according to American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider. As elsewhere in the world at the time, movies produced in the Indies were shot on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. However, Kristanto records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

He worked with Professors Alec Skempton and Alan W. Bishop and obtained his PhD degree in 1958; his thesis title was \\"The seismic stability of earth dams\\". He joined the staff in 1958 as a Lecturer and he was appointed a Reader in Engineering Seismology in 1968 and full Professor of Engineering Seismology in 1974. In 1968 he established the Engineering Seismology Section (ESEE) (now part of the Geotechnics Section) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Imperial College and served as its first Head from 1971 to 1994, until he retired and was reappointed as Senior Research Investigator. He founded and became the first chairman of the British National Committee of Earthquake Engineering.  Scientific work  His major research focused on engineering seismology and geotechnical earthquake engineering. He specialised in earthquake hazard assessment, the earthquake resistant design of geotechnical structures (dams and foundations) and strong-motion seismology; on which he published widely (more than 300 publications, of which several papers appeared in highly cited journals), provided consulting services and edited work of other colleagues in numerous journals. He was co- founder of the Journal of Earthquake Engineering Journal of Earthquake Engineering and one of the early creators of the European Association for Earthquake Engineering.European Association for Earthquake EngineeringThe European Association for Earthquake Engineering He is among the most widely cited authors in the diverse fields of civil engineering and earthquake engineering,Google Scholar – Authors: Earthquake Engineering and one of the most cited authors in the field of engineering seismology to which he is considered by many to be a founding father.Google Scholar – Authors: Engineering Seismology = Seismic dam and slope stability = His doctoral work on the seismic stability of dams (1958) dealt, among other issues, with the prediction of permanent displacements in earth dams after earthquakes and formed the basis of what is today known as the Newmark's sliding block analysis method (1965). Newmark himself acknowledged Newmark, N. M. (1965) Effects of earthquakes on dams and embankments. Geotechnique, 15 (2) 139–160. Ambraseys' contribution to this method through \\"... the comments and suggestions... of his colleague for several months, while he was visiting the University of Illinois...\\". Moreover, Harry Bolton Seed, the founding father of the diverse academic field geotechnical earthquake engineering, in the 19th Rankine Lecture Seed, H. B. (1979) Considerations in the earthquake-resistant design of earth and rockfill dams. Geotechnique, 29 (3) 215–262. acknowledged the influence of Ambraseys, \\"... who introduced him to the problems of earthquakes and encouraged him to become involved in this new area pointing out the enormous field laboratory that existed in California...\\" Ambraseys' early work Ambraseys, N. N. (1960) On the shear response of a two-dimensional truncated wedge subjected to an arbitrary disturbance, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 50(1), 45–56Ambraseys, N. N. (1960) The seismic stability of earth dams, Proceedings of the 2nd World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, Tokyo, III, 1345–1363Ambraseys, N. N. and Sarma, S. K. (1967) The response of earth dams to strong earthquakes, Geotechnique, 17(2), 181–213 on the seismic stability of earth dams set the foundations of a new method of analysis which was later further developed by other researchers, the \\"shear beam\\" method; which was an early attempt to consider the dynamic behavior of an earth dam due to seismic wave propagation. His early work on seismic stability of dams attracted the attention and inspired numerous young researchers in that field. The most notable example is his first PhD student Sarada K. Sarma whose research led to the development of the Sarma method of seismic slope stability. Extensions of that work and on the calculation of seismic displacements led to new developments regarding earthquake induced ground displacements. Ambraseys had also in his early days researched in the aspect of theoretical ground response analysis.Ambraseys, N. N. (1959). The response of an elastic overburden of varying rigidity to an arbitrary ground motion, Bull. Seism. Soc. Amer., 49, 211‑220Ambraseys, N. N. (1960). A note on the effect of surface loading on the shear response of overburdens, J. Geoph.Res., vol.65, pp.363‑6 In fact, his pioneering work on the seismic response of dam was based on those early considerations of ground response and was their extension by considering the geometry of an earth dam as a truncated wedge. = Earthquake records and historical seismicity = He was extensively involved in the European Strong Motion Database project.The European Strong motion project He led a European effort to collect and process various strong motion data from the European region.Ambraseys, N. N. et al. (2004) Internet site for European strong-motion data. BOLLETTINO DI GEOFISICA TEORICA ED APPLICATA, 45 (3) 113-.129 Finally, a huge amount of data was published providing access to seismic researchers and practitioners in Europe. Many people argue that Ambraseys's greatest contribution is in the field of historical seismicity. He personally searched, found and collected an enormous amount of information about earthquakes which existed in various libraries, manuscripts and other forms of written communication around the world. His ability to speak fluently a number of languages allowed his direct involvement in the search for the original sources of earthquake information. Finally, he was in a good position to identify several erroneous information about earthquake events, and therefore he was able to develop new correct catalogues of earthquake history with updated and corrected information. = Other contributions = He also worked on hydrodynamics and investigated how to calculate hydrodynamic forces on various types of structures. Moreover, his contribution to tsunamis has been significant, and there is an intensity scale named after him (Sieberg-Ambraseys Tsunami Intensity Scale).Ambraseys, N. N. (1962). Data for the investigation of seismic sea waves in the Eastern Mediterranean. Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 52, 895 – 913.Sieberg-Ambraseys Tsunami Intensity Scale  Earthquake engineering educator  Ambraseys was one of the early academics who worked on Earthquake Engineering in Europe. In addition to his research activities, he established a strong academic training at Imperial College, with relevant modules both in the undergraduate and postgraduate curriculums. Regarding the latter, he introduced MSc courses in Earthquake Engineering, Structural Dynamics and Engineering Seismology which were very popular and attracted gifted students from around the world (e.g. Sarada K. Sarma). Through his engaging lectures Ambraseys inspired and educated generations of engineers and many of them are now eminent academics or practising engineers around the world.  Recognition & awards  He was a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, of the European Academy, of the Academy of Athens and the medallist of a number of UK and European learned societies. Ambraseys was invited in 1987 to deliver the first Mallet–Milne Lecture for the Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics (SECED), and in 2004 to deliver the 44th Rankine Lecture of the British Geotechnical Association, titled \\"Engineering, seismology and soil mechanics\\". In 2005 Ambraseys received the Harry Fielding Reid Medal of the Seismological Society of America.Harry Fielding Reid Medal This medal is the highest honor granted by the SSA and it is awarded no more than once a year for outstanding contributions in seismology and earthquake engineering. The list of previous recipients of this award includes Charles Richter and C. Allin Cornell. The European Association for Earthquake Engineering has established the \\"Prof. Nicholas Ambraseys Distinguished Lecture Award\\" Prof. Nicholas Ambraseys Distinguished Lecture Award in recognition of Ambraseys's huge contribution in the field of Earthquake Engineering. In the 14th World Conference in Earthquake Engineering that took place in Beijing in October 2008, he was voted as one of the 13 Legends of the Field – the only European on the list. Only five living persons received this rare distinction: (in alphabetical order) Nicholas Ambraseys, Ray W. Clough, George W. Housner, Thomas Paulay and Joseph Penzien. In 2014, the Department of Civil Engineering at Imperial College, SECEDSociety for Earthquake & Civil Engineering Dynamics and the British Geotechnical Association (BGA)British Geotechnical Association organised a pre-Rankine seminar (an annual half-day seminar held at Imperial College before the prestigious Rankine Lecture) to honour and commemorate Professor Ambraseys's great contribution to the field of Earthquake Engineering, called \\"Nicholas Ambraseys Memorial Symposium\\".Nicholas Ambraseys Memorial SymposiumBGA – Nicholas Ambraseys Memorial Symposium A special issue of the Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering, the official journal of the European Association for Earthquake Engineering, was published in 2014 in memory of Professor Ambraseys. An obituary written by two of Professor Ambraseys's former students (John Douglas and Sarada K. Sarma) was published in the soil mechanics journal Geotechnique in 2013.

F. Powys, first published in 1927.Brian Stableford, \\"Mr. Weston's Good Wine\\", in: Frank N. Magill, ed. Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature, Vol 3. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. . pp. 1047-1051. It describes an evening in 1923 when Mr. Weston, who is apparently a wine merchant, but is evidently God, visits the fictional village of Folly Down in Dorset, and meets some of its individuals, whose backgrounds and lives leading up to this day are described during the course of the novel. Mr. Weston's colleague is named Michael, which is an allusion to the Archangel.Richard Perceval Graves,The Brothers Powys. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984, p.193. For a while time stands still, and these individuals, according to their possessing qualities of good or evil, find their ultimate reward. The fictitious village of Folly Down in this novel and other works by T. F. Powys is based on Chaldon Herring, where he lived from 1904 until 1940.Richard Perceval Graves,The Brothers Powys pp. 57, 305; Blamires, H.. A Guide to twentieth century literature in English. London: Taylor & Francis, 1983, p.225. Summary In the early evening of 20 November 1923, Mr. Weston and his younger colleague Michael drive in their Ford van to the top of a hill overlooking the village of Folly Down; Michael switches on a lighting system connected to the vehicle's battery, and the phrase \\"Mr. Weston's Good Wine\\" is displayed in the sky. Michael, reading from a book, reads aloud to Mr. Weston the names and background of some of the village's inhabitants, and Mr. Weston considers the likelihood of each one purchasing his wine. =The villagers, and their history up to this evening= As described by Michael to Mr. Weston, or described later in the novel: Mr. Mumby is the local squire at Oak-tree Farm; his sons are Martin and John. Mr. Kiddle is a cattle dealer; his daughters are Phoebe and Anne. Ada Kiddle, the eldest daughter, was taken by Martin and John Mumby one summer under the oak tree on the green, with the encouragement of Mrs. Vosper, and drowned herself when winter came. Mrs. Vosper, who likes to see that girls are taken by men under the oak tree, encouraged the same to happen to Phoebe and Anne. The Rev. Nicholas Grobe lives at the rectory, with Tamar his daughter, who believes that an angel will come to her. She fell in love with the angel on the signboard of the Angel Inn. Mr. Grobe has not believed in God since his wife Alice died. She was killed when a card depicting an angel, which Tamar had bought when in town with her mother, fell onto a railway line and Alice tried to retrieve it. Mr. Grobe often sits alone in his study in the evening; he misses his wife, although she used to tease him by dancing in front of him. Thomas Bunce is landlord of the Angel Inn; he blames God for everything. His daughter Jenny is a domestic servant at the rectory; she wants to marry Luke Bird. Luke Bird was once a brewer's clerk, but he preached against drink and lost his job; he came to live in Folly Down and started converting the farm animals to Christianity. He wants to marry Jenny Bunce. Mr. Grunter, the parish clerk, has a reputation as the village's lover, and is blamed when village girls are ravished. =This evening= Mrs. Vosper takes Jenny Bunce to the oak tree, saying that Martin Mumby wants to show her a bird. Martin and his brother John are there; but before anything can happen, there is an interruption and Jenny escapes. In the Angel Inn, Mr. Mumby, Mr. Kiddle, Mr. Meek the local shopkeeper and Mr. Bunce the landlord talk about whether it is Mr. Grunter or God who is responsible for the babies in the village. They notice that the time has stopped at 7 o'clock. Mr. Weston comes in; each one there thinks they know him, and is perhaps a relation; they are happy in his company. He is aware of the topic they were discussing. Mr. Bunce serves him a glass of beer; while he drinks, they seem to hear someone say, \\"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I, the lord, do all these things.\\"The words heard as Mr. Weston drinks is a quotation of Isaiah 45:7. Before he leaves, Mr. Weston advises Mr Bunce to go to the Rev. Grobe for an answer to the question discussed. Mr. Bunce does so, and asks whether it is God or Mr. Grunter who causes the mischief in Folly Down; Mr. Grobe tells him that God does not exist. Luke Bird goes to the Angel Inn and asks Mr. Bunce if he can marry Jenny; Bunce replies that he can if there is wine in the well near Luke's cottage. After Luke leaves he meets Jenny in a lane and asks her to love him, but she runs off; he wonders if he should be brutal, like the way the Mumby sons ill-treat their horses. Tamar, who is wearing a wedding dress, meets Mr. Weston near the green; he tells her to go to the oak tree where she will meet a young man; she meets Michael there, who is her angel from the inn signboard. They are married at the church, Mr. Weston officiating, and then go to the oak tree on the green. Luke Bird waits for Mr. Weston, with all the money he has, to buy wine to fill the well; Mr. Weston visits him and makes the sale, telling him to go to the well. Luke goes there with Mr. Bunce and the well is full of wine. Jenny is in Mr. Weston's van; Luke takes her to his home. Mr. Weston takes Martin and John Mumby to the church, saying he has wine there for them; he shows them the body of Ada Kiddle. Martin and John are angered and they go away. Thinking they are being chased by a lion, they hide in Mrs. Vosper's house. Phoebe and Anne Kiddle are there, being insulted by her. Mrs. Vosper, believing a beast is approaching, dies of fright. Mr. Grunter, who went to the church when he noticed it was lit for the wedding, and disinterred the grave of Ada Kiddle for Mr. Weston, walks to the inn; on his way he sees the oak tree. He did not ravish any village girls; aware of what happened to Ada Kiddle under the oak tree, he curses it. Lightning strikes the tree and it falls; Tamar, who is there, is struck by the lightning, and Michael carries her to the sky. Mr. Weston visits Mr. Grobe and describes his wine; Mr. Grobe says he will buy a bottle. After Mr. Weston has left, he finds a flagon of wine where the bible used to be; drinking, he is filled with gentle melancholy. The bottle is still full, and he drinks more. Later, he finds the flagon of wine is a bible again. Mr. Weston returns, with some dark wine; he says he will see his wife Alice again if he drinks. Mr. Grobe, drinking this wine, dies. Time starts again in Folly Down as Mr. Weston leaves in his van. Mr. Bunce, finding he has no beer in his barrels, blames not God but Mr. Weston. On the hilltop over Folly Down, Mr. Weston and Michael look at the village, as dawn approaches. Mr. Weston asks Michael to drop a burning match into the van's petrol tank; in the smoke, they disappear into the sky. The title The title comes from the novel Emma by Jane Austen. A character in the novel has the name Mr. Weston; in chapter 15 is the sentence: \\"She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.\\" Bibliography Buning, Marius, T.F.

It lies to the north of the village of Kewstoke, and the stretch of coastline called Sand Bay north of the town of Weston-super-Mare. On a clear day it commands views over Flat Holm, of the Bristol Channel, South Wales, Clevedon, the Second Severn Crossing and the Severn Bridge. A line drawn between Sand Point and Lavernock Point in South Wales marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel. Middle Hope is a sequence of carboniferous limestone with unusual geological features including a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and as a result has been designated as a regionally important geological site. The underlying geology and soil types support scarce plants such as the smallflower buttercup, honewort, Cheddar pink and Somerset hair grass. Human use of the sites is shown by a bowl barrow and disc barrow from late Neolithic or Bronze Age and the site of a likely motte-and-bailey castle. Woodspring Priory, a former Augustinian priory which was founded in the early 13th century, sits just inland of the rocky promontory. The priory and surrounding land is owned by the National Trust and is a popular place for walking. Geology The cliffs and rocky beach at Middle Hope At Middle Hope a sequence of carboniferous limestone is exposed, which includes thick volcanic tuffs and lavas, demonstrating Tournaisian carbonate sections. The site contains a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and shore platform. These features have led to the designation of Middle Hope as a regionally important geological site (RIGS). The raised beach of wave-cut platforms has been created by changes in sea level of the Bristol Channel since the Quaternary period. The arrangement of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, including the Black Rock Limestone, illustrates the events of 350 million years ago. The strata have been tilted and compressed during the variscan orogeny. Flora Among scarce plants found on Sand Point are smallflower buttercup, and honewort. The range of soils at the site support various flora and fauna. The calcareous grassland is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata, while the scrub towards the west of the site is dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), while that to the east consists of common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg). Less common plants include the cheddar pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus) and Somerset hair grass (Koeleria vallesiana). History The triangulation station and site of the bowl barrow and disc barrow Evidence of early human occupation if provided by a bowl barrow and disc barrow from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age have been identified on the higher ground. The bowl barrow is in diameter and approximately high. Slightly west of the bowl barrow is a disc barrow surrounded by a bank and ditch which enclose an area about across. These are situated at the highest point where the Ordnance Survey have constructed a triangulation station. A motte-and-bailey castle may have been constructed after the Norman Conquest. The site is known as Castle Mound or Castle Batch and can be seen as a high mound which is approximately in diameter and marked by a ditch on the landward eastern edge. The mound was damaged by the construction of a building during World War II. The medieval date for the construction is in doubt with some sources suggesting that the mound may have been a watchtower constructed in the 16th century. The walls of the sheep fold were built by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars. Hope Cove on the northern coast had a reputation for smuggling as it was \\"well away from the men of HM Customs and Excise\\". Woodspring Priory was an Augustinian priory. It was founded by William de Courtney, in the early 13th century, and dedicated to Thomas Becket. The small community built a church and monastic lodgings during the next hundred years. They were Victorine Canons who were influenced by the Cistercians emphasis on manual labour and self-sufficiency. As a result, the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm, as well as providing clergy for surrounding churches. Despite endowments of land the priory was not wealthy until the 15th century when further building work, including the current priory church, infirmary and barn was undertaken. It was dissolved in 1536 and then owned by local noblemen and leased to local farmers. In 1969 the priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust who spent 20 years on restoration work, and since the 1990s have rented out the farmhouse as holiday accommodation. The surviving buildings include the priory church, which was a 15th-century replacement for the earlier 13th century structure, infirmary, barn and 16th century prior's lodging which was converted into a farmhouse. The whole site was arranged around a central cloister from which only the east wall and west wall of the chapter house remain, the sacristy, refectory, chapter house, lady chapel and parlour having been demolished. Because of the biological and geological interest the site was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1952. In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune. During World War II weapons were tested at Sand Point, in association with the base at Birnbeck Pier which was commissioned as \\"HMS Birnbeck\\" by the Admiralty as part of the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. To support this buildings were constructed at St Thomas Head, east of Middle Hope. Some of these have since been removed and the site is now used by QinetiQ as an explosives and shock test facility.
