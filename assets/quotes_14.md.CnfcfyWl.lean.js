Ouranosaurus measured about long. Two rather complete fossils were found in the Elrhaz Formation, Gadoufaoua deposits, Agadez, Niger, in 1965 and 1970. The animal was named in 1976 by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet; the type species being Ouranosaurus nigeriensis. The name is a combination of the Arabic word for \\"courage\\" and the country of discovery, although ourane is also the Tuareg name for the desert monitor. Discovery and naming Location of the Gadoufaoua within Niger Five French palaeontological expeditions were undertaken in the Gadoufaoua region of the Sahara Desert in Niger between 1965 and 1972 and led by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet. These deposits come from GAD 5, a layer in the upper Elrhaz Formation of the Tégama Group, which was deposited during the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous. On the first expedition, lasting from January–February 1965, eight iguanodontian specimens were discovered at the \\"niveau des Innocents\\" site, east of the Emechedoui wells. An additional two skeletons were discovered southeast of Elrhaz in the \\"Camp des deux Arbres\\" locality, which were given the field numbers GDF 300 and GDI 381. Both were collected in the February–April 1996 expedition, the former including a nearly complete but scattered skeleton, and the latter a skeleton what was two-thirds preserved. The skeletons then in 1967 were brought to the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris, where they were prepared. GDF 381 was recategorized with the number MNHN GDF 1700 and then later described in 1999 as the holotype of the new taxon Lurdusaurus arenatus. While the third expedition did not turn up additional iguanodontian material, the fourth in January–March 1970 uncovered a nearly complete and partially articulated skeleton lacking the skull, south of the \\"niveau des Innocents\\" site, and was also given the field number GDF 381. This specimen was collected and taken to the MNHN by the fifth expedition in 1972. Following a subsequent Italian-French expedition led by Taquet and Italian palaeontologist Giancarlo Ligabue that turned up a potential additional iguanodontian specimen, Ligabue offered to donate the nearly complete specimen and a skull of Sarcosuchus to the Municipality of Venice, which accepted the offer and subsequently mounted the skeleton in 1975 at the Museo di Storia Naturale di Venezia. Taquet formally described the two mostly-complete specimens MNHN GDF 300 and MNHN GDF 381 from the first and fourth expeditions as Ouranosaurus nigeriensis in 1976, along with a referred coracoid and femur that bore the numbers MNHN GDF 301 and MNHN GDF 302 respectively. MNHN GDF 300 was made the holotype, and was the primary specimen described, including a semi-articulated skull lacking the left , right and the , almost the entire vertebral column, forelimbs lacking a few hand bones, and most of the right hindlimb and a few bones of the left. Additional description for bones unpreserved in the holotype was based on Taquet's MNHN GDF 381, which was not mentioned as having been sent to Venice and renumbered as MSNVE 3714, although this was confirmed by Belgian palaeontologist Filippo Bertozzo and colleagues in 2017. The holotype itself was returned to Niger after being described and having its bones casted and mounted, and is now on display at the Musée National Boubou Hama in Niamey. The generic name Ouranosaurus carries a double meaning, it is both taken from Arabic meaning \\"valour\\", \\"courage\\" or \\"recklessness\\" and also from the local Tuareg language of Niger where is it the name they call the desert monitor. The specific name refers to Niger, the country of discovery. Taquet had used the name \\"Ouranosaurus nigeriensis\\" previously, first in a public presentation of the skeleton MNHN GDF 300 in July 1972, then later in September 1972 in a news article and again in December 1972 in a book; only the book bore any images associated with the name, and none of the earlier mentions had a diagnosis to make the name valid. Description Size of Ouranosaurus compared to a human Ouranosaurus was a relatively large iguanodontian, estimated by Taquet in 1976 to have a body length of and a weight of . A lighter weight of was suggested by American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul in 2010 due to the although a longer length of was given. The holotype and paratype specimens were suggested to belong to subadults by Bertozzo et al. in 2017, although they would have been close to adult size. MSNVE 3714 is long as mounted, although a few caudals are missing, and is roughly 90% the length of the holotype, which would be long. The variation between the sizes fits within the range of variation between adult individuals of Iguanodon, so there is a chance that the larger holotype and smaller paratype were same ontogenetic stage. =Skull= Skull The skull of Ouranosaurus is long. It was rather low, being wide and only tall. The top of the skull was flat, the highest point being just in front of the orbits and sloping down towards both the read of the skull and the tip of the snout. This makes Ouranosaurus have the most elongate skull of any non-hadrosaurid, the length being 3.8 times the maximum height, although the skull is proportionally wider than related Mantellisaurus. Bones of the snout are more loosely articulated with each other than the bones of the posterior skull. The are long, with very deep as in other iguanodontians. Anteriorly, the premaxillae flare gently laterally into a rugose surface for a beak, like other iguanodontians, although dissimilar from Iguanodon and similar to hadrosaurids the nares are entirely visible from above. Neither premaxilla bears any teeth, although the very anterior tip has \\"pseudo-teeth\\" formed by multiple denticles on the margin of the bone. Only the right maxilla of Ouranosaurus is known. although it is well preserved forming a triangle long and tall, much taller proportionally than Iguanodon. The maxilla bears faces for articulation with the premaxilla in front, above, , , and possibly internally, and to the rear. The lacrimal process is the highest point of the maxilla, and behind this process is a smooth and curved margin for the , which is bounded by the maxilla in front and below, lacrimal above, and jugal behind. The jugal overlaps only the posterior end of the maxilla, which is unlike hadrosaurids where there is more overlap. The dental edge of the maxilla is slightly arced, and above the toothrow is a shallow depression bearing , also known as the buccal emargination that is diagnostic of Ornithischia. 20 teeth are preserved in the maxilla, although the anterior end of the toothrow is broken and Taquet (1976) predicted the total number to be 22. Restoration of the head displaying \\"nasal protuberances\\" Many of the central bones of the skull are the same form as those of hadrosaurids or related iguanodontians like Iguanodon and Mantellisaurus. The jugal below and behind the orbit bears the same shape as in hadrosaurids, with a high rear process, and articulated with the quadratojugal and quadrate that are also very similar to more derived taxa. As in other ornithopods, the is a tri- radiate bone surrounding sides of the orbit, and . Contact between the postorbital and the excludes the flattened and wide from the supratemporal fenestra. In Ouranosaurus and related taxa the are small, and articulates with the broadened and textured lacrimal. Only a single was present in Ouranosaurus, which projects into the orbit above the eye. The of Ouranosaurus are unique among ornithischians. The bones are unfused suggesting mobility, and at their ends on the top of the skull are rounded domes, which were described by Taquet (1976) as distinct and rugose \\"nasal protuberances\\". The snout was toothless and covered in a horny sheath during life, forming a very wide beak together with a comparable sheath on the short predentary bone at the extreme front of the lower jaws. However, after a rather large diastema with the beak, there were large batteries of cheek teeth on the sides of the jaws: the gaps between the teeth crowns were filled by the points of a second generation of replacement teeth, the whole forming a continuous surface. Contrary to the situation with some related species, a third generation of erupted teeth was lacking. There were twenty-two tooth positions in both lower and upper jaw, for a total of eighty-eight. =Postcranial skeleton= ROM The most conspicuous feature of Ouranosaurus is a large \\"sail\\" on its back, supported by long, wide, neural spines, that spanned its entire rump and tail, resembling that of Spinosaurus, a well-known meat-eating dinosaur also known from northern Africa. These tall neural spines did not closely resemble those of sail-backs such as Dimetrodon of the Permian Period. The supporting spines in a sailback become thinner distally, whereas in Ouranosaurus the spines actually become thicker distally and flatten. The posterior spines were also bound together by ossified tendons, which stiffened the back. Finally, the spine length peaks over the forelimbs. The first four dorsal vertebrae are unknown; the fifth already bears a that is pointed and slightly hooked; Taquet presumed it might have anchored a tendon to support the neck or skull. The tenth, eleventh and twelfth spines are the longest, at about . The last dorsal spine, the seventeenth, has a grooved posterior edge, in which the anterior corner of the lower spine of the first sacral vertebra is locked. The spines over the six sacral vertebrae are markedly lower, but those of the tail base again longer; towards the end of the tail the spines gradually shorten. Dorsal vertebrae The dorsal \\"sail\\" is usually explained as either functioning as a system for thermoregulation or a display structure. An alternative hypothesis is that the back might have carried a hump consisting of muscle tissue or fat, resembling that of a bison or camel, rather than a sail. It could have been used for energy storage to survive a lean season. The axial column consisted of eleven neck vertebrae, seventeen dorsal vertebrae, six sacral vertebrae and forty tail vertebrae. The tail was relatively short. The front limbs were rather long with 55% of the length of the hind limbs. A quadrupedal stance would have been possible. The humerus was very straight. The hand was lightly built, short and broad. On each hand Ouranosaurus bore a thumb claw or spike that was much smaller than that of the earlier Iguanodon. The second and third digits were broad and hoof-like, and anatomically were good for walking. To support the walking hypothesis, the wrist was large and its component bones fused together to prevent its dislocation. The last digit (number 5) was long. In related species the fifth finger is presumed to have been prehensile: used for picking food like leaves and twigs or to help lower the food by lowering branch to a manageable height. Taquet assumed that with Ouranosaurus this function had been lost because the fifth metacarpal, reduced to a spur, could no longer be directed sideways. Restoration of Ouranosaurus nigeriensis based on skeletal diagrams and casts, fossils, and related species The hindlimbs were large and robust to accommodate the weight of the body and strong enough to allow a bipedal walk. The femur was slightly longer than the tibia. This may indicate that the legs were used as pillars, and not for sprinting. Taquet concluded that Ouranosaurus was not a good runner because the fourth trochanter, the attachment point for the large retractor muscles connected to the tail base, was weakly developed. The foot was narrow with only three toes and relatively long. In the pelvis, the prepubis was very large, rounded and directed obliquely upwards. Classification Taquet originally assigned Ouranosaurus to the Iguanodontidae, within the larger Iguanodontia. However, although it shares some similarities with Iguanodon (such as a thumb spike), Ouranosaurus is no longer usually placed in the iguanodontid family, a grouping that is now generally considered paraphyletic, a series of subsequent offshoots from the main stem-line of iguandontian evolution. It is instead placed in the clade Hadrosauriformes, closely related to the Hadrosauroidea, which contains the Hadrosauridae (also known as \\"duck-billed dinosaurs\\") and their closest relatives. Ouranosaurus appears to represent an early specialized branch in this group, showing in some traits independent convergence with the hadrosaurids. It is thus a basal hadrosauriform. The simplified cladogram below follows an analysis by Andrew McDonald and colleagues, published in November 2010 with information from McDonald, 2011. Paratype MSNVE 3714 in front view Paleobiology =Diet= The jaws were apparently operated by relatively weak muscles. Ouranosaurus had only small temporal openings behind the eyes, from which the larger capiti-mandibularis muscle was attached to the coronoid process on the lower jaw bone. Small rounded horns in front of its eyes made Ouranosaurus the only known horned ornithopod. The back of the skull was rather narrow and could not compensate for the lack of a greater area of attachment for the jaw muscle, that the openings normally would provide, allowing for more power and a stronger bite. A lesser muscle, the musculus depressor mandibulae, used to open the lower jaws, was located at the back of the skull and was connected to a strongly projecting, broad and anteriorly oblique processus paroccipitalis. Ouranosaurus probably used its teeth to chew up tough plant food. A diet has been suggested of leaves, fruit, and seeds as the chewing would allow to free more energy from high quality food; the wide beak on the other hand indicates a specialisation in eating large amounts of low quality fodder. Ouranosaurus lived in a river delta. =Histology= Ouranosaurus bears more similarities to other derived iguanodonts than more basal ornithopods. Remodeling is present in the subadult paratype, and high vascular density and circumferential arrangement of the microstructure suggests fast growth. Faster growth occurs in the same phylogenetic groups as higher body size, although their relationship is unclear. Ouranosaurus is a similar size to more basal Tenontosaurus which has slow growth, so either faster growth is caused by body size or Tenontosaurus is the maximum size of an ornithopod with a slow growth rate. Paleoecology Suchomimus and Nigersaurus in the environment of the Elrhaz Formation Ouranosaurus is known from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located in Niger. Only two mostly complete skeletons and up to 3 additional individuals have been found. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. Ouranosaurus is from the upper portion of the formation, probably Aptian in age. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone). After the iguanodontian Lurdusaurus, Nigersaurus was the most numerous megaherbivore. Other herbivores from the same formation include Ouranosaurus, Elrhazosaurus, and an unnamed titanosaur. It also lived alongside the theropods Kryptops, Suchomimus, Eocarcharia, and Afromimus. Crocodylomorphs like Sarcosuchus, Anatosuchus, Araripesuchus, and Stolokrosuchus also lived there. In addition, remains of a pterosaur, chelonians, fish, a hybodont shark, and freshwater bivalves have been found. Grass did not evolve until the late Cretaceous.

See Actor model and process calculi history. There are many similarities between the two approaches, but also several differences (some philosophical, some technical): *There is only one Actor model (although it has numerous formal systems for design, analysis, verification, modeling, etc.); there are numerous process calculi, developed for reasoning about a variety of different kinds of concurrent systems at various levels of detail (including calculi that incorporate time, stochastic transitions, or constructs specific to application areas such as security analysis). *The Actor model was inspired by the laws of physics and depends on them for its fundamental axioms, i.e. physical laws (see Actor model theory); the process calculi were originally inspired by algebra . *Processes in the process calculi are anonymous, and communicate by sending messages either through named channels (synchronous or asynchronous), or via ambients (which can also be used to model channel-like communications ). In contrast, actors in the Actor model possess an identity, and communicate by sending messages to the mailing addresses of other actors (this style of communication can also be used to model channel-like communications -- see below). The publications on the Actor model and on process calculi have a fair number of cross-references, acknowledgments, and reciprocal citations (see Actor model and process calculi history). How do channels work? Indirect communication using channels (e.g. Gilles Kahn and David MacQueen [1977]) has been an important issue for communication in parallel and concurrent computation affecting both semantics and performance. Some process calculi differ from the Actor model in their use of channels as opposed to direct communication. Synchronous channels Synchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel must wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel before the sender can proceed. =Simple synchronous channels= A synchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives \`put\` and \`get\` communications. The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple synchronous channel: *Each \`put\` communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent when the message is received by a \`get\` communication from the channel in FIFO order. *Each \`get\` communication has an address to which the received message is sent. =Synchronous channels in process calculi= However, simple synchronous channels do not suffice for process calculi such as Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) [Hoare 1978 and 1985] because use of the guarded choice (after Dijkstra) command (called the alternative command in CSP). In a guarded choice command multiple offers (called guards) can be made concurrently on multiple channels to \`put\` and \`get\` messages; however at most one of the guards can be chosen for each execution of the guarded choice command. Because only one guard can be chosen, a guarded choice command in general effectively requires a kind of two-phase commit protocol or perhaps even a three-phase commit protocol if time-outs are allowed in guards (as in Occam 3 [1992]). Consider the following program written in CSP [Hoare 1978]: [X :: Z!stop()  Y :: guard: boolean; guard := true; *[guard → Z!go(); Z?guard]  Z :: n: integer; n:= 0; *[X?stop() → Y!false; print!n; [] Y?go() → n := n+1; Y!true] ] According to Clinger [1981], this program illustrates global nondeterminism, since the nondeterminism arises from incomplete specification of the timing of signals between the three processes \`X\`, \`Y\`, and \`Z\`. The repetitive guarded command in the definition of \`Z\` has two alternatives: #the \`stop\` message is accepted from \`X\`, in which case \`Y\` is sent the value false and \`print\` is sent the value \`n\` #a \`go\` message is accepted from \`Y\`, in which case \`n\` is incremented and \`Y\` is sent the value true. If \`Z\` ever accepts the \`stop\` message from \`X\`, then \`X\` terminates. Accepting the \`stop\` causes \`Y\` to be sent false which when input as the value of its guard will cause \`Y\` to terminate. When both \`X\` and \`Y\` have terminated, \`Z\` terminates because it no longer has live processes providing input. In the above program, there are synchronous channels from \`X\` to \`Z\`, \`Y\` to \`Z\`, and \`Z\` to \`Y\`. =Analogy with the committee coordination problem= According to Knabe [1992], Chandy and Misra [1988] characterized this as analogous to the committee coordination problem: :Professors in a university are assigned to various committees. Occasionally a professor will decide to attend a meeting of any of her committees, and will wait until that is possible. Meetings may begin only if there is full attendance. The task is to ensure that if all the members of a committee are waiting, then at least one of them will attend some meeting. :The crux of this problem is that two or more committees might share a professor. When that professor becomes available, she can only choose one of the meetings, while the others continue to wait. =A simple distributed protocol= This section presents a simple distributed protocol for channels in synchronous process calculi. The protocol has some problems that are addressed in the sections below. The behavior of a guarded choice command is as follows: *The command sends a message to each of its guards to \`prepare\`. *When it receives the first response from one of its guards that it is prepared, then it sends a message to that guard to \`prepare to commit\` and sends messages to all of the other guards to \`abort\`. **When it receives a message from the guard that it is \`prepared to commit\`, then it sends the guard a \`commit\` message. However, if the guard throws an exception that it cannot \`prepare to commit\`, then guarded choice command starts the whole process all over again. *If all of its guards respond that they cannot \`prepare\`, then the guarded command does nothing. The behavior of a guard is as follows: *When a message to \`prepare\` is received, then the guard sends a \`prepare\` message to each of the channels with which it is offering to communicate. If the guard has booleans such that it cannot \`prepare\` or if any of the channels respond that they cannot \`prepare\`, then it sends \`abort\` messages to the other channels and then responds that it cannot \`prepare\`. **When a message to \`prepare to commit\` is received, then the guard sends a \`prepare to commit\` message to each of the channels. If any of the channels respond that they cannot \`prepare to commit\`, then it sends \`abort\` messages to the other channels and then throws an exception that it cannot \`prepare to commit\`. **When a message to \`commit\` is received, then the guard sends an \`commit\` message to each of the channels. **When a message to \`abort\` is received, then the guard sends an \`abort\` message to each of the channels. The behavior of a channel is as follows: *When a \`prepare to put\` communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a \`prepare to get\` communication pending unless a \`terminate\` communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot \`prepare to put\`. *When a \`prepare to get\` communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a \`prepare to put\` communication pending unless a \`terminate\` communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot \`prepare to get\`. **When a \`prepare to commit to put\` communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a \`prepare to commit to get\` communication pending unless a \`terminate\` communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot \`prepare to commit to put\`. **When a \`prepare to commit to get\` communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a \`prepare to commit to put\` communication pending unless a \`terminate\` communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot \`prepare to commit to get\`. ***When a \`commit put\` communication is received, then depending on which of the following is received: ****When a \`commit get\` communication is received, then if not already done perform the \`put\` and \`get\` and clean up the preparations. ****When an \`abort get\` communication is received, then cancel the preparations ***When a \`commit get\` communication is received, then depending on which of the following is received: ****When a \`commit put\` communication is received, then if not already done perform the \`get\` and \`put\` and clean up the preparations. ****When an \`abort put\` communication is received, then cancel the preparations. ***When an \`abort put\` communication is received, then cancel the preparations. ***When an \`abort get\` communication is received, then cancel the preparations. =Starvation on getting from multiple channels= Again consider the program written in CSP (discussed in Synchronous channels in process calculi above): [X :: Z!stop()  Y :: guard: boolean; guard := true; *[guard → Z!go(); Z?guard]  Z :: n: integer; n:= 0; *[X?stop() → Y!false; print!n; [] Y?go() → n := n+1; Y!true] ] As pointed out in Knabe [1992], a problem with the above protocol (A simple distributed protocol) is that the process \`Z\` might never accept the \`stop\` message from \`X\` (a phenomenon called starvation) and consequently the above program might never print anything. In contrast consider, a simple Actor system that consists of Actors X, Y, Z, and print where *the Actor X is created with the following behavior: **If the message \`\\"start\\"\` is received, then send Z the message \`\\"stop\\"\` *the Actor Y is created with the following behavior: **If the message \`\\"start\\"\` is received, then send Z the message \`\\"go\\"\` **If the message true is received, then send Z the message \`\\"go\\"\` **If the message false is received, then do nothing *the Actor Z is created with the following behavior that has a count \`n\` that is initially 0: **If the message \`\\"start\\"\` is received, then do nothing. **If the message \`\\"stop\\"\` is received, then send Y the message false and send print the message the count \`n\`. **If the message \`\\"go\\"\` is received, then send Y the message true and process the next message received with count \`n\` being \`n+1\`. By the laws of Actor semantics, the above Actor system will always halt when the Actors X, Y, are Z are each sent a \`\\"start\\"\` message resulting in sending print a number that can be unbounded large. The difference between the CSP program and the Actor system is that the Actor Z does not get messages using a guarded choice command from multiple channels. Instead it processes messages in arrival ordering, and by the laws for Actor systems, the \`stop\` message is guaranteed to arrive. =Livelock on getting from multiple channels= Consider the following program written in CSP [Hoare 1978]: [Bidder1 :: b: bid; *[Bids1?b → process1!b; [] Bids2?b → process1!b;]  Bidder2 :: b: bid; *[Bids1?b → process2!b; [] Bids2?b → process2!b;] ] As pointed out in Knabe [1992], an issue with the above protocol (A simple distributed protocol) is that the process \`Bidder2\` might never accept a bid from \`Bid1\` or \`Bid2\` (a phenomenon called livelock) and consequently \`process2\` might never be sent anything. In each attempt to accept a message, \`Bidder2\` is thwarted because the bid that was offered by \`Bids1\` or \`Bids2\` is snatched away by \`Bidder1\` because it turns out that \`Bidder1\` has much faster access than \`Bidder2\` to \`Bids1\` and \`Bids2\`. Consequently, \`Bidder1\` can accept a bid, process it and accept another bid before \`Bidder2\` can commit to accepting a bid. =Efficiency= As pointed out in Knabe [1992], an issue with the above protocol (A simple distributed protocol) is the large number of communications that must be sent in order to perform the handshaking in order to send a message through a synchronous channel. Indeed, as shown in the previous section (Livelock), the number of communications can be unbounded. =Summary of Issues= The subsections above have articulated the following three issues concerned with the use of synchronous channels for process calculi: #Starvation. The use of synchronous channels can cause starvation when a process attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command. #Livelock. The use of synchronous channels can cause a process to be caught in livelock when it attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command. #Efficiency. The use of synchronous channels can require a large number of communications in order to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command. It is notable that in all of the above, issues arise from the use of a guarded choice command to get messages from multiple channels. Asynchronous channels Asynchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel need not wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel. =Simple asynchronous channels= An asynchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives \`put\` and \`get\` communications. The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple asynchronous channel: *Each \`put\` communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent immediately (without waiting for the message to be gotten by a \`get\` communication). *Each \`get\` communication has an address to which the gotten message is sent. =Asynchronous channels in process calculi= The Join-calculus programming language (published in 1996) implemented local and distributed concurrent computations. It incorporated asynchronous channels as well as a kind of synchronous channel that is used for procedure calls. Agha's Aπ Actor calculus is based on a typed version of the asynchronous π-calculus. Algebras The use of algebraic techniques was pioneered in the process calculi. Subsequently, several different process calculi intended to provide algebraic reasoning about Actor systems have been developed in , , Denotational Semantics Will Clinger (building on the work of Irene Greif [1975], Gordon Plotkin [1976], Henry Baker [1978], Michael Smyth [1978], and Francez, Hoare, Lehmann, and de Roever [1979]) published the first satisfactory mathematical denotational theory of the Actor model using domain theory in his dissertation in 1981. His semantics contrasted the unbounded nondeterminism of the Actor model with the bounded nondeterminism of CSP [Hoare 1978] and Concurrent Processes [Milne and Milner 1979] (see denotational semantics). Roscoe [2005] has developed a denotational semantics with unbounded nondeterminism for a subsequent version of Communicating Sequential Processes Hoare [1985]. More recently Carl Hewitt [2006b] developed a denotational semantics for Actors based on timed diagrams. Ugo Montanari and Carolyn Talcott [1998] have contributed to attempting to reconcile Actors with process calculi. References *Carl Hewitt, Peter Bishop and Richard Steiger.

Jocko), was an early Canadian fur trader, scout, and explorer associated with the North West Company. He built Spokane House and Kootanae House, two key fur-trading posts of the era, and helped David Thompson cross the Continental Divide and discover the Columbia River. Biography Finlay was born in 1768 on the south bank of the Saskatchewan River. His mother came from the Chippewa tribe of Native Americans, but never married his father, James Finlay, a North West Company trader who had a family in Montreal. Finlay was recorded as a clerk of the North West Company as early as 1799; this was the highest office accorded to \\"half-breeds\\" in that era. Finlay was compensated, however, as much as David Thompson, the English-born explorer, probably reflecting his reputation as a scout. Thompson accordingly engaged Finlay in 1806 to blaze a trail through the Rocky Mountains across the Continental Divide; Thompson followed in 1807, though he was markedly unhappy with the quality of the trail, which led at least as far as Howse Pass. Finlay also played a key advance role in Thompson's discovery (from the East) of the Columbia River, scouting, storing provisions, and building canoes. After Thompson returned east, Finlay found work with the Pacific Fur Company (a surviving receipt shows him to have been literate). He later returned to the employ of the North West Company when the latter purchased the assets of the former during the War of 1812, and remained an employee until 1816, along with three of his sons. He later took over a defunct Hudson's Bay Company post, where botanist David Douglas recorded a visit in 1826, as well as a recipe for bread made from local lichens. Spokane area Indian Reservations. He died in 1828, and was buried on the grounds of Spokane House. According to Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, who passed by the abandoned site in 1833, all the buildings had been burned for firewood but one, which was maintained out of respect for a dead clerk buried beneath it. In 1950, a construction crew discovered what became the archaeological site, and Finlay's body was found with items including a clay pipe marked \\"JF\\". His descendants can be found throughout the Northwest, especially on the Flathead, Colville, Spokane, Kalispel, Coeur D'Alene, and Umpqua Indian Reservations. An early settler, Jacob Allen Meyers (J.A. Meyers) wrote in the early 20th century – > \\"Jacques Finlay had a large family of sons and daughters, noted for their > fine physique, many with light blue eyes. The men in the family were > competent and trustworthy. The daughters were fine wives and mothers.\\" Legacy The Jocko Valley and the Jocko River in Montana are named for him.

The Buddhist Mahastupa or the great stupa and vihar in Dhulikatta village were established at the end of the 2nd century BC, which is more than 2000 years ago. During that period, the region played a greater role and thus was protected with numerous fortifications. According to many historians, the description of this fortified town which is situated on the banks of a river that has been conceptualized by the Greek emissary Megasthenes, matches with that of this town. The remains and ruins of this ancient stupa that has been built on an elevated place are still discernible. The constructions of platforms make the Mahastupa look larger. The lime-stone blocks that are elegantly carved are decorated with many Buddhist symbols like the Muchalindanaga (a snake from the Buddhist mythology).

Its name comes from the juazeiro tree which grows in the region. The city is twinned with Petrolina, in the state of Pernambuco. The two cities are connected by a modern bridge crossing the São Francisco River. Together they form the metropolitan region of Petrolina-Juazeiro, an urban conglomerate of close to 500,000 inhabitants.  History  It was founded in 1833 and became a city on July 15, 1878.  Organization  Its city districts are Abóbora, Carnaíba, Itamotinga, Junco, Juremal, Massaroca, and Pinhões.  Climate  The annual average temperature is 24.2 °C. Although it lies on the São Francisco River and the Curaçá River, the climate of the city is semi-arid and it gets an annual precipitation of only 399 mm (15.7 in.).  Transport  Presidente Dutra bridge over São Francisco River connects Juazeiro and Petrolina There are highway connections with several capitals of the Northeast and railroad connections to the coast are made by the Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica. The railroad connection ends at the fluvial port of Juazeiro.  Economy  Like its sister city Petrolina, Juazeiro has experienced great growth in the last decade due to the irrigation of the semi-arid soils with water from the São Francisco River. Fruit cultivation is important to such an extent that Juazeiro entitles itself \\"Capital of Irrigated Fruit\\", which is exported between the Petrolina Airport to USA and/or Europe.

Bush lived in various places around the United States with his wife, Barbara (née Pierce), and their young son, George W. In 1949, they moved to Compton, California; by then, Barbara was pregnant with the couple's second child. On September 23, 1949, Pauline Robinson Pierce, Barbara's mother, was killed in a car accident, which also injured her father, Marvin. Since she was very late into the pregnancy, Marvin advised Barbara not to make the journey to New York, so as not to hurt the baby. On December 20, 1949, Barbara delivered a baby girl, whom she named Pauline Robinson Bush, after her late mother. Initially, the child's intended name was Pauline Pierce Bush, until George H. W.'s mother pointed out that her initials would be P. P. Bush, which \\"would never do\\". From birth, the little girl was referred to as Robin, so much so that, later in life, Barbara would comment that Robin's siblings probably do not even remember her real name. Robin was described as being calm and having a \\"sweet soul\\". She was \\"quiet and gentle, and she had lovely little blond curls.\\" Her father would later say of Robin: \\"She'd fight and cry and play and make her way just like the rest, but there was about her a certain softness... Her peace made me feel strong, and so very important.\\" In 1950, shortly after Robin's birth, the family relocated again, this time to Midland, Texas; the family quickly became involved in their new town. In February 1953, after having moved to their third house in Midland, the Bushes had another child, John Ellis, nicknamed \\"Jeb\\".  Illness and death  In the spring of 1953, shortly after Jeb's birth, Robin awoke one morning, listless. She said she was unsure of what to do that particular morning, stating that she \\"may go out and lie on the grass and watch the cars go by\\", or just stay in bed. Barbara believed Robin had come down with what her mother had referred to as \\"spring fever\\", as, up until that point, she had been \\"as rowdy and healthy\\" as her brothers. The child was taken to the family's pediatrician, Dorothy Wyvell, who took a blood sample and told Barbara to return later that afternoon with George H. W.; Barbara had not yet noticed the bruises on Robin. Dr. Wyvell told George and Barbara that Robin had advanced stage leukemia. Her advice for them was to not tell anyone about the child's illness, and to take her home, \\"make life as easy as possible for her, and in three weeks' time, she'll be gone.\\" Neither parent had ever heard of leukemia, and, in the 1950s, not much was known of it; consequently, it was nearly always fatal. George H. W. Bush holding Robin, 1953. The Bushes went against both parts of the doctor's advice. Almost immediately, their friends from the country club were discussing Robin's diagnosis, and George called his uncle, John M. Walker, president of Memorial Hospital in New York City. Walker urged them to take Robin to the adjacent Sloan Kettering Institute. He told George and Barbara that \\"you could never live with yourselves unless you treat her.\\" The very next day, leaving George W. and Jeb with different friends, they both flew to New York and had Robin admitted into Sloan Kettering. She was tested once again, and, after the diagnosis was confirmed, she was immediately put on medication. George W. was told that his sister was sick, but was never explained exactly how bad her condition was. For the next six months, Barbara largely remained in New York with Robin, while George traveled back and forth, due to his job. Their two sons were cared for either by family friends or by housekeepers. Robin was, by her mother's account, \\"wonderful\\", not questioning why she was sick. She disliked bone marrow tests, which were very painful, as were many of the blood transfusions she endured. At times, the medication was so effective that Robin did not even appear to be ill. However, she never went into complete remission. According to Charlotte Tan, who treated Robin in New York, she was mature and tolerated her treatments well. Barbara and George heard about a doctor in Kansas City who maintained he had found the cure for leukemia. However, their hopes were dashed when they found out the man was merely testing a new drug, and had not claimed to have the cure. Sometimes, her parents would take Robin to the Bush house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and she was once taken to Maine for a brief period. There, she got to see her brothers, whose pictures she had taped to the headboard of her hospital bed. During this visit, George W. was not allowed to wrestle with his sister like they used to; his mother focused most of her attention on Robin and would \\"snap\\" at him if he tried to \\"horse around\\" with his sister. By fall, Robin's condition was worsening. She spent time in an oxygen tent, and her platelets were low enough that whenever she started bleeding, it was very difficult to ascertain when it would stop. Barbara allowed no crying around Robin, and made her husband leave the room if he felt like doing so. Prescott Bush, George's father, had purchased a plot for Robin to be buried in, as her situation was not improving. Eventually, due to her medication, Robin developed heavy bruising, which almost entirely covered one of her legs, and \\"a hundred or so\\" stomach ulcers. Barbara called George, and, by the time he arrived to his daughter's bedside, she had entered a coma. Robin died on October 11, 1953, after doctors' efforts to close the ulcers in her stomach. She was two months short of her fourth birthday. Two days later, on October 13, a memorial service was held for Robin, at the Bushes' home in Greenwich. Initially, her body was donated for research, in hopes that her death might help others survive. Several days later, when the hospital released her remains, Dorothy Walker Bush, her paternal grandmother, was among those who buried her. In 2000, her grave was exhumed and her remains were relocated and reburied at the George H.W. Bush Library.  Legacy  The portrait of Robin that hung in the Bushes' Texas homes. After Robin's death, Barbara cried herself to sleep many nights. She stated that she \\"crumbled\\" completely, and would later say that she \\"fell totally apart and [George] took care of [her].\\" George W. was told of his sister's death a few days after it happened, when his parents picked him up from school. He would later describe this as the only low point of his happy childhood, remembering the sadness he felt both for his parents and for the loss of his sister. He and his brother Jeb then became their mother's focal points, and she devoted her time to caring for them, as a means of overcoming her daughter's death. After overhearing George W. tell one of his friends that he could not go out and play, as he needed to play with his mother, Barbara decided that it was time to heal, for her family. After a few months, \\"the grief and the awful aching hurt began to disappear.\\" \\"I like... to think of Robin as though she were a part, a living part, of our vital energetic and wonderful family of men and [Barbara],\\" George H. W. Bush would later write. Barbara came to believe that she and her husband valued all people more because of the loss they suffered with Robin. Barbara also attributed the premature graying of her hair to Robin's extended illness and death. Dorothy Walker Bush commissioned an oil painting of Robin, which hung in the Bushes' homes in Midland and, later, Houston. Eventually, Barbara and George H. W. had three more children: Neil, in 1955, Marvin in 1956, and another daughter, Dorothy, known as \\"Doro\\" and born in 1959. Doro was once described by her father as \\"a wild dark version of Robin\\", noting that the two looked so much alike, her parents once mistakenly called her Robin . In 2000, Robin's remains were transferred from Connecticut to the family's future burial plot at the George Bush Presidential Library in Texas. On this occasion, George H. W. stated: \\"It seems funny after almost 50 years since her death how dear Robin is to our hearts.\\" Following Robin's death, the Bush family created a charity to raise awareness and money for leukemia research called the Bright Star Foundation. The impact of the Bright Star Foundation was acknowledged by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2004, when it opened the Robin Bush Child and Adolescent Clinic. Barbara later became honorary chairwoman of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and honorary national chairperson of Donor Awareness Week. Following Barbara's death in April 2018, a cartoon by Marshall Ramsey, of The Clarion-Ledger, was widely circulated, showing Robin greeting Barbara upon the latter's entry to heaven. The cartoon was shared by various people and relatives of the family, including George W.'s daughter, Jenna Bush Hager. Following her father's death in November of that same year, Robin would be featured again in another Ramsey cartoon, where she and Barbara greeted George H. W. after the latter landing a TBM Avenger (the type of airplane he flew in the Navy during World War II) in heaven.

He was the son and successor of Šamši-Adad IV, and he ruled for 19 yearsKhorsabad Kinglist, tablet IM 60017 (excavation nos.: DS 828, DS 32-54), iv 5. during a troubled period of Assyrian history, marked by famine and war with nomads from the deserts to the west. He is best known for his penitential prayer to Ištar of Nineveh. Biography According to a royal hymn composed in his honor, he was born “in the mountains that nobody knows,” suggesting he may have been born in exile, or perhaps a literary device, as it continues: “I was without understanding and I prayed not of your majesty.” It relates that, when Ištar appointed him to the kingship, he had restored her overthrown cult. Known from a single copy from the library of Ashurbanipal, it includes a plea to the goddess to restore him to health from the sickness that afflicted him, citing his temple-restoration, and devotions, to persuade her. It addresses Ištar of Nineveh, and Ištar of Arbil, as though they were separate deities. A second, fragmentary literary prayer thanks her for her favor.

He was succeeded by his son, Šalmanu-ašaredu II, who mentions him in one of his own inscriptionsRIMA 2 A.0.93.1:4. and later by another son, the long-reigning Aššur-rabi II.

Public intoxication laws vary widely from jurisdiction, but usually require some obvious display of intoxicated incompetence or behavior disruptive/obnoxious to public order before the charge is levied.  Australia  Victoria and Queensland are the only states in Australia that still have a specific offence of public drunkenness, a charge that a royal commission found disproportionately affected Aboriginal people. On 22 August 2019, Victoria announced plans to decriminalise public drunkenness and to treat alcohol abuse as a health issue.'Long overdue': public drunkenness to be decriminalised in Victoria Police even in these states are relatively lenient about public intoxication, and generally transport an intoxicated person to his or her residence or temporary detention at a police station or other welfare establishment until the person is sober. Prosecution (charging) is generally only considered if the person is violent or other offenses have been committed. In Victoria being \\"drunk in a public place\\" and \\"drunk and disorderly in a public place\\" are separate offences contained in the Summary Offences Act 1966 which have their own power of arrest. Recent changes to legislation allow police to issue an infringement notice for these offences in addition to the traditional method of charging and bailing the offender to the Magistrates' Court. The current fine attached to the infringement notice is $590 for a first offence and $1,100 for a subsequent offence. A person arrested for being drunk or drunk and disorderly is held at the Melbourne Custody Centre or the cells at a police station or placed in the care of a friend or relative. Public drunkenness was decriminalised in New South Wales (1979),Public intoxication in NSW: the contours of criminalisation and the Northern Territory, and in South Australia (1984).Public Intoxication Act 1984 In New South Wales police have the discretion to issue \\"on the spot\\" fines or infringement notices for \\"drunk in public\\", a fine that costs the individual over $480 (4 penalty units). Community Legal Centres across the state complain about these fines and the impact it has had on various vulnerable members of the community, including young people, the homeless and minority groups. As an example, a \\"drunk and disorderly\\" fine in New South Wales starts at $550. As of February 2009, local councils in New South Wales are not allowed to charge people who drink in alcohol-free zones; they are only permitted to confiscate the alcohol of the intoxicated person. Canada In Canada, liquor laws are made by the provinces and not the federal government. In British Columbia, drinking in public and public intoxication are offenses. If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit. In Ontario, drinking in public and public intoxication are offenses. Having an open container in public garners a $125 fine. Public drunkenness garners a $65 fine and detainment until sober. If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit. While liquor laws are similar from province to province, the laws in the territories tend to be substantially different. For instance, in the Northwest Territories public intoxication can result in imprisonment or detention in a medical facility for up to 24 hours (NWT Liquor Act).  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, the police normally only enforce the laws against public intoxication if the intoxicated person is unable to act in a reasonable manner, as demonstrated by such activities as climbing on Stonehenge (pictured). In the United Kingdom, there are a number of offences dealing with intoxication, which vary between the constituent countries. In a public place, it is an offence to be: *drunk, *drunk and disorderly It is also an offence to be drunk: *while boarding, or while on board, an aircraft *while in charge of a child under 7 years old *while travelling to a \\"designated sporting event\\" (usually professional football matches) on public transportsection 1, Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985 or a vehicle with eight seats or more1A, Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985 *while in, or attempting to enter, a \\"designated sporting ground\\" (a football ground) during a designated sporting event.section 2, Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985 The police will only get involved if the person is so drunk they are unable to act in a reasonable manner, such as passing out on the street. In that case typically the police will, depending on the circumstances, help the intoxicated person on their way or place the person in a police station cell until sober. Once fit to be dealt with the detained person will normally either be cautioned, be issued with a Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND – £90 fine in ticket form) or bailed to appear at the local court. The court in turn may issue a fine (up to level 1 or level 3 on the standard scale depending on the offence charged). There are also many more specific offences, including driving a motor vehicle while drunk (or being found 'drunk in charge') \\\\- Road Traffic Act 1998, ss.4-5 and riding a cycle while unfit through drink. \\\\- Road Traffic Act 1998, s.30 Furthermore, the police have the power (although not the obligation) to confiscate any alcohol which is being consumed in public by those under 18, and local authorities have the power to prohibit alcohol consumption in certain areas. \\\\- Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, ss.12-16 New Zealand In New Zealand, drinking in public is not a crime and instead, local governments must specify that alcohol is banned in an area before it is considered a crime to drink in that location. Being drunk in public is not specifically an offense unless the person who is intoxicated is a public nuisance, in which case they may be dealt with for 'disturbing the peace'. This will usually result in being taken home, or otherwise taken to a police cell until sober. United States Public intoxication laws in the United States vary from state to state, and some states consider it a misdemeanor to obstruct sidewalks as a result of intoxication. Laws in the United States regarding drunkenness vary widely from state to state. =1968 Constitutional challenge= In 1968, in the case of Powell v. Texas, the Texas law against public intoxication was challenged in the Supreme Court of the United States for alleged violation of Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment. The court upheld the law, ruling that criminalizing public intoxication was neither cruel nor unusual. =State public intoxication laws today= *California: California Penal Code 647(f) considers public intoxication a misdemeanor. The code describes public intoxication as someone who displays intoxication to liquor, drugs, controlled substances or toluene and demonstrates an inability to care for themselves or others, or interferes or obstructs the free use of streets, sidewalks or other public way. California Penal Code 647(g) affords law enforcement the option to take an individual fitting the arrest criteria for 647(f), and no other crime, into civil protective custody if a \\"sobering facility\\" is available. Essentially, the detainee agrees to remain at the location until the facility's staff consents to their departure; usually after four hours and upon the belief that the detainee is safe to look after themselves. Not every municipality in California has such a facility. Also, if a person is being combative and/or is under the influence of drugs, they will be taken to jail. Unlike a person who is taken to jail, a civil detainee under 647(g) is not later prosecuted in a court of law. *Colorado: Public intoxication in the state of Colorado is not punished with criminal or civil penalties. Instead, state law prohibits the passing of local laws that penalize public intoxication, but state law provides for the creation of patrols trained to provide assistance to intoxicated and incapacitated people. *Georgia: In Georgia, public intoxication is a class B misdemeanor. Public intoxication is defined as a person who shall be and appear in an intoxicated condition in any public place or within the curtilage of any private residence not his own other than by invitation of the owner or lawful occupant, which condition is made manifest by boisterousness, by indecent condition or act, or by vulgar, profane, loud, or unbecoming language. *Indiana: In Indiana, public intoxication is a class B misdemeanor, punishable with up to 180 days in jail, and a $1,000 fine. As of 2012, simply being intoxicated in public is no longer a crime. The person must also be, (1) endangering the person's life; (2) endangering the life of another person;(3) breaching the peace or is in imminent danger of breaching the peace; or (4) is harassing, annoying, or alarming another person. (See IC 7.1-5-1-3). *Iowa: The Code of Iowa Sec 123.46 states that \\"a person shall not be intoxicated or simulate intoxication in a public place\\". Public Intoxication is a Simple Misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 30 days' jail and a $1,000 fine. Aggravated Public Intoxication (3rd or subsequent Offense) is an Aggravated Misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 2 years in prison. As of 2013, Johnson County, home of the University of Iowa had the highest arrest rate for public intoxication of any county in the state, at 8.28 per 1,000 residents. *Kansas: Being drunk in public in Kansas is not a criminal offense. Kansas statute 65-4059 states \\"No county or city shall adopt any local law, ordinance, resolution or regulation having the force of law rendering public intoxication by alcohol in and of itself or being a common drunkard or being found in enumerated places in an intoxicated condition, an offense, a violation, or the subject of criminal penalties.\\" *Minnesota: Public intoxication is not a crime in Minnesota. However, cities can enact laws against public intoxication, such as the City of St. Cloud. *Missouri has no state public intoxication law. Missouri's permissive alcohol laws both protect people from suffering any criminal penalty (including arrest) for the mere act of being drunk in public, and prohibit local jurisdictions from enacting criminal public intoxication laws on their own. *Montana state law states that public intoxication is not a crime. However, the law allows law enforcement to take an intoxicated person home, or to detain them, if they are a danger to themselves or others. The law also states that no record can be made that indicates the person was arrested or detained for being intoxicated. *Nevada has no state public intoxication law. Nevada state law both protects people from suffering any criminal penalty (including arrest) for the mere act of being drunk in public, and prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting criminal public intoxication laws on their own. *Oregon: The state has no laws against public intoxication and actively bans local intoxication ordinances in §430.402. \\"However, if the person is incapacitated, the health of the person appears to be in immediate danger, or the police have reasonable cause to believe the person is dangerous to self or to any other person, the person shall be taken by the police to an appropriate treatment facility.\\" § 430.399 *Texas: Public intoxication is a Class C misdemeanorTexas Penal Code Section 49.02. (Class C misdemeanors are punishable by fine only not to exceed $500Texas Penal Code Section 12.23.). However, if the offender is a minor, harsher penalties apply (especially if a two-time prior offender in which case jail time can be ordered).Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code Section 106.071. Section 49.01 of the Penal Code, which legally defines \\"intoxication\\", includes both a blood alcohol content greater than 0.08 but also defines it as \\"not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body\\"; thus, a breathalyzer or field sobriety test is not required to prove public intoxication. This low standard of proof has led to criticism that officers are using \\"public intoxication\\" as a means of harassment, especially towards minority groups. *Virginia criminalizes public intoxication under section 18.2-388 of the Code of Virginia. It is punishable by a fine of up to $250. *Wisconsin also does not have a state public intoxication law although municipalities may pass city ordinances prohibiting public intoxication. Public intoxication is legal in Milwaukee, however, public drinking is not.

According to the BBC's response to the Graf report, the site aims to Site homepage History backstage.bbc.co.uk was created by Tom Loosemore, Ben Metcalfe and James Boardwell. It was piloted internally within the BBC in the Spring of 2005, then launched on 11 May 2005. Its aim was to encourage innovative use of the content across bbc.co.uk, including the BBC News website, by third-party developers. The website came out of beta as an official site on 23 July 2005 at the backstage.bbc.co.uk OpenTech event which was organised by NTK and the UK Unix Users Group. It is sometimes referred to as BBC Backstage, although the official title of the project is backstage.bbc.co.uk. The BBC admit that in the past they had not always welcomed amateur innovators who attempted to reuse BBC content, but through the backstage site they aimed to foster a dialogue with such developers and the wider community. This was essential as the BBC launched a video player online and the same community voiced their concerns. A peaceful DRM protest in February 2007 took place in London and Manchester by Defective by Design, BBC Backstage kept the dialogue open in their public mailing list and later in the first of many podcasts In July 2006, backstage.bbc.co.uk won the New Statesman New Media Innovation award. In December 2010, the project was closed. An ebook retrospective was created to mark the end.

It was designed by a team of engineers led by Dean Sicking at the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It was developed from 1998–2002, and first installed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May 2002. The SAFER barrier consists of structural steel tubes welded together in a flush mounting, strapped in place to the existing concrete retaining wall. Behind these tubes are bundles of closed-cell polystyrene foam, placed between the barrier and wall. The theory behind the design is that the barrier absorbs a portion of the kinetic energy released when a race car makes contact with the wall. This energy is dissipated along a longer portion of the wall. The impact energy to the car and driver are reduced, and the car is likewise not propelled back into traffic on the racing surface. The SAFER barrier also lessens damage to the car itself, thereby reducing repair costs. After its introduction in 2002, nearly every oval track on the IndyCar and NASCAR circuits had the device installed by 2005. Road and street tracks apply SAFER barriers on high speed cornering sections where space is limited. The SAFER Barrier and its developers have won several awards within the racing and engineering community, including the Louis Schwitzer Award, Pocono Raceway Bill France, Sr. Award of Excellence, NASCAR Bill France, Jr. Award of Excellence, R&D; 100 Award, SEMA Motorsports Engineering Award, GM Racing Pioneer Award, Autosport Pioneering and Innovation Award. Sicking also received the National Science and Technology Medal from President George W. Bush, in part due to his work on the SAFER Barrier and on other roadside safety devices. History Throughout the decades of organized professional automobile racing, track owners and sanctioning bodies were constantly developing and attempting to utilize various devices to protect drivers and spectators in the event of a crash. Tire barriers, water and sand barrels, Styrofoam blocks, gravel traps, guardrails, earth embankments, and other various low-cost devices were implemented, with a varying level of success and usefulness. In most cases, the devices were practical for road and street courses, but impractical, or particularly inappropriate for oval tracks. Oval tracks typically were constructed with reinforced concrete walls around the entire perimeter of the track (and along all or parts of the inside perimeters). The high speeds of oval track racing required strong walls to prevent cars from leaving the racing surface and protect spectators alike, primarily due to centrifugal force. Early years saw metal guardrails on the outside perimeters at some oval tracks, but their limitations, maintenance needs, and sometimes troublesome results saw them completely phased out by the late 1980s. The concrete walls generally showed favorable protection for spectators, and even against large NASCAR stock cars, routinely held up nearly unscathed during crashes. They also usually required minimal maintenance. However, the hard surface and unforgiving nature of the walls were prone to cause injury to the drivers in a crash. In the later years of the 20th century, sharply increasing speeds and several high-profile fatal accidents accelerated the need and public outcry for safety improvements at the track level. The undesirable results or outright failures of existing safety devices required the need for a full-scale research and development of a new device. Throughout the 1970s–1990s, Indycar constructors, for instance, had attempted to address the issue of impact dissipation through car design. Pieces of the car (wheel assemblies, wings, bodywork, etc.) were designed to breakaway after impact, absorbing kinetic energy. Crumple zones were also created. While it typically yielded positive results, it also had drawbacks. The debris field created new hazards for cars approaching the crash scene, and if cars hit pieces of the debris, it could be propelled into the spectator areas. In two high-profile incidents multiple spectators were fatally injured when sheared off wheel assemblies were punted into the grandstands. =PEDS Barrier= The precursor to the SAFER Barrier was developed in 1998. The Polyethylene Energy Dissipating System (or PEDS Barrier) was developed by the Indy Racing League and retired GM engineer John Pierce at Wayne State University. The device consisted of PE cylinders mounted upright along the concrete wall, covered with plates of the same material, overlapping each other in the direction of travel. The plates mounting pattern resembled scales on a fish. The PEDS barrier was installed on a trial basis at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in time for the 1998 Indianapolis 500. It was installed along the inside wall near the entrance to the pits. However, it was not impacted during the race. About two months later, the barrier received its first full-scale test. During the 1998 IROC at Indy race, Arie Luyendyk spun and impacted the barrier broadside with his IROC stock car. The violent impact ripped many of the PEDS Barrier components from the wall, threw them high into the air, and littered the track with huge amounts of heavy debris. Luyendyk's car bounced off the wall, across the track and back into oncoming traffic. The car narrowly missed being T-boned by another car approaching the scene at high speed. Though the barrier was credited with saving Luyendyk from serious injury, it was deemed mostly a failure due to the flaws that were exposed with the design. A slightly updated version (PEDS-2) was installed for a trial basis for the 1999 Indianapolis 500, but after driver Hideshi Matsuda impacted it, another major flaw (the tendency to \\"catch and pivot\\") was exposed. The barrier was removed soon after. =SAFER Barrier= SAFER barrier at Talladega Superspeedway After the mixed results with the PEDS Barrier, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway contacted engineers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln starting in the fall of 1998, in order to spearhead development of a new barrier. Dean Sicking at the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility led the project, sponsored and bankrolled by the Indy Racing League, with some support from NASCAR. With the primary goal of reducing driver impact, the project also had the following objectives: *A device that would have a flush surface – to prevent \\"catch and pivot\\" or \\"wrapping\\" scenarios. *A device that would be able to be retro-fitted to the existing concrete walls at the multitude of speedways across the country, which each had varying existing conditions. *Prevent the car from bouncing back to the racing surface and into oncoming traffic. *Be able to withstand both open wheel Indy cars and heavy NASCAR stock cars (since many tracks hosted both series) *A device that could easily be repaired after impact – preventing lengthy delays during an event. *Cost-effectiveness The SAFER Barrier development was completed in the spring of 2002, and was first installed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May 2002, in time for the 2002 Indianapolis 500. It was first \\"tested\\" by Robby McGehee in a crash during the first day of practice. After successful usage at Indianapolis, the system began to be installed at several other tracks nationwide. By 2006, every oval facility that hosted an IRL IndyCar Series or NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event included the SAFER barrier. In 2006, Iowa Speedway became the first racetrack to install a purpose-built, self-standing SAFER barrier that extends around the entire outer circumference of the track. All previous installations had been the retrofit style to an existing concrete wall only in the turns. Most oval speedways more than a mile in length in the United States have since installed the system. Several tracks that had SAFER barriers initially installed in the turns in the early/mid-2000s have extended their barriers to more than just the turns, some to the entire perimeter. Many have added additional barriers along the inside walls. An interesting challenge was presented with Dover International Speedway. When officials came to install the barrier, they found the wall, which was made of steel and not concrete, would not support the system. Officials were able to install the system on the inside concrete wall successfully. After a re-design and further testing, the system was installed a year and a half later. The barrier received its first road course usage when Watkins Glen International adopted the SAFER barrier for key sections of the circuit, most notably in the bus stop chicane and Turn 11 for 2010. International road and street track adoption for the SAFER barrier has progressed gradually. Typically they are installed on high speed cornering sections, where space for runoff areas or gravel traps is limited and side impacts are of concern. Notable uses include: * Circuit de la Sarthe: Porsche Curves (2016) * Autódromo José Carlos Pace: Turn 14 (2010) * Baku City Circuit: Turns 13, 19 (2016) * Circuit Gilles Villeneuve: Turn 5 (2017) * Road America: Turn 11 (2019) Other forms of \\"soft walls\\" * Cellofoam – This is an encapsulated polystyrene barrier—a block of plastic foam encased in polyethylene. * Impact Protection System (IPS) – This inner piece of the wall is then wrapped in a rubber casing. Holes are drilled in the concrete wall and cables are used to tie the segments to it. * Compression barriers – This idea is to place cushioning materials, such as tires, water barrels, or sand barrels, against the concrete wall, and then cover those cushions with a smooth surface that would give when impacted, and then pop back out to its previous shape once the impact is over.

Each book focused on different aspects of mythology, fairy tales or folklore, and all were released by Time Life Books.http://www.pjtss.net/library/batsy/timelife.htm Their overall editor was Ellen Phillips and their primary consultant was Tristram Potter Coffin, a Guggenheim Fellowship Award-winning University of Pennsylvania Professor Emeritus of English. Overview The volumes in the series were known for their art and the extensive research used in their by their respective authors retold stories, and were executed as gold imprinted, cloth bound hardcover books, with a glued-on cover illustration. The books often overlap; for example, while King Arthur and his knights only have one book completely devoted to them, Fall of Camelot, they often appear in other books. Half of Legends of Valor is about them, and they appear in Wizards and Witches, Fairies and Elves, Dwarfs, Spells and Bindings, and Giants and Ogres. A unique part of the series was that its books were written as stories, taking place from an \\"in the universe\\" perspective, presenting its subjects as real people, places, and things. Related to such things having once been real, a common thread through several of them was its documentation of the alleged decline of magical things from \\"when the world was young\\" to the modern day. The subjects—dragons, dwarfs, giants—are presented as being potent and strong at the dawn of time, but magical creatures grow weaker and eventually disappear as humans spread and demystify the world, though there is always the promise that the magic will return once again. Christendom is often related to the decline. Though The Enchanted World describes it as humankind's greatest shield against those magics and beings of magic that would prove hostile to it, it proved detrimental even to good magic as people ceased to believe in the old gods in favor of Christ. According to the series, this was because Christianity was centered around a god of reason and that it promised a clearly defined universe of order and stability, a universe where there could be only one god. Magic could hardly thrive under such circumstances. It continued to exist either in opposition to Christianity or, more often, in connection to in-between places and in-between things. The series states that magic had always had a strong connection to things that were neither one thing nor another because as neither one thing nor another, such things could escape definition and be more than what they appeared. Despite the universal appeal of the subject matter, the series has not seen widespread translations in other languages though a Dutch-language edition is known to have been near- concurrently released by the local Amsterdam Time-Life Books [International] BV branch, albeit truncated; that edition (as \\"Het Rijk der Fabelen\\", which literally translates as \\"The Realm of Fables\\"), did not see the translated publication of the last nine volumes - most likely because of disappointing sales. On the other hand, it was standard issued with a dust jacket, contrary to the English-language editions which were normally issued without one for individual bookstore sales, whereas series subscribers were issued with one. The popularity of the Enchanted World series was followed by the Mysteries of the Unknown series. The Series In order of publication: =Wizards and Witches (1984, )= Brendan Lehane's book opens stating that in the earliest days the world was not yet fully ordered and the process of creation not yet completed. Since reality was fluid, it was relatively easy for mighty wizards such as Finland's Väinämöinen, Taliesin, Manannán mac Lir, Math the Ancient and Gwydion to cast their magic. Magic in those days was almost instinctual and inborn; it was an art. Those days ended with Merlin, the last and greatest of the old wizards. Famous for his aiding King Arthur and the realm of Camelot when he withdrew from the world, magic itself began to withdraw and the wizards retreated from human sight. As a result of Christianity clearly setting and defining the world, the use of magic became much more difficult and even dangerous. It was difficult because it was no longer an art to be understood instinctively but a science that required years of study. It was dangerous because to challenge the order of reality was to challenge God the author of that reality, and, more often than not, the only being willing to aid a wizard in such an effort was Satan himself. Some wizards earned their powers legitimately and used them responsibly; Roger Bacon is one example, as revealed in one tale. Others, such as Michael Scot, gambled their souls by attending the Scholomance, the school of black magic. Still others, such as Faustus, took the quick and easy way and made deals with the Devil, always with grisly results. Concurrent with the scholar wizards were their more humble cousins, the witches. Unlike their male counterparts, their magic retained links to the natural world. Some witches were good and were called white witches, cunning folk, and fairy doctors. They tended to be good Christians and they used their powers for good; their spells were often indistinguishable from prayers. The White Paternoster is just one example. They were needed to counterbalance and oppose their evil sisters who used their powers for the sake of greed, revenge, or even just cruel pleasure. They more often than not placed themselves in the service of the devil and served as his perfect followers. The Witches' Sabbath was their chief pleasure. Lehane closes that as time marched on and witches retreated from humankind, their magic was forgotten and relegated to stories for scaring children. Even so, their ancestors, the sleeping wizards, are still alive and waiting for the time to awaken. The book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following three chapters, which each contain sub-chapters and side bar stories. *Cover: (illustrated by James C.

Born before time began, these creatures were sons of chaos, and so the gods did battle with them, for only when they were beaten could order prevail and the universe be born. Across various cultures, the same told was told with Set and Ra, Marduk, Thor, and Zeus playing the same role. The gods ultimately did prevail and these cosmic dragons were destroyed but the fight was not yet over because they left descendants with whom mortals would do battle. Cadmus's dragon was one example. Chinese dragons and other Asian dragons were an exception to all this; unlike their western cousins, they never lost their semi-divine status and, again unlike them, they were mostly benevolent. The creator goddess Nu Kua was herself partly dragon, and the Emperor of China sat on the Dragon Throne. The Dragon Kings governed wind and water and for the rain they sent the Chinese people loved them. No such love was present for European dragons. While not always evil as seen with the Laidly Worm, dragons were nearly always a threat, and even when they were not, they guarded treasures that man sought, whether gold or water or something else. They had to be destroyed and Christianity, \\"the hammer of the dragon race,\\" proved one of the most powerful weapons against them because it promised a world in which dragons, creatures of appetite, could have no place. Some saints killed their dragons, such as Saint Margaret, while other saints, such as Carantoc, tamed theirs. Regardless of the good intentions of men like Carantoc, however, peaceful coexistence between man and dragon was almost impossible as the tale of Saint Martha and Tarasque shows. The dragonslayers rose up to destroy them as well. Saint George is the most famous example. A dragonslayer could expect to win gold, women, and everlasting glory, but it was usually a quest for survival. In the end, humans civilized the world and drove dragons to extinction.

They were known to the Norse as the Alfar or elves in English and sometimes as fairies, a word that derives from the Latin fatum/fate and fatare/enchant. Fairie correctly refers to their lands or magic. In contrast to mortals, beings who sought order, these magical beings were said to be very fickle and unpredictable. Even members of the usually good Seelie Court were prone to mischief. The chief classifications were the trooping and solitary fairies the aristocrats and peasants of their kind. Among the Trooping fairies are mentioned the Sidhe, the Tuatha Dé Danann and the children of the Dagda. Though friendly enough to their mortal counterparts, they eventually withdrew from their sight and were replaced in mortal interactions by their smaller cousins. Leshy, polevik, and other nature spirits continued to haunt the wilds of the world. They were all very unpredictable; some were friendly to humans and used their powers to help them with their household chores while others were cruel and delighted in tormenting mortals. Inevitably, the fairies weakened in the wake of humanity. This was in changelings; a fairy mother would exchange her child with a human child, perhaps to add the vigor of humanity to a weakening race. Also, the friendly meetings which had characterized their relationship with mortals grew increasingly rare. Husbands of swan maidens often won their wives only through deceit. True love was possible between fairies and mortals but, as in the case of Melusine, the love failed when the mortal husband broke the wife's trust.

A short excerpt, \\"Late one spring night in the last century, a certain Englishman found himself, to his astonishment, standing in the garden outside his house. It was quite bewildering. He remembered falling asleep in his bed, but he had no memory of waking and walking out the door. Yet here he was, shivering in the chill, his bare feet buried in rain-soaked grass. Another surprise awaited him: when he tried the door, it proved to be locked.\\" The book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters. *Chapter One: Guises of the Reaper (pg.6) **Song of the Sorrowing Harp (pg.32) *Chapter Two: Invasions by the Angry Dead (pg.38) **A Meeting on the Road Home (pg.62) *Chapter Three: Shadow Plays of Grief and Pain (pg.70) **The Hooded Congregation (illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg) (pg.100) *Chapter Four: Hands Across the Void (pg.108) **Glam's Tale (pg.132) =Legends of Valour= Written by Brendan Lehane, Legends of Valor centers primarily on Cúchulainn and the world of the Ulster Cycle, and later on King Arthur and the Matter of Britain. Other heroes briefly mentioned are Perseus, Sigurd, and Roland from Greek myth, Volsunga saga, and the Matter of France/Song of Roland, respectively. In detailing the life of Cuchulain, Lehane writes that in the early world, tribes needed champions to protect them and lead them in battle. The king could not risk his life, so in his place a hero fought and were the jewels in a king's crown. It emphasizes that heroes were often born to gods and mortal Queens—it was not given to peasants to sire or spawn heroes. Such men were warriors and were expected to be fierce and savage. Their lives were short, bound to vows of vengeance and the \\"cruel demands of honor.\\" The life of Irish hero Cuchulain is retold, and with it, how while there were other men of the Red Branch, he proved himself the greatest champion of Conchobar mac Nessa, King of Ulster. Cuchulain, the son of Lugh fought bravely for his king and became a warrior without peer, although he was killed by Maeve who tricked him into breaking his various vows or geis. After Cuculain's death, Ireland was plunged into chaos, though later, as the Fenian cycle told, order was restored. Leading men milder and more civilized, but just as valiant, High King Cormac Mac Art and his Fianna protected Ireland from invasion. Even there conflicting vows could spell doom as when Grianne betrayed her husband the king by sleeping with his champion Diarmuid. The rest of the story centers on the \\"Brotherhood of the Round Table.\\" Heroes still lived but they were different from their forebears, most notably in the moralizing effects of chivalry. A knight was expected to be kind to women, to show mercy to defeated foes, and to refuse no plea for help. Horses also gave men greater mobility. Under the salvific influence of Christianity, Arthur and his men were the finest heroes in all Christendom and beyond. Despite the Christian kingdom of Camelot being at peace, such men were needed as giants, dragons, and witches made Britain a place of wonder and danger. Some magical beings, such as the Lady of the Lake, proved friends. However, those who would harm the innocent were kept at bay due to Arthur's Knights, chief among them Lancelot, the Lady's son. Unfortunately, Lancelot's love for Guinevere, Arthur's Queen, would bring down Camelot which was already grievously exhausted by the Grail Quest. In searching for the Holy Grail, the Knights of the Round Table did prove themselves the very best heroes of all times but the loss of so many good men in the quest crippled Camelot and left it vulnerable to decay from within. Arthur's bastard son Mordred, in the end, destroyed the perfect world his father tried to create, though it is promised that one day, Arthur will return.

The first story is an old Danish tale. Following is an excerpt, \\"Within this hall, hearths and torches blazed warm and bright, and drinking horns passed freely among the warriors of the Scylding clan; bards intoned the praises of their chieftain, Hrothgar, the valorous King; harpists sang of warmth and light. Outside the hall, however, solitary in the cold and dark, another kind of being walked. Although manlike, that being was no man. Huge and hairy, it shambled through the night mists of fell and fen, its claws scrabbling from time to time in the dirt as it tore at its hapless prey - hares, ferrets and other small beasts.\\" The book contains 141 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters. *Cover: (illustrated by Matt Mahurin) *Chapter One: Perilous Paths through the Dark (pg.6) **A Reckoning with the Fianna's Ancient Bane (pg.30) *Chapter Two: Visitations from the Realm of Shadow (illustrated by John Jude Palencar) (pg.38) **Charting the Kingdom of Dreams (illustrated by Willi Glasauerhttp://www.williglasauer.de/assets/buecher.pdf) (pg.62) *Chapter Three: Blood Feasts of the Damned (illustrated by Anne Yvonne Gilbert) (pg.72) **Nighstalker of Croglin Grange (pg.98) *Chapter Four: The Way of the Werebeast (pg.108) **The Fox Maiden (pg.132) =Water Spirits= Water Spirits opens with the story of man who saved the life of a mermaid who promptly blessed him with the power to heal and to break witchcraft and cursed him so that every generation one man from his family would drown. This was done to illustrate people's fear of the sea as a mysterious and fickle place that could from one moment give life and in the other death. Water was hailed as the source of life; the Hindus worshipped the Ganges under the name of Ganga, Mimir's well gave Odin his wisdom, the Nile and the Jordan River built civilizations, and everywhere people sought the Fountain of Youth. Water Spirits then points out that the creation myths of many cultures imagine the universe coming out of the watery deep and that many cultures recalled a time when the world was washed clean of sinners by the Great Flood. Humans began taking the initiative in sea quests, however, as seen with Jason and his Argonauts. He was faithful to the gods and led a crew of heroes across the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas. Regardless of his initial faithfulness to the gods, those same gods destroyed Jason but turned the Argo into a constellation. That was a testimony to how fickle the gods could be, because sea gods were viewed in relation to their seas. Poseidon, for example, was as arbitrary as the enchanted seas and magic islands he ruled. On the contrary, the kinder Ea came from the calmer Persian Gulf to teach men civilization and agriculture whilst the consistently cruel Rán ruled the volatile North Sea. The gods would lose their strength, however. In Christian times, sailors no longer worshipped the sea gods but still lived in fear of the sea's power. For example, ships were still launched on Woden's Day/Wednesday and not, for example, on Thor's Day for fear of storms and thunder. Figureheads replaced the oculi, or eyes, of Greek Triremes, but the function remained the same; keep a lookout for evil. Anointing a ship with wine replaced the pagan custom on smearing ships with animal and even human blood. There were limits, as seen with how Christian priests were rarely let on board for fear of angering the old gods. Lakes and rivers held their powers too in the form of Nixes and Undines. The Japanese told of Urashima and Europeans of selkies and mermaids; daughters of foam-born Aphrodite, they were carved on churches as warning against lust.

Humans feared the animals and worshipped the cave bear. Time passed and the cave bear perished, but other beast gods remained such as Cernunnos. The gods of Egypt were beast men and the Greeks spoke of their gods disguising themselves as animals. There are other examples such as Chiron; a centaur, he was hailed as the divine beast. There came the day, however, that Pan, the goat god, died and the beast gods's decline began. This was seen in how animalistic Fomorians of Ireland had lost their magic and were forced to ruling with brute force. They and Balor, their king, were routed by his grandson Lugh of the Long Hand, champion of the ascendant Tuatha de Danaan. Magic was dying as Europe was Christianized, but there were other places in the world such as Asia where magic yet held sway and dog men, monopods, and Blemmyes. It also recounts that many flying animals, both mundane and magical, commanded respect for reason that they were able to escape the mundane world by flight. Pegasus, the roc, simurghs, firebirds, the phoenix, and even ordinary birds like the raven in mythology and the robin were revered. Other flying animals were also known such as griffins, harpies and tengus. Of all magical beasts, however, the unicorn was the most respected. It epitomised beauty and purity but courage as well because it would never let itself be taken alive. Its cousins included China's ki-lin and the Persian karkadann which, unlike their European counterpart, respectively embodied only gentility or ferocity. All, however, could be tamed by maidens. Unicorn horns also had the power to cure poison and disease; in their desire to obtain the horns, humans drove unicorns to extinction. The text mentions other beasts such as the manticore, mermecolion, barometz, basilisk, and peryton.

Tolkien and was an intentional change of spelling) opens with the Younger (\\"Prose\\") Edda, a narration of Norse mythology. It opens with Norse dwarves and tells how the race began soon after Odin and his Aesir killed Ymir, using his flesh to make the earth. The maggots that crawled from the flesh became dwarfs. Corpse grey and subterranean troglodytes, the gods tended to look down on them but the dwarfs, brash and brazen, knew that when Aesir needed weapons or wanted luxuries that the dwarfs by their magical craftsmanship alone could provide what was needed. While author Tim Appenzeller admits that such tales contain much fiction, they still contain a grain of truth. However, in time the dwarfs lost the ability, or the will, to stand as equals to the gods and walked among mortals. With the pagan gods dead and the God and His Church dominant, a new world had dawned. Even so, the dwarf kings such as Herla or Laurin of the Tyrol's Mountains were not afraid and outshone their cavedwelling ancestors in splendor. The dwarfs adapted well to Christian Europe, befriending mortals; Alberich, for example, was famous for befriending King Otnit of Lombardy and going with him to Syria to help him win an exotic pagan princess for a bride. The tale of Elidor is also recounted. The dwarfs' decline is further explored with the dwarfish peasantry. They were friendly towards mortal peasants with whom they shared parallel lives and they often helped each other just as their respective kings did. However, as humans grew stronger, forming centralized states, large cities, roads, and factories, and as the dwarfs' own magic began to fail them, the fragile ties of friendship began to unravel and most dwarfs left the mortal world. Those that remained, abandoned by their fellows suffered a diaspora and placed themselves at mortals' mercy. They went on to become household spirits slavishly serving as domestic help of their particular mortals, though even there they would go into retreat. The last sightings of dwarfs concerned the Knockers, beings that lived in mines and watched over miners. While, the text says, miners would give them food and drink; these were offerings, not rewards. Tim Appenzeller goes on to speculate that knockers are just the most visible members of hidden dwarf kingdoms. While some of them might be recent dwarf refugees from the outside world, some of them might have always lived there, \\"awaiting the day when their earth-shaping skills will once again dazzle mortals and gods alike.\\" The book contains 141 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub- chapters. *Cover: (illustrated by Arthur Rackham) *Contents: (illustrated by James C.

It cites the legends of Og, Orion, Cronus, and Ymir, and shows that in those earliest of days, giants were indeed wielders of incredible size and strength. However, these \\"princes of the cosmos\\" were also superior to the gods (their children) in authority, wisdom, and magic. In fact, it was from the giants that the Greek and Norse gods had to wrest their dominion. Even after, as was seen in the Northlands where the giants held to their power the longest, the gods looked to the giants as equals, beings to whom they would turn in search of wisdom. However, as the \\"first world\\" ended and they lost their equality with the gods, giants assimilated into mortal society. Some, such as Bran the Blessed, went on to become kings and heroes, worthy heirs of their ancestors. Others befriended and watched over the peasantry; some giantesses even used their magic as midwives for their tiny neighbors. However, as the giants' decline accelerated, they grew increasingly hostile to humans. They became enemies of humanity, using their superior strength and their magic to attack the younger race that was taking over their world. Their cousins, the trolls and the ogres, became outright predators raping human women and eating human men. Examples such as the giant who had no heart in his body or of the giant who faced Jack atop the beanstalk (illustrated by the talented Barry Moser, and his company, Pennyroyal Press) are cited. By the end of their existence, when men like King Arthur and Charlemagne ruled, the giants were totally defeated. While there remained a few wise and noble giants such as Ferragus, who battled Roland, they were the exceptions. Most had shrunk in size to the point that they were only slightly larger than humans. Worse, the giants—beings whose wisdom even the gods had once envied—became degenerate cretins, who could be bested by mere children's tricks. Though the giants disappeared, the common folk never forgot them, they remembered the great monuments they had built, such as Giant's Causeway, and the Long Man of Wilmington, as illustrated by Willi Glasauer. *Cover: (illustrated by Roberto Innocenti) *Contents: (illustrated by Alicia Austin) *Chapter One: Princes of the Cosmmos (pg.6) **The Heirs of the First World (illustrated by Matt Mahurin) (pg.30) *Chapter Two: Protectors and Providers (illustrated by Roberto Innocenti, John Howe) (pg.42) **The Tests of the Green Knight (illustrated by Alicia Austin) (pg.68) *Chapter Three: A Deepening Enmity (illustrated by Barry Moser) (pg.78) **Kilhwch and Olwen (pg.102) *Chapter Four: The Twilight of Power (pg.110) **The Earth's Memory (illustrated by Willi Glasauer) (pg.130) *Index: (illustrated by Alicia Austin) =Seekers and Saviors= Tales and beliefs about the adventures of explorers, heroes, and damsels. *Chapter One: Under the Wing of Magic (illustrated by Michael Hague) (pg.6) **An Undying Guardianship (pg.32) *Chapter Two: Tests of Love and Loyalty (pg.48) **A Slave Maiden's Eye for Evil (pg.78) *Chapter Three: Strong Arms, Sturdy Hearts (pg.96) **The Quest of the Fair Unknown (pg.122) =Fabled Lands= About Mythological places *Contents: (illustrated by Michael Hague) *Chapter One: Journeys into Wonder (pg.6) **An Enchanted Archipelago (pg.32) *Chapter Two: Realms of Eternal Night (pg.48) **Daring the Dark (illustrated by Willi Glasauer) (pg.76) *Chapter Three: A Parting of Worlds (pg.90) **The Countess of the Fountain (pg.120) *Index: (illustrated by Michael Hague) =Book of Christmas= Brendan Lehane's Book of Christmas opens with a brief retelling of the Nativity story told in the Gospels of Luke and Mark. It recounts Mary and Joseph going to Bethlehem and the birth of Jesus Christ but states that the pattern was already set. The fact that the birth of Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness, is celebrated in December is no accident. There are many winter festivals. Most people worshipped the sun as a god and so were afraid when winter came and it seemed that the lifegiving sun grew weak; thus they celebrated the Solstice, the winter day when the weakening sun regained its strength. In fact, many Christmas traditions have their roots in pre-Christian traditions but it was the birth of Jesus that made a season of fear into a season of hope. Such fears are mentioned in tales of animal and even human sacrifice meant to appease the pagan gods such as Odin in hopes of surviving winter. Christmas was also said to be the time of the dead; as it was the time when the whole world seemed to die and was an undefined in between time, it was only right the ghosts and monsters rise up against mortals. Similarly, the Wild Hunt and its various leaders are recounted, various heathen deities such as Berchta and Gwyn ap Nudd being cast out by their former worshippers in favor of the Christian God whose mortal birth those worshippers celebrated. However, while winter could be terrifying, Lehane asserts that most Christians were not afraid. They celebrated a topsy-turvy Christmastide with mummers and plays and feasts led by the Abbot of Misrule. Christmas was a time filled with old magic when animals could talk and nature spirits abounded, but followers of the new religion saw nothing strange in keeping their ancestors' pagan traditions alive. Their faith was not the abolition, but rather the fulfillment, of their old rituals because with Jesus, the rituals meant to hold back winter's darkness were vindicated. Lehane states, \\"In the Child born at Bethlehem, they had the promise of spring in the heart of midwinter, the divine gift of a bright, cleansing flame to drive away the dark.\\" *Chapter One: The Eternal Moment (pg.6) **Days of Winter Magic (pg.18) *Chapter Two: The Heart of Darkness (pg.38) **The Midnight Battle (pg.62) *Chapter Three: Summoning the Sun (pg.78) **The Songs of Christmas (pg.104) *Chapter Four: The Light Triumphant (pg.128) =Fall of Camelot= The book is 143 pages long. It is divided into seven chapters. Each chapter deals with a different person in the life of King Arthur. 1\\\\. Arthur (pg.8) Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon sees Igraine, the beautiful wife of Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall. He desires her and asks for help from the Wizard, Prophet and Enchanter Merlin. Merlin promises to do this in exchange for any child that may be conceived from the union. Merlin enchants Uther to look like Gorlois and Uther has his way with Igraine. Nine months later, Arthur is born and taken away by Merlin. He is raised in secret in Wales until the age of fifteen. During a tournament in London, Arthur, acting as a squire, while searching for a sword for the knight he serves, finds the Sword in the Stone in a church courtyard and pulls it out, thereby proving to the world that he is the rightful heir to the throne of England. Even with this heavenly mandate, Arthur still is forced to defeat many other armies in battle in order to win the throne. 2\\\\. Morgause (pg.20) Igraine and Lord Gorlois had had three daughters before Lord Gorlois died. These daughters knew that Arthur was their half-brother. Arthur, though, was unaware. The eldest of the three daughters, Morgause, travelled to Camelot, where Arthur fell in love with her. Merlin prophesied that if Arthur slept with Morgause that the child that would come of it would destroy England and kill Arthur. Arthur ignored this counsel and took Morgause anyway. She then became pregnant and left before Arthur was aware of it. The child that he fathered that evening was Mordred. 3\\\\. Guinevere (pg.36) Guinevere was the daughter of Lord Leodegrain. Arthur fell in love with her and married her. During the wedding feast, Guinevere asked Merlin to perform some magic for her and the guests as entertainment. At first he declined, but then later created an illusion that entertained, but also upset many. After the spell was complete, Merlin told all that his act of casting magic had alerted the Old Ones who were now looking at and paying attention to King Arthur and his court. Having the attention of the Old Ones is something that is not preferred. It can bring a lot of pain. 4\\\\. Morgan (pg.56) All of Gorlois and Igraine's three daughters hated Arthur, but Morgan, the youngest, hated him the most. But she hid her hate well. Arthur knew neither that she was his sister nor that she hated him. She and her husband came to live with Arthur in Camelot, where her husband worked as one of Arthur's knights. Morgan, though, was very beautiful, and many of the knights chose to be close to her. One day, Arthur was kidnapped by a knight who was having an affair with Morgan. Before the fight, Morgan had stolen Arthur's sword Caliburn and had given it to her lover. She then also gave Arthur a cursed copy of his own sword. During the fight, the cursed sword slowed Arthur down and took away enough of his strength that he was about to lose the fight. But the Lady of the Lake arrived, magically pulled the sword from the hand of his enemy, and returned it to Arthur. Arthur, who won the fight, also became aware of Morgan's hate for him. Nevertheless, Morgan tried to kill Arthur several other times, unsuccessfully. 5\\\\. Lancelot (pg.74) At birth, Lancelot's name was Galahad, but after his father was killed and his father's castle destroyed, he was taken and raised by the Lady of the Lake. This was where he received the name Lancelot. He is also sometimes referred to as the \\"Fair Foundling\\" and \\"Lancelot du Lac.\\" He was the greatest of all knights. No one was his equal. He was presented to Arthur when he was eighteen by the faeries. Arthur took him in and trained him to be a knight. Lancelot and Guinevere though fell in love at first sight and they had a secret affair that lasted for years. Morgan, Arthur's half-sister, found out about this affair and informed the King about it. Lancelot had a son with another woman and gave him the name Galahad, which had been his own birth name. 6\\\\. Mordred (pg.90) Mordred was unaware for a long time that his father was Arthur. He came with his mother Morgause and lived in Camelot, where he eventually became one of Arthur's knights. During one travel, Mordred and Lancelot met an old man who prophesied to Mordred that he would kill his own father, Arthur, destroy the knights of the round table, and kill the old man as well, but that his father, Arthur, would also kill him. This is how Mordred found out that Arthur was his father. Mordred grew so angry that he drew his sword and killed the old man instantly. Lancelot felt like killing Mordred for his cruelty, but chose not to. Mordred eventually found out about the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere, and thus, he followed Lancelot and Guinevere and found a place where they were sleeping. In consequence, Mordred brought many knights there to act as witnesses of the affair. Lancelot fought his way out and left Camelot, but Guinevere was taken and arrested. Arthur was law-bound to punish his wife and the law demanded that she be burned at the stake. The next day, many knights had left Camelot, as everyone had loved Guinevere, and her execution sentence seemed so unjust that the round table was broken. Many knights abandoned their brotherhood. The two knights who were ordered to tie her to the stake and burn her refused to wear their armor to do it. They did not agree with the sentence either, and refused to obey it as knights. But as the fires were lit, a band of rebel knights, led by Lancelot, burst into Camelot, killed the men who had been ordered to execute Guinevere, and took Guinevere away to safety. 7\\\\. Gawain (pg.118) The brother of the two knights slain by Lancelot was Gawain. He had been a knight to King Arthur for years and was one of Arthur's most trusted allies. Gawain's anger for Lancelot was deep and insatiable. Nothing would end his anger except the death of Lancelot. Arthur, who now controlled many fewer knights than before, could not risk losing his greatest ally, so, Arthur and his remaining troops camped around the stronghold where Lancelot now lived in France. Guinevere had long since been returned to Camelot after Lancelot vowed to all that no affair had ever taken place. Guinevere was safe because of Lancelot's lie, but Gawain's anger was still demanded that Lancelot die. The siege lasted weeks. During the siege, Arthur received a note that said that Mordred had told the people that Arthur had died in battle and that Mordred was now King. The note also said that Mordred had vowed to take Guinevere as his wife. Arthur immediately returned to Camelot with all of his forces. There was a great battle in which Gawain, Arthur and Mordred were slain. Mordred killed Arthur and as he died, Arthur's stroke also killed his son Mordred. =Magical Justice= *Chapter One: The Code (pg.6) **The Prodigal Mill (pg.8) **A Harsh Payment in Kind (pg.16) **The

transmitted either in first-run syndication or during late-night television programming. The first of these known to be transmitted featured four people who described themselves as being in touch with the Enchanted World: 1\\\\. Susan Hammett, who called herself an authentic witch. She began the first commercial by saying: > \\"People think that witches only exist in fairy tales. I'm living proof that > we're real--and still around today! In fact...I'm from a long line of > witches.\\" 2\\\\. Litany Burns, a self-styled clairvoyant. Her statement was: > \\"Ever since I was a child, I've been able to see things that aren't visible > to ordinary senses. So ghosts are nothing new to me. I've seen them many > times.\\" 3\\\\. Olga Hayes, a tarot card reader. According to her statement: > \\"The tarot cards are over five hundred years old. With them, I can tell a > person's future. I can also tell what they were--in another life.\\" And 4\\\\. Wayne Weiseman, a self-styled psychic and the only male participant in the commercial. As he phrased his contacts with the Enchanted World: > \\"There are times when I find myself in another world. (He here faced the > camera more directly.) I'm actually there. A lot of people have this power. > They just have to develop it.\\" At least two of the later commercials featured actor Vincent Price, well known for his frequent roles in horror films. The first of these, which featured a series of animals—first a rabbit, then a crow or a raven, then a frog, then a cat—transforming into each from the last through special photographic effects, had him, as the narrator, exhorting viewers, \\"Enter 'The Enchanted World.'\\" At the end of this commercial, the cat transformed—again, through special photographic effects—into a human; specifically, self-styled authentic witch Susan Hammett from the previous commercial, who pointed out, \\"After all, how can you be sure witches don't exist--if you don't know what one looks like?\\" In the second, Price was shown on camera promoting the series and reading at least one of the books by candlelight. At one point, a gust of wind from an open window blew out the candle, which Price re-lit with a match. Then, through lighting trickery, his skin turned glowing green. All the commercials ended with announcer Ted Alexander providing a toll-free telephone number for viewers to call, together with a mailing address where payment for each book in the series could be sent after a ten-day trial.

It was the first test of the TX-17 thermonuclear weapon, the first deployed thermonuclear bomb. It was detonated on March 27, 1954, at Bikini Atoll of the Marshall Islands, on a barge moored in the middle of the crater from the Castle Bravo test. It was the first such barge-based test, a necessity that had come about because the powerful thermonuclear devices completely obliterated the small islands following detonation.  Deployment  The tested design became the first air-droppable thermonuclear device, initially the \\"emergency capability\\" EC-17, of which only five were made. The first deployable staged radiation implosion Teller- Ulam thermonuclear weapon evolved into the Mark 17, of which 200 were made. Both of those were huge devices, weighing and respectively. As a result, only the B-36 was capable of carrying that first generation of thermonuclear bombs. They were also some of the largest yield devices deployed by Strategic Air Command — the EC-17 producing around 10 megatonnes (Mt), and the Mk 17 between 11 and 15 Mt. They were all out of service by August 1957.  Design  The Runt device The Runt TX-15 device was a weaponized dry fusion bomb, using lithium deuteride fuel for the fusion stage of a staged fusion bomb, unlike the cryogenic liquid deuterium of the first-generation Ivy Mike fusion device. Similar to the Shrimp TX-21 device tested before in the Castle Bravo test, it differed from that device in using lithium deuteride derived from natural lithium (a mixture of 7.5% lithium-6 and 92.5% lithium-7 isotopes) as the source of the tritium and deuterium fusion fuels, as opposed to the relative high enrichment level of lithium (approximately 40% lithium-6) deuteride used in Bravo.  Yield  Like the Bravo test, it produced far more than its predicted yield, and for the same reason — an unexpected participation of the common lithium-7 isotope in fusion reactions. Although it had been predicted to produce a yield of 4 megatons with a range of 1.5 to 7 megatons (before the results of the Bravo test caused an upgrade in the estimates, it had originally been estimated to produce 3–5 megatons), it actually produced a yield of 11 megatons, the third-largest test ever conducted by the U.S. Like the Ivy Mike and Castle Bravo tests, a large percentage of the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium \\"tamper\\"; 7 megatons of the yield were from this source. Fireball in popular culture Iconic image of the Castle Romeo mushroom cloud One particular image of the Castle Romeo fireball (at right) has been one of the most highly reprinted images of a nuclear explosion. It often serves as a stand-in for nuclear weapons in general for news stories, book covers, magazine articles, etc., likely because of its threatening appearance and extreme red, orange, and yellow hues. The fact that the explosion is of a US megaton-range weapon has not prevented it from being used to represent the arsenals of other states or weapons of far lower yields in many cases, which would have a very different appearance. One prominent usage is as the backdrop for heavy metal band Megadeth's greatest hits compilation Greatest Hits: Back to the Start. The image of Castle Romeo was also used on the cover of the New York hardcore music pioneers Cro-Mags debut album The Age of Quarrel. It is also featured on the title screen of Team17's turn-based artillery game Worms Armageddon. The Castle Romeo photos are sometimes confused with that of Castle Bravo. The two nuclear blasts looked very similar, and they were both conducted in the same location, but much of Bravo's photographic record was destroyed because of its unexpectedly high yield.

Continental Celtic is a geographic, not a linguistic, grouping of the ancient Celtic languages. These were spoken by the people known to Roman and Greek writers as Keltoi, Celtae, Galli and Galatae. They were spoken in an arc from about half of Iberia in the west to north of Belgium and east to the northern Balkans/greater Slovakia and, further east, after being superseded along the coasts, in inner Anatolia (Turkey). Even though Breton is spoken in Brittany continental Europe, and has been since at least the 6th century AD, it is not considered one of the languages as it is a Brittonic language, as are Cornish and Welsh. Whilst a Gaulish substratum in its Vannetais dialect has been mooted (Galliou and Jones 1991) other historical and linguistic evidence points otherwise. Attested Continental Celtic languages Although it is likely that Celts spoke dozens of different languages and dialects across Europe in pre-Roman times, only a small number have been attested: *Lepontic (6th to 4th century BC)Pierre-Yves Lambert, La langue gauloise, éditions errance 1994. p. 14. was spoken on the southern side of the Alps. It is evidenced in a number of inscriptions as well as place names. *Gaulish (3rd century BC to 5th (?) century AD) was the main language spoken in greater Gaul. This is often considered to be divided into two dialects, Cisalpine (the Italian side) and Transalpine (the French side). It is evidenced in a number of inscriptions as well as place names and tribal names in writings of classical authors. It may have been a substratum to Breton, as noted below. *Galatian, which was spoken in the region of Ankara of what is now central Turkey. Classical writers say that the language is similar to that of Gaul. There is also evidence of invasion and settlement of the Ankara area by Celts from Europe. *Noric, which is the name given sometimes to the Celtic dialects spoken in Central and Eastern Europe. It was spoken in Austria and Slovenia; only two fragmentary texts are preserved but there are plenty of known personal names and toponyms. *Celtiberian or Northeastern Hispano-Celtic (3rd to 1st century BC)LAMBERT 14 is the name given to the language in northeast Iberia, between the headwaters of the Douro, Tagus, Júcar and Turía rivers and the Ebro river. It is attested in some 200 inscriptions as well as place names. It is distinct from Iberian. *Gallaecian also known as Gallaic or Northwestern Hispano-Celtic, attested in a set (corpus) of Latin inscriptions containing isolated words and sentences that are unmistakably Celtic.\\"In the northwest of the Iberian Peninula, and more specifically between the west and north Atlantic coasts and an imaginary line running north-south and linking Oviedo and Merida, there is a corpus of Latin inscriptions with particular characteristics of its own. This corpus contains some linguistic features that are clearly Celtic and others that in our opinion are not Celtic. The former we shall group, for the moment, under the label northwestern Hispano-Celtic. The latter are the same features found in well-documented contemporary inscriptions in the region occupied by the Lusitanians, and therefore belonging to the variety known as LUSITANIAN, or more broadly as GALLO-LUSITANIAN. As we have already said, we do not consider this variety to belong to the Celtic language family.\\" Jordán Colera 2007: p.750Prósper, B.M. (2005). Estudios sobre la fonética y la morfología de la lengua celtibérica in Vascos, celtas e indoeuropeos. Genes y lenguas (coauthored with Villar, Francisco). Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca, pp. 333-350. . It was spoken in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula comprising today's Spanish regions of Galicia, western Asturias and western Castile and León, and the Norte Region in northern Portugal. Use of term The modern term Continental Celtic is used in contrast to Insular Celtic. While many researchers agree that Insular Celtic is a distinct branch of Celtic (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), having undergone common linguistic innovations, there is no evidence that the Continental Celtic languages can be similarly grouped. Instead, the group called Continental Celtic is paraphyletic and the term refers simply to non-Insular Celtic languages. Since little material has been preserved in any of the Continental Celtic languages, historical linguistic analysis based on the comparative method is difficult to perform. However, other researchers see the Brittonic languages and Gaulish as forming part of a sub-group of the Celtic languages known as P-Celtic.Pierre- Yves Lambert, La langue gauloise, éditions errance 1994. p. 17. Continental languages are P-Celtic except for Celtiberian, which is Q-Celtic. These have had a definite influence on all the Romance languages.

Early life Diffring was born Alfred Pollack in Koblenz. His father, Solomon Pollack, was a Jewish shop-owner who managed to avoid internment by the Nazi authorities and survived Nazi Germany. His mother, Bertha Pollack (née Diffring), was Christian. He studied acting in Berlin and Vienna, but there is conjecture about when he left Germany prior to the outbreak of World War II. The audio commentary for the Doctor Who series Silver Nemesis mentions that he left in 1936 to escape persecution due to his homosexuality. Other accounts point to him leaving in 1939 and going to Canada, where he was interned in 1940, which is unlikely as he appears in the Ealing Studios film Convoy (released in July 1940, as the officer of the U-37, in an uncredited role). His sister Jacqueline Diffring moved to England and became a sculptor. Although he made two fleeting uncredited appearances in films in 1940, it was not until 1950 that his acting career began to take off. Career Anton Diffring as Baron Frankenstein in Tales of Frankenstein (1958) With numerous World War II dramatic productions in film and television being produced in England in the 1950s, Diffring's \\"Germanic\\" physical type of blond hair, pale blue eyes and chiselled features saw him often cast in roles as Nazi military officers in films such as Albert R.N. (1953) and The Colditz Story (1955). Some of his more notable roles as German characters were in The Heroes of Telemark (1965), The Blue Max (1966), Where Eagles Dare (1968), as SS officer Reinhard Heydrich in Operation Daybreak (1975), and the football match commentator in Escape to Victory (1981), though he also played a Polish parachutist in The Red Beret (1953). He played Hitler's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in the American mini-series The Winds of War (1983). In the Italian war movie Uccidete Rommel, shot in an Egyptian desert in 1969, he played the role of a British officer of the SAS. On stage, Diffring played the title role in the flop musical \\"Mister Venus\\", opposite Frankie Howerd. The show, with book by Ray Galton and Johnny Speight opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre on 23 October 1958 but closed after just sixteen performances. Diffring sang two solo numbers in the show: \\"Love Like Ours\\" and \\"Tradition\\".Theatre programme: Mister Venus, Prince of Wales Theatre The music was by Trevor H. Stanford (Russ Conway) and Norman Newell. He played an important part in the TV mini-series Flambards, that of the aeronautical pioneer who assists William Russell (Alan Parnaby), second in line of inheritance to the Flambards Estate, who is obsessed with flying. Diffring's character was a German living in Britain shortly before the beginning of the Great War. Diffring starred in a number of horror films, such as The Man Who Could Cheat Death (1959) and Circus of Horrors (1960) and played the lead in the television pilot Tales of Frankenstein (1958). He also appeared in quite a number of international films, such as Fahrenheit 451 (1966) directed by François Truffaut. His final performance was again as a Nazi for the BBC in the 1988 Doctor Who serial Silver Nemesis, in which he agreed to appear because the filming in England coincided with the Wimbledon Championships, which he wanted to attend. Death Diffring died on 19 May 1989 from cancer at his home in Châteauneuf-Grasse, in the South of France, at the age of 72. His body was buried in the graveyard of St. Andrew's Church, in the village of White Colne in Essex.Entry for the grave of Diffring in 'Findagrave' website (2019).

The Riddle-Master of Hed is a fantasy novel by American writer Patricia A. McKillip and the first book of her Riddle Master trilogy. The novel and trilogy utilize themes from Celtic mythology. Setting In a fantasy world, the ruler of each land has a mystical awareness of his or her land called the land-rule. The seldom-seen High One presides over all. Riddles, typically questions about obscure pieces of lore, feature significantly, as well as shapeshifting magic. Plot summary The titular Riddle-Master is Morgon, the Prince of Hed, a small, simple island populated by farmers and swineherds. The prince, inexplicably, has three stars on his forehead. Morgon's sister Tristan discovers that he keeps a crown hidden under his bed. He explain that he won it in a riddle-game with the ghost of the cursed king Peven of Aum. When Deth, the High One's harpist, discover this, he explains that another king, Mathom of An, has pledged to marry his daughter Raederle to the man who wins that crown from the ghost. Accompanied by Deth, Morgon sets forth to claim his bride. En route, the ship is sunk by mysterious shapechangers. Shipwrecked, Morgon loses his memory and the power of speech. When Deth finds Morgon again, after he has regained both. Morgon resolves to travel to question the High One about the shapechangers. The High One's home, located in the far north on Erlenstar Mountain, is seldom visited. As Morgon and Deth travel the length of the realm, they are repeatedly attacked by the shapechangers, and Morgon learns more and more perilous knowledge concerning the three stars and the great powers which come with them. He also comes to know personally the land rulers of Ymris, Herun, Osterland, and Isig. Critical reception The novel was voted #13 in Locus' 1987 \\"All-Time Best Fantasy Novels\\" reader poll.

Plot summary  The novel is a tale of a group of people caught by the spell of the mysterious and enigmatic Mischa Fox - the enchanter - possibly foreign, definitely wealthy, and said to have great, perhaps mystical powers. Peter Saward, a scholar, is in love with Rosa Keepe. Ten years previously, Rosa refused Fox's marriage proposal, and is currently engaged in an affair with two Polish immigrants, the Lusciewicz brothers. Rosa's brother, Hunter, edits a suffragette magazine. The fearsome Calvin Blick, Fox's despised agent, is attempting to buy the magazine for Fox, and performs other machinations. The adventurous, willful Annette Cockeyne, age 19, drops out of school to learn from real life, but gets in over her head, especially after she becomes a target of Fox's attention. John Rainborough, a bureaucrat, suffers from unrequited love and threats to his authority from his \\"typist,\\" Miss Casement. Nina the dressmaker clothes both Annette and Rosa, and is meanwhile one of Fox's agents, or perhaps his slave. The Flight from the Enchanter, Warner Books, 1973 Contemporary themes Set mainly against the background of post-WWII West London, issues of immigration and women's liberation recur throughout the story. Through his connection to Rainborough, Hunter Keepe accesses classified information on immigration policy to use against Stefan Lusiewicz, who he wants out of his house. Another Eastern European, Nina, kills herself after discovering she might be deported. Annette, smitten with a seemingly uncaring Fox, attempts suicide in a London hotel room. A group of elderly Suffragettes inject humour into the story. Although apparently preposterous, they hold high moral principles and show more decisiveness than anyone.

He was educated at Liège and became a royal chaplain to Duke William of Normandy, who later became King William I of England. After the Norman Conquest, the king nominated Thomas to succeed Ealdred as Archbishop of York. After Thomas' election, Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, demanded an oath from Thomas to obey him and any future Archbishops of Canterbury; this was part of Lanfranc's claim that Canterbury was the primary bishopric, and its holder the head of the English Church. Thomas countered that York had never made such an oath. As a result, Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. The King eventually persuaded Thomas to submit, but Thomas and Lanfranc continued to clash over ecclesiastical issues, including the primacy of Canterbury, which dioceses belonged to the province of York, and the question of how York's obedience to Canterbury would be expressed. After King William I's death Thomas served his successor, William II, and helped to put down a rebellion led by Thomas' old mentor Odo of Bayeux. Thomas also attended the trial for rebellion of the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, Thomas' sole suffragan, or bishop subordinate to York. During William II's reign Thomas once more became involved in the dispute with Canterbury over the primacy when he refused to consecrate the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm, if Anselm was named the Primate of England in the consecration service. After William II's sudden death in 1100, Thomas arrived too late to crown King Henry I, and died soon after the coronation. Early life Thomas is sometimes referred to as Thomas I to distinguish him from his nephew Thomas, who was also an Archbishop of York. The elder Thomas' father was a priestBarlow William Rufus pp. 198–199 named Osbert; his mother was named Muriel, but little else of them is known.Douglas William the Conqueror p. 129 He had a brother named Samson, who was Bishop of Worcester from 1086 until 1112. He was of Norman descent. Under the patronage of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, both boys were sent to Liège for their education.Barlow English Church p. 250 Thomas may also have studied with Lanfranc in Normandy while the latter was teaching at the Abbey of Bec,Cowdrey \\"Thomas\\" Oxford Dictionary of National BiographyVaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan pp. 32–33 and some scholars contend that he also studied in Germany and Spain.Welborn \\"Lotharingia as a Center of Arabic\\" Isis pp. 197–198 Thomas then returned to Normandy to become one of Bishop Odo's officials and a chaplain, or secretary.Chibnall Anglo-Norman England pp. 126–127 He was a canon and the treasurer of Bayeux Cathedral as well as a member of Duke William's ducal clergy before the Norman Conquest of England. The new King named him a royal clerk after the Battle of Hastings.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops Archbishop under William I alt=Embroidered image of a walking man in chainmail and helm holding a club over his head Thomas succeeded Ealdred as Archbishop of York in 1070; he was nominated on 23 May and was probably consecrated on 25 December.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 281 The appointment of Thomas was a departure for the King, who had usually promoted Norman nobles or monks when he was still Duke of Normandy. The appointment was more consistent with English norms, as most of those appointed to the English episcopate before the Conquest had previously been royal clerks.Hill and Brooke \\"From 627 until the Early Thirteenth Century\\" History of York Minster pp. 19–20 Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, pursuing a claim that Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined to make such a written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before.Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan pp. 161–163 King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury.Douglas William the Conqueror pp. 321–323Chibnall Anglo-Norman England pp. 39–40 Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, it was the beginning of the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York.Barlow English Church p. 33 The next year both archbishops travelled to Rome for their palliums, where Thomas took advantage of the opportunity to ask Pope Alexander II to decree that the sees of Canterbury and York were equal. Thomas also sought to have the pope declare that the midland sees of Worcester, Dorchester on Thames, and Lichfieldall south of the River Humberwere part of the Archdiocese of York rather than Canterbury. The 12th-century chronicler Eadmer, a monk at Canterbury, wrote much later that Thomas had resigned and surrendered his archiepiscopal symbols, but they were promptly returned to him by Lanfranc on the pope's orders. The story's partisan source casts some doubt on its accuracy.Ruud \\"Episcopal Reluctance\\" Albion pp. 165–167 The pope referred the dispute to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council decided that the Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics were taken from the province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies.Dawtry \\"Benedictine Revival\\" Studies in Church History 18 p. 94 The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England – such as the Danish king.Higham Kingdom of Northumbria p. 246 However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland.Duggan \\"From the Conquest to the Death of John\\" English Church and the Papacy in the Middle Ages p. 103 Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors. All of these decisions were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or representative of the pope, as well as many bishops and abbots.Huscroft Ruling England p. 128 Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to Alexander II, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope Gregory VII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere.Barlow English Church pp. 39–42 In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland.Hudson Viking Pirates p. 165 Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.Kapelle Norman Conquest of the North p. 132 Thomas reorganised the cathedral chapter during his archiepiscopate, establishing a group of secular canons with individual prebends to provide the clergy with income. The cathedral chapter at York had until then lived in a group, but Thomas' reforms allowed the clergy to live in their own houses. Thomas also set up a number of officials within the cathedral chapter, including a dean, treasurer, and precentor. He increased the number of clergy in the chapter, increasing it from the three he found at York when he took office, and reorganised the episcopal and chapter's estates, giving a number of estates to the chapter.Norton Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux pp. 4–5 He introduced the continental system of archdeacons to the Diocese of York, dividing the diocese into territorial units and appointing an archdeacon to each.Barlow English Church pp. 48–49 Archdeacons were responsible for aiding the bishop or archbishop with his episcopal duties, collecting revenues, and presiding over some judicial courts.Brett English Church Under Henry I pp. 204–205 Rebuilding the cathedral Shortly before Thomas' appointment, York Minster, the cathedral of the archdiocese, was damaged in a fire that swept through York on 1069,Norton Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux p. 1 and which also destroyed the refectory and dormitory for the canons. Soon after his consecration, Thomas had a new dormitory and refectory built and a new roof put on the cathedral; these appear to have been temporary measures however, as some time later, probably in about 1075, he ordered the construction of a new cathedral on a different site. The new building, much larger than the one it replaced,Norton Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux pp. 9–11 has not survived. It was excavated between 1966 and 1973, showing the plan of the cathedral to be different from most others built in England around that time. It was longer, had no aisles in the nave, and it had a rectangular ring crypt that had been long out of style in 1075. Because of the way the foundations were laid out, it appears likely that the entire building was planned and built in one design phase, with few modifications.Norton Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux pp. 14–15 It may have been that Thomas designed his cathedral to be as unlike Canterbury Cathedral as possible, perhaps because of the conflict between York and Canterbury over primacy.Plant \\"Ecclesiastical Architecture\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 236 William of Malmesbury, a 12th-century writer, states that Thomas finished the cathedral, and this is corroborated by the fact that Thomas was buried in the minster in 1100. Some elements of Thomas' structure are still visible in the crypt of York Minster.Higham Kingdom of Northumbria p. 249 Serving William II The tomb of alt=A stone slab on the ground with carved lettering on it After the death of the Conqueror, Thomas was loyal to the third son, William Rufus, who had inherited England instead of the eldest brother, Robert Curthose. Thomas supported Rufus despite a rebellion led by his old mentor Odo of Bayeux, and the Archbishop accompanied the King on his campaigns to put down the revolt.Barlow William Rufus p. 95 Thomas attended the subsequent trial for rebellion in 1088 of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, who had sided with Odo. William was Thomas' sole suffragan bishop, but it was Thomas who pronounced the sentence of the court.Barlow English Church pp. 283–284 In 1092 and again in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained about what he felt were infringements of York's rights. The first of these occasions was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter was referred to as Primate of England. The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury.Cantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture pp. 64–65 The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate. Hugh the Chanter, who was a member of the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used.Vaughn Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan p. 148 Modern historical opinion is divided, with Frank Barlow, author of The English Church 1066–1154 inclined towards the primatial title,Barlow English Church pp. 42–43 but with Richard Southern, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title.Southern Saint Anselm pp. 340–341 The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts. Herbert de Losinga was appointed a papal legate in 1093 by Pope Urban II to investigate the matter of Thomas' profession of obedience to Lanfranc. Herbert seems to have done nothing about investigating the issue. Also in 1093, King William II gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the Abbot of Selby Abbey in compensation for the loss of York's claim to the Diocese of Lincoln.Knowles Monastic Order p. 631 While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097, Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester, and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor, an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury's province, and it was Anselm's right to consecrate the new bishops.Cantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture pp. 50–52 In 1100 after the sudden death of King William II and the seizure of power by the King's younger brother Henry, Thomas arrived in London too late to crown Henry I, as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice, Bishop of London, in the absence of both archbishops. Anselm at this time was still in exile.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England p. 171Cantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture pp. 135–135 Thomas was initially angry at the slight, until it was explained to him that the King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay. To mollify him, Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation.Crouch Normans p. 166 Death and legacy Thomas died at York on 18 November 1100. He was considered to have been an excellent archbishop, and ensured his cathedral clergy were well cared for. He repaired the cathedral and did much to promote trade in the city of York.Chibnall Anglo-Norman England p. 152 Thomas also helped to advance the careers of his family; one of his nephews, Thomas II of York, became Archbishop of York in 1108, and another, Richard, became Bishop of Bayeux in 1107.Barlow English Church p. 58 During his lifetime, Thomas was praised for his learning, his encouragement of education in his diocese, and his generosity. He was an excellent singer and composed hymns. In his youth, he was known for having a sturdy build, and in his old age he had a ruddy complexion and snow white hair.Norton Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux p. 3 Thomas composed the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror's tomb in St. Etienne in Caen, but the chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition.Barlow William Rufus p. 51 Thomas did not concern himself with the church–state issues surrounding the Investiture Crisis, but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert primacy over the whole of England.Cantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture p. 36 Later authors, including William of Malmesbury and Hugh the Chantor, praised Thomas for his generosity, chastity, elegance, and charm.Barlow English Church Notes Citations References         * * Category:1100 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Normans in England Category:Archbishops of York Category:People from Calvados (department) Category:11th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Norman clerics given benefices in England Category:Burials at York Minster Category:11th-century English clergy ","title":"Thomas of Bayeux"},{"id":"2196144","text":"Thomas II (died 24 February 1114) was a medieval archbishop of York.

Handbook of British Chronology p. 281 at the request of the dean and cathedral chapter of York. Because he refused to profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, his consecration was delayed and formed part of the Canterbury-York dispute. Thomas said that the chapter would not allow him to make a written profession, and the chapter wrote as a body to Archbishop Anselm confirming this. Meanwhile, the dean of York went to Rome to procure the pallium for Thomas, which was sent with a papal legate. Anselm died in April 1109 without any resolution to the dispute between the two archbishops. Anselm had told the bishops before his death that he felt that Thomas must make a profession of obedience, and obediently the bishops appealed to the king's court to make Thomas do so. Henry I and his bishops finally decided against Thomas, who capitulatedCantor Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture pp. 300-301 and was consecrated in London on 27 June 1109 by Richard de Beaumis, Bishop of London. He received his pallium from Cardinal Ulrich, the legate, on 1 August 1109. Thomas worked to extend York's metropolitan authority over Scotland, and consecrated Michael of Glasgow as Bishop of Glasgow. Michael made a written profession of obedience to York before his consecration.

The first of many U.S. and international security breach notification laws, it was introduced by California State Senator Steve Peace on February 12, 2002, and became operative July 1, 2003.  Sections  Enactment of a requirement for notification to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. Essentially, this requires an agency, person or business that conducts business in California and owns or licenses to computerized 'personal information,' to disclose any breach of security (to any resident whose unencrypted data is believed to have been disclosed). The bill mandates various mechanisms and procedures with respect to many aspects of this scenario, subject also to other defined provisions. The statute requires notification if you meet the following: # Any agency that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information # shall disclose any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the security of the data # to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. An out-of-state corporation that has personal information relating to a California resident would fall under this statute. A question on minimum contacts would then ensue as to whether an action may be brought in California to enforce the California resident's rights under the statute. Corporations with no physical locations in California are not subject to California law. SB 1386 no more impacts a Delaware corporation with no presence in California than do California laws regarding vehicle emissions. That SB 1386 would affect an out-of-state corporation is based on the notion of 'quasi in rem' jurisdiction, a notion that the Supreme Court invalidated in Shaffer v. Heitner. Corporations can determine whether they are subject to this statute by reviewing the following questions: # Does their data include \\"personal information\\" as defined by the statute? # Does that \\"personal information\\" relate to a California resident? # Was the \\"personal information\\" unencrypted? # Was there a \\"breach of the security\\" of the data as defined by the statute? # Was the \\"personal information\\" acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person? A corporation that answers yes to all five of these questions must report. The statute does not apply to \\"encrypted\\" information. Thus one way to avoid reporting is to encrypt all \\"personal information.\\" A corporation can also avoid reporting if its data does not contain \\"personal information\\" relating to a California resident. \\"Personal information\\" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted: # Social security number. # Driver's license number or California Identification Card number. # Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. \\"Personal information\\" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.

Although the barge had been moored in over of water, the test left a crater in diameter and deep in the bottom of the lagoon. Like the Ivy Mike, Castle Bravo, and Castle Romeo tests, a large percentage of the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium tamper, which contributed to the extensive fallout caused by these tests.

Garlawolu (sometimes seen as \\"Garlawulo,\\" \\"Galawolu\\" or \\"Galawulo\\"), (born 1951) is a Liberian politician and attorney. Origins Garlawolu was born to Mr. Flomo Garlawolu and Madam Towin Var Garlawolu in the small village of Garlawoluta, then Jorquelleh District (now Yellequelleh District), Bong County, Republic of Liberia. Legal and political career After completing his studies at the University of Liberia in the 1970s, Garlawolu began working as an attorney on human rights cases in Liberia. He successfully defended poor people, labor unions, and opposition groups in the 1980s. Garlawolu passed the Bar Examinations, and was admitted to the Supreme Court Bar in 1983. He holds several awards including the Albent Award for the democratization of Liberian society. In 1984, Garlawolu served as a Deputy Trial Counsel of the Supreme Military Tribunal with the rank of Captain. In 1990, when the Country was divided by the Civil war, Garlawolu founded a national movement for the protection of civilian rights. This organization was known as the concerned citizen movement of Liberia. He was its National Chairman. He attended all the peace conferences from Africa to Europe, which led to the formation of a government of National Unity, in which he became the first Attorney General and Minister of Justice in 1996. In 1997, he was elected as Senior Senator of Bong County and chaired the Senate Standing Committee on Judiciary & Human Rights. Following the dethroning of the Taylor-led-government, Garlawolu was unanimously elected as member of the National Transitional Legislative Assembly in 2003. Garlawolu was unanimously elected by his Colleagues to chair the Judiciary Committee - which Committee he still chairs. Garlawolu is a member of the International Criminal Law Network based in The Hague with the rights of a defense Counsel. He is accredited to practice before the International Criminal Court & International Court of Justice. In 2003, Garlawolu filed a case on behalf of the Liberian Government against the Government of Sierra Leone before the International Court of Justice. He also represented ex-president Charles G. Taylor before the Special Court in Sierra Leone. He has represented Charles Taylor's wife in divorce proceedings. Garlawolu takes credit for building schools, a clinic, and a church in Bong County. He is married to Mrs. Serena F. Garlawolu, who has been described as a civil rights activist and a humanitarian. Mrs. Garlawolu, a Senior Student at the Louis Author Grimes School of Law, University of Liberia, is the Consul General for South Korea in Liberia. Garlawolu is the author of two books: \\"The Liberian Civil War and Efforts for Peace\\" and \\"The Abandoned Child.\\" The latter is used as literature for the 9th grade class of the Liberian School System. 2005 presidential election Garlawolu, as a Constitutional Lawyer, represented the Grand Coalition of political parties before the Supreme Court of Liberia in 1986. The Grand Coalition was founded by five political parties against the then ruling party, the National Democratic Party of Liberia. Upon hearing that the Coalition had scheduled a mass Rally at the Coconut Plantation Beach of Monrovia, the Government of Liberia filed a petition for a writ of prohibition against the holding of the rally. The Leaders of these parties (Unity Party, Liberia Unification Party, LAC & United People's Party) were arrested and detained. Garlawolu represented them. He has represented most of the individuals and political parties seeking participation in the upcoming elections. Garlawolu at one point intended to be a presidential candidate on the ticket of the National Patriotic Party (NPP), and declared that he hoped to win more than 75% of the votes in the October, 2005 presidential elections. When the list of 22 accepted presidential candidates was announced by the National Election Commission in August 2005, however, Garlawolu's name was not on the list. Reports suggest that he lost the NPP primary to Dr. Roland Massaquoi. \\"Get Informed International\\" Garlawolu accepted the U.S.-based company Get Informed International, Inc.'s proposal for establishing and implementing an economic development platform in Liberia as the basis for the economic aspect of his campaign and as the economic platform that would have been implemented upon his election. Garlawolu also appointed Get Informed International, Inc. as his official presidential advisor in all economic issues as well as other issues in the best interests of the growth and development of Liberia. Get Informed International's officers were involved in the U.S. branch of Garlawolu's election campaign. Get Informed International's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are also committee managers in the Nuwaubian Trust Freedom Network which is working for the release of Malachi Z. York from an American prison. Senator Garlawolu was reported as assisting in this effort.

It is similar to hemodialysis and based on the same principles. Like a bioartificial liver device, it is a form of artificial extracorporeal liver support.https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2015&q;=liver+dialysis&hl;=en&as;_sdt=0,14 A critical issue of the clinical syndrome in liver failure is the accumulation of toxins not cleared by the failing liver. Based on this hypothesis, the removal of lipophilic, albumin-bound substances such as bilirubin, bile acids, metabolites of aromatic amino acids, medium-chain fatty acids and cytokines should be beneficial to the clinical course of a patient in liver failure. This led to the development of artificial filtration and absorption devices. Hemodialysis is used for kidney failure and primarily removes water-soluble toxins. However, it does not remove toxins bound to albumin that accumulate in liver failure. Liver dialysis is performed by physicians and surgeons and specialized nurses with training in gastroenterological medicine and surgery, namely, in hepatology, the study of the liver, alongside their colleagues in the intensive or critical care unit and the transplantation department, which is responsible for procuring and implanting a new liver, or a part (lobe) of one, if and when it becomes available in time and the patient is eligible. Because of the need for these experts, as well as the relative newness of the procedure in certain areas, it is usually available only in larger hospitals, such as level I trauma center teaching hospitals connected with medical schools.  Prognosis/survival  While the technique is in its infancy, the prognosis of patients with liver failure remains guarded. Liver dialysis, currently, is only considered to be a bridge to transplantation or liver regeneration (in the case of acute liver failure) and, unlike kidney dialysis (for kidney failure), cannot support a patient for an extended period of time (months to years).  Devices  Artificial detoxification devices currently under clinical evaluation include the Single Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD), Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS)®, Prometheus system, and Dialive. = Single Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD) = Single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) is a simple method of albumin dialysis using standard renal replacement therapy machines without an additional perfusion pump system: The patient's blood flows through a circuit with a high-flux hollow fiber hemodiafilter, identical to that used in the MARS system. The other side of this membrane is cleansed with an albumin solution in counter-directional flow, which is discarded after passing the filter. Hemodialysis can be performed in the first circuit via the same high-flux hollow fibers. =Molecular adsorbents recirculation system= The Molecular Adsorbents Recirculation System (MARS) is the best known extracorporal liver dialysis system and has existed for approximately fifteen years. It consists of two separate dialysis circuits. The first circuit consists of human serum albumin, is in contact with the patient's blood through a semipermeable membrane and has two filters to clean the albumin after it has absorbed toxins from the patient's blood. The second circuit consists of a hemodialysis machine and is used to clean the albumin in the first circuit, before it is recirculated to the semipermeable membrane in contact with the patient's blood. = Comparing SPAD, MARS and CVVHDF = SPAD, MARS and continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) were compared in vitro with regard to detoxification capacity. SPAD and CVVHDF showed a significantly greater reduction of ammonia compared with MARS. No significant differences could be observed between SPAD, MARS and CVVHDF concerning other water-soluble substances. However, SPAD enabled a significantly greater bilirubin reduction than MARS. Bilirubin serves as an important marker substance for albumin-bound (non-water-soluble) substances. Concerning the reduction of bile acids no significant differences between SPAD and MARS were seen. It was concluded that the detoxification capacity of SPAD is similar or even higher when compared with the more sophisticated, more complex and hence more expensive MARS. As albumin dialysis is a costly procedure, financial aspects are important: For a seven-hour treatment with MARS, approximately €300 for 600 ml human serum albumin solution (20%), €1740 for a MARS treatment kit, and €125 for disposables used by the dialysis machine have to be spent. The cost of this therapy adds up to approximately €2165. Performing SPAD according to the protocol by Sauer et al., however, requires 1000 ml of human albumin solution (20%) at a cost of €500. A high-flux dialyzer costing approximately €40 and the tubings (€125) must also be purchased. The overall costs of a SPAD treatment is approximately €656—30% of the costs of an equally efficient MARS therapy session. The expenditure for the MARS monitor necessary to operate the MARS disposables is not included in this calculation. = Prometheus = The Prometheus system (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) is a device based on the combination of albumin adsorption with high-flux hemodialysis after selective filtration of the albumin fraction through a specific polysulfon filter (AlbuFlow). It has been studied in a group of eleven patients with hepatorenal syndrome (acute-on-chronic liver failure and accompanying kidney failure). The treatment for two consecutive days for more than four hours significantly improved serum levels of conjugated bilirubin, bile acids, ammonia, cholinesterase, creatinine, urea and blood pH. Prometheus was proven to be a safe supportive therapy for patients with liver failure. = Dialive = Dialive (Yaqrit Limited, London, UK) incorporates albumin removal and replacement and, endotoxin removal. It is at \\"Technology readiness level\\" (TRL) 5, which means it is validated in the disease environment.

The name is Italian for \\"donkey- inhabited\\", but it is thought to derive from the Latin \\"sinuaria\\", and meaning sinus-shaped. The island is virtually uninhabited. The census of population of 2001 lists one man. The island is located off the north-western tip of Sardinia, and is mountainous in geography with steep, rocky coasts. Because fresh water is scarce, trees are sparse and low scrub is the predominant vegetation. Part of the national parks system of Italy, the island was recently converted to a wildlife and marine preserve. It is home to a population of wild Albino donkeys from which the island may take its name. Geography and geology Asinara is located at the north-western tip of Sardinia. It is a territory of with a length of and a width which ranges from at Cala di Sgombro to of the northern part, as well as of coast length. The highest point, at , is Punta della Scomunica. The territory is entirely state property. The island is formed by four mountainous sections linked by a narrow, flat coastal belt. The windswept west coast is steep and rocky with a very deep sea bottom. The west coast turns down towards the bay of Asinara. As an extension of the larger island, Asinara is the second largest island after Sant'Antioco. The surface is hilly, covered by thick Mediterranean scrub and few trees, with the exception of a wooded area in the northern part of the island. In the other parts of the island only small trees survive, mostly junipers. The island has indented coast, as seen from Cape Falcone. The west side of the island is more rocky and steep, while the east has wide, flat areas with a maximum height of . There are only three sandy beaches, all on the eastern coast. , of the surrounding marine and underwater environment is a protected natural area. From a geological point of view, the Asinara is part of the Nurra of north-western Sardinia, made up by more than 80 percent of metamorphic rock. The rock characterizes the island landscape together with the woody vegetation. Among the metamorphic rocks, great interest is attached to rare black Hercynean amphibolites 950 million years old, the oldest rocks in Italy. History =Early history= right right Human habitation on the island dates back to the Neolithic Age, with Domus de Janas (sprites' houses) near Campu Perdu. Carved into soft limestone, the constructions are unique to the island. Because of its central position in the Mediterranean, Asinara was known and used by Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans. The Camaldolite monastery of Sant'Andrea and the Castellaccio on Punta Maestra, Fornelli, may date to the Middle Ages. Cala d'Oliva, first village at the time of the prison. The island was also an object of pirate raids by the Saracens. Later, ownership of Asinara was contested between Pisa, the Republic of Genoa, and the kingdom of Aragon. From the 17th century, shepherds from Sardinia and Liguria colonized the island. In 1721, it became property of the Savoy Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1885 the island became state property; a lazaretto, the Primario Lazzaretto del Regno d'Italia, was built at Cala Reale and an agricultural penal colony was established at Cala d'Oliva, by order of King Umberto I of Italy. About 100 families of Sardinian farmers and Genoese fishermen who lived on Asinara were obliged to move to Sardinia, where they founded the village of Stintino. During the First World War, the island was used as a prison camp for some 24,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers, 5,000 of whom died during their imprisonment. It was used as a place of detention for Ethiopian POWs during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Majority of the Ethiopians kept there were members of the Ethiopian nobility. In the 1970s the prison facilities were refurbished as a maximum security prison. In past years was assigned mainly to detention of mafia members and terrorists, and has housed the likes of such as the mafia boss Totò Riina. Prisoners and warders were the only inhabitants of Asinara for about 110 years, until the closure of the prison in December 1997. Construction on the island has been forbidden for the last century. =Modern history and the national park= The Albino Donkey for which the island probably was named. In 1997 Asinara was established as a National Park, and is now a nature reserve. Its natural beauty, unspoiled by the sparse human settlement, made it an ideal candidate. Since 1999, tourists have been able to visit Asinara Island, but only through organized and guided tours. Swimming is permitted only on three beaches and docking of private boats is forbidden. In 2002, the waters offshore of the national park were zoned and designated as Italy's newest marine protected area, encompassing of coastline around the island and of its coastal waters. There are two no access, no fishing zones on Asinara Island. There are many species of native and introduced mammals on the island, including horses, asses, goats, sheep, and pigs. The island's vegetation is a mix of plants native to Sardinia, plants common throughout the Mediterranean, or introduced plants found in other bioregions, including North America. The island also harbors several rarely seen species, including the white Asinara donkey. There are many old facilities on the island, including the prison facilities, but also small cities built for and by the inhabitants of the quarantine camp, and for the staff that serviced the camp and the prison. All of these have been turned over to the national park, and in tandem the marine protected area, who sorted out what will be kept and with what restoration is needed. Details of protection Cala Sabina. A Presidential Decree, on 3 October 2002, officially set both the Park and the Park body, which is a management body envisioned for national parks by a framework on protected areas. The park body will also manage the Protected Marine Area set by decree of the Minister of the environment and land protection on 13 August 2002. Both the park and the marine area are enclosed in the protected area \\"international cetacean sanctuary\\"(Act. 391/01). Asinara is furthermore a Site of Community importance.(on 3 April 2000). There are strict regulations on the island put in place to guarantee the conservation of the marine and land habitats. Institutional decrees (M.D. 28.11.97, M.D. 13.8.02, Presidential Decree 3.10.02), with numerous clauses, include no permission to use own vehicles, prohibition of sport fishing, anchorage and navigation with the exception of authorized means. Ecology The vegetation of Asinara is a typical Mediterranean macchia, with lentisk, Euphorbia, tree heath (Erica arborea), Calicotome spinosa, Phillyrea angustifolia, Phoenician juniper and cistus. The flora consists of 678 species, 29 of which are endemic. Some, such as Centaurea horrida, Limonium laetum and Limonium acutifolium, are exclusive to northern Sardinia, while others are characteristic of the Sardinian – Corsican region. The fauna numbers around 80 wild species of terrestrial vertebrates, including mouflon, wild boar, horses, Sardinian donkeys and the white Asinara donkey, which was introduced onto the island at the beginning of the 1800s, and probably abandoned when the inhabitants were moved to Stintino. Birds include the rare Audouin's gull, cormorants, peregrine falcons and the Barbary partridge. Asinara is the only place in Sardinia where the magpie is present. The marine setting is rocky in the eastern side, with steep slopes and ravines, but mainly sandy in the western area. The shallowest part of the coast is colonized by two rare species, the red alga Lithophyllum lichenoides and the endangered giant limpet Patella ferruginea. The integrity of the ecosystem is due to the history of its settlement, or rather the lack of it, that is a characteristic of the island.

Sir Dennistoun Burney rose to fame as an airship designer, best known for his work at Howden on the R100 for Vickers. Starting in 1927, thirteen cars were made at Maidenhead. Each was different, as they were intended as showcases for his patents rather than for serious production. Engine and running gear The cars incorporated such features as independent suspension, hydraulic brakes, a heater and all seating within the wheelbase. Ignition and other controls operated through flexible cables encased in copper tubing, which followed contemporary aircraft industry practice. The cars were rear-engined with twin radiators. Shows cut-away view of car. The first car used an Alvis front- wheel-drive chassis effectively turned back-to-front but adapted so the new front wheels steered. Later cars used Beverley straight 8, Lycoming and Armstrong Siddeley engines. Body The streamlined bodywork is very long at just under . The spare wheel was carried inside one of the rear doors which must have put an enormous strain on the hinges and door pillar. The equivalent space in the opposite door was occupied either by a second spare wheel or a cocktail cabinet. The car's unusual aerodynamic design was eye catching, with very little front overhang, but a long rear overhang (containing the engine). The underside was also covered in sheet metal to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The Streamline pointed to the future in terms of space efficiency, featuring a seven-seat interior and, even by the standards of the time, excellent headroom, which seems to have been a particular concern for the designer. Commercial Each car was priced at around £1,500. A blue one was bought by the Prince of Wales late in 1930, and another crossed the Atlantic to be exhibited at the Detroit Car Show. In total, 12 Streamlines were built between 1929 and 1931, but none appears to have survived.\\"Inventor and Streamlined Car With Rear Engine Will Sail From England Tomorrow.\\" This will be the ninth one built; the Prince of Wales bought the fifth one. Crossley Motors took out a licence to build the Streamline, producing a further 25 vehicles, of which two survive. The Straight eight Beverley-Barnes engines in the earlier cars proved to be unreliable, and in the final three cars were replaced by US-built 6-cylinder Lycoming or UK-built Armstrong Siddeley units. Streamline Cars finally closed in 1936. Driving impressions A contemporary report commended the lack of mechanical noise from the driver's seat and the excellence of the ride. The car's considerable weight – 38 cwt or about 1900 kg on the 1930 model – may have been one cause of the clutch-slip reported at 76 mph (about 122 km/h) which was close to the car's claimed maximum. The engine was mounted wholly behind the rear axle, and the car was therefore alarmingly unstable in wet or windy weather. A remarkable turning circle of was achieved in spite of the car's length. No two Streamlines were identical and the version tested was \\"only\\" 18 ft 7 in (approximately 5.6 meters) long with a 12 ft 5 in (3.8 m) wheelbase which made it unwieldy in restricted spaces. It was longer than the longest available Rolls-Royce and only about £350 cheaper. Aftermath Some of the ideas (including the location of the spare wheel) were used by Crossley Motors in their \\"Streamline\\" but this also was not a production success. The Maidenhead factory was also used for car production by Marendaz and GWK.

He also worked as an actor; his most famous role was that of the unnamed man shot by Marshal Matt Dillon in the opening sequences of the long-running television series Gunsmoke. As a joke on the producers, James Arness and Arvo actually did the opener once with Dillon falling to the ground. Born to Finnish immigrant parents Los Angeles Times Obituaries, July 20, 2005 Retrieved August 31, 2011 as a young man, Ojala taught himself marksmanship and how to quick-draw a handgun while living on his father's ranch near Yakima, Washington. He said he sharpened his marksmanship skill by shooting the heads off rattlesnakes. During the early 1950s, Ojala was living in Los Angeles, and working for the Hollywood film studios. \\"I watched these guys in Westerns,\\" he told a reporter in 1957, \\"and realized that they were slow on the draw because the cylinder of their guns got stuck in their holsters. I decided the trick was to keep the cylinder free. I began making holsters in my garage. I lined each one with metal so a man could draw without any impediment. Then I began practicing myself. After a year or two I got it down so pat that today I can double draw in one-sixth of a second.\\"Shearer, Lloyd. 1957. St. Petersburg Times, September 29, p. 113. Ojala was \\"the genuine article\\" to those he tutored. His speed was clocked and verified a number of times. He could draw, fire, and hit the target in one- sixth of a second, faster than the eye can blink. His technique of cocking \\"in the holster\\" as he drew revolutionized the western and was shown in detail both by Henry Fonda in the western film The Tin Star and by John Payne in his series The Restless Gun. At the height of the TV Westerns, Ojala opened a \\"quick-draw\\" studio on the 8500 block of the Sunset Strip, next to the famous King's Cellar Liquor Store. For further proof, Arvo would drop a silver dollar with his gun hand (right) from belt height, then draw and hit the coin before it could fall four inches. This was using \\"live\\", or full-power ammunition, not the wax bullets and quarter-loads used today in so-called \\"fast draw\\" competitions. In another exhibition, his opponent (using blanks) would face him with his pistol out of the holster and cocked, then nod as he simultaneously fired his revolver, while Arvo would draw and fire before the opponent could get a shot off. He never lost. In August 1956, Ojala filed a patent application for his low-slung, metal-lined \\"Quick Draw Holster\\", and in April 1958, he was granted US Patent 2832519. His holster was publicly described in the New York Times on May 3, 1958. Disputes over similar holsters made by others resulted in a published court case—California Court of Appeals, OJALA v. BOHLIN, 178 Cal.App.2d 292 (1960) Docket No. 23844, February 24, 1960. Among the TV and film stars that Ojala taught to shoot included James Arness, Robert Culp, James Garner, Kevin Kline, Paul Newman, Hugh O'Brian, Clint Walker, Marilyn Monroe and Thomas F. Wilson. He was a close personal friend to Audie Murphy with Murphy becoming Arvo's children's Godfather. He noted that most actors in westerns had, at best, a nodding acquaintance with handguns, especially the 1873 Colt .45s widely used in television and film because of their reliability. But, a gifted teacher, he said he could teach the necessary skills to anyone in two weeks. He also had speaking roles in many television series and films, to include the 1959 film The Oregon Trail, in which his expertise as a gunhandler, fastdraw artist, and instructor were shown. Usually, it was Arvo's hand that was actually shown in close-up when real speed and spinning skills were needed. His wife Doris Severson, preceded him in death (1951 - 1978). He is survived by his children Valerie, Jon, Erikk, Inga and Kym.

It has a population of about 1,200 (2001), shown in the 2011 Census as being included in the population of Chapel-en-le-Frith. It straddles the A6 road approximately three miles north of Buxton and three miles south of Chapel-en- le-Frith. Trains run from Dove Holes railway station into Manchester. Residents of the village live either in the village or on outlying farms. There are around six farms in the village and many more within the boundaries of the parish. There are also large limestone quarries that, over the years, have made an important contribution to the development and economy of the village. Additionally, there are several businesses. There are two public houses, one of which offers accommodation. There is a daily milk delivery service and a mobile library every fortnight. There is a church, Methodist chapel and a community centre. The village lies on the fringe of the Peak District National Park. Evidence of human occupation at Dove Holes can be traced back to the Neolithic Period (late Stone Age) because of the existence of a henge, known locally as The Bull Ring, and an adjoining tumulus. In medieval times the area was used as the royal hunting Forest of High Peak (now known as Peak Forest), an area set aside as a royal hunting forest. The village's name is believed to derive from the Celtic word dwfr (dŵr in modern Welsh), which means water, hence Water Holes or Dove Holes. The same word is the origin of the name 'Dover' for the famous Channel ferryport. In 1650, a General Survey of the Manor of High Peak was made to assess the property of the late King Charles. This recorded that people were burning limestone around the village and that there were 14 kilns thereabouts, the burnt lime (quicklime) being slaked and used by farmers to condition the soil in their fields. At that time, lime kilns could be built and demolished without authority. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, and the opening of the Peak Forest Tramway in 1796, the limestone quarries were commercialised. The first of these was at nearby Loads Knowl and others quickly followed along Dove Holes Dale. Undoubtedly, the opening of the Peak Forest Tramway and the consequent expansion of commercial limestone quarries contributed greatly to the expansion of the village. For the first time, there was an outlet for limestone in Manchester via the Peak Forest Tramway, Bugsworth Basin, the Peak Forest Canal and the Ashton Canal. Buxton Mountain Rescue Team has been based in Dove Holes since the 1970s. Their present base in the village was opened in 1990 by HRH Diana Princess of Wales. There is a High Peak bus company garage on the east side of the A6, replacing the one which used to be in Buxton. In 2001, the village was voted the ugliest village in Britain in a Radio 5 Live poll. However Dove Holes railway station was chosen in 2019 to feature in the music video for the chart-topping single \\"Someone You Loved\\" by singer Lewis Capaldi. Cemex operate a quarry in Dove Holes.

Life He was the youngest son of Freeman Thomas and Amelia, daughter of Colonel Thomas Frederick. His elder brothers included Freeman Frederick Thomas, a noted cricketer, who was the father of Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon, Viceroy of India; and Sir Charles Inigo Thomas. He was born at Ratton Park, Sussex, and educated at Haileybury College. He was intended for the Civil Service, but delicate health interfered with his studies, and in 1873 he went to Paris to cultivate the musical talent he had displayed from an early age. Here he studied for two years with Émile Durand. In 1875, he returned to England, and in 1877 entered the Royal Academy of Music, where for three years he studied under Ebenezer Prout and Arthur Sullivan, twice winning the Lucas medal for composition. At a later period he received some instruction in orchestration from Max Bruch. His first published composition was a song, Le Roi Henri, which appeared in 1871. An early comic opera, Don Braggadocio (libretto by his brother, C. I. Thomas), was apparently unfinished; some of the music in it was afterwards used for The Golden Web. A selection from his second opera, The Light of the Harem (libretto by Clifford Harrison), was performed at the Royal Academy of Music on 7 November 1879, with such success that Carl Rosa commissioned him to write Esmeralda (libretto by Theophile Marzials and Alberto Randegger), dedicated to Pauline Viardot, produced at Drury Lane on 26 March 1883. (Creator cast: Georgina Burns (Esmeralda): Barton McGuckin (Phoebus): William Ludwig (Frollo): Leslie Crotty (Quasimodo): Clara Perry (Fleur-de-Lys): Leah Don (Lois): J.H. Stilliard (Chevreuse): Ben Davies (Gringoire): G.H. Snazelle (Clopin).) This contained the very successful aria \\"O, vision entrancing\\". Two years later the opera was given (in German) at Cologne and Hamburg, and in 1890 (in French) at Covent Garden. On 16 April 1885, at Drury Lane, Rosa produced Thomas's fourth and best opera, Nadeshda (libretto by Julian Sturgis); a German version of which was given at Breslau in 1890. A fifth opera, The Golden Web (libretto by Frederick Corder and B. C. Stephenson), an opéra bouffe slighter than its predecessors, was produced (after the composer's death) by the Carl Rosa Opera Company at Liverpool on 15 February, and at the Lyric Theatre, London on 11 March 1893. In spite of some positive critical attention, interest in the opera was short-lived.\\"The Golden Web\\", The Musical Times March 1893, p. 152; and \\"Facts, Rumours, and Remarks\\", The Musical Times, January 1893, pp. 18–20 Besides these dramatic works, Thomas's chief compositions were a psalm, Out of the Deep, for soprano solo and chorus (London, 1878); a choral ode, The Sun Worshippers (Norwich, 1881), and a suite de ballet for orchestra (Cambridge, 1887). A cantata, The Swan and the Skylark, was found in piano score among his manuscripts after his death: it was orchestrated by Charles Villiers Stanford, and produced at the Birmingham Festival of 1894. His minor compositions include over 100 songs and duets. In 1891 Thomas became engaged to be married; shortly afterwards he showed signs of mental disease, and his career came to a tragic end on 20 March 1892 when he committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train. He was buried in Finchley Cemetery. Goring Thomas occupies a distinct place among English composers of the 19th century. His music, which shows traces of his early French training, reveals a great talent for dramatic composition and a real gift of refined and beautiful melody. Personally the most amiable of men, he was most critical of his own work, never attempting anything for which he felt he was unfitted, and constantly revising and rewriting his compositions.

General Tactics  Another Mesopotamian tactic involved small, well-disciplined spearman formations.

These missile units were later idealized in the famous epic poem \\"The Sie.\\" The Mesopotamian battle formation consisted of the shield wall and short-sword armed sliders in front, and the missile troops behind, with charioteers on the flanks.

Plot summary The story is told in the first person, and the nameless detective known only as The Continental Op investigates a theft of diamonds from the Leggett family of San Francisco. The plot involves a supposed curse on the Dain family, said to inflict sudden and violent deaths upon those in their vicinity. Edgar Leggett's wife is a Dain, as is his daughter Gabrielle. The detective untangles a web of robberies, lies and murder. It is discovered that Gabrielle Leggett is under the influence of a mysterious religious cult and is also addicted to morphine. Gabrielle escapes from the cult and marries her fiancé Eric Collinson, but bloodshed continues to follow her. The Continental Op, on behalf of four successive clients, investigates the reason behind all the mysterious, violent events surrounding Gabrielle Leggett, which he eventually uncovers. The concluding chapters of the novel contain a detailed description of how the Op weans her from her drug habit, and the novel ends on a hopeful note.

Distribution  This genus has not yet become established in the USA, but it is considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore, it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA.Cowie R. H., Dillon R. T., Robinson D. G. & Smith J. W.

(1979). \\"The origin and evolution of the gastropod family Pomatiopsidae, with emphasis on the Mekong river Triculinae\\". Academy of natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Monograph 20: 1-120. . at Google Books. proposed a Gondwanan origin for the Pomatiopsidae, with rafting to mainland Asia via the Indian Craton after break-up of Gondwanan and colonization of South-East Asia and China. It is hypothesized that Oncomelania snails, arrived in southwestern China from Indian before the second (major) Tibetan orogeny (2.5 Ma), then evolved and spread down their respective river systems, to mainland of China, Indonesia and Philippines. Although mutation rate calibrations using fossil data is impossible here, many studies have demonstrated the confidence that molecular data can provide reasonable estimates of divergence time. Data by Zhao et al. (2010) suggested that the two subspecies of Oncomelania hupensis began to diverse as early about 2–6 Ma based on the invertebrate ITS substitution rate range. Zhao et al. (2010) did not find any strong molecular and fossil evidences about Oncomelania evolution, but the reported Oncomelania fossil found in Guangxi (1 Ma) by Nils Hjalmar Odhner in 1930 and geological movement make this diversification time reasonable. It provides a new insight into the Oncomelania evolution history although the substitution rate needs to be verified with new fossil and molecular data in future study.  Parasites  Various Oncomelania species are significant medically, because they can serve as vectors for two serious human diseases: they can carry the schistosomiasis blood fluke parasite, and the paragonimus lung fluke parasites. The miracidia reproduce asexually through sporocyst stages within these intermediate hosts, resulting in the production of many free-swimming cercariae.Riley S, Carabin H, Bélisle P, Joseph L, Tallo V, et al.

It is owned by HMV. History =Origins= The company was setup by Englishman Gordon Montgomery and began as a one-man stall in Glasgow, Scotland in 1981. The name \\"Fopp\\" comes from the title of a song by the Ohio Players on their 1975 album Honey. By 2007, Fopp had expanded to become a chain of over 100 branches in the UK. With the demise of rival chain Music Zone, Fopp became the third largest specialist music retailer in the UK in terms of shop numbers (after HMV and Virgin Megastores). =Administration= Having taken over rival chain Music Zone following its fall into administration, Fopp found itself with cash flow problems. The company cancelled book deliveries in June blaming a change in location of warehouse from Bristol to Stockport (the old Music Zone warehouse). On 21 June 2007, the company began accepting only cash transactions, stating card authorisation problems as the cause.Neelam Verjee & Robert Lindsay, Music chain in talks with administrators, Times Online, 28 June 2007, accessed 16 September 2007 On 22 June 2007 the company closed all branches for 'stocktaking' and said it was in talks with its bank. A week later the company announced a temporary closure in all its outlets and its online venture, and staff were informed that they would not be receiving their monthly pay. On 29 June 2007, Fopp called in receivers after a last-ditch deal that would have allowed Sir Richard Branson a way to devolve himself from the loss making Virgin Megastores without the negative PR of closing down multiple locations, but this deal failed to win support from Virgin's main supplier. The shops were closed, and staff were sent home with their monthly salaries unpaid. The Fopp website was taken down shortly afterwards and replaced with the following message: Ernst & Young was appointed as joint administrator of Fopp and Music Zone, and issued a press statement detailing shops closed and the numbers of jobs lost at each location. =HMV ownership= Fopp store in London On 31 July 2007, it was announced that HMV would take control of the Fopp brand and its shops in Cambridge, Edinburgh Rose Street (but not Cockburn Street), Glasgow, London Covent Garden, Manchester and Nottingham. On 12 February 2008, Bristol Evening Post reported that a further shop would open in Bristol (in a former HMV-owned Waterstone's store), a city in which three Fopp shops had traded prior to summer 2007. On 24 August 2007, the Glasgow Union Street and Edinburgh stores reopened. The Cambridge shop reopened on 25 August 2007, and the Manchester shop was relaunched on the 27th. After a statement from HMV stating that it was unable to open the Covent Garden London branch, it finally gained the landlord's consent to take over the lease and the shop reopened on 5 October 2007. Only around 10% of the original 700 employees kept their jobs. It was also announced that the Leamington Spa shop would be reopening as Head, a separate shop from Fopp, but retaining Fopp's stock and assets.Oliver Williams, The music is back: independent store set to take over from Fopp, Leamington Courier, 12 October 2007, accessed 23 October 2007 The Head shop opened on 1 November 2007 and employed some of its predecessor's former employees. The shop intends to host regular performances from local bands, and hopes to allow musicians, artists and authors from Leamington and its surrounding areas to sell their work there. This was initially a single shop, but has more recently expanded into a chain of four sites. In 2009 the HMV shop in Exeter, Devon, was rebranded as a new Fopp shop while HMV moved to a new building in the redeveloped Princesshay Shopping Centre. Also in August 2010, HMV opened a new Fopp store on the ground floor of the Waterstone's store in Gower Street, London. On 30 January 2011, HMV closed the Fopp shop in Exeter due to poor sales in the recent reform of HMV. It was the first Fopp shop to close under the HMV banner. In January 2014, Fopp announced it would be closing the London Gower Street branch within Waterstone's on 18 January 2014, with the remaining business transferring to the Covent Garden branch. At their peak under HMV ownership, nine shops were trading as Fopp.HMV starts the buy-up of Fopp, Bearded Magazine Online, 31 July 2007, accessed 16 September 2007 On 15 January 2013 Fopp, along with its parent company HMV went into administration. HMV was bought out of administration by Hilco UK on 5 April 2013 saving Fopp's nine remaining shops. On 28 December 2018, HMV confirmed it had again been placed into administration, which Hilco UK cited the \\"tsunami\\" of retail competition as the reason for the move. On 5 February 2019, Canadian record shop chain Sunrise Records announced its acquisition of HMV Retail Ltd. from Hilco UK for an undisclosed amount, but at the cost of closing 26 locations, including four Fopp shops, leaving only six shops trading under the name. In January 2020 the Byres Road shop in Glasgow closed leaving only five stores. Merchandising The first Fopp shop was a market stall in Decourcey's Arcade near Byres Road in Glasgow opened 1981 by Gordon Montgomery. Fopp operated a \\"keep-it-simple\\" approach to the pricing of its merchandise, with most prices rounded to whole-pound figures. It built a reputation for reasonable prices on new releases, and competitive prices (often £5) on non-mainstream catalogue CDs, DVDs and books. The company also had a policy called \\"suck it and see\\", whereby any purchase could be returned to the shop within 28 days for a full refund as long as it was as new. Locations As of 2020, Fopp has five shops across England and Scotland - London Covent Garden, Manchester, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Glasgow Union Street. Until 2007 there were 50 Fopp shops and 37 outlets branded as Music Zone throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Fopp appeared in The Scotsman's list of the 250 Biggest Scottish Companies of 2005.Scotsman 250 (2005), Scotsman Online, accessed 16 September 2007 In February 2019 it was announced that the shops in Oxford, Bristol, Manchester and Byres Road will close,, however the store in Manchester reopened soon after, in May 2019.

The species sometimes is called the Japanese lung fluke or oriental lung fluke. Human infections are most common in eastern Asia and in South America. Paragonimus westermani was discovered when two Bengal tigers died of paragonimiasis in zoos in Europe in 1878. Several years later, infections in humans were recognised in Formosa.  Introduction  Paragonimiasis is a food-borne parasitic infection caused by the lung fluke. It may cause a sub-acute to chronic inflammatory disease of the lung. It is one of the most familiar lung flukes with the widest geographical range. It was discovered by Coenraad Kerbert (1849–1927) in 1878.  Causative agent  More than 30 species of trematodes (flukes) of the genus Paragonimus have been reported to infect animals and humans. Among the more than 10 species reported to infect humans, the most common is Paragonimus westermani, the oriental lung fluke.  Morphology  Paragonimus westermani. An adult of the hermaphroditic generation. In size, shape, and color, Paragonimus westermani resembles a coffee bean when alive. Adult worms are 7.5 mm to 12 mm long and 4 mm to 6 mm wide. The thickness ranges from 3.5 mm to 5 mm. The skin of the worm (tegument) is thickly covered with scalelike spines. The oral and ventral suckers are similar in size, with the latter placed slightly pre-equatorially. The excretory bladder extends from the posterior end to the pharynx. The lobed testes are adjacent from each other located at the posterior end, and the lobed ovaries are off-centered near the center of the worm (slightly postacetabular). The uterus is located in a tight coil to the right of the acetabulum, which is connected to the vas deferens. The vitelline glands, which produce the yolk for the eggs, are widespread in the lateral field from the pharynx to the posterior end. Inspection of the tegumental spines and shape of the metacercariae may distinguish between the 30-odd species of Paragonimus spp. but the distinction is sufficiently difficult to justify suspicion that many of the described species are synonyms. Egg of Paragonimus westermani * Eggs: Paragonimus westermani eggs range from 80 to 120 µm long by 45 to 70 µm wide. They are yellow-brown, ovoid or elongate, with a thick shell, and often asymmetrical with one end slightly flattened. At the large end, the operculum is clearly visible. The opposite (abopercular) end is thickened. The eggs are unembryonated when passed in sputum or feces. * Cercaria (not shown): Cercariae are often indistinguishable between species. There is a large posterior sucker, and the exterior is spined. * Metacercaria: Metacercariae are usually encysted in tissue. The exterior is spined and has two suckers * Adults: Adult flukes are typically reddish brown and ovoid, measuring 7 to 16 mm by 4 to 8 mm, similar in size and appearance to a coffee bean.They are hermaphroditic, with a lobed ovary located anterior to two branching testes. Like all members of the Trematoda, they possess oral and ventral suckers.  History of discovery  P. westermani was discovered in the lungs of a human by Ringer in 1879 and eggs in the sputum were recognized independently by Manson and Erwin von Baelz in 1880. Manson proposed the snail as an intermediate host and various Japanese workers detailed the whole life cycle in the snail between 1916 and 1922. The species name P. westermani was named after Pieter Westerman (1859–1925) a zookeeper who noted the trematode in a Bengal tiger in an Amsterdam Zoo[Artis].  Life cycle  Unembryonated eggs are passed in the sputum of a human or feline. Two weeks later, miracidia develop in the egg and hatches. The miracidia penetrate its first intermediate host (snail). Within the snail mother sporocyst form and produce many mother rediae, which subsequently produce many daughter rediae which shed crawling cercariae into fresh water. The crawling cercariae penetrate fresh water crabs and encyst in its muscles becoming metacercaria. Humans or felines then eat the infected crabs raw. Once eaten, the metacercaria excysts and penetrates the gut, diaphragm and lung where it becomes an adult worm in pairs. The first intermediate hosts of the Paragonimus westermani are freshwater snails: * Koreoleptoxis amurensisWorld Health Organization (1995). Control of Foodborne Trematode Infection.

Paragonimus has a quite complex life-cycle that involves two intermediate hosts as well as humans. Eggs first develop in water after being expelled by coughing (unembryonated) or being passed in human feces. In the external environment, the eggs become embryonated. In the next stage, the parasite miracidia hatch and invades the first intermediate host such as a species of freshwater snail. Miracidia penetrate its soft tissues and go through several developmental stages inside the snail but mature into cercariae in 3 to 5 months. Cercariae next invade the second intermediate host such as crabs or crayfish and encyst to develop into metacercariae within 2 months. Infection of humans or other mammals (definitive hosts) occurs via consumption of raw or undercooked crustaceans. Human infection with P. westermani occurs by eating inadequately cooked or pickled crab or crayfish that harbor metacercariae of the parasite. The metacercariae excyst in the duodenum, penetrate through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, then through the abdominal wall and diaphragm into the lungs, where they become encapsulated and develop into adults. The worms can also reach other organs and tissues, such as the brain and striated muscles, respectively. However, when this takes place completion of the life cycles is not achieved, because the eggs laid cannot exit these sites.  Epidemiology  Reservoir hosts of Paragonimus spp. include numerous species of carnivores including felids, canids, viverrids, mustelids, some rodents and pigs. Humans become infected after eating raw freshwater crabs or crayfish that have been encysted with the metacerciaria. Southeast Asia is more predominately more infected because of lifestyles. Raw seafood is popular in these countries. Crab collectors string raw crabs together and bring them miles inland to sell in Taiwan markets. These raw crabs are then marinated or pickled in vinegar or wine to coagulate the crustacean muscle. This method of preparation does not kill the metacercariae, consequently infecting the host. Smashing rice-eating crabs in rice paddies, splashing juices containing metacercariae, can also transmit the parasite, or using juices strained from fresh crabs for medicinal uses. This parasite is easily spread because it is able to infect other animals (zoonosis). An assortment of mammals and birds can be infected and act as paratenic hosts. Ingestion of the paratenic host can lead to infection of this parasite. Paragonimus westermani is distributed in southeast Asia and Japan. Other species of Paragonimus are common in parts of Asia, Africa and South and Central America. P. westermani has been increasingly recognized in the United States during the past 15 years because of the increase of immigrants from endemic areas such as Southeast Asia and is estimated to infect 22 million people worldwide.  Transmission  Transmission of the parasite P. westermani to humans and mammals primarily occurs through the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. In Asia, an estimated 80% of freshwater crabs carry P. westermani. In preparation, live crabs are crushed and metacercariae may contaminate the fingers/utensils of the person preparing the meal. Accidental transfer of infective cysts can occur via food preparers who handle raw seafood and subsequently contaminate cooking utensils and other foods. Consumption of animals which feed on crustaceans can also transmit the parasite, for cases have been cited in Japan where raw boar meat was the source of human infection. Food preparation techniques such as pickling and salting do not exterminate the causative agent. For example, in a Chinese study eating \\"drunken crabs\\" was shown to be particularly risky because the infection rate was 100% when crabs are immersed in wine for 3–5 minutes and fed to cats/dog.  Reservoir  Animals such as pigs, dogs, and a variety of feline species can also harbor P. westermani.  Vector  There is no vector, but various snail and crab species serve as intermediate hosts. In Japan and Korea, the crab species Eriocheir is an important item of food as well as a notable second intermediate host of the parasite.  Incubation period  Time from infection to oviposition (laying eggs) is 65 to 90 days. Infections may persist for 20 years in humans.  Pathology  Once in the lung or ectopic site, the worm stimulates an inflammatory response that allows it to cover itself in granulation tissue forming a capsule. These capsules can ulcerate and heal over time. The eggs in the surrounding tissue become pseudotubercles. If the worm becomes disseminated and gets into the spinal cord, it can cause paralysis; capsules in the heart can cause death. The symptoms are localized in the pulmonary system, which include a bad cough, bronchitis, and blood in sputum (hemoptysis).  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is based on microscopic demonstration of eggs in stool or sputum, but these are not present until 2 to 3 months after infection. However, eggs are also occasionally encountered in effusion fluid or biopsy material. Furthermore, you can use morphologic comparisons with other intestinal parasites to diagnose potential causative agents. Finally, antibody detection is useful in light infections and in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary paragonimiasis. In the United States, detection of antibodies to Paragonimus westermani has helped physicians differentiate paragonimiasis from tuberculosis in Indochinese immigrants. Additionally, radiological methods can be used to X-ray the chest cavity and look for worms. This method is easily misdiagnosed, because pulmonary infections look like tuberculosis, pneumonia, or spirochaetosis. A lung biopsy can also be used to diagnose this parasite.  Management and treatment  According to the CDC, praziquantel is the drug of choice to treat paragonimiasis. The recommended dosage of 75 mg/kg per day, divided into 3 doses over 3 days has proven to eliminate P. westermani. Bithionol is an alternative drug for treatment of this disease but is associated with skin rashes and urticaria. For additional information, see the recommendations in The Medical Letter (Drugs for Parasitic Infections).

Acute symptoms: The acute phase (invasion and migration) may be marked by diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, cough, urticaria, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary abnormalities, and eosinophilia. The acute stage corresponds to the period of invasion and migration of flukes and consists of abdominal pain, diarrhea and urticaria, followed roughly 1 to 2 weeks later by fever, pleuritic chest pain, cough and/or dyspnea. Chronic Symptoms: During the chronic phase, pulmonary manifestations include cough, expectoration of discolored sputum, hemoptysis, and chest radiographic abnormalities. Chronic pulmonary paragonimiasis, the most common clinical pattern, is frequently mild, with chronic cough, brown- tinged sputum (the color being caused by expectorated clusters of reddish brown eggs rather than by blood) and true hemoptysis.  Confusion with tuberculosis  Practitioners should always consider the possibility of tuberculosis in patients with fevers, cough, and weight loss. However, in endemic areas it is prudent to consider paragonimiasis as well. Flukes occasionally cause confusion when they invade the pleural space without entering the lung parenchyma. > \\"In contrast to tuberculosis, pulmonary paragonimiasis is only rarely > accompanied by rales or other adventitious breath sounds. Many patients are > asymptomatic, and symptomatic patients frequently look well despite a > prolonged course.\\" In pleural paragonimiasis, symptoms may be minimal and diagnosis complicated, since ova are not coughed or spit out or swallowed and there is frequently no cough. Such patients may develop pleural effusions and, because of the coendemicity with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (and co-infection in some patients), such effusions are often misdiagnosed as isolated tuberculosis. *Adapted from Heath, Harley W & Susan G Marshall. \\"Pleural Paragonimiasis In A Laotian Child.* Extra-pulmonary locations of the adult worms result in more severe manifestations, especially when the brain is involved. Extra-pulmonary paragonimiasis is rarely seen in humans, as the worms nearly exclusively migrate to the lungs. Despite this, cysts can develop in the brain and abdominal adhesions resulting from infection have been reported. Cysts may contain living or dead worms; a yellow-brownish thick fluid (occasionally hemorrhagic). When the worm dies or escapes, the cysts gradually shrink, leaving nodules of fibrous tissues and eggs which can calcify. Worldwide the most common cause of hemoptysis is paragonimiasis. Other case studies: * *  Public health and prevention strategies  Prevention programs should promote more hygienic food preparation by encouraging safer cooking techniques and more sanitary handling of potentially contaminated seafood. The elimination of the first intermediate host, the snail, is not tenable due to the nature of the organisms habits. A key component to prevention is research, more specifically the research of everyday behaviors. This recent study was conducted as a part of a broader effort to determine the status of Paragonimus species infection in Laos. An epidemiological survey was conducted on villagers and schoolchildren in Namback District between 2003 and 2005. Among 308 villagers and 633 primary and secondary schoolchildren, 156 villagers and 92 children had a positive reaction on a Paragonimus skin test. Consequently, several types of crabs were collected from markets and streams in a paragonimiasis endemic area for the inspection of metacercariae and were identified as the second intermediate host of the Paragonimus species. In this case study, we see how high prevalence of paragonimiasis is explained by dietary habits of the population. Amongst schoolchildren, many students reported numerous experiences of eating roast crabs in the field. Adult villagers reported frequent consumption of seasoned crabs (Tan Cheoy Koung) and papaya salad (Tammack Koung) with crushed raw crab. In addition to this characteristic feature of the villagers' food culture, the denizens of this area drink fresh crab juice as a traditional cure for measles, and this was also thought to constitute a route for infection.

He first came to the territory in 1935, when he traveled to Unalakleet to visit his uncle, Charles Traeger, who ran a trading post there and spent 2 years developing a portfolio of Alaskan scenes. After leaving Alaska, he spent some time as an illustrator in New York, but longed to return to Alaska. He returned in 1942 after volunteering with the U.S. Navy and requesting a posting to the Aleutian Islands during World War II. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was responsible for intelligence for the North Pacific Command. After the war, he trained for a short time at the Art Students League in New York, studying lithography under Will Barnet, and then returned to Unalakleet in 1946. Machetanz married Sara Dunn, a writer, in 1947, and the two settled near Palmer, Alaska in 1951. They published several books together and collaborated on films for Walt Disney, the Territory of Alaska, and Encyclopædia Britannica. They also made many promotional and lecture tours through the lower 48 states from 1948 through 1960. The turning point in Fred's painting career came on April 21, 1962, when Bob Atwood, editor and publisher of the Anchorage Times, arranged for a one-man show of his paintings. The works at the show sold quickly, and the success allowed Fred to pursue painting full-time. Style Machetanz was a strong colorist. He most often painted on hardboard, which was prepared with layers of an ultramarine blue base using a large brush. He then applied a transparent oil glazing technique to build up layers from there, emphasizing areas of color and form. This gave his works a cool, luminous quality that he felt reflected the environment of the Arctic. During his career, he produced fifty stone lithographs of scenes of Alaska. Honors He was named Alaskan of the Year in 1977, and American Artist of the Year in 1981 by American Artist magazine. Machetanz was also awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Alaska and The Ohio State University. As a result of their philanthropic activities, several facilities are named for the Machetanz's including: the football field at Palmer High School, a building at Mat-Su College, a theatre in Wasilla, and Fred & Sara Machetanz Elementary School in Wasilla. Family Fred and Sara had a son, Traeger, in 1959 who practices law in Washington and Alaska. Through Traeger, Fred and Sara are the grandparents of Alex (b. 1992) and Olivia (b. 1996.)

It is centred on Wollaton Hall, a classic Elizabethan prodigy house which contains the Nottingham Natural History Museum, with the Nottingham Industrial Museum in the stable block. Various events including concerts are held in the park. History The enclosure of Wollaton Park required the destruction of the village of Sutton Passeys. It was enclosed by Henry Willoughby, 6th Baron Middleton with a red brick wall at the start of the nineteenth century. Originally , land sales have reduced the park to . In this park during World War II, American troops of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the US 82nd Airborne Division, were billeted, waiting to be parachuted into Europe, which they did in June 1944. A small plaque commemorates this event. Subsequently German prisoners of war were billeted here for employment in the locality between 1945 and 1947.Nottingham Evening Post, Wednesday 3 September 2003 Other buildings In addition to Wollaton Hall the park hosts the following historic buildings: =Lenton Lodge= Lenton Lodge on Derby Road Lenton Lodge is one of the Gatehouses built around the boundary of Wollaton Park. It was commissioned by Henry Willoughby, 6th Baron Middleton. It was designed by the architect Jeffry Wyatville and completed in 1825.Listed Buildings Online – LBS Number 457103 It is built in the Elizabethan Revival style. With the sale of part of the park for residential building, Lenton Lodge is now separated from the rest of the park, and stands isolated but prominent on Derby Road in Lenton. It was sold by Nottingham City Council in the early 1980s . A 99-year revolving lease was acquired by Moiz Saigara in 1996. Planning permission to convert Lenton Lodge to a single dwelling was obtained and major restoration work was undertaken by Moiz Saigara, using Julian Owen Associates as the architect. The main part of this work -apart from restoration and installation of services – was filling in the middle archway in such a way as to be able to connect the two wings without detracting from the appearance which identifies the building as a gatehouse. The Lodge was used by Moiz Saigara as his residence from 1996 to 2006, when the lease was sold to Chek Whyte. In 2006-8 Lenton Lodge was restored by Chek Whyte Industries and sold as a office in 2009. It was occupied by Global Fire and Security for six years, and sold to the University of Nottingham in 2016. =Beeston Lodge= Beeston Lodge on Derby Road It was designed by the architect Jeffry Wyatville around 1832. It is built of coursed Gritstone ashlar in a heavy Gothic style with \\"martello-type\\" round outer towers with battlements. The square central gatehouse is connected to the towers at the second floor level. It has an arched carriage entrance with an oriel window above. It was built following the Nottingham Reform riots in October 1831,\\"Comfort and Security\\" The Regency Great House, Malcolm Airs.

Each night there is a large corvid roost at the park, made up of rook, jackdaw, and carrion crow. Other bird species present at the site include jay, nuthatch and sparrowhawk. Migrating wildfowl grace the lake in the winter and species of note include gadwall, shoveler, wigeon and tufted duck. There is a good diversity of fungi present, especially in the winter months, mainly found near the wooded areas and the lake. Northern pike have been spotted swimming in the lake.

It was intended as a communist-controlled center of authority, challenging organs of the legitimate and mainstream Polish Underground State. The existence of the KRN was later accepted by the Soviet Union and the council became to a large extent subjugated and controlled by the Soviets. The KRN was established on the night of 31 December 1943 on the initiative of the Polish communist party, the Polish Workers' Party (PPR), then led by Władysław Gomułka. It was the implementation of the party's Central Committee decision of 7 November 1943. The council was declared to be the \\"actual political representation of the Polish nation, empowered to act on behalf of the nation and manage its affairs until the time of Poland's liberation from the occupation\\". From the beginning, the KRN viewed the prewar Sanation government and the contemporary Polish government in exile as illegitimate, based on the \\"elitist-totalitarian\\" April Constitution, \\"whose legality had never been recognized by the nation\\", and as representative of narrow reactionary interests. The new government formation would be based on the \\"worker-peasant alliance\\" and on the alliance with the Soviet Union. The Armia Ludowa was established as the KRN's armed force. The exile government and the Polish Underground State, especially the Armia Krajowa command, were worried by this development and by the progressing social radicalization in Poland by Soviet strings. They accelerated the formation of the already planned Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), their own parliament, created on 9 January 1944. Bolesław Bierut, a Stalinist and Gomułka's rival, chaired the formal legislative body The Soviet regime under Stalin, initially unaware of the establishment of the KRN because of the non-existent at that time communications, became critical of it until, according to the evolving international situation, the Soviets developed new ideas in respect to Poland and found the KRN to be a potentially convenient entity. A KRN delegation went to Moscow for talks with Stalin on 22 May 1944 and the body's existence was upheld. The KRN was installed and dominated by pro-Soviet and pro-communist activists from various Polish far- left prewar parties. Attempts to broaden the KRN's base by absorbing other leftist and popular groups were unsuccessful. The left-wing of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) had also in mind a future People's Republic of Poland, but of a different variety than the communists and Soviets. The KRN included some members of the PPS, the Polish People's Party (PSL), the People's Party (SL), the Democratic Party (SD), the Labour Party (SP), non-aligned and Jewish politicians. Bolesław Bierut of the PPR became the KRN's chairman. Bierut was opposed to Gomułka's efforts to broaden the KRN's participation and a sharp conflict between the two ensued. Bierut believed in future communist rule based on the presence of the Soviet Red Army in Poland and did not want to dilute the PPR's identity and influence by the inclusion of too many other forces. The KRN's vice-chairmen were Wincenty Witos (PSL), Stanisław Grabski (nonaligned) and Stanisław Szwalbe (PPS). Edward Osóbka-Morawski, a socialist, was co-opted as the KRN's vice-chairman On 22 July 1944, the KRN delegation and the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP), having deliberated in Moscow, took it upon themselves to form a new governmental structure, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN), which was officially established in the Lublin province. PKWN gave rise to communist- dominated governments, which later included some former members of the Polish- government-in-exile, led by Stanisław Mikołajczyk, and represented a half- hearted attempt by the communists to meet the Yalta Conference requirements of forming a coalition government and carrying out free elections. On 31 December of that year, the KRN transformed the PKWN into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (Rząd Tymczasowy Republiki Polskiej, RTRP). Both early governments were headed by the socialist Edward Osóbka-Morawski. Until the elections to parliament (Sejm), the KRN held both legislative and executive powers, and Bolesław Bierut was the head of state. In July 1945, the KRN had 273 members (97 from PPR, 77 from PPS, 56 from SL, 17 from SD, 26 non- aligned). In October 1946 it was expanded to 444 members (135 from PPR, 111 from PPS, 62 from SL, 57 from PSL, 37 from SD, 4 from SP, 3 Jewish representatives (1 each from the Bund, Communists and Zionists), 26 non- aligned). The 1947 Polish legislative elections were rigged by the communists, who previously conducted the illegitimate Polish people's referendum of 1946. The unchallenged rule of the communists that followed, combined with extensive repressions and persecution, forced many opposition leaders to leave the country. The new Sejm, which replaced the KRN, was totally dominated by the communists and their allies until the collapse of communism in Poland in 1989.

Plot The film tells the true story of Justin Yoder (played by Muniz), a young boy born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Justin uses a wheelchair. He lives with his overprotective parents and brother, Seth (Patrick Levis), who is a successful high school athlete. Due to his disability, Justin is unable to play any sports, something he is determined to do, much to the scepticism of his brother. For guidance, he turns to God, who takes form of famous race car driver Bobby Wade (Tuc Watkins). Justin attempts to try out for summer league baseball, but is turned down by the head coach due to his disability. Unrelenting, he continues on his sports journey and soon picks up chess. After only some time practicing and immediately promising his brother he's going to win a trophy, he enter a tournament where due to being wheelchair bound, he is incorrectly placed in a younger bracket. Justin considers it an advantage going up against younger kids but is quickly defeated in his first match. After leaving the tournament in disappointment, he finds himself at a car show where he spots his neighbor, Vic (Roger Aaron Brown), and his vintage red Corvette. Justin notices a trophy to be awarded for best car and asks if Vic has a chance of winning it. He is told that it is unlikely, not because of the car as the contest holders consider it probably the best car there, but because the winner will be the one who collects the most money, something that will be hard for Vic due to his off-putting demeanor and personality. Justin gets an idea and offers to help Vic collect in exchange for the trophy if he wins. Vic initially refuses but realizes it's his best chance at winning and agrees to do it. Vic wins the contest and after gives Justin a ride home. A couple of days later, Vic drives by and asks Seth if Justin is home to which he's told no. He considers giving a box to Seth but ultimately decides against it and drives off. Seconds after Vic leaves, Justin and his mom pull up and Justin recognizing Vic's truck, asks Seth if he had a box with him. Seth says yes and Justin immediately takes off for Vic's house, ignoring his brother's pleas to help him with the groceries. Justin pulls up outside the house and calls out Vic's name, but gets no response. Determined to get his trophy, he wheels into the back of the house looking for Vic where he finds the Corvette stored in a garage. Inside the garage he spots a box high up on a shelf and assumes that it's his trophy. Unwilling to wait any longer to get it, he attempts to knock the box down, but instead inadvertently knocks down the shelf which lands on the car, damaging it, and causing it to roll down the driveway into some trash cans, damaging it further. Forced to make up for what he did, Justin is sent to help Vic clean up the mess he made. As Vic gets to know Justin, he starts taking a liking to him and starts being friendlier, even offering Justin some milk and cookies. After finishing up the garage, Justin asks Vic if he wants him to help him with the shed too, an offer he quickly turns down, telling Justin to stay away from the shed. One day, while helping Vic around the yard, Vic leaves Justin while he runs some errands. With him gone, Justin peeks into the shed through a window and notices multiple trophies inside. He goes inside and discovers even more awards along with a soapbox racer. He starts up an old film and sees on the screen a young girl racing soapbox racers. As he watches on with interest, the door behind him opens and Vic storms in, demanding that Justin leave. Justin hopes to participate in that sport and eventually finds a love and talent for it. To accommodate his disability, his father and their neighbor, Vic, build a customized racer with a hand brake (which they call the \\"Justin Brake\\"). Meanwhile, Seth feels that his parents focus too much on Justin rather than giving both equal treatment. However, he has a change of heart when Justin crashes during a race. The Yoders are confronted with the idea that Justin's involvement with the sport may be hazardous to his health. At the end of the film, he asks God if people are perfect when they go to Heaven. In response, he shows him a vision of it where there are people with and without wheelchairs, all together, to which he happily replies \\"perfect\\". As a tribute to Justin, live footage of him is shown before the closing credits.

Symptoms, which include itchy, raised papules, commonly occur within 1–2 days of infection and do not generally last more than 2–3 weeks. However, people repeatedly exposed to cercariae develop heavier symptoms with faster onset. Cercarial dermatitis is common in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats worldwide. Incidence may be on the rise, although this may also be attributed to better monitoring. Nevertheless, the condition has been regarded as emerging infectious disease. There are no permanent effects to people from this condition. Orally administered hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions. In addition, bathing in oatmeal, baking soda, or Epsom salts can also provide relief of symptoms.In CDC. \\"Swimmers Itch FAQS.\\" retrieved May 12, 2014  Cause  Swimmer's itch probably has been around as long as humans. The condition was known to exist as early as the 1800s, but it was not until 1928 that a biologist found that the dermatitis was caused by the larval stage of a group of flatworm parasites in the family Schistosomatidae. The genera most commonly associated with swimmer's itch in humans are Trichobilharzia and Gigantobilharzia. It can also be caused by schistosome parasites of non-avian vertebrates, such as Schistosomatium douthitti, which infects snails and rodents. Other taxa reported to cause the reaction include Bilharziella polonica and Schistosoma bovis. In marine habitats, especially along the coasts, swimmer's itch can occur as well. These parasites use both freshwater snails and vertebrates as hosts in their parasitic life cycles as follows: # Once a schistosome egg is immersed in water, a short-lived, non-feeding, free-living stage known as the miracidium emerges. The miracidium uses cilia to follow chemical and physical cues thought to increase its chances of finding the first intermediate host in its life cycle, a freshwater snail. # After infecting a snail, it develops into a mother sporocyst, which in turn undergoes asexual reproduction, yielding large numbers of daughter sporocysts, which asexually produce another short-lived, free-living stage, the cercaria. # Cercariae use a tail-like appendage (often forked in genera causing swimmer's itch) to swim to the surface of the water; and use various physical and chemical cues in order to locate the next and final (definitive) host in the life cycle, a bird. These larvae can accidentally come into contact with the skin of a swimmer. The cercaria penetrates the skin and dies in the skin immediately. The cercariae cannot infect humans, but they cause an inflammatory immune reaction. This reaction causes initially mildly itchy spots on the skin. Within hours, these spots become raised papules which are intensely itchy. Each papule corresponds to the penetration site of a single parasite.Life-cycle of swimmers itch # After locating a bird, the parasite penetrates through the skin (usually the feet), dropping the forked tail in the process. Inside the circulatory system, the immature worms (schistosomula) develop into mature male and female worms, mate and migrate through the host's circulatory system (or nervous system in case of T. regenti) to the final location (veins feeding the gastrointestinal tract) within the host body. There they lay eggs in the small veins in the intestinal mucosa from which they make their way into the lumen of the gut, and are dumped into the water when the bird defecates. One European species, Trichobilharzia regenti, instead infects the bird host's nasal tissues and larvae hatch from the eggs directly in the tissue during drinking/feeding of the infected birds. Risk factors Image of infectious cercariae Humans usually become infected after swimming in lakes or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely in the morning and on sunny days, and exposure to water in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe and North America, and shallow inshore waters may harbour higher densities of cercariae than open waters offshore. Onshore winds are thought to cause cercariae to accumulate along shorelines. Studies of infested lakes and outbreaks in Europe and North America have found cases where infection risk appears to be evenly distributed around the margins of water bodies as well as instances where risk increases in endemic swimmer's itch \\"hotspots\\". Children may become infected more frequently and more intensely than adults but this probably reflects their tendency to swim for longer periods inshore, where cercariae also concentrate. Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host skin include unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in sun lotions and creams based on plant oils. Control Mechanical removal of snails in Lake Annecy, France Various strategies targeting the mollusc and avian hosts of schistosomes, have been used by lakeside residents in recreational areas of North America to deal with outbreaks of swimmer's itch. In Michigan, for decades, authorities used copper sulfate as a molluscicide to reduce snail host populations and thereby the incidence of swimmer's itch. The results with this agent have been inconclusive, possibly because: * Snails become tolerant * Local water chemistry reduces the molluscicide's efficacy * Local currents diffuse it * Adjacent snail populations repopulate a treated area More importantly, perhaps, copper sulfate is toxic to more than just molluscs, and the effects of its use on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood. Another method targeting the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried in some areas of North America and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering praziquantel to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans. Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common insect repellent DEET prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice. Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.

He served in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the campaign against the Kohat Pass Afridis, the suppression of the Santhal rebellion, and the suppression of the Indian Mutiny. He became military member of the Viceroy's Council (in effect Minister for War in India) in 1870, in which role he maintained the policy of ensuring that the Indian Army were less well armed than British troops there to deter another mutiny. As a result, he became a member of the Council of India; and in his later years he became Governor of Jamaica and then Governor of Queensland. Early life John Lawrence, Viceroy of India and other council members. c. 1864 Born one of two sons (his brother was Francis Booth Norman) of James Norman, a merchant who had conducted most of his business in Cuba before moving to Calcutta, and his wife Charlotte Norman (née Wylie), Norman joined the family firm in Calcutta in 1842 and then set about persuading his father to let him join the Bengal Army.Heathcote, p.230 Military career Having obtained a cadetship in the Bengal Native Infantry, Norman was then commissioned as an ensign in the 1st Bengal Native Infantry on 1 March 1844 and then transferred to the 31st Bengal Native Infantry in March 1845. He was posted to Lahore in 1846 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 25 December 1847, took part in the Battle of Ramnagar in November 1848, the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Having attracted the favourable notice of Sir Colin Campbell, Norman was selected by Campbell to accompany an expedition against the Kohat Pass Afridis in 1850 as officiating brigade- major. The subaltern of twenty-four was given a substantive appointment in this capacity for a splendid deed of gallantry, which is recorded by Sir Charles Napier in the following terms: \\"In the pass of Kohat a sepoy picket, descending a precipitous mountain under fire and the rolling of large stones, had some men killed and wounded. Four of the latter, dreadfully hurt, crept under some rocks for shelter. They were not missed until the picket reached the bottom, but were then discovered by our glasses, high up and helpless. Fortunately the enemy did not see them, and some sepoys volunteered a rescue, headed by Norman of the 31st Native Infantry and Ensign Murray of the 70th Native Infantry. These brave men would that the names of all were known to me for record ascended the rocks in defiance of the enemy, and brought the wounded men down.\\"Napier, p. 225 Norman served in numerous frontier expeditions between 1850 and 1854 and in the suppression of the Santhal rebellion of 1855 to 1856 before becoming assistant adjutant general in India in May 1856. During the Indian Mutiny he was constantly engaged, being present at the Siege of Delhi in Summer 1857, the Siege of Lucknow in November 1857, the Second Battle of Cawnpore in December 1857 and the Capture of Lucknow in March 1858. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 17 August 1859. Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1903. Promoted to captain on 1 March 1859, Norman became assistant military secretary for Indian affairs at the Horse Guards in October 1860. He was further promoted to brevet major on 3 December 1860 and to brevet lieutenant colonel on 4 December 1860.Heathcote, p. 231 He went back to India in 1861 as deputy adjutant general of the Bengal Army and then became military secretary to the government of India in January 1862. He was appointed an aide-de-camp to the Queen in September 1863 and, having been promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 March 1864, to brevet colonel on 8 September 1868 and to brevet major-general on 23 March 1869, he was given the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 March 1870. Norman went on to become military member of the Governor-General's Council (in effect Minister for War in India) in May 1870, in which role he maintained the policy of ensuring that the Indian Army were less well armed than British troops there to deter another mutiny. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 24 May 1873, promoted to lieutenant general on 1 October 1877 and returned to London to become a member of the Council of India in February 1878. He was promoted to full general on 1 April 1882 and retired from active military service. Later life In October 1883 Norman became Governor of Jamaica and implemented the decision of the Colonial Office to introduce a new constitution intended to limit the ability of the local assembly, which was dominated by white plantation owners, to make all decisions.Heathcote, p. 232 Appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 24 May 1887 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887, he was transferred to the post of Governor of Queensland in 1889: although his mandate was to cut public expenditure, he managed to get on well with both the local politicians and the local people who were impressed by his administrative skills. Declining the post of Viceroy of India in September 1893, Norman left Queensland in November 1895 and returned to London. He was appointed a Commissioner to enquire into the conditions and prospects of the West India Sugar-growing Colonies in December 1896. Norman became governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in April 1901, and, having been promoted to field marshal on 26 June 1902, became a Commissioner to inquire into the military preparations for the Second Boer War in September 1902. He died at the Royal Hospital Chelsea on 26 October 1904 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.

In the center of the tower is a large columnar pipe system. Threaded through the main pipe column is a cable that is attached to a piston on one end, looped over a pulley at the top of the tower and attached to the seat carriage on the other. In the loading position, the seat carriage is at the base of the tower and the piston is at the top of the pipe column. Once the ride has been loaded, the seats are lifted slightly off the ground and loaded seats are weighed in order to calculate the amount of air pressure needed to safely propel the seats up the tower. Upon charging the air system to the correct pressure, compressed air is injected into the central column pushing the piston rapidly downward. As the piston moves down, it pulls the cable downward over the pulley at the top, propelling the seat carriage up the outside of the tower. Upon exhausting the air from the pressure system, the carriage descends, drawing the piston back up the pipe column. As the piston moves up, the air inside the pipe column alternately compresses and expands, causing the carriage to bounce several times. With each bounce, a pressure relief valve at the top of the pipe column releases some of the compressed air making each successive bounce smaller until the carriage reaches the loading platform.

It has about one thousand students of ages eleven to eighteen, and specialist-school status as a Music College. The school has long been associated with the advancement of women's education. History Founded in 1871 by the suffragist Frances Mary Buss, who also founded North London Collegiate School, the Camden School for Girls was one of the first girls' schools in England. Although not a fee-paying school by then, girls in the mid-20th century wore a traditional uniform of dark green, with blue and green striped ties. The blazer badge showed a type of ancient sailing ship called a \\"buss\\" to commemorate the founder's surname, with the motto 'Onwards and Upwards'. Although no entry exams were held, in its pre-comprehensive era, entrance was by interview. One of its most formative headmistresses, Doris Burchell, took on the school in the post war years and developed its renowned strengths in both science and music, overseeing a massive amount of new building on the site. The Sir John Cockcroft science wing was built from funds raised by many means, including a series of Celebrity Concerts held at the school and involving many eminent musicians. A grammar school for much of the 20th century, it became comprehensive in 1976, although only year by year. It was not fully comprehensive until 1981. The school was damaged in the war but rebuilt in 1957, the architect being John Eastwick-Field OBE. In 1973 the assembly hall roof collapsed following deterioration of its roof beams due to problems with the high-alumina cement concrete used. Academic performance A 1999 Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) report called it \\"a unique and very effective school in many ways.\\" Another, written in March 2005, said it was an \\"outstanding school with excellent features,\\" and the most recent report said that it \\"rightly deserves the outstanding reputation it has among parents and in the community.\\" Its GCSE results are excellent, and its A-level results are the best in the Camden LEA outside the private sector.

It consists of 103 buildings with townhouse style units ranging from one bedroom to five bedrooms. The complex is owned and managed by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA). The complex is bounded by Grape Street to the west, 97th Street to the north, Alameda Street to the east, and 103rd Street to the south. This large area had been used as a truck farm for years and during the second World War it supplied vegetables for the surrounding communities of Watts, South Gate and Lynwood. History First opened in May 1944, the complex was originally developed as semi-permanent housing for war workers during World War II. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In the early 1950s, HACLA converted it to public housing; it was among the last of the public housing projects in Watts to be opened for that purpose. It opened in 1955, shortly after new mayor Norris Poulson ended all new public housing in the city. The development, like others in the area, began partially integrated; however, its tenancy rapidly became majority black, approaching 100% by the mid-1960s. This rapid change occurred for a number of reasons. Many of the veterans who still lived in the projects in the early 1950s moved out as they were able to purchase homes. Blacks, still migrating west after the war ended, gravitated toward areas like Watts that already had sizeable black populations. In addition, at least in the first decade of the post-war period, restrictive covenants helped channel recent migrants into Watts and away from nearby suburban cities such as Compton. =1960s to 1980s= Across the next four decades, Jordan Downs and the other project houses came to be seen as microcosms of the ills of society: either of the dependency of individuals on the welfare state, as conservatives argued, or of institutional racism, lack of access to education and jobs, and the cycle of poverty, as liberals argued. The rapid decrease in manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles depressed the area; at the same time, the concentration of impoverished citizens, combined with a pervasive sense of disenfranchisement and official indifference or hostility, made the housing projects likely breeding-grounds for crime. Jordan Downs was one of the flashpoints of the 1965 Watts riots. Like the other housing projects, Jordan Downs benefited relatively little from the influx of federal money and attention that followed the riots. In the seventies and eighties, despair about the post-war model of public housing and declining federal spending in this area served to further dilapidate this and the other area projects. By the mid-1980s, Jordan Downs was probably most famous among the general public as one of the homes to the newly prominent street gangs: in this case, the Crip gang named after Grape Street. In 1989, claiming that HACLA had failed to improve quality of life at the project, executive director Leila Gonzalez-Correa announced plans to sell the project to a private developer at market value. The plan was intended to provide a fresh influx of money while preserving the land as low-income housing. The plan was eventually cancelled in the face of opposition from residents and the Los Angeles City Council; potential buyers also noted that the security and insurance risks associated with the project would be likely to make Jordan Downs an unprofitable investment. The controversy contributed to Gonzalez-Correa's departure from the housing authority at the end of 1989. =1990s and today= In the early 1990s, Jordan Downs witnessed the same social changes that marked the city as a whole. The changing demographics of Watts were reflected in tenancy at the project, as Latin American tenants began to make inroads into the long-sizeable black majority at the facility. This transformation, though generally peaceful, was accompanied by occasional tension. The Grape Street Crips wore purple bandanas in their left pocket. They were key players in both the Watts truce that preceded the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the more general truce agreed to in the wake of the riots. As a result, Jordan Downs was comparatively peaceful for the balance of the 1990s. The resurgence of gang violence in the new century, combined with steep cutbacks in police patrols, has led to a steady increase in gang violence but has decreased rapidly in the late 2000s due to numerous police raids. Redevelopment Project  Jordan Downs is currently under construction in completely transforming the projects into a modern urban village with new apartment complexes, new restaurants, retail stores and parks. =Media= The complex is featured in the movie Menace II Society.

The ancient cities of Canopus, Heracleion and Menouthis lie submerged beneath the waters of the bay. In 1798 it was the site of the Battle of the Nile, a naval battle fought between the British Royal Navy and the Navy of the French First Republic. The bay contains a natural gas field, discovered in the 1970s. Geography Abu Qir Bay lies approximately east of Alexandria, bounded to the southwest by the Abu Qir headland, on which lies the town of Abu Qir, and to the northeast by the Rosetta mouth of the Nile. The bay is a highly fertile Egyptian coastal region but suffers from acute eutrophication and pollution from untreated industrial and domestic waste. The ABU QIR Fertilizers and Chemicals Industries Company, a large producer of nitrogen fertilizer, is located on the bay.  Antiquities  Map of Nile Delta showing ancient Canopus, Heracleion, and Menouthis In ancient times Abu Qir Bay was surrounded by marshland and contained several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, port cities were established on the bay. The bay now contains the underwater archaeological sites of three cities from the pre-Hellenistic, Hellenistic and Roman periods. The Eastern part of ancient city of Canopus is submerged in the bay, along with the remains of Menouthis and its sister-city Herakleion–Thonis which now lies 7 kilometres offshore. They were excavated by French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio. In July 2019, a smaller Greek temple and ancient granite columns, treasure-laden ships, along with bronze coins from the reign of Ptolemy II, pottery dating back to the third and fourth centuries BC were found at the sunken city of Heracleion, known as Egypt's Atlantis. The investigations were conducted by Egyptian and European divers led by the underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio. They also uncovered an absolutely devastated historic underwater temple (city's main temple) off Egypt's north coast. A number of sunken ships have been excavated from the bay, including a ceremonial boat (Neshmet boat) dedicated to Osiris and several Roman era ships. Classical sources indicate that the Canopic branch of the Nile delta once entered the sea in the vicinity of Heracleion or Eastern Canopus. A combination of Islamic texts and investigation using geoarchaeology suggest that this branch was still in existence in the eighth century, when a major inundation caused Eastern Canopus to sink into the bay. The Canopic branch subsequently declined and eventually became closed. Battle of the Nile British ships attacking French ships at Abukir On August 1, 1798, Horatio Nelson fought the naval \\"Battle of the Nile\\", often referred to as the \\"Battle of Aboukir Bay\\". (Not to be confused with the Battle of Abukir (1799) and the Battle of Abukir (1801).) On 1 March 1801, some 70 British warships, together with transports carrying 16,000 troops, anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria. The intent was to defeat the French expeditionary force that had remained in Egypt after Napoleon's return to France. Bad weather delayed disembarkation by a week but, on 8 March, Captain Alexander Cochrane of HMS Ajax deployed 320 boats, in double line abreast, to bring the troops ashore. French shore batteries opposed the landing, but the British were able to drive them back and, by the next day, all of Sir Ralph Abercromby's British army was ashore. The British then defeated the French army at the Battle of Alexandria. The Siege of Alexandria followed, with the city falling on 2 September 1801. L’Orient, Napoleon's flagship, was destroyed by Nelson's fleet and lies in the bay on the sea bottom. It was carrying five million francs in gold and one million in silver plate taken from the Knights Hospitaller in Malta. Between 1998 and 1999, French archaeologist Franck Goddio led an expedition that carried out an underwater archaeological study of the wreck-site. Nelson's Island Nelson's Island, also known as Aboukir Island, is a -long island in Abu Qir bay that is used for picnics and recreation. The island has been reduced considerably in size since antiquity as a result of erosion and sandstone quarrying. When it was a part of Ancient Egypt it was probably connected to the mainland at what is now the Aboukir naval base. In Pharaonic times the island lay on a primary commercial route to the Nile River and became a major religious and commercial centre. There is archaeological evidence that a high-status necropolis was sited on the island. During the Ptolemaic Kingdom the island was fortified. Following the Battle of the Nile in 1798, a number of British dead were buried on the island. Their graves were discovered in 2000. As they were in danger of sea erosion, thirty bodies were reburied at Chatby Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Alexandria in 2005.

Life Polydouri was born in Kalamata. She was the daughter of the philologist Eugene Polydouris and Kyriaki Markatou, a woman with early feminist beliefs. She completed her high school studies in Kalamata, and had also gone to school in Gytheio and Filiatra, as well as in Arsakeio in Athens for two years. She was a contemporary of Kostas Karyotakis, with whom she had a desperate but incomplete love affair. Although she wrote poetry from an early age, her most important poems were written during the last four years of her life, when, suffering from tuberculosis, she was secluded in an Athens Sanatorium, where she died in 1930. She first appeared in the Literary world at age 14 with the prose poem “The Pain of the Mother”, which refers to the death of a sailor who was washed up on the shores of Filiatra and is influenced by the lamentations heard in Mani Peninsula. At sixteen, she was appointed to the Prefecture of Messenia and also expressed keen interest in The woman question. In 1920, during the time period of forty days, both her parents died. In 1921, she was transferred to the Prefecture of Athens while enrolled at the Law School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Kostas Karyotakis, a fellow poet of the time, was working at the same service sector. After their encounter, a fierce love developed, which did not last long but decisively influenced her life and work. They first met in January 1922. Polydouri was then 20 years old, while Karyotakis was 26. She had published some juvenilia poems while he had published two poetry collections – \\"The pain of Men and things\\" (1919) and \\"Nepenthe\\" (1921) – and had already won the respect of some critics and fellow-craftsmen. In the summer of 1922, Karyotakis discovered that he suffered from syphilis, a disease that was incurable and bore social stigma. He immediately informed Polydouri about this and asked her to end their relationship. She proposed to marry without having children, but he was too proud to accept the sacrifice. Maria doubted his sincerity and felt that his illness was a pretext to leave her. In 1924, she met Aristotelis Georgiou, a lawyer who had just returned from Paris. Polydouri got engaged to him in early 1925. Despite the dedication to her fiancé, Polydouri could not concentrate seriously in any activity. She lost her job in the public sector after repeated absences and dropped out of Law School. She studied at the Kounallaki Drama School and even managed to appear as an actress in a play, \\"The Little Rag\\", for which she had the lead role. In the summer of 1926, she broke off her engagement and left for Paris. She studied dressmaking but could not work because she contracted tuberculosis. She returned to Athens in 1928 and was hospitalized at Sotiria Hospital, where she learned about the suicide of her former lover, Kostas Karyotakis. In the same year, she released her first poetry collection \\"The Chirps that faint\\" and in 1929 the second, \\"Echo over chaos\\". Polydouri left two prose works, her diary and an untitled novel in which she attacked the conservatism and hypocrisy of the time. She died of tuberculosis on the morning of 29 April 1930, after a series of morphine injections that were given to her by a friend in Christomanos Clinic. Work Maria Polydouri belongs to the generation of 1920, which fostered the feeling of dissatisfaction and decline. Love and death are the two axes around which her poetry revolves. Her poetry is a concise source of lyricism that breaks in deep sorrow and sometimes grief, with obvious influences from the love of her life, Kostas Karyotakis, but also laments from Mani. Polydouri's affective and emotional exacerbations often cover some technical weaknesses and songwriting amenities. Critic and poet Kostas Stergiopoulos wrote: \\"Maria Polydouri used to write her poems as if she was writing her personal diary. The transmutation happened automatically and effortlessly. To Polydouri, expression meant straight transcribing from the events occurring in her emotional world to the poetic language with all the idealizations and exaggerations her romantic nature dictated to her\\". The first article about Maria Polydouri based on her archives and diary belongs to Vasiliki Bobou-Stamati and is published in Elliniki Dimiourgia (1954), p. 617-624. The Collected Works of Maria Polydouri released for the first time in the 1960s by Estia Press, curated by Lili Zografou. Since then they have been republished by various publishers. The writer and poet Kostis Gimossoulis has written a fictional biography titled \\"Raining light\\". Her poems have been set to music by Greek composers, classical artists and rock – including Menelaos Palladio, Kostis Kritsotakis, Nikos Mamangakis, Yiannis Spanos, Notis Mavroudis, George Arkomanis, Dimitris Papadimitriou, Michalis Koumbios, Stelios Botonakis and band \\"Plinthetes\\" and \\" Iliodromio \\"and the composer Nikos Fylaktos with voice and piano. In 2009, she was portrayed by Maria Kitsiou in the Greek TV series Karyotakis (TV series), aired by ERT1.

During Mu'awiya's governorship of Syria (639–661), Abd al-Rahman commanded a number of campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and defended the Upper Mesopotamian frontier from the Iraq- based forces of Caliph Ali (). He fought reputably against the latter at the Battle of Siffin in 657 and continued his governorship of Homs and campaigns against the Byzantines after Mu'awiya became caliph in 661. His battlefield reputation and descent from his father, the prominent general Khalid ibn al- Walid, made him particularly popular among the Arabs of Syria. Mu'awiya ultimately perceived him as a potential rival of his own son Yazid, who he was grooming as his successor, which led the caliph to allegedly order Abd al- Rahman's poisoning in 666.  Life  Abd al-Rahman was born in , the son of the prominent Muslim general and member of the Qurayshi clan of Banu Makhzum, Khalid ibn al-Walid. Abd al-Rahman's mother was Khalid's wife Asma, the daughter of Anas ibn Mudrik, a prominent chieftain and poet of the Khath'am tribe who was active during the pre-Islamic period and died several years after the advent of Islam in the 620s. Abd al-Rahman likely entered military service during the caliphate of Uthman (). During Uthman's reign, he was appointed the governor of Jund Hims (military district of Homs) by Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, the overall governor of the province of Syria. Abd al-Rahman was dispatched by Mu'awiya to command a number of military campaigns against the Byzantines in Anatolia and was referred to in the Greek sources \\"Abderachman\\". He fended off a raid against Mu'awiya's territory in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) by the Iraqi forces of Caliph Ali () in 657. Later that year, Abd al-Rahman served as a commander in the Syrian army of Mu'awiya against Ali at the Battle of Siffin, where he fought with distinction and held the banner of the Syrians. His brother Muhajir fought for Ali's side in the same battle and was killed. During the subsequent arbitration talks in Adhruh or Dumat al-Jandal in 658 or 659 between the representatives of Ali and Mu'awiya, Abd al-Rahman was among those in the latter's faction to witness the arbitration document. Abd al-Rahman continued as governor of Jund Hims during the caliphate of Mu'awiya beginning in 661. In 664/665 and 665/666, he led the winter campaigns against the Byzantines along the Anatolian front. According to the Muslim traditional sources, Abd al-Rahman posed a threat to Mu'awiya's ambitions to appoint his own Yazid as his successor and the caliph resolved to eliminate him. At the time, he was the last surviving son of Khalid ibn al- Walid, his descent from the reputable general and his own valor and effectiveness fighting the Byzantines had endeared him to the Syrian Arabs. To that end, he had his Christian physician Ibn Uthal poison Abd al-Rahman upon the latter's return to Homs from the Byzantine front in 666. The physician was later killed by a kinsman of Abd al-Rahman called Khalid, who was either his own son or the son of his brother Muhajir. This Khalid was consequently imprisoned and fined Ibn Uthal's blood money by Mu'awiya to protect him from potential retaliation. Relations between the influential Banu Makhzum, who were mostly concentrated in the Hejaz (western Arabia), and Mu'awiya deteriorated as a result of Abd al-Rahman's alleged poisoning. The Orientalist historian Henri Lammens doubts the reliability of this narrative, which he relates to the anti-Christian violence in Homs around that time. The line of Khalid ibn al-Walid died out with the deaths of Abd al-Rahman's roughly forty male descendants as a result of a plague in Syria toward the end of the Umayyad period (661–750). Abd al-Rahman is buried alongside his father and one of his father's wives, Fadda, in Homs. In 1908, the Ottoman rulers of Syria built the Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque around the site claimed since at least the 12th century to contain their graves.

His film credits included The Sword and the Sorcerer, Invasion USA, The Seven-Ups, Scarecrow, Little Nikita, Bad Dreams, God Told Me To, and Halloween. He appeared in science fiction productions, including Battlestar Galactica (as Wolfe) and its sequel series Galactica 1980 (as Commander Xaviar). He also appeared in such shows as Starsky and Hutch, Baretta, T. J. Hooker, Blue Thunder, Airwolf, The A-Team, Charmed and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Early life and career Richard Hugh Lynch was born on February 12, 1940 (sometimes incorrectly cited as 1936) in Brooklyn, New York City to Catholic parents of Irish descent. His younger brother is actor Barry Lynch. Lynch served in the United States Marine Corps for four years. Lynch's distinct scarred appearance made him a popular nemesis, and he can be seen in more than 100 film and television performances. The scars came from a 1967 incident in New York's Central Park in which, under the influence of drugs, he set himself on fire, burning more than 70% of his body. He spent a year in recovery, gave up drug use and ultimately began training at The Actors Studio and at the HB Studio. In 1970, he co-starred with Robert De Niro, Sally Kirkland and Diane Ladd in the short-lived off- Broadway play One Night Stands of a Noisy Passenger, written by Shelley Winters. He often played a villain in features, including Scarecrow, which marked his film debut, The Seven-Ups, Bad Dreams, The Sword and the Sorcerer, and Little Nikita. In 1982, Lynch won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the evil King Cromwell in The Sword and the Sorcerer. Although Richard Lynch is best known for playing villains, he was cast as the president of the United States in the 2007 film Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy. Lynch starred alongside Judson Scott in the 1982 short-lived science fiction TV series The Phoenix. In addition to acting, Lynch was a musician, and he played the saxophone, guitar, piano, and flute. He held Irish citizenship through his Irish-born parents and was a frequent visitor to Ireland. He starred together with brother Barry in the films Nightforce and Total Force. Lynch's wife Lily starred with him in the film Breaking the Silence (1998) and son Christopher Lynch appeared with him in the science fiction film Trancers II. In 1977, Richard Lynch shared the stage with actor Al Pacino, a close friend, in the Broadway play The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel. Lynch played a Vietnam veteran who used a wheelchair, and was nominated for a Tony in 1977. Through the years, Lynch worked with friend and colleague Don Calfa in the films Necronomicon (1993), Toughguy (1995), Corpses Are Forever (2003), and Lewisburg (2009). Later life and death Lynch married twice — once to Béatrix Lynch (their son Christopher died in 2005 from pneumonia), and later to Lily Lynch. Lynch's body was found in his home in Yucca Valley, California on June 19, 2012. It is not known if Lynch died on June 18 or June 19. After not having heard from Lynch for several days, friend and actress Carol Vogel went to his home to find the door open and his body in his kitchen. He was survived by his brother Barry and two sisters, Carole Taylor and Cathy Jones. News reports following his death incorrectly identified his birth year as 1936, but the obituary in the Los Angeles Times published by his family correctly listed the year as 1940.

The software and systems comprising NINJAM provide a non-realtime mechanism for exchanging audio data across the internet, with a synchronisation mechanism based on musical form. It provides a way for musicians to \\"jam\\" (improvise) together over the Internet; it pioneered the concept of \\"virtual- time\\" jamming. It was originally developed by Brennan Underwood, Justin Frankel, and Tom Pepper. Principle Creating music naturally relies on players' ability to keep time with each other. Latency between players causes natural time keeping to be thrown awry. The internet does not provide a low- latency data exchange mechanism that can be used over global distances. In order to approach latency-free collaboration, NINJAM extends the latency, by delaying all received audio until it can be synchronised with other players. The delay is based on the musical form. This synchronisation means that each player hears the others in a session and can play along with them. NINJAM defines the form in terms of the \\"interval\\" - the number of beats to be recorded before synchronising with other players. For example, with an interval of 16, four bars of common time would be recorded from each player, then played back to all others. Reception The process was described in Wired as \\"glitch-free\\", and \\"designed for musicians who enjoy realtime collaboration.\\" In MIT Technology Review, the software's users are described as \\"really loyal\\" due to its free and open source status. Other music product vendors have added support for NINJAM; Expert Sleepers, a vendor of electronic music hardware and software, added plugin support for NINJAM in 2006. Technical background Each player in a NINJAM session feeds audio data from their client to a server via a TCP/IP connection to a specific port (commonly in the range 2049 upwards, depending on the host). The \\"client\\" here is only the component that the player uses to connect to a NINJAM server, encode and transmit their audio stream, receive and decode remote players' streams and handle the chat (IRC-like) session. Each player will also need some way of feeding audio information to the NINJAM client - either by using the client as a plugin in a DAW or by using the standalone version with a direct audio input. Each client's data is synchronised against a distributed clock. This clocking is then used to distribute the data out to all the other clients so that they can play all the remote streams in sync. The server does little apart from manage connections, chat and data streaming. Overview of usage =Clients and client setup considerations= Common considerations All clients feed data at 0 dB to the server, regardless of local monitoring levels. When setting up, the NINJAM client \\"local\\" level is set to 0 dB. \\"Local\\" does not affect transmitted volume. The slider labelled \\"local\\" only affects what the user hears locally, not what others hear. The user must adjust their input level - before the NINJAM client in the signal path - to affect what remote players are hearing. There is limited headroom in an audio channel, so it is considered good practice never to let audio level peak above 12 dB, and to set one's \\"loud\\" level at around 18 dB; this ensures space in the mix for others. REAPER-tied VST effect VST effects are a commonly used option (based on number of posts on the NINJAM support forums\\"NINJAM support forums\\". Cockos.com.) but requires that the user install REAPER. Open Source AU plugin Derived from the Open Source Standalone version, works on Mac AU hosts. Similar considerations to REAPER-tied VST effect above. Open Source standalone clients Standalone clients are available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. As the Linux version works with JACK, it can have audio routed to it from any JACK client. On Windows, use with virtual audio sources is problematic as there is no comparatively easy routing mechanism. Hence it is more suited to real instruments, where it provides a simpler alternative to the complexity of running a DAW just to access NINJAM. =Server and server set-up requirements= More detailed set-up and configuration is available on the NINJAM web site. Bandwidth According to Cockos, of bandwidth requirements, outbound bandwidth is the major requirement. A 4-person session will require approximately 768kbit/s of outbound and 240kbit/s of inbound bandwidth. An 8-person session will require approximately 3Mbit/s of outbound (and 600kbit/s inbound) bandwidth.

Turner South's programming consisted of a mix of movies, drama series, sitcoms, regional news updates, and unique original programming. It also carried telecasts of professional sporting events from the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball, Atlanta Hawks NBA, and Atlanta Thrashers NHL franchises, all of which were owned by the Turner Broadcasting System at the network's launch. Turner South's original programs could be broadly termed \\"southern lifestyle\\", including cooking and gardening shows. The sitcoms and dramas featured on the network (such as Major Dad and In the Heat of the Night) also tended to appeal to Southerners, or were set in the South. Other series included Liars & Legends and Off The Menu which was based out of the Commander's Palace restaurant in New Orleans. Beginning in 2002, the channel also aired a live simulcast of radio program The Rick and Bubba Show. =News Corporation lawsuit= News Corporation filed a lawsuit against Turner Broadcasting and its corporate parent Time Warner in a Georgia Superior Court on June 15, 1999, citing that the plans Turner had unveiled to carry sports events on Turner South violated a non-compete agreement that the two companies signed as part of News Corporation's $65 million purchase of SportSouth (now Fox Sports South) in 1996, which prohibited Turner from launching a regional sports network in the southeastern United States until 2008. The suit was settled out of court with undisclosed terms. =Sale to Fox= On February 23, 2006, Fox Cable Networks, a subsidiary of News Corporation, agreed to purchase Turner South, for a reported $375 million.Unstead, R.

The game revolves around a pair of ninja sent to assassinate a dictator in a futuristic version of New York City. A port was planned for the Game Boy, but was released in a rebranded form as Ninja Gaiden Shadow. Gameplay Gameplay of Shadow of the Ninja, with Kaede (left) and Hayate (right) In 2029, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the United States of America, building a stronghold in the middle of the nation's \\"largest city\\". To stop Garuda and avenge the innocent lives that were lost in his reign, two ninja masters from the Iga clan, Lord Hayate and Lady Kaede, are sent to infiltrate the dictator's well-guarded stronghold and kill him. Shadow of the Ninja is a side-scrolling platform game that can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with one player controlling Hayate (a ninja in purple) and the other as Kaede (a kunoichi in orange). In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character. The player can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summoning a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality. The player's default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally, but can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthened by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon's strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret power-ups hidden in some levels. The player can also obtain throwable shuriken and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long as the player's supply lasts before the player reverts to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions. Shadow of the Ninja consists of five levels with 16 stages, with the first four levels being divided into three stages and the final level into two. The player fights numerous types of enemy characters throughout each level, including bosses and sub-bosses. Once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are to it, since actually the same amount of health from one level will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared. Release American magazine GamePro ran a contest in 1991, awarding 10 readers with a free copy of the game; the magazine stated the 10 giveaway copies were an exclusive edition, which had a password feature not included in any of the retail versions.GamePro 18 (January 1991), p. 125. Shadow of the Ninja was re- released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in 2010, the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in 2015, and the Nintendo Switch via the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2020. Natsume began development of a Game Boy version following the NES release. However, the publishing rights of the game were picked up by Tecmo and the title was subsequently revised as a Ninja Gaiden 1991 spin-off Ninja Gaiden Shadow, which was also developed by the Nagoya division of Natsume. Reception Shadow of the Ninja was well received upon its release. The \\"Greatest Hits\\" special issue GamePro gave it a near-perfect score of 23/25 and called it \\"an above average ninja fare with top of the line graphics and fast-paced gameplay\\" and \\"a top flight, fast-paced action cart,\\" while Electronic Gaming Monthly in particular praised the game's \\"superb\\" graphics and sound.Electronic Gaming Monthly 21 (April 1991). Total! gave it a more reserved total rating of 74%, but added that \\"if this is the kind of game you're into, you won't find a better cartridge for your NES this side of Low G Man.\\" Nintendo Power featured it in the 1991 article \\"Weird Heroes\\" for supposedly featuring the \\"first male-and-female team\\" in video game history.Nintendo Power 18, page 90. Retrospectively, Hardcore Gaming 101's Kurt Kalata in 2006 called it \\"still an excellent game.\\" Matt Allen from Nintendo Life and Jeremy Parish from USgamer were more critical in their reviews of the Virtual Console release, awarding it six stars out of ten and three stars out five, respectively. Lucas M. Thomas from IGN rated the VC release 7.0/10, opining it is \\"not quite as smooth or memorable as Gaiden, and it'll frustrate you a few times as only an NES action game could -- but its unique qualities, like two-player co-op support, compensate well for any of its shortcomings.\\" See also *Return of the Ninja References External links * *Shadow of the Ninja at GameFAQs Category:1990 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Dystopian video games Category:Hack and slash games Category:Natsume (company) games Category:Video games about ninja Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games scored by Iku Mizutani Category:Video games set in the 2020s Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Virtual Console games for Nintendo 3DS Category:Taito games Category:Nintendo Switch Online NES games ","title":"Shadow of the Ninja"},{"id":"2196484","text":"In military strategy, the flypaper theory is the idea that it is desirable to draw enemies to a single area, where it is easier to kill them and they are far from one's own vulnerabilities.

But this is exactly where we want to fight them.... This will prevent the American people from having to go through their attacks back in the United States.

He became the oldest person at age to do a solo circumnavigation of the globe. He has successfully made eight solo circumnavigations. On October 16, 2004 Saitō left Japan on his yacht Shuten- dohji II (named after Shuten-dōji, a mythical demon who lived in the 10th century; it is also literally translated in English as \\"Drunkard's Child,\\" and sometimes jokingly westernized by other sailors as \\"Shoot Your Doggy\\") and returned 233 days later to complete his 7th circumnavigation, non-stop. He finished his 8th solo circumnavigation, this time the \\"wrong way around,\\" on September 17, 2011, after 1,080 days. He was 71 years old on completion.  Biography  Saitō was born in Asakusa, Tokyo. He has participated three times in the most prestigious and grueling race in the sailing world, the single- handed, around-the-globe competition originally called the BOC Challenge, then Around Alone, and renamed the Velux 5 Oceans Race which commenced in 2006. The races are run in legs, with stop-overs for rest and repair in several countries along the way. In his continuing career, Saitō has become the most experienced blue-water yachtsman from Japan with transoceanic voyages totaling more than — almost exactly the distance to the moon. He has started and finished eight solo circumnavigations of the Earth, the seventh one non-stop, achieving several international honors and world records. Saitō is quite well known among American, European and Australian sailing enthusiasts, and increasingly so in Japan as his international renown becomes better appreciated in his home country. In January, 2007, Saitō was named the recipient of the highly vaunted 2006 Blue Water Medal awarded to one outstanding sailor each year by the Cruising Club of America. This recognition is considered the top international award for adventure sailing. He was also inducted in 2006 into the Single-handed Sailing Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, joining such solo sailing luminaries as Joshua Slocum (1844-1909); Sir Robin Knox-Johnston (1939-); Mike Plant (1950-1992); and Isabelle Autissier (1956-). In January 2012, Saitō was named recipient of the Juan Sebastian del Cano Award, given by the 45,000-member United States Power Squadrons. The award is named for the navigator who finished the first-ever circumnavigation of the world led by Ferdinand Magellan in 1522. Saitō was cited for successfully completing his 8th solo circumnavigation at age 77, an international record, as well as for his nearly 40-year sailing career that includes a non-stop solo circumnavigation in 2005 at age 71. It was only the second time the award to honor adventure boating has been presented by the organization.  The 8th solo circumnavigation – the \\"wrong way around\\"  Sailing west-to-east to circle the globe in a wind-driven craft is no small feat but rarely is the plan to go westwardly instead — the \\"wrong way around\\" — against the prevailing winds, currents and waves. This route puts immense stresses on the vessel and crew, and for solo sailors, days can pass with little or no sleep when the going is particularly hard. Few single-handers have attempted such a feat and certainly none near Saitō's age — when he finished this voyage he was 77 years and 8 months old. The voyage started with an October 2008 departure from Yokohama, and entailed a westward circumnavigation of , and expected arrival back in Yokohama in the spring of 2010, after 6 months. Instead, it took almost 3 years for him to successfully complete the circumnavigation. Saitō's vessel encountered a number of problems. He stopped for repair in Sydney, Australia in November 2008, in Fremantle, Australia in December and in Cape Town, S.Africa in February. He was disabled with rudder problems at Cape Horn, Chile in April, 2009. He was towed to the world's southernmost city, Punta Arenas, Chile, where he over- wintered and carried out repairs. A second attempt around the Horn was successful, but sail and engine problems forced him to return to Punta Arenas, where he again attended to repairs. He restarted the circumnavigation in late January, 2010. He still had engine problems and stopped at Valdivia, Chile in February-March 2010 for repair. He then made a long stop in Honolulu, USA (June 2010-May 2011) and shorter stops in Galapagos, Ecuador and Ogasawara, Japan. He finished in Yokohama on September 17 2011, 1,080 days after his departure. Saitō's single-handed westward circumnavigation set two of the most-unchallengeable records of all sports: a solo circumnavigation at age 77 years and 8 months, and his 8th time around the globe solo in a sailing yacht.

The Fairchild SM-73 (originally Bull Goose) was a sub-sonic, jet-powered, ground-launched decoy cruise missile. Development Starting in December 1952, Fairchild began concept studies for a ground-launched long range decoy missile that could simulate strategic bombers on radar.SM-73, Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles - Appendix 1: Early Missiles and Drones, by Andreas Parsch , retrieved November 10, 2007. In March 1953, the United States Air Force released General Operational Requirement (GOR) 16 which called for a long range decoy missile to increase the effectiveness of Strategic Air Command bombers by confusing and saturating an air defense system.SM-73 Bull Goose, 1997 Web Page by the Federation of American Scientists, , retrieved November 10, 2007. Multiple SM-73 missiles would be ground-launched from Strategic Air Command bases located in the continental United States. Fifty percent of the deployed SM-73 missiles would be launched within the first hour after an alert and the remaining missiles would be launched one hour later.Fairchild B-73 Bull Goose, Fact Sheet from the National Museum of the USAF, , Retrieved on November 10, 2007. The requirement called for 85 percent of the decoy missiles to arrive at the target area within 115 nm (185 km).Historical Essay by Andreas Parsch, Goose, , retrieved on November 10, 2007. The SM-73 was to fly 4,000 nm (7,408 km) at speed of at least 0.85 Mach at an operating altitude of 50,000 ft (15,240 m) with a payload of 500 lb (227 kg). After flying 2,500 nm (4,650 km), the SM-73' would simulate the performance of the B-47 Stratojet or B-52 Stratofortress over the final 1,500 nm (2,780 km) of flight. Study contracts were awarded to Convair and Fairchild in July 1954 by the United States Air Force under the project designation MX-2223. The Fairchild MX-2223 design called for a non-metallic fuselage with swept wings and a v-tail. Radar reflectors were located in the fuselage and on pods positioned on the wing tips to simulate the radar return of a bomber. Design In December 1955, Fairchild was awarded a contract to develop Weapon System 123A which included the SM-73 missile. American Machine and Foundry Company was responsible for the ground equipment, Ramo-Woodridge Corporation was responsible for electronic equipment, and Paul Omohundro Co who was responsible for airframe elements. Two engine contracts were awarded by the USAF in November 1954 to minimize development risk.The History of North American Small Gas Turbine Aircraft Engines, William Fleming and Richard Leyes, AIAA, 1999 Each engine was in the 2,450 lbf (10.9 kN) thrust class with a thrust to weight ratio goal of 10:1. General Electric was awarded a contract for the development of the General Electric J85 and Fairchild was awarded a contract for the a competing engine the Fairchild J83. Fairchild proposed a lightweight engine of conventional design. The proposed General Electric engine had a more advanced design, involving more risk, but having a higher thrust to weight ratio. The XSM-73 was powered by the Fairchild J83 on all test flights but was also capable of using the General Electric J85. The Fairchild J83 was operating by early 1957. Like the MX-2223 design, the SM-73 utilized a non-metallic fiberglass fuselage. The swept wing of the MX-2223 design evolved to a fiberglass 52°delta wing. A Thiokol solid-propellant rocket booster was used to launch the SM-73 to a speed of 300 knots (345 mph). Cruise speed for the SM-73 was 488 knots (562 mph). The SM-73 had a fuel capacity of 803 gal (3,040 L) of JP-4. This fuel was stored in 10 fuselage and six wing tanks. An autopilot used a Rate integrating gyroscope for directional control. The rate integrating gyroscope could be pre-programmed to turn the SM-73. Pitch and roll control were provided by elevons either operating in phase or asymmetrically. Yaw control was provided by a rudder. The control system positioned flight controls by sending electrical signals to hydraulic actuators located at each flight control. The SM-73 was designed to carry radar reflectors and active electronic countermeasures operating in S-band, L-band, and lower frequencies. The SM-73 was not armed. Funding issues and problems with the fiberglass wing, the booster rocket, and the Fairchild J83 engine delayed testing. Test and evaluation began in February 1957 with rocket sled tests at Holloman Air Force Base. A B-57 Canberra was modified and used as a flying engine testbed for the Fairchild J83. Testing of the SM-73 then transitioned to Patrick Air Force Base in June 1957. At Patrick Air Force Base, launch complexes 21Encyclopedia Astronautica, Cape Canaveral LC21, retrieved November 10, 2007. and 22Encyclopedia Astronautica, Cape Canaveral LC22, retrieved November 10, 2007. were constructed near the Cape Canaveral Light to support SM-73 testing. Five dummy booster launches and fifteen test flights were flown between March 1957 and December 1958. The United States Air Force planned to purchase 2,328 operational missiles and 53 missiles for test and evaluation. This would have provided enough missiles for 10 squadrons. Deployment was planned to start in 1961 and be completed by October 1963. Bull Goose bases were initially planned at Duluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota and Ethan Allen Air Force Base, Vermont.GOOSE (BULL GOOSE) Fact Sheet, Cliff Lethbridge, Spaceline Website, , retrieved November 10, 2007. Construction of Bull Goose missile sites began in August 1958. In December 1958 the program was canceled because the missile was not able to simulate a B-52 on radar. The Fairchild J83 engine program was also canceled in November 1958. Total program cost at cancellation was $136.5 million USD. The SD-5 Osprey reconnaissance drone was developed with the Goose as a basis.Newcome 2004, p.75.

Early life Kolettis was of Aromanian origin. He was born in Syrrako, Epirus and played a leading role in the political life of the Greek state in the 1830s and 1840s. Kolettis studied medicine in Pisa, Italy and was influenced by the Carbonari movement and started planning his return to Epirus in order to participate in Greece's independence struggles. In 1813, he settled at Ioannina, where he served as a doctor and after gaining standing he was recruited as the personal doctor of Ali Pasa's son, Muqtar Pasa. He remained in Ioannina till March 1821, when he entered Filiki Eteria and left for Syrrako, together with chieftain Raggos, in order to spread the revolution into Central Greece (Rumeli), but his efforts quickly failed because of the rapid reaction of the Ottoman army. Kolettis was the leader of the pro-French party and based his power on his relations with the leaders of Central Greece but also on his ability to eliminate his adversaries by acting behind the scenes. Greek War of Independence Ioannis Kolettis by Dominique Papety. In the First Greek National Assembly, at Epidavros, he participated as the representative of Epirus and in January, 1822 he became Minister of Internal Affairs. After the Second Greek National Assembly, at Astros in May, 1823 he was appointed sub-prefect of Euboea and managed to remove Turkish troops off the island. At the same time, he continued his political activities, resulting in his election as member of the Legislative Body (Νομοθετικόν), a position that he held till 1826. At the end of 1824, during the civil war between the rebel factions, he was in charge of the Roumeliot (Central Greece) party and defeated the Moreot or Peloponnesian party, which opposed the Kountouriotis government. Nonetheless, in the Third Greek National Assembly, he supported the Peloponnesian party and with its support was assigned to train troops from Thessaly and Macedonia, with the aim of destroying Ottoman resource depots at Atalanti. However, the whole operation failed because of his inexperience in military affairs, which ruined his reputation. Political career after 1821 When John Capodistria landed at Nafplio in January 1828 as governor, he was appointed as governor of Samos and later, in July 1829 as Minister of Defense. In October 1831, Capodistria was assassinated; in the ensuing civil war, which lasted until 1832, Kolettis was once again leader of the Roumeliot Party. He tried, along with Theodoros Kolokotronis and Augustinos Kapodistrias to form a government but due to severe disagreements the coalition was dissolved. To assume leadership after 1821, he is considered responsible for the death of a great Greek Independence Hero, Odysseus Androutsos, and also responsible for the separation (\\"divide and conquer\\") of a legendary couple of the Greek Independence: Prince Dimitrius Ypsilantis and Manto Mavrogenous. Political career during Otto's reign Until Otto of Greece reached adulthood, Kolettis was Minister of the Navy and Minister of Defense. In 1835, he was sent to France as the ambassador where he created connections with French politicians and intellectuals. He returned to Greece after the coup that broke out in Athens in September 1843, which forced King Otto to grant a constitution and Kolettis took part in the subsequent Constitutional Assembly. To contest the elections in 1844, he formed a party, the French Party (Γαλλικό Κόμμα) and together with Andreas Metaxas, leader of the Russian Party formed a government. When Metaxas resigned, he became Prime Minister and served as such until his death in 1847. He is credited with conceiving the Megali Idea or \\"Great Idea\\" which became the core of Greek foreign policy until the early 20th century.

It is based on a John Collier short story published in the 1951 collection Fancies and Goodnights. Written originally for television, the musical focuses on a poet who takes refuge from the world by hiding out in a department store after closing. He meets a community of night people who live in the store and falls in love with a beautiful young girl named Ella. Bizarre complications arise when the leader of the group forbids their relationship. Synopsis Poet Charles Snell takes refuge from the world by hiding out in a department store after closing (\\"If You Can Find Me, I'm Here\\"). Once there he finds a secret group who have lived in the store for years. The leader of the group, Mrs. Monday, permits Charles to stay after he convinces her that he is a poet. Charles meets and is smitten with a beautiful young girl, Ella Harkins, Mrs. Monday's maid. Ella, who is now 19, has lived in the store since she was separated from her mother at age six, falling asleep in the women's hat department. Ella is unhappy and wants to leave, but is afraid of the \\"Dark Men.\\" Should someone try to return to the outside world and risk revealing the group's existence, the Dark Men take them away and another mannequin appears in the clothing department. Charles realizes Ella has not seen the sun for thirteen years, but she replies that she remembers (\\"I Remember\\"). Charles has fallen in love with Ella; as he plays cards with members of the group, he has a quiet duet with Ella (\\"When\\"). Ella finally decides to leave with Charles (\\"Take Me To The World\\"). Charles is initially reluctant to leave his now-comfortable life, but then understands that he loves Ella more than poetry. Mrs. Monday and the others hear their plans, and they call the Dark Men, as Ella and Charles try to escape. The store opens the next morning with a couple on the sidewalk who resemble Ella and Charles from behind, but turn out to be strangers when the camera pans to their faces. They're looking at a window display in which Ella and Charles are now mannequins dressed as a bride and groom, with the night watchman acting as their minister. Productions Anthony Perkins as Charles Snell; Charmian Carr as Ella Harkins Written specifically for the television anthology series ABC Stage 67, it aired on November 16, 1966.

He trained as a carpenter, attended night classes at Cooper Union, and went into business as a builder and architect, most notably in the Park Slope and Flatbush neighborhoods of Brooklyn. In this capacity, he developed the \\"Calder House,\\" a semi-detached two-family structure that was widely adopted in the latter district.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/07/16/94704474.html?pageNumber=137 From 1902 until his death, Calder resided in the former district at 551 1st Street, a limestone townhouse built by competitor William Flanagan.http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0709.pdf In 1893, he married Catherine E. Harloe. His children were Elsie Calder, who married to Rear Admiral Robert C. Lee, and William M. Calder II. He served as the Borough of Brooklyn Building Commissioner from 1902 to 1903. He represented New York as a Republican in the United States House of Representatives from 1905 until 1915. In 1914, he lost the Republican primary for U.S. Senator to James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr. In 1916, he won the Republican primary, defeating Robert Bacon, and was elected to the United States Senate over Democratic National Committee chairman William F. McCombs in the general election. He served one term, from 1917 to 1923. He became well known as the sponsor of the Standard Time Act of 1918 (also known as the Calder Act), the first U.S. law implementing standard time and daylight saving time in the United States. In 1922, he was defeated for re-election by Democrat Royal S. Copeland. After leaving Congress he continued to be active in the building trade and financial institutions. He died on March 3, 1945, which was his 76th birthday. Legacy His papers are held in a number of archives including: Herbert Hoover Presidential Library; the New York Historical Society; and Yale University.

Layla was the daughter of Al Minhal and was later also known as Umm Tamim. Because of her beauty, she was pursued by many men, but rejected their advances. Finally, she met and married Malik ibn Nuwayra. Malik bin Nuwayra Malik was a chief of some distinction; a warrior, noted for his generosity; and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs. During the lifetime of Muhammad, he had been appointed as a tax collector. Attack on Malik ibn Nuwayra's tribe During the Ridda wars, which broke out in Arabia after the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr sent his most talented general Khalid ibn Walid into Najd with 4000 men to submit the tribes of the surrounding areas. Malik was guilty for his acts against the state of Medina. After the death of Muhammad, he broke in open revolt against Medina. As soon as Malik heard of the death of Muhammad, he gave back all the tax to his tribesmen, saying that \\"I will only pay taxes to the man chosen at Ghadeer\\" (Ali ibn Abu Taleb).reference=al-Balazuri: book no: 1, page no:107. Moreover, he was to be charged because he signed a pact with the self- proclaimed prophetess Sajah. This agreement stated that first they would deal with local enemy tribes together, and then they would confront the state of Medina.reference=al-Tabari: Vol. 2, page no: 496. When Malik heard about Khalid ibn Walid's victories against powerful Arab tribes, he ordered his tribesmen not to engage the approaching Khalid ibn Walid in battle, to stay at home and hope for peace.reference= Tabari: Vol. 2, Page no: 501-502. He himself apparently moved away across the desert with his family. Also, so as to prove himself loyal to the state of Medina (the future Islamic empire), he collected the tax and sent it to Medina. His riders were stopped by Khalid ibn Walid's army at the town of Battah. Khalid asked them about the signing of a pact with Sajah but they said it was only to exact revenge on their terrible enemies.reference= Tabari: Vol) p. 501-2. When Khalid reached Najd, he found no opposing army, so he sent his cavalry to nearby villages and ordered them to call the Azaan (call for prayer) to each party they meet. Zirrar bin Azwar, a group leader, arrested the family of Malik claiming they did not answer the call to prayer. Malik ibn Nuwayra's Death =Shia view= Malik was asked by Khalid about his crimes. Malik's response was \\"your master said this, your master said that\\" referring to [Abu Bakr]. Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution.reference=Tabari: Vol. 2, Page no: 5) Khalid bin Walid ordered the execution of Malik ibn Nuwayra and after that he married his wife, Layla bint al-Minhal without waiting for iddah period. =Sunni view= When arrested in November 632 AD, Malik was asked by Khalid ibn Walid about his crimes. Khalid's interpretation of Malik's response was that although he and his followers were Muslims, they did not wish to pay taxes to Abu Bakr. Khalid understood this to be a transparent attempt by Malik to save his own life by any means at his disposal. Khalid having clear evidence of Malik's distributing the tax money on getting news of Muhammad's death declared Malik an apostate and ordered his execution. Due to the controversy of marrying Malik's wife on the same night, who was not allowed a waiting or mourning period, Khalid has to explain himself in the court of Medina. When he met Abu Bakr, he explained that Malik bin Nawari had killed hundreds of Muslims in the town of Rabaab; followed Sajah bint Tameem (an Arab Christian who claimed prophethood) and joined forces with her to kill the Muslims; refused to give the Zakat; refused to answer back to the call of prayer given before entering upon his people; his wife had already claimed she had been abused by him and kept as a prisoner when she proclaimed her allegiance to Islam and his refusal to name the Prophet Muhammad by his title of Prophethood. For all these reasons he was killed as an enemy and due to his killings of the Muslims in the town of Rabaab.

Early life Bauval was born in Alexandria, Egypt, to parents of Belgian and Maltese origins. He attended the British Boys' School in Alexandria (now El Nasr Boys' School) and the Franciscan College in Buckinghamshire, England. He left Egypt in 1967 just before the Six-Day War, during the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser. He has spent most of his engineering career living and working in the Middle East and Africa as a construction engineer. Writing career In late 1992, Bauval had been trying to obtain a translation of Hermetica by Walter Scott. He then came across a new edition printed by Solo Press with a foreword by Adrian Gilbert.Walter Scott, Hermetica: The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings which contain Religious or Philosophic Teachings ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus (Solo Press, 1992). Bauval contacted Gilbert after being interested in his foreword concerning a link between an Alexandrine school of Hermes Trismegistus and the pyramid builders of the Fourth dynasty of Egypt. They went on to write The Orion Mystery together, which became an international bestseller. BBC Two broadcast a documentary on Bauval's ideas around the time of the book's publication. He has co-authored three books with Graham Hancock, including 2004's Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith in which the two put forward what sociologist of religion David V. Barrettin a review in The Independent described Talisman as a factually incorrect and unconvincing \\"mess of a book\\" based upon indiscriminate use of source material culminating by \\"promulgating a version of the old Jewish-Masonic plot so beloved by ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists. Orion Correlation Theory Bauval is specifically known for the Orion Correlation Theory (OCT), which proposes a relationship between the fourth dynasty Egyptian pyramids of the Giza Plateau and the alignment of certain stars in the constellation of Orion. However, 20 years before Bauval's book The Orion Mystery suggested that the Giza Pyramids were aligned to Orion's belt, Dr. James J. Hurtak pointed out such a correlation in 1973. One night in 1983, while working in Saudi Arabia, he took his family and a friend's family up into the sand dunes of the Arabian desert for a camping expedition. His friend pointed out the constellation of Orion, and mentioned that Alnitak, the most easterly of the stars making up Orion's belt, was offset slightly from the others. Bauval then made a connection between the layout of the three main stars in Orion's belt and the layout of the three main pyramids in the Giza necropolis.The theory, known as the Orion Correlation Theory or OCT, was first published in Discussions in Egyptology (DE, Volume 13, 1989). The Orion Correlation Theory has been described as a form of pseudoarchaeology. Among the idea's critics have been two astronomers: Ed Krupp of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and Anthony Fairall, astronomy professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Krupp and Fairall independently investigated the angle between the alignment of Orion's Belt to North during the era cited by Bauval (which differs from the angle in the 3rd millennium BCE, because of the precession of the equinoxes), and found that the angle was somewhat different from the 'perfect match' claimed by Bauval and Hancock: 47 to 50 degrees, compared to the 38-degree angle formed by the pyramids. Krupp also pointed out that the slightly-bent line formed by the three pyramids was deviated towards the North, whereas the slight \\"kink\\" in the line of Orion's Belt was deformed to the South, meaning that a direct correlation would require one or the other to be inverted. Indeed, this is what was done in the original book by Bauval and Gilbert (The Orion Mystery), which compared images of the pyramids and Orion without revealing that the pyramids' map had been inverted. Krupp and Fairall find other problems with the claims, including the point that if the Sphinx is meant to represent the constellation of Leo, then it should be on the opposite side of the Nile (the 'Milky Way') from the pyramids ('Orion'), that the vernal equinox around 10,500 BCE was in Virgo and not Leo, and that the constellations of the Zodiac originate from Mesopotamia and were unknown in Egypt at the time. Atlantis Reborn documentary On 4 November 1999, the BBC broadcast a documentary entitled Atlantis Reborn which tested the ideas of Robert Bauval and his colleague, Graham Hancock. Bauval and Hancock afterwards complained to the BSC (Broadcasting Standards Commission) that they had been treated unfairly. A hearing followed and in November 2000 the BSC ruled in favour of the documentary makers on all but one of the ten principal complaints brought by Hancock and Bauval. The BSC concluded that Hancock and Bauval had been treated unfairly in respect of an omission of their rebuttal of a specific argument against the Orion Correlation Theory. In regard of the nine remaining principal complaints, the BSC ruled against Hancock and Bauval, concluding that they had not been treated unfairly in the criticism of their theories concerning carbon-dating, the Great Sphinx of Egypt, Cambodia's Angkor temples, Japan's Yonaguni formation and the mythical land of Atlantis. The BBC offered to broadcast a revised version of the documentary, which was welcomed by Hancock and Bauval. It was broadcast as Atlantis Reborn Again on 14 December 2000. The revised documentary continued to present serious doubts about Bauval and Hancock's ideas, as held by astronomer Anthony Fairall, Ed Krupp of the Griffith Observatory, Egyptologist Kate Spence of Cambridge University and Eleanor Mannikka of the University of Michigan.

The term \\"Hainanese\\" was frequently used by all inhabitants of Hainan island to refer to themselves overseas. Min speaking Hainanese often refer to themselves as Qiongwen to distinguish themselves from other ethnic groups of Hainan such as the Cantonese or Tanka. History Hainanese children at the Presbyterian Mission playground in Hainan, 1920. Most Hainanese Han people were originally fishers from the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi who later settled in the island of Hainan, while the Lingaoese, Tanka and Li natives invaded the island earlier and were descendants of the Yue tribe, from mainland China. During the fall of the Song Dynasty, Min Hainanese-speaking colonists of scholars and military families arrived and colonized the island from the three districts of Xinghua prefecture (including Putian city) in the centre-coast of Fujian province pushing many if not most of the local inhabitants to the impoverished areas. As a result of the assimilation of other dialect groups, many Hainanese genetically cluster with Han Chinese from Guangdong and Guangxi instead of Fujianese people. Similarly to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, Hainan has been a source for immigrants. Towards the turn of the 20th century, many Hainanese migrated to various Southeast Asian nations, where they worked as cooks, restaurateurs, coffee shop owners, clothesmakers, sailors and hoteliers. Chan Sing, one of the \\"villain\\" movie stars that dotted the Hong Kong movie industry was of Hainanese ancestry, as was the bartender who invented the world-famous Singapore Sling at the renowned Singapore Raffles Hotel, Mr. Ngiam Tong Boon. In Thailand, singer Nichkhun of 2PM, media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul, the politically influential Sarasin family, as well as two of the wealthiest business families, the Chirathivats and the Yoovidhyas, all trace their ancestries to Hainan. In Laos, former deputy prime minister Somsavat Lengsavad is also of Hainanese descent. Culture =Language= In Hainan, the local Han Chinese speak Hainanese, a Min Chinese language also known as Qiongwen, as their native tongue. The dialect of Wenchang () is spoken by Hainanese from the northern parts of Hainan. Numerous Wenchang Hainanese descended from Jinshi and merchants from Putian as many of their Jiapu (family genealogies) show. This is also why they pronounce some words with the Hokkien twang (example: close door is \\"gieh mui\\" for other Hainanese dialects. Today, many Wenchang Hainanese still return to Putian for ancestors tomb cleaning (). Many Hainanese who have surnames largely found only in Cantonese people like 麥, 鄺, 莫, 譚, 岑, 龐, 梅, etc. have ancestry from Cantonese immigrants who immigrated to the island in waves especially during the Ming dynasty as indicated in historical records and their jiapus. Standard Chinese (phonologically based on Beijing Mandarin) is also the lingua franca in the island province as in the rest of China. =Cuisine= Hainanese chicken rice served in Singapore The Hainanese are known for their signature dishes such as the Hainanese chicken rice, Wenchang chicken, Hainanese pork chop, Hainanese mutton soup, Hainanese salted fish soup and beef noodle soup. Notably, in Singapore, these signature dishes are served at the various eateries located along Purvis Street, within the Hainanese enclave; as a result, Purvis Street is often referred to as \\"Hainan Second Street\\", while Middle Road and Seah Street are referred to as \\"Hainan First Street\\" and \\"Hainan Third Street\\" respectively. Hainanese chicken rice is a recognised dish throughout Southeast Asia due to the Hainanese diaspora in these areas who famed it. It is often labelled as Singapore's national dish. =Arts= Hainanese opera (Qiong opera) is a passion for many Hainanese, particularly for the older generation. Enriched with local flavours, Hainanese opera is part and parcel of Hainanese culture.

Neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, or magnetoencephalography are especially useful non- invasive tools to locate eloquent cortex. Much higher spatial and temporal resolution maps of cortical activity can be achieved with a technique called electrocorticography, however this requires placement of subdural electrodes on the surface of the brain and this must be done during surgery.

At times the regiment was attached to the 17th Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division and later, the 13th Airborne Division. During most of their combat, the unit was an independent combined force of 17th Airborne troops called the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team or 517th PRCT /517th PCT /517th RCT. The unit was formed in early 1943 and trained at Camp Toccoa, Georgia. The 517th saw heavy fighting in the Italian Campaign in June 1944, before being transferred to take part in Operation Dragoon in August 1944, in Southern France, which happened to be their first combat jump. Following the liberation of France, the 517th was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division and fought with it in Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge. Following the end of the war, the 517th was assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where the unit was inactivated on 25 February 1946. Operation Dragoon The 517th was one of three parachute infantry regiments assigned to the First Airborne Task Force, which was charged with the assault on Southern France. The assault was set for 0800 on 15 August 1944, however, the 517th dropped early at 0328 on the 15th. This marked the unit's first combat jump. After three days of heavy fighting around the towns of Le Muy, Les Arcs, La Motte and Draguignan, German resistance ceased. For their participation in Operation Dragoon and the subsequent liberation of France, the 517th PIR was awarded the French Croix de Guerre by the Provisional Government of the French Republic. Battle of the Bulge The 517th was attached to the XVIII Airborne Corps following the liberation of France, along with the 82nd, 101st, and 13th Airborne Divisions. Elements of the 517th participated in counter-attacks near the Belgian towns of Soy, Sur-Les-Hys, Hotton, and Manhay, pushing the German offensive past its starting point. The 517th suffered heavy casualties in the ferocious fighting during the battle, during which 1st Battalion, 517th received the Presidential Unit Citation for its successful assault on Soy and Hotton. Last days of World War II Following the Battle of the Bulge, the 517th PIR was assigned to the 13th Airborne Division, to take part in Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the Rhine river. However, prior to the operation, the 13th's participation in the attack was called off. The 517th, then attached to the 17th Airborne Division, was slated to take part in Operation Coronet, the airborne invasion of the Japanese Home Islands, which was also called off after V-J Day. Statistics The 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team accumulated over 150 combat days during five campaigns on battlefields in Italy, France, Belgium and Germany. The battalion casualty rate was 81.9 percent. The team suffered 1,576 casualties and had 247 men killed in action. PFC Melvin E. Biddle B/1/517th PIR was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroic actions during the Soy-Hotton engagement. On 15 February 1945, elements of the RCT were assigned to the 13th Airborne Division. The 13th was inactivated in February 1946. In addition to the one Medal of Honor, troopers of the 517th PRCT earned 6 Distinguished Service Crosses, 131 Silver Stars, 631 Bronze Stars, 1,576 Purple Hearts, 5 Legion of Merits, 4 Soldier's Medals, 2 Air Medals and 17 French Croix de Guerres.

Distribution  Oncomelania hupensis has been found in China, Taiwan, and also in Japan, Philippines, and Indonesian island of Sulawesi. varix surrounding the aperture are clearly visible, and a pair of eyes and a pair of tentacles are also visible on the head, with a strong contour of the foot below.  Description  Over the past a few decades, the taxonomy of Oncomelania hupensis has been a dispute due to the variation in morphological characters such as shell sculpture, operculum etc. Phenotypically, Oncomelania hupensis can be separated into ribbed- and smooth- shelled morphotypes. In China, the typical morphotype of Oncomelania hupensis is ribbed-shelled, and its distribution is restricted to Yangtze River basin. Smooth-shelled snails are also distributed in mainland China, but are considered as the same species and subspecies of Oncomelania hupensis. Oncomelania hupensis reported in other Far East countries are smooth-shelled, and have been considered either as subspecies of Oncomelania hupensis or independent species in this genus. { Photo of apertural view of a shell of Oncomelania hupensis hupensis.

(2011). \\"Terrestrial invasion of pomatiopsid gastropods in the heavy-snow region of the Japanese Archipelago\\". BMC Evolutionary Biology 11: 118. . It is seasonally amphibious species which lives in lakes and on marshy ground. The habitats of Oncomelania hupensis in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River include lake/marshland regions and hill regions, both of which have extensive physical connections with the Yangtze River through channels or in low floodplains beside the Yangtze River. With frequent floodings of the Yangtze River, snails in these habitats can be dispersed and subsequently deposited widely in various localities. The accumulation of mixed sources of snails can then generate genetically diversified populations of snails, leading to the existence of various haplotypes. In Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni are distributed in mountainous areas, and are not subjected to flood influence as much as in the middle and lower reaches of the river. It is interesting to see that a relatively lower number of haplotypes were found in this region as compared with Oncomelania hupensis hupensis. It appears likely that there has been certain degree of isolation for these mountainous populations.  Parasites  This freshwater snail is significant medically, because it is an important vector of parasitic infection in the tropics and subtropics. It can serve as vectors for two serious human diseases: the schistosomiasis blood fluke parasite, and the paragonimus lung fluke parasites. Oncomelania hupensis is the unique intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum,Lewis F. A., Liang Y., Raghavan N. & Knight M. (2008). \\"The NIH- NIAID Schistosomiasis Resource Center\\". PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 2(7): e267. . which causes schistosomiasis endemic in the Far East, and especially in mainland China. Oncomelania hupensis largely determines the parasite's geographical range. Disinfesting Oncomelania hupensis, Japan has completely overcome Schistosoma japonicum.

In the inner ear, stereocilia are the mechanosensing organelles of hair cells, which respond to fluid motion in numerous types of animals for various functions, including hearing and balance. They are about 10–50 micrometers in length and share some similar features of microvilli.Caceci, T. VM8054 Veterinary Histology: Male Reproductive System. http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab27/Lab27.htm (accessed 2/16/06). The hair cells turn the fluid pressure and other mechanical stimuli into electric stimuli via the many microvilli that make up stereocilia rods.Alberts, B., Johnson, A., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K. and Walter, P. (2002) The Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Science Textbooks. Stereocilia exist in the auditory and vestibular systems. Morphology Resembling hair-like projections, the stereocilia are arranged in bundles of 30-300. Within the bundles the stereocilia are often lined up in several rows of increasing height, similar to a staircase. At the core of these hair-like stereocilia are rigid cross-linked actin filaments, which can renew every 48 hours. These actin filaments face their positive ends at the tips of the stereocilia and their negative ends at the base and can be up to 120 micrometres in length. Filamentous structures, called tip links, connect the tips of stereocilia in adjacent rows in the bundles. The tip links are made up of nearly vertical fine filaments that run upward from the top end of a shorter stereocilia to its taller neighbor. Tip links are analogous to tiny springs, which, when stretched, open cation selective channels thus allowing ions to flow across the cell membrane into the hair cells. They also are involved in the force transmission across the bundle and the maintenance of the hair bundle structure. Auditory pathway Section through the spiral organ of Corti, magnified. The stereocilia are the \\"hairs\\" sticking out of the tops of the inner and outer 442x442pxAs acoustic sensors in mammals, stereocilia are lined up in the organ of Corti within the cochlea of the inner ear. In hearing, stereocilia transform the mechanical energy of sound waves into electrical signals for the hair cells, which ultimately leads to an excitation of the auditory nerve. Stereocilia are composed of cytoplasm with embedded bundles of cross-linked actin filaments. The actin filaments anchor to the terminal web and the top of the cell membrane and are arranged in grade of height. As sound waves propagate in the cochlea, the movement of endolymph fluid bends the stereocilia. If the direction of movement is towards the taller stereocilia, tension develops in the tip links, mechanically opening transduction channels near the tips. Cations from the endolymph flow into the cell, depolarizing the hair cell and triggering the release of neurotransmitters to nearby nerves, which send an electrical signal to the central nervous system. Vestibular pathway In the vestibular system, the stereocilia are located in the otolithic organs and the semicircular canals. Hair cells in the vestibular system are slightly different from those in the auditory system, in that vestibular hair cells have one tallest cilium, termed the kinocilium. Bending the stereocilia toward the kinocilium depolarizes the cell and results in increased afferent activity. Bending the stereocilia away from the kinocilium hyperpolarizes the cell and results in a decrease in afferent activity. In the semicircular canals, the hair cells are found in the crista ampullaris, and the stereocilia protrude into the ampullary cupula. Here, the stereocilia are all oriented in the same direction. In the otoliths, the hair cells are topped by small, calcium carbonate crystals called otoconia. Unlike the semicircular ducts, the kinocilia of hair cells in the otoliths are not oriented in a consistent direction. The kinocilia point toward (in the utricle) or away from (in the saccule) a middle line called the striola.Gray, Lincoln. \\"Vestibular System: Structure and Function\\". Neuroscience Online: an electronic book for the neurosciences. http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab27/Lab27.htm (accessed 2/16/06). Mechanoelectrical transduction In the cochlea, a shearing movement between the tectorial membrane and the basilar membrane deflects the stereocilia, affecting the tension on the tip-link filaments, which then open and close the non-specific ion channels. When tension increases, the flow of ions across the membrane into the hair cell rises as well. Such influx of ions causes a depolarization of the cell, resulting in an electrical potential that ultimately leads to a signal for the auditory nerve and the brain. The identity of the mechanosensitive channels in the stereocilia is still unknown. The transduction channels associated with stereocilia are thought to lie at the distal ends of the stereocilia. Deflections of the stereocilia in the direction of the tallest stereocilia leads to an increased rate of opening of nonspecific cation channels. This, in turn, causes receptor depolarization and leads to the excitement of the cochlear nerve afferents that are located at the base of the hair cell. Deflections of the stereocilia in the opposite direction toward the shortest stereocilia causes transduction channels to close. In this situation, the hair cells become hyperpolarized and the nerve afferents are not excited. There are two different types of fluid that surround the hair cells of the inner ear. The endolymph is the fluid that surrounds the apical surfaces of hair cells. Potassium is the major cation in the endolymph and is thought to be responsible for carrying the receptor currents in the cochlea. Perilymph is found surrounding the sides and the bases of the hair cells. Perilymph is low in potassium and high in sodium. The different ionic makeups of the surrounding fluid in addition to the resting potential of the hair cell creates a potential difference across the apical membrane of the hair cell, so potassium enters when transduction channels open. An influx of potassium ions depolarizes the cell and causes the release of a neurotransmitter that can initiate nerve impulses in the sensory neurons that synapse on the base of the hair cell. Destruction of stereocilia Stereocilia (along with the entirety of the hair cell) in mammals can be damaged or destroyed by excessive loud noises, disease, and toxins and are not regenerable. Environmental noise induced hearing impairment is probably the most prevalent noise health effect according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Abnormal structure/organization of a bundle of stereocilia can also cause deafness and in turn create balance problems for an individual. In other vertebrates, if the hair cell is harmed, supporting cells will divide and replace the damaged hair cells.  Genetic studies  The methionine sulfoxide reductase B3 gene (MsrB3), a protein repair enzyme, has been implicated in large scale stereocilia bundle degeneration, as well as many other factors such as gestational age and tolerance to cold environments in plants. Although the exact process of pathogenesis is unknown, it seems to be related to apoptotic cell death. A study based on splicing morpholinos to down-regulate MsrB3 expression in zebrafish showed shorter, thinner, and more crowded cilia, as well as small, misplaced otoliths. Several stereocilia also underwent apoptosis. Injection with wild-type MsrB3 mRNA rescued auditory deficits, suggesting MsrB3 helps prevent apoptosis. Another gene, DFNB74, has been observed as a gene involved in recessive hearing loss. DFNB74 based hearing loss may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. DFNB74 and MsrB3 based deafness may be related to one another. Research on these genes is based on families with recessive deafness, and multiple nonrelated families with this deafness have mutations on both DFNB74 and MsrB3. Damaged or abnormal stereocilia that are a result of genetic mutations often cause hearing loss and other complications, and can be passed down to children. In a recent study, researchers studied mice that inherited a mutated hair cell gene called whirlin, which leads to shorter and fatter stereocilia that are organized in additional rows and that often die off after birth. No current therapies or reparative measures exist to replace such defective hair cells in humans. In order to correct this mutation, researchers injected a gene therapy containing the corrected gene into the inner ear of mice with the genetic mutation. The therapy restored stereocilia to normal lengths and eliminated the additional rows of stereocilia in newborn whirler mice. Despite the restoration of hair cells, the treated whirler mice exhibited no signs of improved hearing ability following testing after one month and after three months of treatment. Further studies are looking to understand why the restoration of the stereocilia did not improve the hearing ability of the mutated mice.  Current research  Sound above a certain decibel level can cause permanent damage to inner ear stereocilia. New research has shown that the damage can possibly be reversed if we can repair or recreate some of the proteins in the stereocilia. In this study, scientists used zebrafish to examine the motion of proteins within live ear cells using a confocal microscope. This has shown that proteins in stereocilia move quickly, indicating that the movement of the proteins within the hair cells may be a very important factor to maintaining the integrity of the hair bundles in the inner ear. Further research found myosin and actin, two proteins that are important for cell movement, move very quickly. Fascin 2b, a protein involved in actin cross-linking, moves even faster. Constant movement of proteins within cells, along with replacement and readjustment, helps cells repair damage. The fast movement of these proteins has changed our understanding of stereocilia and indicates that proteins within stereocilia are not immobile and static. Further research hopes to investigate manipulating protein dynamics to restore human hearing function after damage.

Ruzicka designed typefaces and wood engraving illustrations for Daniel Berkeley Updike's Merrymount Press, and was a designer for, and consultant to, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company for fifty years. He designed a number of seals and medals, including the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) and the Dartmouth Medal of the American Library Association. Biography Rudolph Ruzicka was born in Bohemia in 1883. He emigrated to the United States of America at age ten, living first in Chicago where he took drawing lessons at the Hull House School before becoming an apprentice wood engraver. From 1900 to 1902 he attended further classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1903 he moved to New York to work as an engraver at the American Bank Note Company and at Calkins & Holden. In subsequent years he attended classes at both the Art Students League of New York and the New York School of Art. In 1910 Ruzicka set up his own shop at 954 Lexington Avenue in New York City. He received his first major art commission from System magazine. Many exhibitions followed, including such venues as the Societe de la Gravure, Paris, the Grolier Club, and the Century Association, New York. In 1916 Ruzicka built a house and a workshop in Dobbs Ferry, New York. In 1935 Ruzicka was awarded the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and in that same year began work with the Typographic Development staff at Mergenthaler Linotype Company, for which he was to produce typeface families. In 1948 he moved to Massachusetts, and eventually he settled in Vermont. Over the years, D. B.

This alkali metal hydride is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are grey. Characteristic of a salt-like (ionic) hydride, it has a high melting point, and it is not soluble but reactive with all organic and protic solvents. It is soluble and nonreactive with certain molten salts such as lithium fluoride, lithium borohydride, and sodium hydride. With a molecular mass of slightly less than 8.0, it is the lightest ionic compound. Physical properties LiH is a diamagnetic and an ionic conductor with a conductivity gradually increasing from at 443 °C to 0.18 Ω−1cm−1 at 754 °C; there is no discontinuity in this increase through the melting point. The dielectric constant of LiH decreases from 13.0 (static, low frequencies) to 3.6 (visible-light frequencies). LiH is a soft material with a Mohs hardness of 3.5. Its compressive creep (per 100 hours) rapidly increases from < 1% at 350 °C to > 100% at 475 °C, meaning that LiH can't provide mechanical support when heated. The thermal conductivity of LiH decreases with temperature and depends on morphology: the corresponding values are 0.125 W/(cm·K) for crystals and 0.0695 W/(cm·K) for compacts at 50 °C, and 0.036 W/(cm·K) for crystals and 0.0432 W/(cm·K) for compacts at 500 °C. The linear thermal expansion coefficient is 4.2/°C at room temperature. Synthesis and processing LiH is produced by treating lithium metal with hydrogen gas: : 2 Li + H2 → 2 LiH This reaction is especially rapid at temperatures above 600 °C. Addition of 0.001–0.003% carbon, or/and increasing temperature or/and pressure, increases the yield up to 98% at 2-hour residence time. However, the reaction proceeds at temperatures as low as 29 °C. The yield is 60% at 99 °C and 85% at 125 °C, and the rate depends significantly on the surface condition of LiH. Less common ways of LiH synthesis include thermal decomposition of lithium aluminium hydride (200 °C), lithium borohydride (300 °C), n-butyllithium (150 °C), or ethyllithium (120 °C), as well as several reactions involving lithium compounds of low stability and available hydrogen content. Chemical reactions yield LiH in the form of lumped powder, which can be compressed into pellets without a binder. More complex shapes can be produced by casting from the melt. Large single crystals (about 80 mm long and 16 mm in diameter) can be then grown from molten LiH powder in hydrogen atmosphere by the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique. They often have bluish color owing to the presence of colloidal Li. This color can be removed by post-growth annealing at lower temperatures (~550 °C) and lower thermal gradients. Major impurities in these crystals are Na (20–200 parts per million, ppm), O (10–100 ppm), Mg (0.5–6 ppm), Fe (0.5-2 ppm) and Cu (0.5-2 ppm). Cracking in cast LiH after machining with a fly cutter. Scale is in inches. Bulk cold-pressed LiH parts can be easily machined using standard techniques and tools to micrometer precision. However, cast LiH is brittle and easily cracks during processing. A more energy efficient route to form lithium hydride powder is by ball milling lithium metal under high hydrogen pressure. A problem with this method is the cold welding of lithium metal due to the high ductility. By adding small amounts of lithium hydride powder the cold welding can be avoided. Solvent-and catalyst-free mechanochemical synthesis of alkali metal monohydrides IZ Hlova, A Castle, JF Goldston, S Gupta, T Prost… - Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 2016 Reactions LiH powder reacts rapidly with air of low humidity, forming LiOH, and . In moist air the powder ignites spontaneously, forming a mixture of products including some nitrogenous compounds. The lump material reacts with humid air, forming a superficial coating, which is a viscous fluid. This inhibits further reaction, although the appearance of a film of \\"tarnish\\" is quite evident. Little or no nitride is formed on exposure to humid air. The lump material, contained in a metal dish, may be heated in air to slightly below 200 °C without igniting, although it ignites readily when touched by an open flame. The surface condition of LiH, presence of oxides on the metal dish, etc., have a considerable effect on the ignition temperature. Dry oxygen does not react with crystalline LiH unless heated strongly, when an almost explosive combustion occurs. LiH is highly reactive toward water and other protic reagents: :LiH + H2O → Li+ \\\\+ H2 \\\\+ OH− LiH is less reactive with water than Li and thus is a much less powerful reducing agent for water, alcohols, and other media containing reducible solutes. This is true for all the binary saline hydrides. LiH pellets slowly expand in moist air, forming LiOH; however, the expansion rate is below 10% within 24 hours in a pressure of 2 Torr of water vapor. If moist air contains carbon dioxide, then the product is lithium carbonate. LiH reacts with ammonia, slowly at room temperature, but the reaction accelerates significantly above 300 °C. LiH reacts slowly with higher alcohols and phenols, but vigorously with lower alcohols. LiH reacts with sulfur dioxide: :2 LiH + 2 SO2 → Li2S2O4 \\\\+ H2 though above 50 °C the product is lithium dithionite. LiH reacts with acetylene to form lithium carbide and hydrogen. With anhydrous organic acids, phenols and acid anhydrides LiH reacts slowly, producing hydrogen gas and the lithium salt of the acid. With water-containing acids, LiH reacts faster than with water. Many reactions of LiH with oxygen-containing species yield LiOH, which in turn irreversibly reacts with LiH at temperatures above 300 °C: :LiH + LiOH → Li2O + H2 Applications =Hydrogen storage and fuel= With a hydrogen content in proportion to its mass three times that of NaH, LiH has the highest hydrogen content of any hydride. LiH is periodically of interest for hydrogen storage, but applications have been thwarted by its stability to decomposition. Thus removal of H2 requires temperatures above the 700 °C used for its synthesis, such temperatures are expensive to create and maintain. The compound was once tested as a fuel component in a model rocket.Lex . Astronautix.com (1964-04-25).

Retrieved on 2011-11-01. =Precursor to complex metal hydrides= LiH is not usually a hydride-reducing agent, except in the synthesis of hydrides of certain metalloids. For example, silane is produced in the reaction of lithium hydride and silicon tetrachloride by the Sundermeyer process: :4 LiH + SiCl4 → 4 LiCl + SiH4 Lithium hydride is used in the production of a variety of reagents for organic synthesis, such as lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) and lithium borohydride (LiBH4). Triethylborane reacts to give superhydride (LiBHEt3).Peter Rittmeyer, Ulrich Wietelmann \\"Hydrides\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. =In nuclear chemistry and physics= Lithium hydride (LiH) is sometimes a desirable material for the shielding of nuclear reactors, with the isotope lithium-7 (Li-7), and it can be fabricated by casting. Lithium deuteride Lithium deuteride, in the form of lithium-7 deuteride, is a good moderator for nuclear reactors, because deuterium (2H) has a lower neutron absorption cross-section than ordinary hydrogen (1H) does, and the cross- section for 7Li is also low, decreasing the absorption of neutrons in a reactor. 7Li is preferred for a moderator because it has a lower neutron capture cross-section, and it also forms less tritium (3H) under bombardment with neutrons. The corresponding lithium-6 deuteride, 6Li2H, or 6LiD, is the primary fusion fuel in thermonuclear weapons. In hydrogen warheads of the Teller–Ulam design, a nuclear fission trigger explodes to heat and compress the lithium-6 deuteride, and to bombard the 6LiD with neutrons to produce 3H (tritium) in an exothermic reaction: 6Li2H + n → 4He + 3H. The deuterium and tritium then fuse to produce helium, one neutron, and 17.59 MeV of free energy in the form of gamma rays, kinetic energy, etc. The helium is an inert byproduct. Before the Castle Bravo nuclear weapons test in 1954, it was thought that only the less common isotope 6Li would breed tritium when struck with fast neutrons. The Castle Bravo test showed (accidentally) that the more plentiful 7Li also does so under extreme conditions, albeit by an endothermic reaction. Safety LiH reacts violently with water to give hydrogen gas and LiOH, which is caustic. Consequently, LiH dust can explode in humid air, or even in dry air due to static electricity. At concentrations of in air the dust is extremely irritating to the mucous membranes and skin and may cause an allergic reaction. Because of the irritation, LiH is normally rejected rather than accumulated by the body. Some lithium salts, which can be produced in LiH reactions, are toxic. LiH fire should not be extinguished using carbon dioxide, carbon tetrachloride, or aqueous fire extinguishers; they should be smothered by covering with a metal object or graphite or dolomite powder. Sand is less suitable, as it can explode when mixed with burning LiH, especially if not dry. LiH is normally transported in oil, using containers made of ceramic, certain plastics or steel, and is handled in an atmosphere of dry argon or helium. Nitrogen can be used, but not at elevated temperatures, as it reacts with lithium. LiH normally contains some metallic lithium, which corrodes steel or silica containers at elevated temperatures.

Printed under the direction of the Ossianic Society Council, 1860. Page 278 (),Placenames NI is a small mountain in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It lies a few miles east of Ballymena, in the townland of Carnstroan. Tradition holds that Saint Patrick, enslaved as a youth, was brought to this area and tended sheep herds on Slemish, and that during this time he found God. Slemish is the remains of the plug of an extinct volcano. The plug is made of olivine dolerite and was formed during the Palaeogene period of the Earth's geological history. Its distinctive appearance —its upper reaches are very steep and rugged, in contrast to the tidy fields on its lower westward-facing slopes and the relatively flat bogland to the east— causes it to dominate the landscape for miles around. Slemish is within an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and, therefore, helps to protect and manage the fragile animal and plant communities that inhabit its slopes. An ideal location for bird watchers, large black ravens, buzzards, wheatears and meadow pipits can be seen regularly.  History  Slemish Mountain is the legendary first known Irish home of Saint Patrick. According to legend, following his capture and being brought to Ireland as a slave, Patrick worked as a shepherd at Slemish Mountain for about six years, from ages 16 to 22, for a man named Milchu (or Miluic). It was during this time that Patrick turned to frequent prayer as his only consolation in his loneliness. In a vision he was encouraged to escape and return home. He did this, then became a priest and returned to Ireland, allegedly to convert his old master. The legend goes that his own real conversion took place while on Slemish out in all weathers, communing with nature and praying continuously. As Patrick was not the first Christian Bishop to visit Ireland, his ministry was confined to the North. Here he established churches and an episcopal system. One such church is thought to have been founded at the nearby site of Skerry Churchyard. In later times, Slemish was the site of a United Irish camp during the 1798 rebellion in County Antrim. Activities Slemish Mountain is open year-round, and on Saint Patrick's Day (17 March) large crowds walk to the top of the mountain as a pilgrimage. The one and a half kilometre round walk to the summit and back takes approximately one hour in good weather. Excellent views can be had of the Antrim and Scottish coasts to the east. Ballymena town, Lough Neagh and the Sperrin Mountains are all normally visible to the west whilst the Bann Valley and the higher summits of the Antrim Hills can be seen to the North. The 180 metre climb is steep and rocky. There is a parking facility with interpretation boards and washrooms on site.  Literature  Slemish features in Dennis Kennedy's book Climbing Slemish. The book chronicles the history of a family over a whole century of Northern Irish life. Annalistic references See Annals of Inisfallen (AI) * AI777.1 Kl.

The successors of Sweeney's Bombers, the gang was formed by Joseph Sangerman in the early-1920s, shortly after the arrests of the Sweeney gang in 1921. Hired out primarily by Chicago politicians and organized crime groups (such as Al Capone's Chicago Outfit), the group was the first to use its services for labor unions. As an officer of the Chicago barbers union, as well as a leading manufacturer of barber supplies, Sangerman began using the gang to bomb barber shops which refused to agree to union regulations. With the gang's early success, Sangerman began accepting jobs from outside trade unions. By the time of Sangerman's arrest in 1925, the gang, by Sangerman's own admission, included a well-organized group of six members which was hired from $50 to $700. George Matrisciano, a leading member of the gang, was considered one of the best bomb makers in Chicago history. After receiving several indictments against him as a result of Sangerman's arrest, Matrisciano was killed before his testimony. A later investigation by the Illinois Crime Survey suspected several members of the barbers union; however, no charges were filed. Another famous member of the Bombers was Cornelius \\"Con\\" Shea. The gang dissolved shortly afterward the indictment of Sangerman (who died while still awaiting trial, on February 12, 1926, following emergency intestinal surgery), and Matrisciano's death. The use of bombings as a means of intimidation had become less favorable from the negative press coverage, specifically during the Aldermen's Wars of 1916-1921 and the 1928 Republican convention known as the \\"Pineapple Primary\\", drew too much attention and public outcry and by the end of the decade the Chicago underworld had returned to more discreet methods of intimidation.

The 508th is a parent regiment under the U.S. Army Regimental System, and two battalions from the regiment are currently active: the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment (1-508th PIR) is assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, and the 2nd Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment (2-508th PIR) is assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. The regiment served in combat during World War II, and regimental elements have served in combat in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Iraq and Afghanistan. History =World War II= The 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment was activated during World War II on 20 October 1942 at Camp Blanding, Florida. Lieutenant Colonel Roy E. Lindquist formed the unit and remained its commander throughout the war. After extensive training and maneuvers the 508th embarked on 19 December 1943 in New York City, New York and sailed on 28 December 1943 for Belfast, Northern Ireland, arriving there on 8 January 1944. After additional training at Cromore Estate in Portstewart, the regiment was moved by ship to Glasgow in Scotland and by train on 13 March 1944 to Wollaton Park in Nottinghamshire, England, where they became part of the veteran 82nd \\"All American\\" Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, which had seen distinguished service in Sicily and Italy. A sister unit, the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (later to become attached to the 17th Airborne Division), who were part of the 2nd Airborne Brigade with the 508th, were camped less than ten miles away at a former country hotel called Tollerton Hall, Nottinghamshire. During training in England Brigadier General James M. Gavin, the Assistant Division Commander (ADC), was particularly impressed with the regiment, noting that the 508th \\"looks as good as any new outfit that I have ever seen, if they cannot do it it cannot be done by green troops.\\"The Sword of St. Michael: The 82nd Airborne Division in World War II, p. 280 Memorial to fallen members of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment in Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England, where the regiment was based in 1944–1945. The 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment participated in Operation Overlord, jumping into Normandy at 2:15 a.m. on 6 June 1944. Their immediate objectives were to capture Sainte-Mère- Église, secure crossings at the Merderet River near La Fiere and Chef-du-Pont, and establish a defensive line north from Neuville-au-Plain to Breuzeville-au- Plain. There they were to tie in with the 502nd Parachute Infantry, of Major General Maxwell Taylor's 101st Airborne Division. Like most paratroop units involved in Overlord, the 508th were dropped in the wrong locations and had extraordinary difficulty linking up with each other. During the assault on June 6, a platoon leader of the 508th, First Lieutenant Robert Mathias, of Company E of the 2nd Battalion, was the first American officer killed by German fire on D-Day. Portions of the 508th regrouped and remained in contact with German forces until relieved on 7 July when they became the divisional reserve force. On 13 July, they were transported back to England in two LSTs and returned to their station at Wollaton Park. Of the 2,056 paratroopers of the regiment who participated in the D-Day landings, only 995 returned. The 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment had, by this time, suffered 1,061 casualties, out of an initial strength on D-Day of 2,056. Of those, 307 had been killed in action, including the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Herbert F. Batchellor, the highest-ranking officer to lose his life in the regiment. For its gallantry and combat action during the first three days of fighting, the unit was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation (later re-designated the Presidential Unit Citation), quoted in part below: After their success in Normandy, the 508th PIR returned to its billet at Wollaton Park and prepared for its part in Operation Market Garden, jumping on 17 September 1944. The regiment established and maintained a defensive position over in length, with German troops on three sides of their position. They seized a key bridge and prevented its destruction. Other units prevented the demolition of the Waal river Bridge at Nijmegen. The regiment additionally seized, occupied, organized, and defended the Berg en Dal hill mass, terrain which controlled the Groesbeek-Nijmegen area. They cut Highway K, preventing the movement of enemy reserves, or escape of enemy along this important international route. After being relieved in the Netherlands, they continued fighting the Germans in the longest-running battle on German soil ever fought by the U.S. Army, then crossed the border into Belgium. Men of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment during Operation Market Garden, 17 September 1944. The 508th later played a major part in the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, during which they screened the withdrawal of some 20,000 troops from St. Vith and defended their positions against the German Panzer divisions. They also participated in the assault led by the 2nd Ranger Battalion to capture Hill 400. The regiment saw little further service in the war and in April 1945 were detached from command of the 82nd Airborne Division, coming under direct control of the First Allied Airborne Army. Lindquist, now a full colonel, relinquished command of the regiment to Lieutenant Colonel Otho Holmes in December 1945. The 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment returned to the United States soon after, settling at Camp Milner, New Jersey and was inactivated on 25 November 1946. Individual awards The following awards were received by individuals. *Medal of Honor:1 (First Sergeant Leonard A. Funk, Jr.) *Distinguished Service Cross:14 *Silver Star:111 *Bronze Star:341 *Legion of Merit:3 *Soldier's Medal:7 = Cold War = The 508th was reactivated as the separate 508th Airborne Regimental Combat Team 1951 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, served in Japan, and later moved to Fort Campbell where it once again inactivated in March 1957 as part of the reactivation of the 101st Airborne Division as a combat unit. When the Army abandoned the Pentomic battle group structure in the early 1960s, the 508th reorganized under the Combat Arms Regimental System as a parent regiment and at the same time was renamed the 508th Infantry. Within the 82d Airborne Division, the former Company A, 508th PIR was reorganized and re-designated as HHC, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry, an element of the 3d Brigade. The former Company B, 508th PIR was reactivated as HHC, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry, part of the 1st Brigade. The 1st and 2d Battalions, 508th Infantry continued to serve in the 82d Airborne Division. They served in Operation Powerpack in the Dominican Republic in 1965 and 1966. When the 3d Brigade was sent to Vietnam in response to the Tet Offensive in early 1968, 1-508th accompanied it. There it took part of the heavy fighting of Huế and the Tet counteroffensives. It was later awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. From 8 August 1962 to 26 June 1968, the lineage of Co C, 508 PIR was reactivated as HHC, 3-508th INF, and the unit served as an airborne battalion within the 193d Infantry Brigade in Panama. When the Airborne component of the battalion was reduced to a single company (Co A), the battalion was reflagged as the 3d Battalion, 5th Infantry. In 1983 both battalions served in the Operation Urgent Fury with the invasion of Grenada. The colors of 1st Battalion, 508th and 2d Battalion, 508th Infantry departed the 82d Airborne Division during an Army-wide reflagging of combat units in the 1980s, leaving the division with battalions of the 325th, 504th, and 505th within the 2d, 1st and 3d Brigades, respectively. =Operation Just Cause= The 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry was activated as part of the 193rd Infantry Brigade from 1987 to 1995 at Fort Kobbe, Panama. The 1st Battalion fought during Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama. It was inactivated with the parent 193rd Infantry Brigade as US forces departed Panama in 1995. During Operation Just Cause, HHC, A Company, and B Company, were assigned to secure and hold Fort Amador. Company C was given a separate assignment, to secure and hold La Commandancia alongside elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment. During the battle for La Commandancia, Company C incurred the battalion's only Killed in Action (KIA) for the battalion: Private First Class Vance Coats and Sergeant Mike DeBlois. =Kosovo peacekeeping= The colors of 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry were reactivated in 1996 in Vicenza, Italy, by reflagging the existing 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry, an airborne battalion combat team, and was expanded in June 2000 to become the reactivated 173rd Airborne Brigade. The battalion had elements training all over Europe and participated in the Kosovo peacekeeping mission from 1996 to 2006. =Invasion of Iraq (\\"Operation Northern Delay\\")= U.S. Army paratroopers prepare to board a C-17 Globemaster III into the Kurdish-controlled area of northern Iraq. This was the first combat insertion of paratroopers using a C-17. On March 26, 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted the 44th combat jump in US history, dropping 965 paratroopers into northern Iraq to secure a lodgement at Bashur during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The 173rd was originally to be attached to the 4th Infantry Division but when Turkey refused the US permission to move the 4th Infantry Division through its territory, U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) ordered the 173rd to plan an airborne operation into Iraq. Without the 4th Infantry Division, Special Operations Forces (SOF) troops would be fully responsible for securing northern Iraq until conventional forces could fight their way up north from Kuwait. The 173rd Airborne Brigade became subordinate to the Joint Special Operations Task Force-North (JSOTF-North) which marked the first in the integration of special and conventional forces during OIF. As the brigade prepared to jump, a small drop zone support team of Army and Air Force personnel moved forward separately to link up with SOF soldiers already on the ground in the vicinity of Bashur along with elements of the 74th Long Range Surveillance Detachment (LRSD) and Air Force tactical air controller in Constanta, Romania. At 8:00 PM local time on March 26, 2003, five C-17s dropped 10 heavy drop platforms of vehicles and equipment. At 8:10 PM, 964 soldiers, including the brigade commander, Colonel William Mayville exited in 58 seconds. Only 32 jumpers did not make it out of the aircraft. The bulk of the airborne force came from the 1-508th Infantry Battalion (Airborne), led by Lieutenant Colonel Harry D. Tunnell, and the 2-503 Infantry Battalion (Airborne), led by Lieutenant Colonel Dominic Caraccilo. The 1-508 main effort had the mission to secure the southeast side of the Bashur Airfield and prepare the runway to receive C-17s within 6 hours of landing. The 2-503 would secure the northeast side of the objective. The remainder of the brigade combat team (BCT) included field artillery, Battery D, 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment, combat engineers, Stinger air defenders, from 173rd Combat Support Company (CSC), 74th LRSD, medics from the 401st Forward Support Company (FSC), a surgical team from the 250th Medical Detachment (Forward Surgical Team), Operational Detachment Alpha (-), 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, a public affairs officer on loan from the JSOTF-North, and U.S. Air Force airmen from the 86th Expeditionary Contingency Response Group and 4th Air Support Operations Squadron (-) (ASOS). 19 soldiers were injured during the jump, with four requiring evacuation back to Italy due to broken bones and joint dislocations. With the ground and airfield secured, the rest of the brigade closed quickly. In the days following the jump, 12 C-17s landed per day, bringing in another 1,200 soldiers and vehicles from the brigade's assigned and attached units. Within 96-hours, 2,160 soldiers and 381 pieces of equipment was moved from Aviano Air Base, Italy to Bashur Airfield, Iraq, led by the 62nd and 446th Airlift Wings from McChord Air Force Base, Washington and 437th Airlift Wing and 315th Reserve Airlift Wing from Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina. Task Force 1-63 Armor flew in on additional 27 C-17 sorties. Although the 173rd played a crucial strategic role by establishing a significant conventional presence in northern Iraq, it did not engage in significant combat operations prior to the end of major combat operations. The brigade first saw action when it moved on Kirkuk on April 10, 2003, following the JSOTF-North's successful efforts to evict the Iraqi Republican Guard and Regular Army from the city. Once in Kirkuk, the 173rd was vital in establishing a secure environment for follow-on stability operations. =Operation Enduring Freedom= In 2005-2006 the 1st Battalion, as part of the 173d Airborne Brigade, deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. As part of Task Force Fury, they were deployed to the border on Pakistan in RC East where it served under the Command of Joint Task Force Devil (1st Brigade, 82d Airborne Division) at Orgun-E.

In January 2006, the colors of both the 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment, were reactivated as infantry battalions in the newly activated 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. In January 2007, 1-508th, 2-508th, 4-73rd Cavalry (the 4th Brigade's Reconnaissance Squadron), 2-321 Field Artillery, and the 782nd Brigade Support Battalion deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In August 2009, the brigade returned to Afghanistan to support Operation Enduring Freedom, and 2-508 was sent to replace 1-17th Infantry Regiment after 1-17th encountered heavy losses due to large IED strikes and small arms encounters. / 5th SBCT/ 2ID in the Arghandab River Valley. After a year long deployment, each company from 2-508 was then replaced by battalions from the 101st Airborne division as well as elements from 4th Infantry Division's 1-12 Infantry Regiment. The Brigade returned to RC South (Zharay and Maywand) in 2012. As part of Army-wide reductions and reorganizations, the 4th BCT was inactivated on 16 May 2014.

It is Ireland's largest shopping centre with over 169 tenants, almost of floor space, and over 3,400 car parking spaces. It is located just south of the village centre of Dundrum. History Dundrum Town Centre was built on the site of the former Pye television factory, later the site of an entertainment and bowling centre called Dundrum Bowl. In 1993, the Dundrum Bowl was closed due to flooding. The shopping centre was opened on 3 March 2005. Over 5,000 people queued in the main square. Within 3 years, over 70 million people visited Dundrum Town Centre. The centre has been extended in phases and is divided into various districts. It is divided into areas its management labels \\"districts\\" - the \\"Gallery\\", located in the main building, \\"Pembroke\\", around the Mill Pond feature, and \\"Dundrum South\\", located outside the main Tesco overground car park. In July 2016, the UK commercial property firm Hammerson bought control of Dundrum from Allianz for a reported £1.01 billion, and will own it jointly with Allianz Real Estate. = 2011 flood = Dundrum Town Centre was evacuated shortly before 8pm on 24 October 2011 after floodwaters surged through the doors. The owner of a Mexican restaurant in the complex said five feet of water had rushed down steps towards his business, causing thousands of euro worth of damage. Name \\"Dundrum Town Centre\\" was originally a local government term, defined by Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, before the shopping centre was built. It was described as \\"the area between the Luas line, the Dundrum Relief Road, the Taney Road / Upper Churchtown Road junction, and the Wyckham By-Pass Route. It is mainly zoned for \\"town centre\\" uses, but with some parts zoned residential.\\" The shopping centre was built under the provisions of the Urban Structure Plan for the Dundrum Town Centre zone. The name Dundrum Shopping Centre referred to an older, smaller, shopping centre off Main Street in Dundrum, which is still open, and home to Lidl, Dealz, Mulveys of Dundrum. Following many years of decay, efforts have been made to revamp this area and it is now known as Dundrum Village Centre.  Tenants Dundrum Town Centre contains a range of retail, restaurant and entertainment tenants. Retail stores include Tesco Ireland, Marks and Spencer, H&M;, Next, Harvey Nichols, Gap, Hollister Co., Penney's, JD Sports and Zara. Restaurants include Siam Thai, Yo Kitchen, Eddie Rocket's, FIVE GUYS, Milano's, Nando's, TGI Fridays and Jamie's Italian. Entertainment includes a Movies@ cinema and Mill Theatre Dundrum. A temporary ice-skating rink is operational during some of the Winter months to host ‘Dundrum on Ice’, which starts in October. Public transport The centre is served by the Luas green line, the closest stop is Balally but it is also close to Dundrum stop. It is also served by Dublin Bus routes 14, 44, 44b and 75 Media RTÉ studio in Dundrum Town Centre Dublin South FM 93.9 is a local BAI-licensed community based radio station for South Dublin. It started broadcasting in 1995 from the old PYE centre, and also broadcast from Rathfarnham. It now broadcasts from purpose-built new studios in the Dundrum Town Centre. About 60 volunteers produce and broadcast 35 hours of programmes each week. Transitions students from local schools also get involved, as well as media students. Communicorp also have a studio in Dundrum Town Centre with 98fm, SPIN 1038, NewsTalk and Today FM regularly broadcasting from it. Today FM's Phil Cawley presents a show from the centre every Sunday from 1-4. An in- house television channel, \\"Dundrum Television\\", was launched by RTÉ in 2005, and used to broadcast advertising and other programming. Interior of Dundrum Town Centre Awards In 2011, Dundrum Town Centre was awarded the county's first Ecocert certification. By the end of 2009, Dundrum Town Centre had won 30 national and international awards since opening. In 2009, Dundrum Town Centre was awarded \\"Shopping Centre of the Year\\" for the third year running at the FBD Retail Excellence Awards, as voted by shopping centre retailers throughout Ireland. On 27 April 2007, Dundrum Town Centre was named as the ICSC (International Council of Shopping Centres) European Shopping Centre of the year for 2007 at their European conference in Warsaw. Shopping Centres throughout Europe were visited and judged as part of a rigorous adjudication system, which had as its criteria: Tenant Mix, Community Integration, Vision, Customer Service Ethos, Management Systems and Sustainability. From an initial list of 24, a short list of 3 was made, from which Dundrum was chosen.

He was born in 1394 as the son of the Marquis della Chiesa in San Germano. He was well- educated due to being a noble and demonstrated a keen taste for the religious life and devoted himself to the service of God; he grew up with the hopes of becoming a religious himself. His distinguished father opposed this desire which later led to his son breaking off all links to his parents. At the age of 20 – despite the protests of his parents – he became a member of the Order of Preachers in Vercelli and soon gained great recognition as an apt preacher and confessor. He accompanied Saint Bernardine of Siena on a range of missions and served in various capacities in the Dominican monasteries. Among those positions was that of the prior and he served at the friaries of Como and Florence as well as in Savona and Bologna. In Como he reformed the life and morals of the town and was sent to govern other friaries following this success. It was at those friaries that he insisted on a rigorous observance to their rule of life according to Saint Dominic. He was also one of the leaders opposing the last of the antipopes: Felix V who troubled the Roman Catholic Church from 1440 until 1449. Felix V had a large support network stemming from Switzerland and della Chiesa opposed the work of the antipope. He managed to succeed in winning over a large number of the antipope's adherents to the lawful power of the true pontiff: Pope Eugene IV and later Pope Nicholas V. While on a trip from Savona to Genoa, pirates captured him, though della Chiesa was released unharmed. He had been apprehended with a fellow friar and the pirates released the pair after being so impressed with the demeanor of the two religious. He was a known miracle worker and was said to be able to read the consciences of men and women alike. He died in 1459 and was able to predict the date of his death. His relics were translated on 28 July 1810 to his birthplace. Pope Pius VII affirmed his cultus and beatified della Chiesa on 15 May 1819, while setting his liturgical feast for 28 July – the date of the translation of his relics. He is an ancestor of Giacomo della Chiesa – the future Pope Benedict XV (1854–1922) who reigned during World War I centuries after Antonio's own life.

Its annual monetary value is approximately equal to the netted sum of six flows of income generated by production: *wages and salaries of employees. *profit including distributed and undistributed profit. *interest paid by producing enterprises from current gross income *rent paid by producing enterprises from current gross income, including land rents. *tax on the production of new value, including income tax and indirect tax on producers. *fees paid by producing enterprises from current gross income, including: royalties, certain honorariums and corporate officers' fees, various insurance charges, and certain leasing fees incurred in production and paid from current gross income. The last five money-incomes are components of realized surplus value. In principle, the value product also includes unsold inventories of new outputs. Marx's concept corresponds roughly with the concept of value added in national accounts, with some important differences (see below) and with the provision that it applies only to the net output of capitalist production, not to the valuation of all production in a society, part of which may of course not be commercial production at all. Definition The concept is formulated more precisely when Marx considers the reproduction and distribution of the national income (see e.g. his manuscript called \\"Results of the Immediate [or Direct] Process of Production\\", available in English in the Pelican edition of Das Kapital), and also online; and the last chapters of Das Kapital Volume 3). Marx wrote this in 1864, i.e. about 70 years or so before the first comprehensive Gross National Product and Capital Formation statistics were pioneered by the likes of Wassily Leontief, Richard Stone, Simon Kuznets and Colin Clark (the United Nations standard accounting system was first finalised in 1953). Marx's manuscript for Das Kapital Vol. 3 ends with a discussion of \\"relations of distribution\\", but he did not live to complete his analysis. In outline his approach is quite clear however. Marx called gross output (or the total value of output sales) the \\"value of production\\" (\\"VPn\\"). If variable capital paid = V, circulating constant capital consumed = C_c, fixed capital consumed = C_f, and surplus value produced = S, then: :VP_n = C_c+C_f+V+S = Gross Output and :VP = V+S = true new value added So, Marx's \\"value product\\" really expressed his view of the true total new value added or the net product. In his view, this total is equal to the value of wage payments + surplus value, the latter which would include, apart from net profit, interest and rent, the net tax levy and royalty-type fees paid in respect of incomes generated by production of output, plus the surplus-value component of unsold inventories of new output. Marx himself never discussed taxation and royalty-income in detail; they were only a small portion of the total national income when he lived (around 5-10% or so). An additional comment by Marx Marx claims that, in an accounting period, the workforce in the capitalist sector normally produces a new value which is equal to its own wage-cost, plus an additional new value (called surplus value). However, Marx warns that: For this reason, Marx criticized ratios such as the share of profits and wages (wage share) in the gross or net product as deceptive, because they disguised the real capitalist relations of production, specifically the rate of surplus value. His primary interest was in the ratio between generic profits and wages (the rate of exploitation). Marxian new value added, versus GDP The equation of new value added with net output or GDP (also known as gross value added) would have made no sense to Marx, mainly because net output includes depreciation (or the consumption of fixed capital), yet excludes various property rents paid by producing enterprises from their gross income (on the ground that renting out an asset does not itself constitute production) as well as a portion of net interest (regarded as property income). As regards depreciation, for Marx the value of real depreciation at least did not constitute any new value, but, value conserved and transferred to the new products by living labor. It appeared as added value, only because when costs are deducted from gross sales income to obtain net profit, depreciation is regarded as a component of the new gross profit income. In official national accounts, a distinction is made between gross value added (including depreciation charges) and net value added (excluding them). Of course, in reality it could be that real (\\"economic\\") depreciation diverges from depreciation for tax purposes. In that case, the reported consumption of fixed capital could contain an element of undistributed profit. Additionally, official national accounts may include in consumption of fixed capital the value of those insurance premiums, interest and rents paid from gross income, which relate directly to the acquisition or maintenance of productive fixed assets, on the ground that they are part of the cost of operating productive fixed assets. In Marxian economics, however, these flows would be regarded either as a faux frais of production, a circulating constant capital outlay, or an element of gross surplus value. By contrast, Marx considered rents paid by producing enterprises from their gross income as a part of surplus value, and as an integral part of the cost structure of the social product. Business rents, excluded as intermediate expenditures from GDP, therefore are included in the Marxian value product as a component of surplus value. From a Marxian point of view, official value added also includes some dubious components such as the rental value of owner-occupied housing. This entry is the market rent of owner-occupied housing that would apply if the housing was rented, treated as a \\"service\\". But most of it does not refer to any real flow of income, nor is it clear that this component has anything to do with production. As regards net interest, the official product accounts will exclude a portion of it, insofar as it is defined as property income unrelated to the value of production. But if it is paid from current gross revenues of producing enterprises, then it should be included in the Marxian value product. For this reason, the Marxian net interest aggregate is likely to be larger than the official one. Criticism and controversy Marx's idea of value creation and value product makes little sense from the point of view of the theory of factors of production and production functions. Marx himself already anticipated this, in chapter 48 of Capital Vol. 3, titled \\"The Trinity Formula\\" where he discusses the view that land, labour and capital (which he sarcastically calls the \\"holy trinity\\" of political economy) all create a new value equal to factor income (Marx regarded human labour and land as the mainsprings of material wealth, but he considered value as a purely social attribution referring to labor-content). In modern macroeconomics, the controversy surfaces again, and is discussed in amusing essays by Prof. Anwar Shaikh (see references). In Marxian social accounting, one theoretical controversy concerns the treatment of the wages of so-called productive and unproductive labour. Unproductive labour by definition does not make net additions to the new value product, but only transfers value from other sectors on the basis that it reduces the costs of capitalist production. Depending on how the gross and net product are defined, the value of these wages could be accounted for either as a component of surplus value, or as a circulating constant capital outlay, or be excluded from the value product altogether. Different interpretations are offered by Shane Mage, Murray Smith, Anwar Shaikh and Fred Moseley. One aspect often overlooked in this controversy is that wages costs and labour costs are not the same thing. Employers and employees must also pay social insurance levies of various types, and there may be other imposts on wages; also, the buying power of wages is reduced by indirect tax imposts and profit imposts. This affects the magnitude of a society's variable capital and the value of labour power. Another Marxian accounting controversy, less discussed, concerns which net tax receipts of government constitute part of the new value product. Obviously taxes included in official gross product measures do not equal the net total tax take, because some taxes are unrelated to production and therefore excluded. The Marxian critique of public finance appears to be rather undeveloped as yet, however. In principle, net tax levied on current production and paid out of current gross revenues would be included in the value product. Least discussed is the problem of finding a non-arbitrary, rigorous distinction between value created and value transferred in respect of services. The conceptual problem here is essentially that it may be difficult to specify unambiguously what the nature and function of the \\"product\\" sold is, when services are rendered. Some Marxists have argued however that Marx's value relations and value aggregates cannot be measured at all, and at best only experienced. That was manifestly not Marx's view; already in his Grundrisse manuscript he had referred to a balance sheet cited by Malthus; in Das Kapital he attempted to calculate the rate of surplus value according to data provided by Frederick Engels; and towards the end of his life, as Leontief noted, he wrote that he wanted to study the \\"ups and downs\\" of economic activity mathematically (but Samuel Moore convinced him that the data to do it did not exist yet). Engels later remarked that the problem really was that much data relevant to testing Marx's concepts simply was not available. Subsequent Marxian scholars have argued the critique of political economy should continue, with regard to the new economic concepts and theories, rather than stop at the point where the ink dried on the last sheet of paper that Marx wrote on. One reason is that the new concepts and theories might distort the representation of economic reality, just as much as the old ones that Marx criticized. In the USSR and other Soviet-type societies, Marx's social accounting approach strongly influenced the Material Product System (MPS), a social accounting method alternative to GDP accounts, which distinguished sharply between \\"productive\\" and \\"non- productive\\" sectors of the economy. These accounts focused on balances of the value of material goods produced. In some respects, this is ironic, since Marx's social accounting referred to the capitalist economy, not to a socialist economy. The MPS accounts were abandoned in favour of GDP accounts after the downfall of official communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe, although they are still compiled as parallel accounts in North Korea and Cuba.

A grandson of Brian Bóruma, Toirdelbach was the son of Tadc mac Briain who was killed in 1023 by his half-brother Donnchad mac Briain. For the first forty years of his life nothing is known of Toirdelbach. It was not until the 1050s that he found allies in Connacht and in Leinster, particularly the powerful King of Leinster Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, who would aid his claims to be ruler of Munster. It took perhaps ten years of sustained attack to remove his uncle Donnchad from power, and send him into exile, and to place Toirdelbach in power in Munster as Diarmait's faithful ally. On Diarmait's death Toirdelbach took over the reins of power, establishing himself as ruler of more than half of Ireland. While not a great military leader, he was a capable politician whose influence extended as far north as Ulaid and who made and unmade Kings of Connacht. He died after more than two decades in power, following a lengthy illness, still in control of events. Both his son, Muirchertach Ua Briain, and grandson, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, would go on to be influential Irish kings. Family quarrels Toirdelbach was the son of Tadc mac Briain, son of Brian Bóruma, and Mór, daughter of Gilla Brigte Ua Maíl Muaid of Cenél Fiachach.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\". His father was killed in 1023, probably on the orders of his half-brother Donnchad mac Briain who thereby made himself king of Munster.Bracken, \\"Donnchad\\"; Annals of Innisfallen AI 1023.3; Annals of Loch Cé, ALC 1023.4; Chronicon Scotorum, CS 1023. Donnchad, while he successfully retained control of Munster for four decades, was never able to achieve the same success as Brian. Epigraphic evidence shows that he aimed to be king of Ireland, and perhaps considered himself to be such, but the annalists and later historians recognised no such pretensions.Bracken, \\"Donnchad\\". As for Toirdelbach, the annals record nothing of him until the 1050s, at which time he was seeking, and finding, outside assistance against his uncle. Donnchad's main rivals were Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster from 1042, and Áed in Gaí Bernaig, King of Connacht from 1046. Diarmait in particular was a serious threat; allied with Niall mac Eochada, King of Ulster, he installed his son Murchad as ruler of Dublin in 1052, driving out Donnchad's brother-in-law and ally Echmarcach mac Ragnaill. From the beginning of the 1050s onwards, Donnchad came under sustained attack from both Áed and Diarmait. Toirdelbach first joined with Áed in the early 1050s, raiding into Tuadmumu in 1052 and inflicting a heavy defeat on Donnchad's son Murchad in Corco Mruad, the north-west of modern County Clare in 1055. By 1058 Toirdelbach had gained Diarmait's support, for he was present when Diarmait, the Leinstermen and the Osraige drove Donnchad from Limerick, which he burned so that it would not fall into the hands of his enemies, and defeated him at Sliabh gCrot in the Galtee Mountains.Bracken, \\"Donnchad\\"; Hudson, \\"Diarmait\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1051.7, AI 1053.2, AI 1055.3, AI 1057.5 & AI 1058.4; Annals of Loch Cé, ALC 1052.1, ALC 1055.3 & ALC 1058.3. Bracken suggests that \\"it is likely that [the] concerted attacks on Munster about 1054 were the result of Toirdelbach Ua Briain's intrigues\\". In 1060 Donnchad attempted to divide his enemies by submitting to Áed.Bracken, \\"Donnchad\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1059.7. This was unsuccessful as Áed attacked again in 1061, razing the Dál gCais fortress at Kincora and burning their church at Killaloe.Bracken, \\"Donnchad\\"; Annals of Loch Cé, ALC 1061.5; Annals of Ulster, AU 1061.5. Injury was added to insult when Diarmait brought an army, and Toirdelbach in his train, to Munster in 1062. Donnchad's son Murchad led the unsuccessful resistance, and even when Diarmait returned to Leinster, Toirdelbach defeated his kinsmen. By 1063, Donnchad was beaten. Deposed, he went on pilgrimage to Rome where he died the following year. Diarmait installed Toirdelbach as a puppet king in Munster.Bracken, \\"Donnchad\\"; Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Hudson, \\"Diarmait\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1063.6 & 1064.5; Annals of Loch Cé, ALC 1064.3; Annals of Ulster, AU 1064.4. Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó Following Donnchad's deposition, Toirdelbach was one of Diarmait's key allies, particularly in Diarmait's final years when his authority was challenged within Leinster. In 1066 Diarmait and Toirdelbach each paid 30 ounces of gold to the king of Ciarraige Luachra of West Munster for his help in assassinating their enemies. In 1067 they campaigned together to defeat and kill the king of Ciarraige Luachra.Chronicon Scotorum, CS 1066; Hudson, \\"Diarmait\\". Toirdelbach's nephew Murchad son of Donnchad was killed in 1068 while raiding in the midlands.Amnals of Innisfallen, AI 1068.2; Annals of Ulster, AU 1068.3. The Annals of Innisfallen record to Toirdelbach as a lawmaker, reporting that in 1068: \\"A law and ordinance was made by Tairdelbach Ua Briain-and no better law was enacted in Mumu for a long time—with the result that neither cow nor horse was housed [at night] but allowed to wander at will.\\"Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1068.4. In the same year, and perhaps related to this law-making, Máel Ísu mac Amalgada, comarba Pátraic or abbot of Armagh and successor of Saint Patrick, visited Munster for the first time and received \\"his full visitation, both in tribute and offerings\\".Annals of Ulster, AU 1068.2. Toirdelbach's ally and protector Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó faced increasing difficulties in his final years, difficulties which led Toirdelbach to intervene on Diarmait's behalf against his enemies in Leinster. Diarmait's sons Murchad and Glúniairn died in 1070, leaving the succession uncertain and disputed.Hudson, \\"Diarmait\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1070.2 & AI 1070.3; Annals of Ulster, AU 1070.2 & AU 1070.12. Later in 1070 Toirdelbach took an army into Leinster, carrying off hostages, and receiving the submission of the king of Osraige.Hudson, \\"Diarmait\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1070.8 & AI 1070.9. Toirdelbach had to return to Leinster again in 1071 open warfare broke out between Diarmait's grandson Domnall, Murchad's son, and his nephew Donnchad, son of Domnall Remair. The annal states that the hostages Toirdelbach took were handed over into the keeping of Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó.Hudson, \\"Diarmait\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1071.2 & AI 1071.3. Toirdelbach was not idle on his own account in these years. He led an army on a raid into the midlands in 1071, and had his soldiers build wooden bridges across the Shannon, evidently for military purposes, at Áth Caille (perhaps modern O'Briensbridge) and Killaloe.Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1071.5 & 1071.7. Diarmait visited Munster in 1071, distributing gifts. Diarmait had earlier given Toirdelbach treasures which included Brian Bóruma's sword, and \\"the standard of the king of the Saxons\\". This was among Diarmait's last recorded acts before his death in battle on 7 February 1072.Hudson, \\"Diarmait\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1068.5 & AI 1071.6. Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, p. 277, presumes that Brian's sword was that which had been recovered from the battlefield at Clontarf and that the standard was a Welsh one taken by Harold Godwinson in his campaigns for King Edward the Confessor; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 157, suggests it may have been King Edward's own standard. At any event, the standard is presumed to have been brought to Ireland by the exiled sons of Harold. Toirdelbach was the chief beneficiary of Diarmait's death, the Annals of Innisfallen recording that: > Toirdelbach Ua Briain went to Osraige and Leinster, burned Uí Cheinnselaig > and brought away much booty and cows, and took hostages from it as well as > from Leinster. And the foreigners gave him the kingship of Dublin, and he > made prisoner the sons of Domnall, son of Máel na mBó, in Dublin, and > brought back the hostages of Osraige on that occasion.Annals of Innisfallen, > AI 1072.4, similarly AI 1072.6. Conchobar Ua Máel Shechnaill, king of Mide, was murdered the next year, and Toirdelbach took advantage of this to ravage the midlands, followed by an expedition to Connacht where he obtained hostages from both the Uí Conchobair and the Uí Ruairc.Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1073.2, AI 1073.3 & 1073.4; Annals of Loch Cé, ALC 1073.1 & ALC 1073.2; Annals of Ulster, AU 1073.2 & AU 1073.4. He divided Leinster between various rivals, a policy of divide and rule which would serve him well. In Dublin he installed one Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, perhaps a kinsman of Echmarcach, as his client king.Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, pp. 277-278; Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 162. A campaign in 1075 directed against the Uí Néill and their allies in the north turned out less well. Toirdelbach's son Muirchertach was defeated by the Airgíalla near Áth Fhirdia (modern Ardee, County Louth) with heavy loss.Annals of Ulster, AU 1075.2; Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\". At more or less the same time Gofraid was banished from Dublin by Toirdelbach, seemingly replaced by Domnall son of Murchad son of Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, who ruled for only a short time before he died, and was replaced by Toirdelbach's son Muirchertach. With Muirchertach securely installed in Dublin, and another son, Diarmait, ruling over Waterford, Toirdelbach was master of half of Ireland.Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1075.2, AI 1075.3 & AI 1075.4; Annals of Ulster, AU 1075.1 & AU 1075.4; Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 167. The wider world While Toirdelbach's son Diarmait, ruler of Waterford, raided Wales in 1080, in general Toirdelbach is seen as less interested in matters outwith Ireland than his protector Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, or his son Muirchertach.Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 176. It was during Gofraid's short reign over Dublin, on 6 May 1074, that Donatus, first archbishop of Dublin died. This led the archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc of Pavia, to take an interest in Irish matters. Lanfranc, basing himself, he said, on Bede's writings, had already assured Pope Alexander II that Dublin formed part of the province of Canterbury and that it was for him to consecrate the new bishop. He also wrote to the Irish kings concerned, being careful not to cause offence. His letter to Toirdelbach calls him \\"magnificent king of Ireland\\", a title which might seem the more impressive had Lanfranc not also addressed Gofraid of Dublin as \\"glorious king of Ireland\\".Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 162-163; Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\". The Annals of Innisfallen report that \\"five Jews came from over sea with gifts to Toirdelbach, and they were sent back again over sea\\".Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1079.3. The meaning and significance of this event is unclear. Hudson remarks that \\"[i]f the delegation wanted [Toirdelbach]'s approval for settling in Ireland they were disappointed\\". Bracken suggests that if this was the intention of the delegation, the otherwise astute Toirdelbach missed a significant opportunity to strengthen his position.Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 168; Bracken, \\"Toirdelach\\". Divide and rule Toirdelbach employed the policy of divide and rule to maintain control of Leinster and to prevent the emergence of a rival in Connacht. In the north, he supported the Ulaid to weaken the Cenél nEógain kings of Ailech. This policy was successful in keeping Leinster pacified, but was less successful in dealing with the Cenél nEógain of the north and the kings of Connacht in the west.Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, p. 278; Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\". For Ulster, see Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1078.5, the arrival of the deposed Donn Sléibe Ua hEochada at Toirdelbach's court, & AI 1081.5, Áed Meránach Ua hEochada's submission to Toirdelbach. The Cenél nEógain, who appear to have had no widely accepted candidates for the kingship, hit upon a candidate in the person of Conchobar Ua Briain, grandson of Toirdelbach's uncle Donnchad mac Briain and Toirdelbach's most obvious rival for the kingship of Munster. Conchobar was king for only a short time when he was murdered, along with his wife. His brother Cennétig was chosen to succeed him.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, 1078.3; Annals of Ulster AU 1078.3. In Connacht, three rival branches of the Uí Briúin, the Ua Conchobair, the Ua Flaithbertaig, and the Ua Ruairc, were in competition. Ruaidrí na Saide Buide of the Ua Conchobair was king of Connacht when he submitted to Toirdelbach in 1076. Toirdelbach deposed Ruaidrí in 1079 and replaced him with an Ua Ruairc, Áed son of Art Uallach.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Duffy, \\"Ruaidrí\\"; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1076.2; Annals of the Four Masters, AFM 1079.10. The Ua Ruairc proved to be a threat to Toirdelbach and to their neighbours. Máel Sechnaill, king of Mide, submitted to Toirdelbach in 1080, perhaps for fear of Ua Ruairc. War broke out in 1084 between Toirdelbach and the Ua Ruairc, joined by Cennétig Ua Briain. Toirdelbach raided Mide, but while he was absent the Conmaicne, clients of the Ua Ruairc, raided Munster. A battle was fought at Monecronock, near modern Leixlip, on 19 October 1082 where Toirdelbach's sons Muirchertach and Tadc won, killing Domnall Ua Ruairc and Cennétig Ua Briain.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, p. 278; Annals of the Four Masters, AFM 1084.8 & 1084.9; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1084.2; Annals of Loch Cé, ALC 1084.5 & 1084.6; Annals of Ulster, AU 1084.5 & AU 1084.6. Death Toirdelbach fell seriously ill in 1085 and lost his hair.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, p. 278. The Annals of the Four Masters, a late and not always reliable source, state that he had been ill for many years.Annals of the Four Masters, AFM 1086.9, states: \\"for he was not well since the head of Conchobar Ua Máel Shechnaill had been brought from Clonmacnoise\\", that is c. 1073. He may never have fully recovered from his earlier illness. The Annals of Ulster report that he \\"died in Kincora [near Killaloe] after great suffering and long repentance, and after receiving the Body of Christ and His Blood, on [14 July] in the seventy-seventh year of his age [1086]\\". Rarely given to over-praising southern kings, this northern annal calls him \\"king of Ireland\\". The Annals of Tigernach, another northern record, styles Toirdelbach rí urmóir Erenn, \\"king of the greater part of Ireland\\".Annals of Ulster, AU 1086.4; Annals of Tigernach, AT 1086.2. Marriages Toirdelbach was probably married three times. Dubchoblaig of the Uí Cheinnselaig, who died in 1088, was the mother of Diarmait, perhaps named for her kinsman and Toirdelbach's protector Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó. Derbforgaill of Osraige was the mother of Tadc and Muirchertach. No children of Gormlaith of Ua Fógarta are named and the mother of Toirdelbach's daughter Mór is not recorded.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; death of Gormlaith, Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1076.7; death of Derbforgaill, Annals of Tigernach, AT 1098.1. Mór married Ruaidrí na Saide Buide. Her son Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair was one of the greatest kings of medieval Ireland. She died in 1088, perhaps coincidentally the year in which a gloss to the Annals of Ulster records Toirdelbach's birth.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Duffy, \\"Ruaidrí\\"; Annals of Tigernach, AT 1088.3; Annals of Ulster, AU 1088.6. Toirdelbach apparently planned to divide his lands between his three sons. Tadc survived him by only weeks, dying of natural causes at Kincora, after which Muircheartach and Diarmait disputed the succession. Diarmait was the loser, banished by his half-brother, and exiled with his mother's kin in Leinster.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\"; Hudson, Viking Kings, p. 177; Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, pp. 2778-279; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 1086.7; Annals of Loch Cé, ALC 1086.3; Annals of Ulster, AU 1086.4.

A cladogram showing phylogenic relations of (23 analyzed) species in the genus Biomphalaria:, text.  Distribution  The origin of the genus Biomphalaria is American. The ancestor of Biomphalaria glabrata colonized Africa 2.3–4.5 or 2-5/ millions years ago and speciated into all the African Biomphalaria species. Natural populations of these snails are usually found in tropical standing water or freshwater in South America and Africa, but they also reach 30° latitude in subtropical areas. Many species of these red-blooded planorbid snails (Gastropoda: Basommatophora) are able to survive a long time when removed from their freshwater habitat. Of the 34 Biomphalaria species, 4 (Biomphalaria glabrata, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Biomphalaria straminea, and Biomphalaria tenagophila) have recently expanded their native ranges. They have been introduced to areas where other Biomphalaria species are endemic (e.g., Congo and Egypt) or to subtropical zones that have no frost period (Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Hong Kong). All species in the genus Biomphalaria except of native Biomphalaria obstructa has not yet become established in the US, but they are considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore, it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA.Cowie R. H., Dillon R. T., Robinson D. G. & Smith J. W. (2009). \\"Alien non-marine snails and slugs of priority quarantine importance in the United States: A preliminary risk assessment\\". American Malacological Bulletin 27: 113-132. PDF .  Parasites  This genus of snails is medically important, because the snails can carry a parasite of humans which represents a serious disease risk: the snails serve as an intermediate host (vector) for the human parasitic blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, that infects about 83 million people. The human disease schistosomiasis (aka snail fever) caused by all Schistosoma species (transmitted also by other snails) infects 200 million people.The Carter Center \\"Schistosomiasis Control Program\\". Accessed 20 November 2009. The fluke, which is found primarily in tropical areas, infects mammals (including humans) via contact with water that contains schistosome larvae (cercariae) which have previously been released from the snail. Infection occurs via penetration of cercariae through the skin. Eighteen species of Biomphalaria are intermediate hosts for Schistosoma mansoni; seven species of the genus have not been tested for this susceptibility and nine species are resistant. Altogether about 30 species of parasites from Africa and at least 20 species from the Neotropics are known to parasitize Biomphalaria.

Consisting of six cantos, each with an introductory epistle, and copious antiquarian notes, it concludes with the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Background The introductory epistle to the first canto of Marmion is internally dated November, and there is no reason to doubt that it was written in that month of 1806.Walter Scott, Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field, ed. Ainsley McIntosh (Edinburgh, 2018), 288. At this time Scott was entering into correspondence with the Durham antiquary Robert Surtees, and in December they discussed the account given by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie of the supernatural summons of James IV and several of his nobles to appear before Pluto which Scott uses in the fifth canto: Scott refers to his developing poem, so it is clear that the overall shape of the work was clear from the outset. Moreover, Surtees sent Scott two forgeries of his own, an account in Latin of a ghostly combat and a ballad, both of which also appear in the poem.The Letters of Sir Walter Scott: 1787‒1807, ed. H. J. C. Grierson (London, 1932), 341‒44 (17 December 1806). On 30 January 1807 Archibald Constable concluded an agreement to pay 1000 guineas (£1050) for the copyright: the sum may have originated with Scott in previous negotiations with Longman.McIntosh, op. cit., 292. William Miller and John Murray each agreed to take a 25% share in the project. Murray observed: \\"We both view it as honourable, profitable, and glorious to be concerned in the publication of a new poem by Walter Scott.\\" Scott said that he thoroughly enjoyed writing the work. He told his son-in-law, Lockhart: \\"Oh, man, I had many a grand gallop among these braes when I was thinking of Marmion.\\" The poem took much longer to compose than Scott had hoped: he was held up by personal and family difficulties and other occupations, and it was probably January 1808 before it was finished.McIntosh, op. cit., 293‒99. Editions Marmion was published in Edinburgh by Archibald Constable on 22 February 1808, and in London by William Miller and John Murray on 8 March. It cost one and a half guineas (£1 11s 6d or £1.57½), and 2000 copies were printed.William B. Todd and Ann Bowen, Sir Walter Scott: A Bibliographical History 1796‒1832 (New Castle, Delaware, 1998), 87. Scott produced small refinements for the text of the verse and larger updatings for the notes in the second edition and third editions (3000 copies each) published later in the year.McIntosh, op. cit., 314‒18. Many further editions followed, both individual and collected, and in 1830 Scott provided the poem with a new introduction.Ibid., 319. In 2018 Ainsley McIntosh produced a critical edition of Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field as the second volume (the first to appear) of The Edinburgh Edition of Walter Scott's Poetry, published by Edinburgh University Press. This takes the third edition as its copy-text and corrects it mainly from the manuscript and the first edition. Plot Detail of the painting Lady Clara de Clare, inspired by original poem Marmion (William D. Washington). The poem tells how Lord Marmion, a favourite of Henry VIII of England, lusts for Clara de Clare, a rich woman. He and his mistress, Constance De Beverley, forge a letter implicating Clare's fiancé, Sir Ralph De Wilton, in treason. Constance, a dishonest nun, hopes that her aid will restore her to favour with Marmion. When De Wilton loses the duel he claims in order to defend his honour against Marmion, he is obliged to go into exile. Clare retires to a convent rather than risk Marmion's attentions. Constance's hopes of a reconciliation with Marmion are dashed when he abandons her; she ends up being walled up alive in the Lindisfarne convent for breaking her vows. She takes her revenge by giving the Abbess, who is one of her three judges, documents that prove De Wilton's innocence. De Wilton, having returned disguised as a pilgrim, follows Marmion to Edinburgh where he meets the Abbess, who gives him the exonerating documents. When Marmion's host, the Earl of Angus (Archibald Douglas) is shown the documents, he arms De Wilton and accepts him as a knight again. De Wilton's plans for revenge are overturned by the Battle of Flodden. Marmion dies on the battlefield, while De Wilton displays heroism, regains his honour, retrieves his lands, and marries Clare. Canto summary Introduction to Canto 1 (To William Stewart Rose, Esq.): Writing in November, Scott considers possible remedies for the destructive effect of time in the natural world, in public affairs (he elegises Nelson, Pitt, and Fox), and in literature: namely spring, the apocalypse, and the revival of medieval romance. Canto 1 (The Castle): The English knight Marmion and his train are received by Sir Hugh the Heron at Norham Castle who arranges for a palmer to guide him on his embassy from Henry VIII to James IV, King of Scots in Edinburgh. Introduction to Canto 2 (To the Rev. John Mariot): Scott considers remedies for historical decline and personal loneliness, namely the joy Mariot and he have found in humble enjoyments, and the purity of solitary meditation. Canto 2 (The Convent): The Abbess of Whitby, with a party of nuns including a novice Sister Clare, journeys by sea to Lindisfarne, where she forms one of a tribunal in sentencing Constance de Beverly to be immured alive together with an accomplice in the planned murder of Clare. In her final speech Constance tells how she had escaped from a convent to join Marmion who had then abandoned her for the wealthy Clare, charging Clare's fiancé with treason and defeating him in armed combat. Introduction to Canto 3 (To William Erskine, Lord KinnederWilliam Erskine): Scott defends his intuitive, ever-varying poetry, taking its inspiration from his experience of the Borders as a young child, against Erskine's advocacy of elevated classical elegy and tragedy. Canto 3 (The Hostel, or Inn): Staying overnight at the inn at Gifford, Marmion is disconcerted when his squire Fitz-Eustace sings a favourite song of Constant (Constance's name when she had accompanied him disguised as a page), and also by the stern looks of the palmer. The host tells of a local elfin spirit who offers combat to all comers. Fitz-Eustace observes Marmion leave to encounter the spirit and return at speed with tell-tale signs of combat. Introduction to Canto 4 (To James Skene): Writing again in November, a year having passed since the first introduction, Scott laments the passing of the youthful companionship enjoyed by Skene and himself, but takes comfort from their more mature acceptance of the variety of experience allotted by Heaven. Canto 4 (The Camp): Sir David Lindsay meets Marmion on the road and arranges for the delegation to receive supervised accommodation at Crichton Castle till James is ready to receive him. Lindsay tells Marmion that a supernatural figure resembling St John has (unavailingly) urged the king against war with England. In response Marmion tells of his supernatural combat at Gifford. Approaching Edinburgh, Marmion surveys from Blackford Hill the assembled Scottish forces as Lindsay deplores the move towards war. Introduction to Canto 5 (To George Ellis): Writing in December from Edinburgh, Scott asserts that the city is more liberal than in medieval times, but just as secure. Ellis is an example to Scott of how medieval literature can be restored and rendered relevant to the modern world. Canto 5 (The Court): Passing through the Scottish forces, Marmion is received by James (in thrall to his mistress Lady Heron and the Queen of France) who commits him to the keeping of the pacific Archibald Douglas at Tantallon Castle and asks him to take charge of the group of English nuns from Canto 2 captured by a Scottish galley. The abbess meets the palmer at night and entrusts him with papers deriving from Constance proving Marmion's part in the false accusation of De Wilton which she had abetted in order to gain influence over him. At Tantallon Marmion, who has been entrusted with returning Clare to her kinsman Lord Fitz-Clare, hears with impatience of the build-up towards battle. Introduction to Canto 6 (To Richard Heber): Writing from Mertoun at Christmas, Scott celebrates the festive occasion maintaining ancient family traditions, and asserts the imaginative power of the superstitions recorded in the old books amassed by the bibliophile Heber. Canto 6 (The Battle): De Wilton appears to Clara at Tantallon and tells how he disguised himself as the palmer. He is knighted by Douglas. Marmion joins Surrey's forces at Flodden and dies of wounds received in the battle, tended by Clare, who is then united with Lord Fitz-Clare. Marmion's body is confused with that of a peasant and buried in an unmarked grave. Clare and De Wilton marry. Reception Many of the reviewers judged Marmion equal in merit to The Lay of the Last Minstrel, though displaying different qualities:For a detailed consideration of the reviews of Marmion see J. H. Alexander, The Reviewing of Walter Scott's Poetry: 1805‒1817, Vol. 2 of Two Studies in Romantic Reviewing (Salzburg, 1976), 358‒69. one critic for example thought that it 'is less sprightly, and less fanciful, but it is more heroic and more stately'The Literary Panorama, 4 (April, 1808), columns 53‒61 (57). But the tone of the comments tended to be more severe than before: thus, although Francis Jeffrey in The Edinburgh Review carefully balanced virtues and defects his overall verdict tended to the negative. Several reviewers felt with him that faults evident in the earlier poem were less tolerable on a second appearance, especially a tendency to antiquarian pedantry. Marmion was also criticised for its style, the obscurity and improbability of the plot, the immorality of its main character, and the lack of connection between the introductory epistles and the narrative. Marmion was a success with the public and remained popular for over a century. The stanzas telling the story of \\"young Lochinvar\\" from Canto 5 particularly caught the public imagination and were widely published in anthologies and learned as a recitation piece. The Brontë sisters were also admirers of Marmion. It is mentioned in Jane Eyre when St. John Rivers gives the poem to Jane.

It is also heard in the U.S. city of San Diego and maintains offices in Chula Vista. The station came on air in 1970. History Joaquín Vargas Gómez, founder of MVS Radio, received the concession for XHOK-FM in December 1970. However, Vargas Gómez did not put the station on air. It would not be until December 1971 that the station signed on. It had been rebadged XHERS-FM and was operated by Paul Schafer's Time Sales Inc. from the United States. Time Sales, which also held the operating rights to XHIS-FM 90.3, ran the two stations as a cluster: XHIS \\"HIS Radio\\" and XHERS \\"HERS Radio\\". The stations' programming was produced at the Time Sales studios, at the Royal Inn at the Wharf in San Diego. While HIS Radio carried a hard-edge progressive rock format, HERS was programmed with softer rock. Not long after signing on, the Time Sales cluster began running into various legal problems. The confluence of a new bilateral radio agreement which would regulate border radio (and required XHERS to move to 104.5), San Diego broadcasters who did not like the competition of Mexican stations targeting the US, and a US Federal Communications Commission investigation did the cluster in. In August 1974, the FCC ruled that Schafer and Time Sales violated the Brinkley Act with their operation; the resulting legal action bankrupted Schafer. XHERS was listed in publications in this period as having a \\"soul music\\" format. By 1979, Vargas Gómez, who never incorporated XHERS into the MVS Radio operation, sold the station to XHERS, S.A., a concessionaire owned and operated by Califórmula Broadcasting and the owner of XHIS. In 1981, XHERS was broadcasting a beautiful music format when the Califórmula cluster was hit by a strike called by STIRT, the Mexican broadcast workers' union, over a program critical of the Governor of Baja California. The strike forced Díaz to sell to Organización Radio Centro and its head, Francisco Aguirre, which brought an end to the action after two months. Two years later, Díaz bought back the stations and relaunched them with new formats and callsigns. The callsign was changed to XHLTN-FM in February 1984, coinciding with the change to the Radio Latina name and format. In 1993, two workers died on the XHLTN tower. They were installing a large piece of transmission equipment, to which they were harnessed, when a cable gave way and the workers fell to their deaths.Gregory Gross, \\"Two fall to their deaths at Tijuana radio tower\\", San Diego Union-Tribune 28 January 1993 XHLTN was acquired by Grupo Imagen in 2004.

This form of animal deception is an adaptive behavior also known as tonic immobility or thanatosis. Apparent death can be used as a defense mechanism or as a form of aggressive mimicry, and occurs in a wide range of animals. When induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as animal hypnosis. According to Gilman et al., the investigation of \\"animal hypnosis\\" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by Athanasius Kircher. Tonic immobility Tonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily paralysed and unresponsive to external stimuli. In most cases this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator. However, in sharks exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating. Despite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility. Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities. =In sharks= Some sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. dogfish sharks, lemon sharks, whitetip reef sharks. For tiger sharks (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour. Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical shark repellent has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery. Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks. Scientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.Brooks, E. J., et al. \\"The Stress Physiology of Extended Duration Tonic Immobility in the Juvenile Lemon Shark, Negaprion Brevirostris (Poey 1868).\\" Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 409.1-2 (2011): 351-60. It has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal. =In teleost fishes= Goldfish, trout, rudd, tench, brown bullhead, medaka, paradise fish, and topminnow have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs. Oscars seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour. A similar behavior has been reported for convict tangs in the field. =In reptiles= Tonic immobility can be reliably induced in iguanas by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular. The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity. Tonic immobility can also be induced in the Carolina anole. The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity. =In rabbits= In 2006, a single study in rabbits tried to find a link between a fear-motivated stress state and some of the physiological responses induced by tonic immobility. Researchers observed an increase in heart rate and breathing immediately following periods of tonic immobility, and while these comprise an expected physiologic reaction to sudden position change, the data were nonetheless used to advance a conclusion that despite the appearance of deep relaxation, the rabbits are actually in fear for their lives.

While the study failed to explore why rabbits seem to enjoy self-induction of tonic immobility and are sometimes found sleeping on their backs, it is now routinely cited to support a notion that rabbits actually hate what they appear to enjoy. The researchers did allow for induction of tonic immobility in rabbits as appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia. =In chickens= See Chicken hypnotism. =In ducks= Tonic immobility has been viewed in some duck species. =In humans= Tonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault. There is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning. Thus, defensive immobilization is hypothesized to have played a crucial role in the evolution of human parent- child attachment, sustained attention and suggestibility, REM sleep and theory of mind.Pdf. =As a scientific tool= Tonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation. It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970. The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats. To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds. This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck. Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’. Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens, hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels, hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor, and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration. Tonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits and pigs. Thanatosis In animal behaviour, thanatosis (from the Greek noun , meaning \\"putting to death\\"; cf. : Thanatos) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a prey evading a predator, a male trying to mate with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The French biologist Georges Pasteur classifies it as a form of self-mimesis, a form of camouflage or mimicry in which the \\"mimic\\" imitates itself in a dead state. =For defense= For defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey. In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced, which suggests that thanatosis is indeed adaptive. In the hog-nosed snake, a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul- smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as cats, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when rats try to eat them.Triumph of Life (2006). Alexandria, VA: PBS Home Video. In mammals, the Virginia opossum is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. \\"Playing possum\\" is an idiomatic phrase which means \\"pretending to be dead\\". It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened. This instinct does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging roadkill may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves. The usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a brown bear is to lie face down, cover the face with one’s hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while. \\"Playing possum\\" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, unconscious, asleep, or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself. Thanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp Nasonia vitripennis, and the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. =For reproduction= In the spider species Pisaura mirabilis, male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of gift-giving and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less. =For predation= Nimbochromis (sleeper cichlids), endemic to Lake Malawi in East Africa, are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. N. livingstoni then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close. A similar strategy has also been observed in the African cichlid Lamprologus lemairii from Lake Tanganyika and in the Central American yellowjacket cichlid Parachromis friedrichsthalii.

The term specifically refers to facilities for connecting players through a variety of graphical chess clients located on each user's computer.  History  In the 1970s, one could play correspondence chess in a PLATO System program called 'chess3'. Several users used chess3 regularly; often a particular user would make several moves per day, sometimes with several games simultaneously in progress. In theory one could use chess3 to play a complete game of chess in one sitting, but chess3 was not usually used this way. PLATO was not connected to Internet predecessor ARPANET in any way that allowed mass use by the public, and consequently, chess3 was and still is relatively unknown to the public. In the eighties, chess play by email was still fairly novel. Latency with email was less than with traditional correspondence chess via paper letters. Often one could complete a dozen moves in a week. As network technology improved, public, widespread use of a centralised server for live play became a possibility. Michael Moore, of the University of Utah, and Richard Nash recognised the potential of an Internet chess server and created its first incarnation, hosted at lark.utah.edu and accessible through telnet. The official opening date of the ICS was January 15, 1992. John Chanak, William Kish, and Aaron Putnam moved the server to a host machine at Carnegie Mellon University in July 1992, and took over its operation. Although it was buggy and suffered from lag problems, the server was popular among a small group of chess enthusiasts. Over time, many features were added to the ICS, such as Elo ratings and support for graphical clients, and the server was made more stable. In late 1992, Daniel Sleator, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, took over management of the ICS. He addressed, among other issues, the frequent complaint that players would lose blitz games on time due to network lag. In 1994, he copyrighted the code, and began receiving purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialise the server. There were questions about whether Sleator was right to claim that the ICS was his intellectual property, since he did not code the original server, although he had made substantial improvements to its code. On March 1, 1995, Sleator announced his intentions to commercialise ICS himself, renaming it the Internet Chess Club, or ICC, and charging a yearly membership fee of $US 49 ($US 59.95 in 2007). This announcement was highly controversial among existing members. Many volunteers who had contributed in various ways to the flourishing of ICS were upset that anyone would attempt to profit from their efforts. Active players on the server who were used to the service being provided without charge were not pleased with the addition of the membership fee. A handful of programmers who had worked on the original ICS became unhappy with what they saw as the commoditization of their project. They formed the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS), and continued to allow everyone to have access to all features for free. In 1996, John Fanning, uncle of Napster founder Shawn Fanning, started Chess.net,Welcome to Chess.net a commercial Internet chess server to rival ICS. Both services remain operational today.  Protocol and access  The ICS protocol is a simple, text-based variant of the TELNET protocol. It is sparsely documented and not standardised, although a few reference implementations and several clients exist. In theory, an ICS can be accessed from any TELNET client. However, almost all users choose to play using a graphical client, called an interface. Currently, the most popular interface is XBoard (and its Windows counterpart, WinBoard). In recent years, however, it has lost ground to newer interfaces like Pychess and eboard. XICS is an X graphical interface to any Internet chess server. Unlike earlier text-based ICS clients, XICS allows the players to see the board and play pieces graphically, usually in a 2-D configuration. In addition to standalone clients, many servers also offer Java interfaces that can be used directly from a Web browser. These are popular with new users and users of public computers.  Available servers  Over the years, several Internet chess servers have been created. The most popular are Chess.com, Chesshub.com, Lichess.org, ICC,Chess Craft Playchess.com, FICS, and Chesscube. Chess is also among the games previously offered by non-specialist site Yahoo! Games.

The tax is thus withheld or deducted from the income due to the recipient. In most jurisdictions, withholding tax applies to employment income. Many jurisdictions also require withholding tax on payments of interest or dividends. In most jurisdictions, there are additional withholding tax obligations if the recipient of the income is resident in a different jurisdiction, and in those circumstances withholding tax sometimes applies to royalties, rent or even the sale of real estate. Governments use withholding tax as a means to combat tax evasion, and sometimes impose additional withholding tax requirements if the recipient has been delinquent in filing tax returns, or in industries where tax evasion is perceived to be common. Typically the withholding tax is treated as a payment on account of the recipient's final tax liability, when the withholding is made in advance. It may be refunded if it is determined, when a tax return is filed, that the recipient's tax liability to the government that received the withholding tax is less than the tax withheld, or additional tax may be due if it is determined that the recipient's tax liability is more than the withholding tax. In some cases the withholding tax is treated as discharging the recipient's tax liability, and no tax return or additional tax is required. Such withholding is known as final withholding. The amount of withholding tax on income payments other than employment income is usually a fixed percentage. In the case of employment income the amount of withholding tax is often based on an estimate of the employee's final tax liability, determined either by the employee or by the government. Basics Some governments have written laws that require taxes to be paid before the money can be spent for any other purpose. This ensures the taxes will be paid first and will be paid on time, rather than risk the possibility that the tax-payer might default at the time when tax falls due in arrears. Typically, withholding is required to be done by the employer of someone else, taking the tax payment funds out of the employee or contractor's salary or wages. The withheld taxes are then paid by the employer to the government body that requires payment, and applied to the account of the employee, if applicable. The employee may also be required by the government to file a tax return self-assessing one's tax and reporting withheld payments. Income taxes =Wage withholding= Most developed countries operate a wage withholding tax system. In some countries, subnational governments require wage withholding so that both national and subnational taxes may be withheld. In the U.S.,See U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 15, which includes withholding tables for income tax. State requirements vary by state; for an example, see the New York state portal for withholding tax. Canada,See Canada Revenue Agency Publication T4001. Canada Revenue Agency also provides significant online guidance accessible through a web index, including an online payroll tax calculator. and others, the federal and most state or provincial governments, as well as some local governments, require such withholding for income taxes on payments by employers to employees. Income tax for the individual for the year is generally determined upon filing a tax return after the end of the year. The amount withheld and paid by the employer to the government is applied as a prepayment of income taxes and is refundable if it exceeds the income tax liability determined on filing the tax return. In such systems, the employee generally must make a representation to the employer regarding factors that would influence the amount withheld.See, e.g., IRS Form W-4. Generally, the tax authorities publish guidelines for employers to use in determining the amount of income tax to withhold from wages. The United KingdomSee HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) PAYE for employers: the basics and certain other jurisdictions operate a withholding tax system known as pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), although the term \\"withholding tax\\" is not commonly used in the UK. Unlike many other withholding tax systems, PAYE systems generally aim to collect all of an employee's tax liability through the withholding tax system, making an end of year tax return redundant. However, taxpayers with more complicated tax affairs must file tax returns. Australia operates a pay-as- you-go (PAYG) system, which is similar to PAYE. The system applies only at the federal level, as the individual states do not collect income taxes.See the Australian Tax Office's PAYG withholding web page for details and tools. =Other domestic withholding= Some systems require that income taxes be withheld from certain payments other than wages made to domestic persons. Ireland requires withholding of tax on payments of interest on deposits by banks and building societies to individuals.See Irish Tax & Customs Deposit Interest Retention Tax. The U.S. requires payers of dividends, interest, and other \\"reportable payments\\" to individuals to withhold tax on such payments in certain circumstances.26 USC 3406, Backup Withholding. Withholding applies to individuals who have not provided the payee a tax identification number or failed to certify that they are is subject to backup withholding or with respect to whom the IRS has notified the payee that backup withholding applies. The rate of withholding tax is the fourth lowest rate of tax for individuals. Australia requires payers of interest, dividends and other payments to withhold an amount when the payee does not provide a tax file number or Australian Business Number to the payer. India enforces withholding tax also on payments between companies and not just from companies to individuals, under the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) system. (Since April 2016, the United Kingdom has discontinued withholding tax on interest and dividends, though in some cases this income will become liable for taxation through other means).Dividend Allowance factsheet HMRC, 17 August 2015 Rwanda charges withholding tax on business payments unless the paying company obtains proof that the recipient is registered with the tax administration and that they have a recent income tax declaration. Social insurance taxes (social security) Many countries (and/or subdivisions thereof) have social insurance systems that require payment of taxes for retirement annuities and medical coverage for retirees. Most such systems require that employers pay a tax to cover such benefits.See for example 26 USC 3111; ATO Publication 71038, Super: What employers need to know. Some systems, for example, New South Wales, Australia levy a payroll tax independently of a social insurance system. Some systems also require that employees pay such taxes.See, for example, 26 USC 3102. Where the employees are required to pay the tax, it is generally withheld from the payment of wages and paid by the employer to the government. Social insurance tax rates may be different for employers than for employees. Most systems provide an upper limit on the amount of wages subject to social insurance taxes.These limits may vary by country and year. For 2009, the U.S. income limit on the retirement portion (6.2%) of social security tax was $106,800, versus $102,000 for 2008, and there was no limit on the medicare portion (1.45%) of the tax; see Publication 15, supra. Canadian wages subject to Canada Pension Plan were limited to $46,390 of the excess over $3,500 for 2009, at a tax rate of 4.95%; see Publication T4001, supra. UK National Insurance contributions are due for earnings above the Earnings Threshold (£110 weekly) up to a limit that varies depending on other coverage. International withholding Most countries require payers of interest, dividends and royalties to non-resident payees (generally, if a non-domestic postal address is in the payers records) withhold from such payment an amount at a specific rate.See, e.g., 26 USC 1441–1446, IRS Publication 515, CRA Publication T4061. Payments of rent may also be subject to withholding tax or may be taxed as business income.For example, U.S. rules provide that rentals that rise to the level of a trade or business are not subject to withholding taxes, but other rental income may be subject to 30% withholding tax. An election may be available under 26 USC 871(d) or an applicable tax treaty. The amounts may vary by type of income. A few jurisdictions treat fees paid for technical consulting services as royalties subject to withholding of tax. Income tax treaties may reduce the amount of tax for particular types of income paid from one country to residents of the other country. Some countries require withholding by the purchaser of real property. The U.S. also imposes a 10% withholding tax on the gross sales price of a U.S. real property interest unless advance IRS approval is obtained for a lower rate.26 USC 897 and 26 USC 1445. The lower rate of withholding is requested by filing IRS Form 8288-B by the sale closing date. Canada imposes similar rules for 25% withholding, and withholding on sale of business real property is 50% of the price, but may be reduced on application. The European Union has issued directives prohibiting taxation on companies by one member state of dividends from subsidiaries in other member state, except in some cases, interest on debt obligations, or royalties received by a resident of another member nation. Procedures vary for obtaining reduced withholding tax under income tax treaties. Procedures for recovery of excess amounts withheld vary by jurisdiction. In some, recovery is made by filing a tax return for the year in which the income was received. Time limits for recovery vary greatly. Taxes withheld may be eligible for a foreign tax credit in the payee's home country. Remittance to tax authorities Most withholding tax systems require withheld taxes to be remitted to tax authorities within specified time limits, which time limits may vary with the withheld amount. Remittance by electronic funds transfer may be requiredThe U.S. requires remittance electronically within no later than the following business day when the balance of unremitted amounts exceeds $100,000, and other thresholds apply; see IRS Publication 15, supra, p. 23. Canada requires remittance within three business days of the end of the quarter-monthly period in which withholding occurs for Threshold 2 remitters; see CRA Publication T-4001, supra., p. 3. or preferred. Penalties for delay or failure to remit withheld taxes to tax authorities can be severe.Penalties of up to 100% may be assessed against a withholding agent under 26 USC 6672 for intentional failure to withhold and remit. The penalty may be assessed against any person, including a corporate officer or employee, having custody or control of the funds. The sums withheld by a business is regarded as a debt to the tax authority, so that on bankruptcy of the business the tax authority stands as an unsecured creditor; however, sometimes the tax authority has legislative priority over other creditors. Reporting Nearly all systems imposing withholding tax requirements also require reporting of amounts withheld in a specified manner. Copies of such reporting are usually required to be provided to both the person on whom the tax is imposed and to the levying government.See, for example, IRS Form W-2 and CRA Form T4 with respect to employees, and IRS Form 1042 and CRA Form NR4 with respect to payments to foreign persons. Reporting is generally required annually for amounts withheld with respect to wages. Reporting requirements for other payments vary, with some jurisdictions requiring annual reporting and others requiring reporting within a specified period after the withholding occurs.

The changing potassium concentrations hyperpolarize the cell at the end of an action potential. The reversal potential of the GABAB-mediated IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential) is –100 mV, which is much more hyperpolarized than the GABAA IPSP. GABAB receptors are found in the central nervous system and the autonomic division of the peripheral nervous system. The receptors were first named in 1981 when their distribution in the CNS was determined, which was determined by Norman Bowery and his team using radioactively labelled baclofen. Functions GABABRs stimulate the opening of K+ channels, specifically GIRKs, which brings the neuron closer to the equilibrium potential of K+. This reduces the frequency of action potentials which reduces neurotransmitter release. Thus GABAB receptors are inhibitory receptors. GABAB receptors also reduces the activity of adenylyl cyclase and Ca2+ channels by using G-proteins with Gi/G0 α subunits. GABAB receptors are involved in behavioral actions of ethanol, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and possibly in pain. Recent research suggests that these receptors may play an important developmental role.  Structure  GABAB Receptors are similar in structure to and in the same receptor family with metabotropic glutamate receptors.MRC (Medical Research Council). 2003. Glutamate receptors: Structures and functions. University of Brisotol Centre for Synaptic Plasticity. There are two subunits of the receptor, GABAB1 and GABAB2, and these appear to assemble as heterodimers in neuronal membranes by linking up by their intracellular C termini. In the mammalian brain, two predominant, differentially expressed isoforms of the GABAB1 are transcribed from the Gabbr1 gene, GABAB(1a) and GABAB(1b), which are conserved in different species including humans. This might potentially offer more complexity in terms of the function due to different composition of the receptor. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the full length GABAB receptor in different conformational states from inactive apo to fully active have been obtained. Unlike Class A and B GPCRs, phospholipids bind within the transmembrane bundles and allosteric modulators bind at the interface of GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunits.

This may include members who are deemed to have hidden evil intentions towards Scientology, members who are unproductive in their work or who produce poor-quality work. The program includes manual labor tasks and the study of L. Ron Hubbard's works. The rehabilitation program may take more than a year to complete, and the Church has been accused of overworking and mistreating its participants.The Church of Scientology’s Rehabilitation Project Force, CESNUR, We have found that it is an intensive programme of study, spiritual counselling and physical work that can take anywhere between one and a few years. Critics have characterized the RPF as a forced labor and re-indoctrination program comparable to the Soviet gulag system. Development The Rehabilitation Project Force developed out of a predecessor group, the Mud Box Brigade, which was formed aboard L. Ron Hubbard's private fleet in the late 1960s. The mud box is a small perforated screening box fitted to the suction pipe in the bilge of a ship, and is designed to catch larger solid waste before it can choke the pipeline and potentially damage the pump. The Mud Box Brigade was assigned to clean out the mud box as well as fuel lines, water hues, bilges and other parts of the fleet's ships.Hubbard, OODs of 4 January 1968, cited in Modern Management Technology Defined, 1975 Hubbard defined the role as being essentially a punishment duty for unsatisfactory workers: \\"More candidates will be appointed regularly and promptly every time I find a freeloader who is loafing on post and drifting with the wind.\\" Hubbard later clarified that \\"(T)his group is the most downstat [unproductive] and one gets assigned to it by being a freeloader, invisible on post, loafing and really goofing up on one's job.\\"Hubbard, \\"Mud Box Brigade\\", Flag Order 1701 of 5 January 1969 Religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, however, suggested that \\"Hubbard understood it in terms of making retribution to the people who had been harmed by the nonperformance or incorrect performance of one's assigned tasks.\\"RPF - A Sociological Study, by J. Gordon Melton In 1969, Hubbard replaced the Mud Box Brigade with the Rehabilitation Unit, again intended for those removed or disciplined \\"as ineffective or trouble.\\" Following an evaluation, the individual was to receive a set of \\"specific recommendations which if followed will rehabilitate the individual as a highly effective and worthwhile Sea Org member.\\" Hubbard instructed that \\"(T)he unit is [to be] worked hard during the day on a rigorous schedule on jobs assigned by the Review Chief handling corrective areas and jobs needing remedy and repair. The Unit itself is thus made into an effective ship's review team. It works on a one job, one time, one place formula completing each job before moving into the next. Each individual thus earns the right to the remedial services he or she will receive.\\"Hubbard, \\"Rehabilitation Unit\\", Flag Order 1848 of 3 March 1969 Finally, the Rehabilitation Unit was replaced in January 1974 with the Rehabilitation Project Force, or RPF. According to Hubbard, \\"the RPF has been created by the Commodore [Hubbard] so that redemption can occur. That is basically its only purpose.\\" He identified four categories of people who were to be assigned to the RPF: \\"rockslammers\\" (people deemed to have hidden evil intentions, as detected by the E-meter); people who were unproductive and scored poorly on the Oxford Capacity Analysis personality test; \\"repeated stat crashers\\", people who were held responsible for declines in Scientology organizations' productivity; and \\"overt product makers\\", people who produced poor-quality work. As before, the unit was to work on \\"one job, one place, one time.\\" A five-hour study period was to be implemented each day to improve the individuals' knowledge of Scientology.Hubbard, \\"Rehabilitation Project Force\\", Flag Order 3434 of 7 January 1974 According to David G. Bromley and Douglas E. Cowan, the RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep. The RPF was originally intended to last no more than a couple of months, where the assignee would learn Scientology auditing, if he or she was not already an auditor, by the \\"read it, drill it, do it\\" method. RPF members would then co-audit each other to better themselves and make each other more ethical and productive. As punishment, RPF members are often made to wear black boiler suits. Controversy Critics of Scientology, including former Scientologists, have compared the RPF with the gulag system of the Soviet Union. Leaving the Sea Org, even from the RPF, results in what Scientology calls \\"freeloader debt\\" or a \\"freeloader's bill\\": retroactive billing for any auditing received or any Scientology training received while in the Sea Org, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars. While this \\"freeloader debt\\" is not legally binding, many former Scientologists have reported that they felt trapped by the \\"freeloader debt\\" policy. Additional convenience link at . In his book The Complex: An Insider Exposes the Covert World of the Church of Scientology, ex-Scientologist John Duignan describes RPF members living in a rat-infested basement, engaging in degrading jobs for years at a stretch, while denied visits with spouses or children. Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley state that various scholars and observers have come to radically different conclusions about the RPF and whether it is \\"voluntary or coercive, therapeutic or punitive\\"., p. 181 Castile Canyon School One location, known as the Castile Canyon School or \\"Happy Valley\\", has been identified as a former RPF facility.\\"Thurston, Susan (31 January 1999) \\"Bitter partings; Some former Scientologists say life at the church's Gilman Hot Springs complex resembles a slave labor camp.

It is a major bedroom community for mostly U.S. military personnel, federal civil servants, local population, retirees and defense contractors. Due to Navarre Beach and the four miles of beach front on the Gulf of Mexico thereof, as well as several miles of beaches within the Navarre Beach Marine Park and the Gulf Islands National Seashore, it has a small, but rapidly growing community of nature enthusiasts and tourists. Navarre has quickly grown from being a small town of around 1,500 in 1970 to a town with a population of 44,876, estimate. Navarre is about east of Pensacola and about west of Fort Walton Beach. The community is roughly centered on the junction of U.S. Route 98 and State Road 87. It is part of the Pensacola–Ferry Pass–Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area (more commonly referred to as the Pensacola Metro Area), and is the second largest community in the metropolitan area, according to a 2014 study. Navarre is also part of the Fort Walton Beach-Navarre-Wright Urbanized Area. It is known for the natural environment, swimming, picnic spots, and its beach. A busy day on Navarre Beach History =The Pez-Sigüenza Expedition of 1693= In 1693 Spanish explorers Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora and Admiral Andrés de Pez y Malzárraga set sail from Veracruz. A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician, and theologian, Sigüenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in Northwest Florida during the expedition. While traveling in the area of East Bay in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the East Bay River. In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sigüenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \\"The River Jordan\\". On April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \\"El Robledal,\\" meaning \\"The Oakgrove\\" in Spanish. After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez- Sigüenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andrés de Arriola y Guzmán (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the Tristán de Luna y Arellano colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted. = Axelson Point =  Settlement and Shipyard  Robledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a homestead by the Axelson Family. Their home was along the shore of the East Bay, on a small cape, in which, they are now the namesake, after the point was officially designated, Axelson Point. Soon after their settlement in what would become Navarre, they established a shipyard on Axelson Point, jutting into what was also then called, Axelson Cove. The shipyard was considered to be mostly successful, as the family made a business of fixing ships in port in the nearby deep-water port in Pensacola and the river port in Milton, as well as building large-scale ships of their own.  Civil War  During the American Civil War, despite the political ideology of citizens in the local area, records make it seem as though the Axelson's were pro-union. This is substantiated by a record showing that, while many businesses in the area were becoming ruined due to the Union blockade of southern ports, the Axelson's shipyard was quite busy and prosperous, primarily from business completed with the Union navy and the United States Merchant Marines. In addition, some records and books, such as the Atlas of Florida, attest that, while most likely unassisted by the Axelsons, Union raids were made against Confederate troops and camps, stationed near where Gulf Breeze is today, through routes in what would become Navarre and Holley, Florida. Bilowry Some maps of the area during this time, seem to indicate that the area was also known as “Bilowry,” a presumed misspelling or combination of the name, Bill Lowry. The area also had a post office under this name from 1886–1891. =Town of Eagan= Some 30 years after the first homestead in the area was established, seemingly coinciding with the community of Bilowry, a small settlement named Eagan arose in 1884. The settlement, composed of approximately 40 families, was located off the Santa Rosa Sound and encompassed a portion of present-day Navarre. The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established the settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre. =Guy Wyman and town development= The founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was Guy Wyman, a colonel in the United States Army. During World War I, he met a French nurse named Noelle. At the time, immigration policies would not allow him to bring her to the United States as a fiancée or even as a wife, but he could bring her back as his legal child. Colonel Wyman, therefore, adopted her and brought her back to the Florida panhandle, where he purchased a large amount of land. Noelle named their holdings Navarre, after the province in Spain, near France. Wyman platted the town in 1925, but made no steps towards development. However, during the Great Depression, the Wymans could not pay the taxes on it and were forced to begin selling it off. Part of that property is where the Navarre Park is today. =Modern era= In modern times, Navarre has become one of the fastest growing communities in Florida. While protecting and enhancing the natural environment of the area; many steps have been taken to develop luxury accommodations, water activities, boutique shopping, scenic trails, schools and nature/educational opportunities. Hurricanes Ivan and Dennis  Navarre has been impacted significantly by hurricanes. Immediately preceding Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Dennis, Navarre was seeing a new strand of growth and economic advancement. This, however, quickly came to a close, as Navarre suffered horribly during the events of those hurricanes. Many planned developments stopped and decided to delay their plans until a later date, many of which were never resumed or completed. This hard mark against Navarre lingered until the mid and late 2010s. Helicopter crash On March 10, 2015, a UH-60, call sign MOJO 69, from the Louisiana National Guard, crashed in the Santa Rosa Sound off the coast of the community of Navarre. All eleven on board were believed killed. On November 18, 2016, Leadership Santa Rosa Class 29 unveiled the Navarre Black Hawk Memorial in Navarre Park. The memorial was built to honor the men who died in the Black Hawk crash and anyone who has paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to the United States. Protests 2017 and 2018 have seen a noticeable rise in civil activism in the Navarre area, with three notable protests occurring, all within the span of 12 months. The first protests recorded in the community occurred on June 9, 2017, after the county unilaterally changed the town's nickname and locally popular sign. The change was made without the consent of the citizens of the town and have sparked additional calls for the incorporation of the community as a municipality. In 2018, there were protests against the Holley- Navarre Water System. The protests were over the water system's potential violations of the Florida Sunshine Law, which guarantees the rights for citizens and residents to access the meetings and public records of government agencies. The alleged violations occurred when the board of directors of the agency met for what they called a \\"secret\\" meeting. The board president stated these meetings were closed due to their nature of discussing legal matters between members of the board and of several attorneys and lawyers. The argument against these protests is that the water system is not a government agency, but instead a utility contracted to serve the greater Navarre area. The situation came to a close as a new, more transparent, water board has been elected by the citizens of Navarre. Some controversy still remains though, after the new water board appointed as CEO, Rob Williamson, a former Santa Rosa County commissioner that had just been voted out of his seat, all of a month before his hiring. The third notable protests were part of the larger national school walkout to promote gun control. While small, only consisting of a few students, it is considered notable in local political circles, as Navarre is in Florida's 1st congressional district, which is often polled as being the most conservative, and arguably the most pro-gun region in the state of Florida. There has been some speculation that this signals a larger change in the ideology of this region, as the younger generation begins to reach the voting age. On June 3, 2020, there was a protest at Navarre Park as part of the George Floyd protests. It consisted of around 120 protestors and was followed by a candlelight vigil at the main pavilion of the park. New expansion For the first time since before hurricanes Ivan and Dennis, Navarre is now not only expanding in population, but in attractions, dining establishments, and other tourist options as well. In 2017 and 2018 alone, Navarre saw the opening of several major housing and apartment complexes, a brand new hotel, a new prototype Walmart Neighborhood Store, and several new restaurants. This expansion appears to be continuing, with the announcement of a new Aldi Supermarket, Homegoods, and several more establishments. Chick- fil-A and Starbucks are considering locations at the Boulevard, a planned development that will include a large high-end apartment complex, several restaurants, and retail and box stores. Firestone and Dunkin’ Donuts are also under construction near the Aldi site. After the failed attempt at incorporation in 2014, a new effort in incorporating has been established by a local political action committee, the Navarre Area United PAC. the PAC has delayed collecting petition signatories to get the issue of incorporation on the ballot due to the COVID-19 outbreak. They are expected to resume collecting signatures after the pandemic.  Geography  =Location= Santa Rosa Sound as viewed from the Navarre Beach Causeway Navarre is located at . It is located within a portion of the Florida Panhandle observing the Central Time Zone.Standard Time Zone Boundaries 49CFR71 Elevation is at an average of . Navarre is located on roughly of shoreline along the Gulf of Mexico. This figure however, does not include the shorelines on both sides of Santa Rosa Sound, and the Navarre's shoreline along East Bay and the East Bay River. =Topography= The community of Navarre is located on the Gulf Coastal Plain and is built on mostly flat sandy soil, though there are a few shallow hills. Navarre is primarily located on the Fairpoint Peninsula and Santa Rosa Island. Navarre is bounded geographically in the north by the East Bay River, the Yellow River, and several creeks and on the south by the Santa Rosa Sound. Holley, a mainland community commonly considered part of Navarre, is north of the Fairpoint Peninsula, across the East Bay River. =Climate= Weather  Hurricanes  As a low-elevation community near the Gulf of Mexico, Navarre is often threatened by hurricanes. Significant damage was incurred as a result of hurricanes Erin, Opal, Ivan, Dennis, and Sally. Many homes and businesses immediately along Santa Rosa Sound (generally south of U.S. Highway 98) suffered storm surge as a result of those storms. Recoveries have been rendered by the area with the population quickly flourishing. This area of Florida is consistently listed as one of the worst places for hurricanes. =Navarre Beach= Navarre Beach is the beach neighborhood of Navarre. It is on Santa Rosa Island, a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico. Immediately to its east is Navarre Beach Marine Park, a former Florida state park. Immediately to its west is a portion of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, and farther west is the community of Pensacola Beach.  Recent History  On March 26, 2006, a \\"beach renourishment\\" project was begun, restoring sand lost due to the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005. This project eventually added approximately of sand and a high berm to the Gulf side of Santa Rosa Island for the entire length of Navarre Beach. The project was completed in December 2006. Another round of beach renourishment was completed in 2016. The entirety of Navarre Beach was closed during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak, with only residents of the beach neighborhood being allowed on that area of the island. Furtherly, It was enforced by a police check on one side of the Navarre Beach Causeway.  Demographics  Navarre is a large community, estimated to have 44,876 people in the community, according to several different estimates completed since 2014. If the town of Navarre was to be incorporated it would be the largest city between Pensacola and Tallahassee (based on population). This is a major increase from just 40 years ago, when the population was hovering around 1,500. The below racial characteristics of the community are from 2017 estimates. *White 78.9% *African-American 7.3% *Hispanic 7.3% *Multiracial 3.6% *Asian 2.00% *Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander 0.58% *Native American and Alaska Native 0.32% *Other 0.10%  Attractions  The old Navarre Beach sign with Christmas decorations The old Navarre Beach sign in the spring time One of the four new Navarre Beach signs Navarre is centered near the junction of U.S. Highway 98, the primary east-west route between Pensacola and the Fort Walton Beach area, and State Road 87. It is located near several large military facilities: Naval Air Station Pensacola to the west; Hurlburt Field and Eglin Air Force Base to the east; and Naval Air Station Whiting Field to the North. Tourism has increased in the Navarre area since 2010, being declared \\"Florida's Best Kept Secret\\" by the local hospitality business. Navarre has a park on the mainland next to Navarre Beach bridge and the Intracoastal Waterway that contains a visitor information center; water splash pad, duck pond, butterfly house, playground, gazebos; pier and small beach area. Boating, Surfing, jet skiing, paddle boarding, fishing, bird watching, exploring scenic trails, and walking/jogging are popular among the residents and visitors. Navarre's fourth hotel became the first beachfront hotel to operate since 2004 when it opened in 2017. In 2010 the Navarre Beach fishing pier was rebuilt after repeated damage from hurricanes. At , it is currently the longest fishing pier on the Gulf of Mexico and in the state of Florida. The Panhandle Butterfly House on Navarre Parkway opened in 1997. Around 14,000 visitors stop by each year to see butterflies up close, learn about their life cycle, and find out how to attract butterflies to their own gardens. A highlight each year is the monarch migration; the orange and black butterflies are seen in the thousands as they travel to and from Mexico to breed. Due to miscommunication on the fault of the Santa Rosa County Commission, the Butterfly House closed its Navarre Park location for the 2019 season and is expected to reopen in 2021 in a new location in Milton, a few miles north of Navarre. Navarre Park provides a play area for children, basketball courts, picnic pavilions, and restroom facilities. The park hosts several large community events each year. Renovation plans for the improved 7-acre park include a new playground, splash pad, restrooms, parking, shade areas, pavilions and a new seawall; slated to be finished in 2021.  Infrastructure  = Education = Education in Navarre is administrated by the Santa Rosa County District School system headquartered in Milton, Florida. The schools that serve the Navarre community are: *Navarre High School (Grades 9–12) *Holley-Navarre Middle School (Grades 6–8) *Holley-Navarre Intermediate School (Grades 3–5) *Holley-Navarre Primary School (Grades K–2) *Woodlawn Beach Middle School (Grades 6–8) *West Navarre Primary School (Grades K–2) *West Navarre Intermediate School (Grades 3–5) *East Bay K-8 School (Opening 2021) = Parks and Recreation = The community of Navarre has several public parks open year-round. These parks are currently owned and operated by the Santa Rosa County Department of Parks and Recreation and are open to the public. The Navarre Sports Complex and Navarre Soccer Complex, while owned and largely managed by the county, are partially operated by the Navarre Youth Sports Association. The largest of the parks are the Navarre Beach Marine Park, Navarre Park, and the Navarre Sports Complex. = Transportation = Transportation infrastructure in Navarre is relatively limited and is dominated by roads, instead of public transportation or sidewalks. This has been to the chagrin of some local citizens. However, relatively little has been done to improve this within the last few years, beyond feasibility studies of possibile improvements.  Roadways  Navarre is centered on the intersection of U.S. Highway 98 (named \\"Navarre Parkway\\" while within the town) and Florida State Road 87 (which has no official name, though is sometimes called \\"the Expressway\\" by local residents). These provide the two largest connections in and out of the town. The Parkway (US 98) connects west to Pensacola, ultimately ending in Mississippi, and connects east to Destin and Fort Walton Beach, ultimately ending in Lakeland, Florida. The Expressway (FL 87) has its southern terminus in Navarre; however, it connects north to Interstate 10 and Milton, then ending at the Alabama state border. Navarre also has secondary connections through Florida State Road 399 and Santa Rosa County Road 399. Because of their matching shield numbers, the two are often confused by residents and tourists alike and are often instead referred to as \\"Gulf Boulevard\\" and \\"East Bay Boulevard\\" respectively. Gulf Boulevard, which has its northern terminus in Navarre, travels on Santa Rosa Island, ultimately going through the Opal Beach section of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Pensacola Beach, then ending in Gulf Breeze. East Bay Boulevard, which has its eastern terminus in Navarre, travels roughly parallel to East Bay and the East Bay River. It also passes by Gable Lake and passes over the Tom King Bayou, before connecting with US 98 in the neighboring community of Woodlawn Beach, Florida. Due to traffic flow issues on both the primary and secondary thoroughfares, a community access road has been proposed by citizens and county leaders alike. An inquiry into the feasibility of such a plan is being conducted by county officials.  Airports  Navarre doesn't have a dedicated commercially- served airport. Instead, it is largely served by Pensacola International Airport (about 25 miles west in Pensacola) and Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport (about 30 miles east in Valparaiso, Florida). Navarre does have one general aviation airfield, confusingly named Fort Walton Beach Airport, despite being both located and registered within Navarre, not the nearby city of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The airfield has a single turf runway and primarily serves banner-towing aerial advertising aircraft, that fly ads along the beach. Navarre did also host an outlying airfield of Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Naval Outlying Landing Field Holley; however, this airfield has since been converted into operations as one of the largest solar fields in the region. Currently being operated by Gulf Power, in cooperation with the United States Navy. Public Transportation Navarre has limited public transportation, despite some public calls for it. However, it is does receive service from Santa Rosa Transportation, which provides some on-demand accessibility service from the town. Popular culture =Jaws 2= A clean- up of old props from Jaws 2 on Navarre Beach. Most of the scenes in Jaws 2 were filmed in and around Navarre and Navarre Beach circa 1977. The production of the movie \\"was a boost to the local economy because local boaters, extras and stand-ins or doubles were hired. Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.\\" Navarre's Holiday Inn \\"Holidome\\" was used as the film's headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodeled for David Brown and Roy Scheider. Universal rented 100 of the hotel's 200 rooms, spending $1 million. The Holiday Inn was destroyed in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. A new hotel was built on the same site as the Holiday Inn and was completed during the summer of 2017.

It first aired on the Fox network on December 2, 2001. In the episode, Mr. Burns falls in love with Gloria, a woman who is much younger than he is and who turns out to be Snake Jailbird's ex-girlfriend. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder, directed by Lance Kramer and dedicated to the memory of George Harrison. The episode featured, along with George Takei as a waiter and Karl Wiedergott as a delivery boy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who appeared as Mr Burns' love interest Gloria. The episode received positive reviews from critics following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu- ray. Plot The Simpsons visit a Chinese restaurant, where Homer is hired to write Chinese fortune cookies after complaining that the current fortunes are unimaginative. One of his fortunes says \\"You will find true love on Flag Day\\". This cookie makes its way to Mr. Burns on, coincidentally, Flag Day. Eager for true love at last, Burns and a reluctant Smithers spend the evening womanising at a wealthy social gathering and a strip club. With mere minutes left in the day, Burns finds a cop ticketing his car, which he had parked in the middle of the road. After discovering the cop is a beautiful woman named Gloria (voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Burns asks her out on a date. Gloria warily accepts, much to Burns' delight and Smithers' chagrin. After a pleasant first date at the carnival, Burns asks about another date but Gloria is about to turn him down when Homer runs by. Burns asks Homer to vouch for him to Gloria, so Homer regales her by listing Burns' many exploits. After Gloria agrees to a second date, Burns enlists Homer to be his \\"youthful advisor\\", accompanying the couple on their next date at the disco hall, and even carrying Burns and Gloria up the stairs when they go to have sex. In these cases, Burns overcomes his weakness and extreme age by means of a powerful aphrodisiac (made from an extract of the \\"pocket fox\\", a species which only existed for three weeks in the 16th century). Eventually, during a date at the bowling alley, Burns decides to ask Gloria to marry him. She says yes. As Burns goes off to get some champagne to celebrate, Snake comes to rob the bowling alley, and is surprised to see Gloria, who turns out to be his ex-girlfriend. Despite Gloria's protests, Snake kidnaps her and Homer. When Burns finds Gloria's ring, dropped in the commotion, he assumes she ran off with Homer. Snake takes Gloria and Homer to his hideout. Though Gloria says she loves Burns, Snake vows he can change. The police arrive and confront Snake. Homer tries to escape but instead sets Snake's house on fire. Snake and Homer get out and Burns runs in to save Gloria, however he is soon overcome by the smoke and Gloria is then seen carrying him to safety. Although initially grateful, Gloria begins to reminisce about Snake, causing her to break up with Burns and become Snake's girl again. Production John Swartzwelder wrote the episode. \\"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\\" was written by John Swartzwelder while Lance Kramer served as director. It first aired in the United States on December 2, 2001 on the Fox network. =Writing= Mike Scully, who worked as an executive producer and show runner for the episode, stated in the episode's DVD audio commentary that the first thing the writers tried to think of while writing the episode was how the Simpson family would fit into the story. In the episode's first draft, Gloria worked as a food truck driver; however, this was later changed so that she instead worked as a police lady. Scully also stated that, in the scene after Homer carries Burns and Gloria up the stairs, there were originally a lot of jokes about Homer \\"taking care of business\\" for Burns; however, the staff decided to leave it out since it would make Homer \\"unlikable.\\" In the episode, Snake Jailbird's mailbox reads \\"Snake (Jailbird)\\" which is a reference to a debate that the writers had over whether Snake's mailbox would read \\"Snake\\" or \\"Jailbird\\". Originally, the episode would end with Burns taking the \\"pocket fox\\" extract, however when seeing the animatic, the writers felt that that ending would be \\"too slow\\", so they changed it into Gloria falling in love with Snake again. =Animation= On the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Kramer stated that there was an issue over which color to paint the fortunes with. Kramer wanted the fortunes to be white while one of his co-workers suggested they should be pink. Kramer stated that the co-worker had been to a Chinese restaurant close to the studio that had pink fortunes, and that \\"that's why she [colored the fortunes pink].\\" The animators also found it difficult to draw Mr Burns happy. Kramer stated that Burns was \\"designed to look like a vulture\\" and look \\"evil all the time\\", so in order to make Burns look happy and more sympathetic, the animators had to change some things in Burns' regular model. For example, Burns' eyebrows are not visible through the majority of the episode. The scene with Mr Burns and Gloria on the Ferris wheel was difficult to animate as well, since the animators had to \\"keep everything moving to sell it.\\" In the scene in which Snake's house is burning down, the animators chose to color the sky red, in order to reflect the fire as well as make the scene \\"a little more exciting.\\" =Casting= Julia Louis-Dreyfus guest-starred as Gloria in the episode. Julia Louis- Dreyfus guest-starred as Gloria in the episode. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, current show runner Al Jean stated that working with Louis- Dreyfus was \\"an absolute pleasure\\", stating that \\"not only was she funny but you'd give her, like, one suggestion, and she'd do three great things with it.\\" The waiter in the Chinese restaurant was portrayed by actor George Takei. Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among several characters on the show, supplied the voice for Woody Allen, who is seen in a writing room for fortune cookies, wondering what he's doing there. The delivery boy was portrayed by Karl Wiedergott, a voice actor who usually fill in for the male actors on The Simpsons when they are not available for the table read. Jean described him as \\"versatile\\" and \\"very talented\\". Release Following the release of thirteenth season of The Simpsons on DVD and Blu-ray on August 24, 2010, \\"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\\" received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Project:Blu, Nate Boss was favorable, describing it as \\"A hilarious episode, with some fantastic one liners\\", and went on to say that the episode was \\"so far the best in the season.\\" Ron Martin of 411Mania was also positive towards the episode, writing \\"The antics of Mr. Burns and Homer trying to woo a young police officer are at worst amusing, at most hilarious.\\" He wrote that Snake Jailbird was \\"a welcome side character\\", and went on to write that the episode was the best of the first disc of The Simpsons' thirteenth season on DVD. Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ rating, and wrote that the episodes highlights were \\"Burns' reaction walking into a strip club\\" [sic] and \\"a fortune cookie Homer writes, 'You will be aroused by a shampoo commercial'.\\" Colin Jacobsson, writing for DVD Movie Guide, stated that, while it was not as good as the previous episode, \\"Homer the Moe\\", \\"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\\" still \\"offers a reasonably solid episode\\". He liked the parts related to the fortune cookies, and stated that “Burns' attempts to woo a much younger woman fare pretty well”. He concluded his review by saying that “enough smiles and snickers emerge to make this an enjoyable show”. Obsessed With Film's Adam Rayner, in his review of The Simpsons' thirteenth season, wrote that Julia Louis Dreyfus's appearance in the episode was \\"arguably the best [cameo] of the season\\".

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 20, 2002\\\\. In the episode, Homer gathers Springfield's citizens to build the world's biggest human pyramid. When it collapses and fails to set the world record, Springfield earns the top spot as the world's fattest town. Marge sues Garth Motherloving's sugar company for making the town's citizens obese. When Springfield outlaws sugar, Homer conspires with Garth to smuggle it to town. \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Mark Kirkland. It was dedicated to the memory of Ron Taylor. Omine conceived the episode after hearing about smokers who sued tobacco companies. While its plot is loosely based on Erin Brockovich, the episode also features references to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Butterfinger. It also features Ben Stiller as Garth Motherloving. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.5 million viewers, finishing in 34th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Plot At a library sale, Homer buys a book on world records published by Duff. After boring everyone with world record trivia, Homer gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. When Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town collecting Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials declare Springfield the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee. The townsfolk are happy to have broken a world record, but Marge worries the whole town is overweight. She learns that nearly everything they eat contains sugar. After complaining to Garth Motherloving, head of the Motherloving Sweets and Sugar Company, Marge sues the sugar industry with the help of Gil and Professor Frink. Judge Snyder sides with her and bans all sugar products in Springfield, angering Homer and most of the town. The whole town goes cold turkey and suffers from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group -- led by Motherloving -- which illegally schemes to return sugar to Springfield. Homer embarks with Bart, Apu, Mr. Burns and a cartoon vampire named Count Fudge-ula to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to Springfield's docks. When Marge pleads with him to dump the cargo, Homer has two choices: obey Marge and press the Drop Cargo button or bring the sugar to Motherloving by pressing the Obey Bad Guy button. Homer drops the cargo and the sugar falls into the water near the Springfield docks. All Springfieldians -- even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar -- jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Snyder declares the sugar ban over and dives in too. Marge is upset and considers giving up changing the world, but Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make the world a better place. Production Ben Stiller portrayed Garth Motherloving in the episode. \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Mark Kirkland. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 20, 2002\\\\. The idea for the episode was pitched by Omine, who based it on a lawsuit at the time, wherein smokers sued tobacco companies for selling harmful wares. Omine found it \\"kinda weird\\" that the people did not take responsibility for their own health, and joked that, in the future, people might sue food companies for \\"making them fat\\", which eventually became the episode's plot. While making the episode, the Simpsons writers decided to compile a list of Springfield's fat residents. According to Omine, the list \\"never ended\\", and when the writers realized the amount of fat people there were in Springfield, they decided that the residents should try and \\"go for the world record\\" in the \\"fattest people\\" category. The writers then decided that the residents were trying to set the world record for largest human pyramid, and then accidentally set the record for fattest population. The episode features the first appearance of Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty.Omine, Carolyn. (2010).

The character was animated by Kirkland's assistant Matt Faughnan, who has since become a regular director for the series.

At one point in the episode, the Springfield residents try to set the record for largest human pyramid, which fails when the pyramid collapses, causing the people to roll into a giant ball. According to director Kirkland, the scene, which the staff members refer to as the \\"people ball\\", was very difficult to animate, and it \\"almost gave [him] a migraine\\" determining how to implement it in the episode. While trying to figure out how to animate the \\"people ball\\", Kirkland spray-painted a globe with white primer and assigned layout artist Paul Wee to draw the Springfield citizens on it with black ink. Normally, the Simpsons animators each draw ten scenes per week, but because he drew the \\"people ball\\", Wee was excused from these duties. Since drawing the \\"people ball\\" by hand would have \\"murdered\\" the animators, they soon decided to photograph it for each frame of the scene. The photographs were taken in Kirkland's garage and were then photocopied using a Xerox photocopier. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean stated that the technique for animating the \\"people ball\\" was \\"extremely interesting\\", although it has never been used again in the series. The \\"master drawing\\" of the human pyramid, which Kirkland also stated was very complicated, took animator Matthew Schofield a couple of days to draw. The drawing then became a reference for the other animators to use when animating the scene.Kirkland, Mark. (2010).

Cereal mascot Count Fudgula is a spoof of the General Mills cereal mascot Count Chocula (who, in turn, parodies fictional character Count Dracula). After sugar becomes banned in Springfield, the town's police force can be seen burning confiscated sugar products. However, when they throw an amount of Butterfinger candy bars in the fire, the bars start to glow and are left intact. Disappointed, police chief Clancy Wiggum explains \\"Butterfingers. Even fire doesn't want them.\\" For a long time, The Simpsons characters starred in Butterfinger commercials, which helped the series get launched by earning revenue from the commercials. Around the time \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\" was written, the series contract with Butterfinger was terminated, and the staff therefore decided to make fun of it. \\"If it had still been in existence, we wouldn't have done it\\", Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty is loosely based on Darlene Cates' character Bonnie Grape in the 1993 film What's Eating Gilbert Grape. During the boat chase when Wiggum pursues Homer for the sugar cargo (narrowly avoiding two boats transporting a huge glass pane and a mother and child riding a combined jet ski-stroller), the Miami Vice Theme is played. Before he agrees to hand the sugar cargo to Motherloving, Homer demands that he gets to see an Oompa Loompa, a character from the 1964 children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The Oompa Loompa's design is based on the version used in the 1971 film adaptation Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, which Kirkland watched in order to \\"get [the design] right.\\" Release In its original American broadcast on January 20, 2002, \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\" received a 7.3 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.5 million viewers. The episode finished in 34th place in the ratings for the week of January 14–20, 2002. On August 24, 2010, \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\" was released as part of The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season DVD and Blu-ray set. Al Jean, Carolyn Omine, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Mark Kirkland and Matt Warburton participated in the audio commentary of the episode. Following its home video release, \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review, writing \\"What would Marge do on the show if she didn’t stage campaigns to tell others what to do? Despite the risk of redundancy, 'Sweets' actually works quite well.\\" He praised Stiller's appearance in the episode, as well as the \\"exploration of the records book\\". He concluded his review by considering it \\"one of Season 13's stronger programs\\". Nate Boss of Project-Blu was favorable as well, calling the episode \\"A funny take on class-action suits (particularly those concerning other consumer products willingly purchased, like tobacco), as well as prohibition.\\" DVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski gave the episode a B rating, and wrote that the \\"library's 'Yes, we have pornography!' banner\\" was the episode's \\"highlight\\". Giving it a more mixed review, Ron Martin of 411Mania called the episode \\"uneven at best, mediocre at worst\\". Andre Dellamorte of Collider described it as a \\"redress\\" of the season 8 episode \\"Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment\\", in which Springfield is faced with prohibition.

These escape routes mainly led toward havens in Latin America, particularly Argentina though also in Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, Ecuador and Bolivia, as well as the United States, Spain and Switzerland. There were two primary routes: the first went from Germany to Spain, then Argentina; the second from Germany to Rome to Genoa, then South America. The two routes developed independently but eventually came together. The ratlines were supported by clergy of the Catholic Church, and historian Michael Phayer claims this was supported by the Vatican. While reputable scholars unanimously consider Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to have committed suicide in Berlin near the end of the war, various conspiracy theories claim that he survived the war and fled to Argentina. Early Spanish ratlines The origins of the first ratlines are connected to various developments in Vatican–Argentine relations before and during World War II. As early as 1942, Monsignor Luigi Maglione contacted Ambassador Llobet, inquiring as to the \\"willingness of the government of the Argentine Republic to apply its immigration law generously, in order to encourage at the opportune moment European Catholic immigrants to seek the necessary land and capital in our country\\". Afterwards, a German priest, Anton Weber, the head of the Rome-based Society of Saint Raphael, traveled to Portugal, continuing to Argentina, to lay the groundwork for future Catholic immigration; this was to be a route which fascist exiles would exploit. According to historian Michael Phayer, \\"this was the innocent origin of what would become the Vatican ratline\\". Spain, not Rome, was the \\"first center of ratline activity that facilitated the escape of Nazi fascists,\\" although the exodus itself was planned within the Vatican. Among the primary organizers were Charles Lescat, a French member of Action Française - an organization suppressed by Pope Pius XI and rehabilitated by Pope Pius XII - and Pierre Daye, a Belgian with contacts in the Spanish government. Lescat and Daye were the first to flee Europe with the help of Argentine cardinal Antonio Caggiano. By 1946, there were hundreds of war criminals in Spain, and thousands of former Nazis and fascists. According to then–United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Vatican cooperation in turning over these \\"asylum-seekers\\" was \\"negligible\\". According to Phayer, Pius XII \\"preferred to see fascist war criminals on board ships sailing to the New World rather than seeing them rotting in POW camps in zonal Germany\\". Unlike the Vatican emigration operation in Italy that centered on Vatican City, the ratlines of Spain, although \\"fostered by the Vatican,\\" were relatively independent of the hierarchy of the Vatican Emigration Bureau. Roman ratlines =Early efforts: Bishop Hudal= Austrian Catholic bishop Alois Hudal, a Nazi sympathiser, was rector of the Pontificio Istituto Teutonico Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome, a seminary for Austrian and German priests, and \\"Spiritual Director of the German People resident in Italy\\". After the end of the war in Italy, Hudal became active in ministering to German-speaking prisoners of war and internees then held in camps throughout Italy. In December 1944, the Vatican Secretariat of State received permission to appoint a representative to \\"visit the German-speaking civil internees in Italy\\", a job assigned to Hudal. Hudal used this position to aid the escape of wanted Nazi war criminals, including Franz Stangl, commanding officer of Treblinka; Gustav Wagner, commanding officer of Sobibor; Alois Brunner, responsible for the Drancy internment camp near Paris and in charge of deportations in Slovakia to German concentration camps; Erich Priebke, who was responsible for the Ardeatine Massacre; and Adolf Eichmann—a fact about which he was later unashamedly open. Some of these wanted men were being held in internment camps: generally without identity papers, they would be enrolled in camp registers under false names. Other Nazis hid in Italy and sought Hudal out as his role in assisting escapes became known on the Nazi grapevine. In his memoirs, Hudal said of his actions, \\"I thank God that He [allowed me] to visit and comfort many victims in their prisons and concentration camps and to help them escape with false identity papers.\\"Hudal, Römische Tagebücher He explained that in his eyes: > The Allies' War against Germany was not a crusade, but the rivalry of > economic complexes for whose victory they had been fighting. This so-called > business ... used catchwords like democracy, race, religious liberty and > Christianity as a bait for the masses. All these experiences were the reason > why I felt duty bound after 1945 to devote my whole charitable work mainly > to former National Socialists and Fascists, especially to so-called 'war > criminals'. According to Mark Aarons and John Loftus in their book Unholy Trinity, Hudal was the first Catholic priest to dedicate himself to establishing escape routes. Aarons and Loftus claim that Hudal provided the objects of his charity with money to help them escape and, more importantly, provided them with false papers, including identity documents issued by the Vatican Refugee Organisation (Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza). These Vatican papers were not full passports and thus were not enough to gain passage overseas. They were, rather, the first stop in a paper trail—they could be used to obtain a displaced person passport from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which in turn could be used to apply for visas. In theory, the ICRC would perform background checks on passport applicants, but in practice the word of a priest or particularly a bishop would be good enough. According to statements collected by Austrian writer Gitta Sereny from a senior official of the Rome branch of the ICRC, Hudal could also use his position as a bishop to request papers from the ICRC \\"made out according to his specifications\\". Sereny's sources also revealed an active illicit trade in stolen and forged ICRC papers in Rome at the time. According to declassified U.S. intelligence reports, Hudal was not the only priest helping Nazi escapees at this time. In the \\"La Vista Report\\" declassified in 1984, Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) operative Vincent La Vista told how he had easily arranged for two bogus Hungarian refugees to get false ICRC documents with the help of a letter from a Father Joseph Gallov. Gallov, who ran a Vatican-sponsored charity for Hungarian refugees, asked no questions and wrote a letter to his \\"personal contact in the International Red Cross, who then issued the passports\\". =San Girolamo ratline= According to Aarons and Loftus, Hudal's private operation was small scale compared to what came later. The major Roman ratline was operated by a small, but influential network of Croatian priests, members of the Franciscan order, led by Father Krunoslav Draganović, who organized a highly sophisticated chain with headquarters at the San Girolamo degli Illirici Seminary College in Rome, but with links from Austria to the final embarcation point at the port of Genoa. The ratline initially focused on aiding members of the Croatian Ustaše including its leader (or Poglavnik), Ante Pavelić. Priests active in the chain included: Fr. Vilim Cecelja, former Deputy Military Vicar to the Ustaše, based in Austria where many Ustashe and Nazi refugees remained in hiding; Fr. Dragutin Kamber, based at San Girolamo; Fr. Dominik Mandić, an official Vatican representative at San Girolamo and also \\"General Economist\\" or treasurer of the Franciscan order - who used this position to put the Franciscan press at the ratline's disposal; and Monsignor Karlo Petranović, based in Genoa. Vilim would make contact with those hiding in Austria and help them across the border to Italy; Kamber, Mandić and Draganović would find them lodgings, often in the monastery itself, while they arranged documentation; finally Draganović would phone Petranović in Genoa with the number of required berths on ships leaving for South America (see below). The operation of the Draganović ratline was an open secret among the intelligence and diplomatic communities in Rome. As early as August 1945, Allied commanders in Rome were asking questions about the use of San Girolamo as a \\"haven\\" for Ustaše. A year later, a US State Department report of 12 July 1946 lists nine war criminals, including Albanians and Montenegrins as well as Croats, plus others \\"not actually sheltered in the COLLEGIUM ILLIRICUM [i.e., San Girolamo degli Illirici] but who otherwise enjoy Church support and protection.\\" The British envoy to the Holy See, Sir D'Arcy Osborne, asked Domenico Tardini, a high-ranking Vatican official, for permission that would have allowed British military police to raid ex-territorial Vatican Institutions in Rome. Tardini declined and denied the church was sheltering war criminals. In February 1947, CIC Special Agent Robert Clayton Mudd reported ten members of Pavelić's Ustaša cabinet living either in San Girolamo or in the Vatican itself. Mudd had infiltrated an agent into the monastery and confirmed that it was \\"honeycombed with cells of Ustashe operatives\\" guarded by \\"armed youths\\". Mudd reported: > It was further established that these Croats travel back and forth from the > Vatican several times a week in a car with a chauffeur whose license plate > bears the two initials CD, \\"Corpo Diplomatico\\". It issues forth from the > Vatican and discharges its passengers inside the Monastery of San Geronimo. > Subject to diplomatic immunity it is impossible to stop the car and discover > who are its passengers. Mudd's conclusion was the following: > DRAGANOVIC's sponsorship of these Croat Ustashes definitely links him up > with the plan of the Vatican to shield these ex-Ustasha nationalists until > such time as they are able to procure for them the proper documents to > enable them to go to South America. The Vatican, undoubtedly banking on the > strong anti-Communist feelings of these men, is endeavoring to infiltrate > them into South America in any way possible to counteract the spread of Red > doctrine. It has been reliably reported, for example that Dr. VRANCIC has > already gone to South America and that Ante PAVELIC and General KREN are > scheduled for an early departure to South America through Spain. All these > operations are said to have been negotiated by DRAGANOVIC because of his > influence in the Vatican. The existence of Draganović's ratline has been supported by a highly respected historian of Vatican diplomacy, Fr. Robert Graham: \\"I've no doubt that Draganović was extremely active in syphoning off his Croatian Ustashe friends.\\" Graham claimed that Draganović, in running his 'ratline,' was not acting on behalf of the Vatican: \\"Just because he's a priest doesn't mean he represents the Vatican. It was his own operation.\\" At the same time, there were four occasions in which the Vatican did intervene on behalf of interned Ustasha prisoners. The Secretariat of State asked the UK and US governments to release Croatian POWs from British internment camps in Italy. =U.S. intelligence involvement= If at first U.S. intelligence officers had been mere observers of the Draganović ratline, this changed in the summer of 1947. A now declassified U.S. Army intelligence report from 1950 sets out in detail the history of the people-smuggling operation in the three years to follow.\\"History of the Italian Rat Line\\" (10 April 1950), document signed by \\"IB Operating Officer\\" Paul E. Lyon, 430th Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), Headquarters of the U.S. Forces in Austria. , from the original, jasenovac- info.com; accessed 4 August 2017. According to the report, from this point on U.S. forces themselves had begun to use Draganović's established network to evacuate its own \\"visitors\\". As the report put it, these were \\"visitors who had been in the custody of the 430th CIC and completely processed in accordance with current directives and requirements, and whose continued residence in Austria constituted a security threat as well as a source of possible embarrassment to the Commanding General of USFA, since the Soviet Command had become aware that their presence in U.S. Zone of Austria and in some instances had requested the return of these persons to Soviet custody\\". These were suspected war criminals from areas occupied by the Red Army which the U.S. was obliged to hand over for trial to the Soviets. The U.S. reputedly was reluctant to do so, partly due to a belief that fair trials could hardly be expected in the USSR (see Operation Keelhaul), and at the same time, their desire to make use of Nazi scientists and other resources. The deal with Draganović involved getting the visitors to Rome: \\"Dragonovich handled all phases of the operation after the defectees arrived in Rome, such as the procurement of IRO Italian and South American documents, visas, stamps, arrangements for disposition, land or sea, and notification of resettlement committees in foreign lands\\". United States intelligence used these methods in order to get important Nazi scientists and military strategists, to the extent they had not already been claimed by the Soviet Union, to their own centres of military science in the US. Many Nazi scientists were employed by the U.S., retrieved in Operation Paperclip. =Argentine connection= > In Nuremberg at that time something was taking place that I personally > considered a disgrace and an unfortunate lesson for the future of humanity. > I became certain that the Argentine people also considered the Nuremberg > process a disgrace, unworthy of the victors, who behaved as if they hadn't > been victorious.

In his 2002 book, The Real Odessa, Argentine researcher Uki Goñi used new access to the country's archives to show that Argentine diplomats and intelligence officers had, on Perón's instructions, vigorously encouraged Nazi and fascist war criminals to make their home in Argentina. According to Goñi, the Argentines not only collaborated with Draganović's ratline, they set up further ratlines of their own running through Scandinavia, Switzerland and Belgium. According to Goñi, Argentina's first move into Nazi smuggling was in January 1946, when Argentine bishop Antonio Caggiano, leader of the Argentine chapter of Catholic Action flew with another bishop, Agustín Barrére, to Rome where Caggiano was due to be anointed Cardinal. In Rome the Argentine bishops met with French Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, where they passed on a message (recorded in Argentina's diplomatic archives) that \\"the Government of the Argentine Republic was willing to receive French persons, whose political attitude during the recent war would expose them, should they return to France, to harsh measures and private revenge\\". Over the spring of 1946, a number of French war criminals, fascists and Vichy officials made it from Italy to Argentina in the same way: they were issued passports by the Rome ICRC office; these were then stamped with Argentine tourist visas (the need for health certificates and return tickets was waived on Caggiano's recommendation). The first documented case of a French war criminal arriving in Buenos Aires was Émile Dewoitine, who was later sentenced in absentia to 20 years hard labour. He sailed first class on the same ship back with Cardinal Caggiano. Shortly after this Argentinian Nazi smuggling became institutionalised, according to Goñi, when Perón's new government of February 1946 appointed anthropologist Santiago Peralta as Immigration Commissioner and former Ribbentrop agent Ludwig Freude as his intelligence chief. Goñi argues that these two then set up a \\"rescue team\\" of secret service agents and immigration \\"advisors\\", many of whom were themselves European war-criminals, with Argentine citizenship and employment. In 2014, over 700 FBI documents were declassified revealing that the US government had undertaken an investigation in the late 1940s and 1950s as to the reports of the possible escape of Adolf Hitler from Germany. Some leads purported that he had not committed suicide in Berlin but had fled Germany in 1945, and eventually arrived in Argentina via Spain. Within the pages of these documents are statements, naming people and places involved in Hitler's alleged journey from Germany to South America including mention of the ratlines that were already in existence. Additional CIA documents contain reported sightings and a photograph of a man alleged to be Hitler in 1954. The claim related to the photograph made by a self-proclaimed former German SS trooper named Phillip Citroen that Hitler was still alive, and that he \\"left Colombia for Argentina around January 1955.\\" The CIA report states that neither the contact who reported his conversations with Citroen, nor the CIA station was \\"in a position to give an intelligent evaluation of the information\\". The station chief's superiors told him that \\"enormous efforts could be expended on this matter with remote possibilities of establishing anything concrete\\", and the investigation was dropped.Selk, Avi (20 May 2018) \\"Scientists say Hitler died in WWII. Tell that to ‘Adolf Schüttelmayor’ and the Nazi moon base.\\" The Washington Post ODESSA and the Gehlen Organization The Italian and Argentine ratlines have only been confirmed relatively recently, mainly due to research in newly declassified archives. Until the work of Aarons and Loftus, and of Uki Goñi (2002), a common view was that ex-Nazis themselves, organised in secret networks, ran the escape routes alone. The most famous such network is ODESSA (Organisation of former SS members), founded in 1946 according to Simon Wiesenthal, which included SS-Obersturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny and Sturmbannführer Alfred Naujocks and, in Argentina, Rodolfo Freude. Alois Brunner, former commandant of Drancy internment camp near Paris, escaped to Rome, then Syria, by ODESSA. Brunner was thought to be the highest-ranking Nazi war criminal still alive as of 2007. Persons claiming to represent ODESSA claimed responsibility for the unsuccessful July 9, 1979, car bombing in France aimed at Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld. According to Paul Manning, \\"eventually, over 10,000 former German military made it to South America along escape routes ODESSA and Deutsche Hilfsverein...\\"Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile Lyle Stuart, Inc. (1980); (page 181) Simon Wiesenthal, who advised Frederick Forsyth on the early 1970s novel/film script The Odessa File which brought the name to public attention, also names other Nazi escape organisations such as Spinne (\\"Spider\\") and Sechsgestirn (\\"Constellation of Six\\"). Wiesenthal describes these immediately after the war as Nazi cells based in areas of Austria where many Nazis had retreated and gone to ground. Wiesenthal claimed that the ODESSA network shepherded escapees to the Catholic ratlines in Rome (although he mentions only Hudal, not Draganović); or through a second route through France and into Francoist Spain.Wiesenthal 1989.George Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1989 - particularly chapter 6, \\"Odessa\\". ODESSA was supported by the Gehlen Organization, which employed many former Nazi party members, and was headed by Reinhard Gehlen, a former German Army intelligence officer employed post-war by the CIA. The Gehlen Organization became the nucleus of the BND German intelligence agency, directed by Reinhard Gehlen from its 1956 creation until 1968. Ratline escapees Some of the Nazis and war criminals who escaped using ratlines include: *Andrija Artuković, escaped to the United States; arrested in 1984 after decades of delay and extradited to Yugoslavia, where he died in 1988 from natural causes *Klaus Barbie, fled to Bolivia in 1951 with help from the United States, as he had been an agent of the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps since April 1947; captured in 1983; died in prison in France on September 23, 1991 *Alois Brunner, fled to Syria in 1954; died around 2001 *Herberts Cukurs, fled to Brazil in 1945, assassinated by Mossad in Uruguay in 1965. *Adolf Eichmann, fled to Argentina in 1950; captured 1960; executed in Israel on 1 June 1962 *Aribert Heim, disappeared in 1962; most likely died in Egypt in 1992 * Sándor Képíró, fled to Argentina, returned to Hungary in 1996.

He was tried and found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, serving a 20 year sentence. He died in 2008. *Franz Stangl, fled to Brazil in 1951; arrested in 1967 and extradited to West Germany; died in 1971 of heart failure *Gustav Wagner, fled to Brazil in 1950; arrested 1978; committed suicide 1980 See also *Aunt Anna's, a safe house, in Merano, Italy, often used by Nazi and SS members *Catholic clergy involvement with the Ustaše *Die Spinne *Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act *Operation Bloodstone *U.S. intelligence involvement with German and Japanese war criminals after World War II References Notes Bibliography  * * Sachslehner, Johannes (2019).

There are two strains: the Lower Guinea strain and the Zaire strain. S. intercalatum is one of the major agents of the rectal form of schistosomiasis, also called bilharzia. It is a trematode, and being part of the genus Schistosoma, it is commonly referred to as a blood-fluke since the adult resides in blood vessels. Humans are the definitive host and two species of freshwater snail make up the intermediate host, Bulinus forskalii for the Lower Guinea strain and Bulinus africanus for the Zaire strain.Tchuem Tchuenté LA, Southgate, VR, Jourdane J, Webster BL, Vercruysse J (2003) Schistosoma intercalatum: an endangered species in Cameroon? Trends Parasitol 19: 141-153.  Morphology  The clinically defining characteristic of most schistosome species are their eggs' size and shape. The eggs of Schistosoma intercalatum have a terminal spine and tend to be moderately larger than those of S. haematobium (approximately 130 × 75 μm). The origin of the name 'intercalatum' is from the observation that their eggs are of an intermediate range between the smaller S. haematobium and larger S. bovis.Fisher AC (1934) Study of the schistosomiasis of the Stanleyville district of the Belgian Congo. T Roy Soc Trop Med H 28: 277-306. These eggs are unique because they will stain red when exposed to the Ziehl-Neelsen technique, aiding in identification.Southgate VR (1976) Schistosomiasis at Loum, Cameroun. Parasitol Res 49: 145-159. When viewed using scanning electron microscopy, it can be observed that the S. intercalatum's surface has a much lower amount of integumental elevations, or bosses, than S. mansoni. This feature is consistent with the tegument appearance of other terminally spined schistosomes.Kuntz RE (1977) Scanning electron microscopy of intergumental surfaces of Schistosoma intercalatum. J Parasitol 63: 401-406. Life cycle Schistosoma intercalatum's life cycle is very similar to that of S. haematobium, except for some key differences. To start the life cycle, the human host releases eggs with its feces. In water, the eggs hatch to become miracidia, which penetrate the freshwater snail intermediate host.\\"Parasites - Schistosomiasis\\" [Internet]. Atlanta (GA): Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [updated 2010 Nov 2; cited 2011 Nov 7] Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/disease.html S. intercalatum has two major strains, each with its own preferred bulinid host. The Zaire strain will use Bulinus africanus, while the Lower Guinea strain will use the extremely common B. forskalii as its intermediate host.Jourdane J, Southgate VR, Pagès JR, Durand P, Tchuem Tchuenté LA (2001) Recent studies on Schistosoma intercalatum: taxonomic status, puzzling distribution and transmission foci revisited. Mem I Oswaldo Cruz 96: 45-8. The miracidia penetrate the snail tissue, and inside they become sporocysts and multiply. The sporocysts then mature into cercariae inside the snail host and are ready to leave. The cercariae are free-swimming in the surrounding water until they find their definitive host: a human. If there is a small temperature change, the cercariae of S. intercalatum will form concentrated aggregates near the surface of the water. This mechanism for body heat detection of a potential host restricts the formation of viable cercariae to small streams and slow moving bodies of water because of their high sensitivity. The cercariae penetrate through the human's skin and lose their tail, becoming schistosomulae. The schistosomulae then migrate to the hepatic portal system of the liver to mature into adults. As adults, they make their way to the inferior mesenteric vein and mate, producing thousands of eggs. These eggs migrate down to the mesenteric venules of the colon and form polyps as the eggs attempt to cross into the lumen. S. intercalatum's eggs are specific to the colon, making them unique among the infectious African schistosomes.Rodriguez-Guardado A, Miquel R, Pérez R, Fresno M, Corachán M (2010) Colonic polyposis due to Schistosoma intercalatum. T Roy Soc Trop Med H 104: 443-5. Epidemiology S. intercalatum is at risk of endangerment in large part due to the introduction of invasive species into its native habitat. Since 1973, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium have been found in places that have been traditionally inhabited by S. intercalatum. This is thought to be because of the increase in transportation accessibility and the increase in forestry jobs in these habitats. Male S. mansoni and S. haematobium will both take priority over S. intercalatum when it comes to mate selection, leading to a smaller proportion of female S. intercalatum available for mating. While crosses with S. mansoni give no viable offspring, the pairing with a male S. haematobium will result in a hybrid organism. Most hybrids will have a diluted genome that is more closely related to S. haematobium, helping to bring about a decline in S. intercalatum populations. The other obstacle restricting the parasite's population growth is its selective distribution. The cercariae are very particular over where they develop, needing small, forested areas with streams to infect their human host. There are only a few of these regions in Africa, and they decrease in size every day due to deforestation. =Prevalence= In 2009, there were an estimated 200 million human infections of schistosomiasis.\\"Weekly Epidemiological Record\\" (2011). World Health Organization 86: 73-80. In 1999, the noted number of S. intercalatum infections was 1.73 million.Crompton DW (1999) How much human helminthiasis is there in the world? J Parasitol 85: 397-403. =Distribution= There are two major strains of S. intercalatum, both living in forested areas of Africa. One strain lives in the Congo area, particularly Zaire, and the other strain lives in the Lower Guinea area, mainly in Cameroon.Bjorneboe A (1978) A comparison of the characteristics of two strains of Schistosoma intercalatum Fisher, 1934 in mice. J Helminthol 53: 195-203. Cameroon is a place of scientific interest because it is where all three species of human schistosomes live. Most relevant research conducted on S. intercalatum was performed in, or around, the Loum area in Cameroon. Pathology =Symptoms= Symptoms of all forms of schistosomiasis are caused by the immune system's reaction to the eggs, rather than the adult worms themselves. A few hours to days after cercariae invade the skin, some people experience pruritus and raised papules at the site of penetration. This is called cercarial dermatitis, also known as swimmer's itch. It can last up to a few weeks, although, this stage is usually asymptomatic in local populations.Yamada T, Alpers DH, Kalloo AN, Kaplowitz N, Owyang C, Powell DW, editors (2008). Textbook of Gastroenterology. 5th ed. Hoboken (NJ): Wiley- Blackwell. Parasitic diseases: helminths; p. 2651-2671. S. intercalatum is associated with lower morbidity than the other schistosomes that infect humans. In a study done on schoolchildren in the Republic of São Tomé and Principe in western Africa–where S. intercalatum and S. haematobium are endemic–the only schistosome present in the sample was S. intercalatum, an overall prevalence of 10.9 percent in stool specimens.Almeda J, Corachan M, Soura A, Ascaso C, Carvalho JM, Rollinson D, Southgate VR (1994) Schistosomiasis in the Republic of São Tomé and Principe: human studies. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 88: 406-409. Unlike the more pathogenic species, infection with S. intercalatum is usually only associated with bloody stool, and sometimes splenomegaly. Blood in the stool is caused by \\"inflammation, hypertrophy, and ulceration of the mucosa\\" of the intestine. These signs can be difficult to interpret because effected populations are often infected with multiple intestinal parasites. Clinical presentation of an established S. intercalatum infection can be different in the local population and non-immune tourists. The majority of infections of foreign travelers are asymptomatic and go unnoticed.Corachan M (2002) Schistosomiasis and international travel. Clin Infect Dis 35: 446-450. Chronic schistosomiasis results in granulomata forming around eggs in the mesenteric vessels. =Diagnosis= Diagnosis is usually made using clinical and epidemiological information. Infection with S. intercalatum can be distinguished from that of S. mansoni or S. haematobium based on where eggs manifest outside the body and the morphology of the eggs. In Africa, the only species of schistosome are S. intercalatum, S. mansoni, and S. haematobium. S. haematobium causes urinary schistosomiasis, so eggs will be shed in the urine; S. mansoni and S. intercalatum reside in the mesenteric venous plexus, so eggs will be shed in the feces. Looking at the stool specimen under a microscope, the species can be distinguished; S. intercalatum eggs have a terminal spine (as seen in the figure above) and S. mansoni eggs have a lateral spine.\\"Diagnostic Findings: Schistosomiasis\\" [Internet]. Atlanta (GA): Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [updated 2010 Jan 7; cited 2011 Nov 7] Available from: http://dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/Frames/S-Z/Schistosomiasis/body_Schistosomiasis_mic1.htm Serologic testing looks for the presence of antibodies against the adult schistosome in the blood. This can only take place 6 to 8 weeks after initial infection in order for the parasite to reach the adult stage and the immune system to produce antibodies against it. However, serologic testing is not useful for patients with previous infections. =Treatment= Praziquantel is an effective treatment against all species of Schistosoma that infect humans. Administering treatment at the correct time is important since the drug only works against the adult worm and there must be a strong antibody response from the immune system. Thus, it should be administered 6 to 8 weeks after suspected infection (contact with infested freshwater). There has been limited evidence on possible drug resistance among the schistosomes due to reports of low cure rates. Oxaminiquine is another treatment for schistosomiasis, but it is not widely available, nor is it routinely used.

It is also used in anti-fungal wallboards as a mixture with azoxystrobin. = Parasiticide = As an antiparasitic, tiabendazole is able to control roundworms (such as those causing strongyloidiasis), hookworms, and other helminth species which infect wild animals, livestock, and humans. = Other = In dogs and cats, tiabendazole is used to treat ear infections. Tiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead, mercury, or antimony poisoning.  Research  Genes responsible for the maintenance of cell walls in yeast have been shown to be responsible for angiogenesis in vertebrates. Tiabendazole serves to block angiogenesis in both frog embryos and human cells. It has also been shown to serve as a vascular disrupting agent to reduce newly established blood vessels. Tiabendazole has been shown to effectively do this in certain cancer cells.  Pharmacodynamics  Tiabendazole works by inhibition of the mitochondrial, helminth-specific enzyme, fumarate reductase, with possible interaction with endogenous quinone.  Safety  The substance appears to have a slight toxicity in higher doses, with effects such as liver and intestinal disorders at high exposure in test animals (just below level). Some reproductive disorders and decreasing weaning weight have been observed, also at high exposure. Effects on humans from use as a drug include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, or headache; very rarely also ringing in the ears, vision changes, stomach pain, yellowing eyes and skin, dark urine, fever, fatigue, increased thirst and change in the amount of urine occur. Carcinogenic effects have been shown at higher doses.  Synthesis  Intermediate arylamidine 2 is prepared by aluminium trichloride-catalyzed addition of aniline to the nitrile of 4-cyanothiazole (1).L. H. Sarett, H. D. Brown, (1967 to Merck & Co.) The amidine (2) is then converted to its N-chloro derivative 3 with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Upon treatment with base, this undergoes a nitrene insertion reaction (4) to produce tiabendazole (5). Tiabendazole synthesis An alternative synthesis involves reacting 4-thiazolecarboxamide with o-phenylenediamine in polyphosphoric acid. =Derivatives= A number of derivatives of tiabendazole are also pharmaceutical drugs, including albendazole, cambendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, mebendazole, and flubendazole.

Born in Barcelona, Serna has performed in 20 countries in six languages and is the recipient of more than 20 international awards. Biography Serna was born in Barcelona, Spain. She studied law until she was 19, after which she \\"preferred being an anarchist\\" and joined the Barcelona's School of Dramatic Arts. In 1993, she married her co-star in Sharpe's Company, Scott Cleverdon, who portrayed Lieutenant Harry Price in the film. Acting career In her career as an actress, Serna felt she was more successful in foreign countries than in her own country. Speaking in a 2016 interview, she said: =Film= Serna is known for her starring role in I, the Worst of All (1990) portraying the Mexican religious scholar Sor Juana. She co-starred with Antonio Banderas in Matador (1986), one of the first films by Pedro Almodóvar, and she appeared in such films as Wild Orchid (1990), Chain of Desire (1992), Nostradamus (1994), The Shooter (1995), The Craft (1996) and Kiss & Tell (1997). Although she predominantly played European roles, Serna has also played Colombians in the films Managua with Louis Gossett Jr. and Drug Wars in Michael Mann's series. Her most recent movie is ¡He matado a mi marido! (filmed October–November 2016) directed by Francisco Lupini, with María Conchita Alonso and Eduardo Yáñez. =Television= On the small screen, Serna is known for playing a Spanish guerrilla in the first four of ITV's Sharpe series of television films based on the novels of Bernard Cornwell, Anna Cellini in Falcon Crest and portraying Catherine of Aragon in Henry VIII opposite Helena Bonham Carter and Ray Winstone. She also acted on the popular Spanish TV series Aquí no hay quien viva. From 2011 to 2014, Serna played one of the female leads, Vannozza dei Cattanei, mistress of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, in Tom Fontana's historical drama Borgia. She co-produced with Wildcard UK a documentary called Fresco Fiasco and acted in the movie Behold the Monkey, two films about the famous restoration of the Ecce Homo which attracted more than 200,000 visitors from 170 countries to the little town of Borja to see the painting. Both projects were seen in February 2016 on the Sky Arts network in the UK. Educator and other work Serna has written two books on acting technique: Screen acting or El trabajo del actor de cine (1999), which was the first book to be written in Spanish regarding the craft of film-acting, and Monologues in V.O. (2001), a resource for auditioning actors. Serna currently teaches courses on communication and leadership in English and Spanish. Serna and Cleverdon developed the first university Master course for actors on \\"Screenacting\\". With the collaboration of more than 70 international organizations and workshops around the world, they teach the courses \\"Directing Actors\\" and \\"The Script and the Actor\\". They formed Fundación First Team and, since 2000, have taught 4,000 students in 6 countries in collaboration with various film schools and film festivals. The last workshop was at the Guadalajara International Film Festival in Mexico. Foundation First Team always include disabled and under-privileged people in their courses. Through Foundation First Team, Serna has published First Female directors of Spanish movies, written by Conchita Martínez Tejedor. Serna served as President of AISGE (Actores e Intérpretes – Sociedad de Gestión de España), Spain's society of managing intellectual property rights for actors. She has volunteered in many organizations, such as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), where for four years she helped select foreign movies for the Oscars. She was a board member of the European Film Academy (EFA) for eight years, and raised 1.8 million euros to bring the European film awards to Catalunya in 2004.

He holds the most victories ever achieved by a Filipino boxer and is also the only boxer from the Philippines to become world champion in the middleweight division. Garcia is commonly credited to as the first well known user of the bolo punch, which was later popularized by Cuban fighter Kid Gavilán. He was inducted into the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 1977 and the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1989. Early life Ceferino Garcia was the son of Fortunato Garcia and Pascuala Montano and was the oldest of six children. He never completed first grade and indulged rather frequently in gambling. At 17, he was feared by so many that nobody would take him in a street fight. He was also a skilled blacksmith. Boxing success While working at a bakery in Cebu City, Garcia met a boxing promoter. This was where his career as boxer started. On September 23, 1937, Garcia first had a shot for a world title in the welterweight division. However, Barney Ross bested him by unanimous decision. On October 2, 1939, Garcia fought Fred Apostoli for the world Middleweight title in the United States and won it by TKO in the 7th round. He defended that title three times until he lost to Ken Overlin on points. He was managed, during the final years of his career by George Parnassus. Life after boxing After retiring from the ring he made a few uncredited appearances in Hollywood films with the exception of \\"Joe Palooka, Champ\\" in which he plays himself.Ceferino García - Internet Movie Database (IMDb) He was also employed for a time by actress Mae West as her chauffeur and bodyguard.

It is found in Africa and the Middle East. It is the major agent of schistosomiasis, the most prevalent parasitic infection in humans. It is the only blood fluke that infects the urinary tract, causing urinary schistosomiasis, and is the leading cause of bladder cancer (only next to tobacco smoking). The diseases are caused by the eggs. Adults are found in the venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs travels to the wall of the urine bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as hydronephrosis. Inflammation of the genitals due to S. haematobium may contribute to the propagation of HIV. S. haematobium was the first blood fluke discovered. Theodor Bilharz, a German surgeon working in Cairo, identified the parasite as a causative agent of urinary infection in 1851. After the discoverer, the infection (generally including all schistosome infections) was called bilharzia or bilharziasis. Along with other helminth parasites Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini, S. haematobium was declared as Group 1 (extensively proven) carcinogens by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans in 2009. History Bloody urine (haematurea) was recorded by Ancient Egyptians in papyri 5,000 years ago. They called it Aaa. The first scientific report was by Marc Armand Ruffer, a British physician in Egypt, in 1910. He discovered parasite eggs from two mummies, which were dated to around 1250–1000 BC. The oldest infection known to date was revealed using ELISA, which is more than 5,000 years old. In 1851, Theodor Maximillian Bilharz, a German physician at the Kasr el-Aini Hospital in Cairo recovered the adult fluke from a dead soldier. He named it Distomum haematobium, for its apparent two mouths (now called ventral and oral suckers) and habitat of the blood vessel. He published the formal description in 1852. The genus Distomum (literally \\"two-mouthed\\") was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for all flukes; hence, it was not specific. Another German physician Heinrich Meckel von Hemsbach introduced a new name Bilharzia haematobium in 1856 to honour the discoverer. He also introduced the medical term bilharzia or bilharziasis to describe the infection. Unbeknown to von Hemsbach, a German zoologist David Friedrich Weinland established a new genus Schistosoma in 1858. After almost a century of taxonomic dispute, Schistosoma was validated by ICZN in 1954; thereby validating the name Schistosoma haematobium. The infectious nature was discovered by British physician Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915. He successfully infected mice, rats, guinea pigs, and monkey using cercariae from four species of snails, belonging to Bullinus (now Bulinus) and Planorbis, which were collected from El Marg canal near Cairo; proving that snails are the intermediate hosts. Its role in cancer was first noted by a British Surgeon Reginald Harrison, at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, in 1889. He recorded that four people out of five cancer victims had bilharzia. A German physician Carl Goebel confirmed in 1903 that bladder tumour occurred in most bilharzia patients. By 1905, he was convinced that carcinoma of bladder was due to bilharzia. After decades of assessing the medical reports, it was finally declared by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans in 2009 that S. haematobium is Group 1 carcinogen. Structure Adult Schistosoma haematobium has male and female, which are permanently paired (a condition called in copula) as what looks like an individual. The male forms the flatworm part, measuring 10–18 mm in length and 1 mm in width. It bears oral and ventral suckers towards its anterior end. Its leaf-like flat body is curled up from both sides to form a channel or groove called gynaecophoric canal in which the female is wrapped up. Thus, it gives the general appearance of a cylindrical roundworm body. Only the extreme anterior and posterior ends of the female are exposed. In contrast to the male, a female exhibits every feature of a roundworm. It is cylindrical and elongated, measuring about 20 mm in length and 0.25 mm in width. Its pathogenic armament, the eggs are oval-shaped, measuring 144 × 58 µm in diameter, with characteristic terminal spine. This is an important diagnostic tool because co-infection with S. mansoni (having a lateral-spined eggs) is common. The miracidium measures about 136 μm long and 55 μm wide. The body is covered by anucleate epidermal plates separated by epidermal ridges. The epidermal cells give off numerous hair-like cilia on the body surface. Epidermal plate is absent only at the extreme anterior called apical papilla, or terebratorium, which contains numerous sensory organelles. Its internal body is almost fully filled with glycogen particles and vesicles. The ceraria has a characteristic bifurcated tail, classically called furcae (Latin for fork); hence, the name (derived from a Greek word κέρκος, kerkos, meaning tail). The body is pear-shaped and measures 0.24 mm in length and 0.1 mm in width. Its tegument is fully covered with spine. A conspicuous oral sucker is at the tip of the body.  Life cycle  Life cycle of S. haematobium. S. haematobium completes it life cycle in humans, as definitive hosts, and freshwater snails, as intermediate hosts, just like other schistosomes. But unlike other schistosomes that release eggs in the intestine, it releases its eggs in the urinary tract and excrete along with the urine. In stagnant freshwater, the eggs hatch within 15 minutes into the larvae called miracidia. Each miracidium is either male or female. Miracidia are covered with hair-like cilia with which actively swims searching for snails. Unless they infect a snail within 24–28 hours, they run out of energy (glycogen) reserves and die. Species of snail belonging to the genus Bulinus, including B. globosus, B. forskalii, B. nasutus, B. nyassanus, and B. truncatus, can harbour the miracidia. The miracidia simply pierce through the soft skin of the snail and move to the liver. Inside the snail, their cilia is cast off and extra-epithelial covering forms within 24 hours. Then they transform into sporocysts and undergo active cell division after two weeks. The mother sporocyst produces many daughter sporocysts. Each daughter sporocyst forms new larvae called cercariae. One mother sporocyst produces half a million cercariae. After a month, the sporocysts rupture and cercariae are liberated. Free cercariae penetrate the liver and move out of the snail into water. Each cercaria has a biforked tail with which it swims to find a human host. Again the cercariae are short lived and can survive in water for 4–6 days unless they find a human host. When human comes in contact with an infested water, the cercariae attach themselves on the skin using their suckers. After proper orientation, they start piercing the skin by secreting proteolytic enzymes that widen the skin pores (hair follicles). This process takes about 3–5 minutes and produces itching, but by then, they have penetrated the skin. Their tails are removed during the penetration such that only the head parts enter. When they enter the blood vessels, they are known as schisotomulae. They enter the systemic system to reach the heart and then the liver, and along the way many are killed by the immune cells. Survivors enter the liver within 24 hours. From the liver they enter the portal vein to reach different parts of the body. Unlike other species again, the schistosomulae of S. haematobium reach the vesical vessels through anastomotic channels between radicles of the inferior mesenteric vein and pelvic veins. After living inside small venules in the submucosa and wall of the bladder, they migrate to the perivesical venous plexus (a group of veins at the lower portion of the bladder) to attain full maturation. To evade detection by the host's immune system, the adults have the ability to coat themselves with host antigen. Individuals sort out opposite sexes. The female body becomes enveloped within the rolled-up gynaecophoric canal of the male; thus, becoming partners for life. Sexual maturation is attained after 4–6 weeks of initial infection. A female generally lays 500-1,000 eggs in a day. The female only leaves the male briefly for laying eggs. It has to because only it can enter the small and narrow peripheral venule in the submucosa so that the eggs can be released into the bladder. The embryonated eggs penetrate the bladder mucosa using proteolytic enzymes, aided by their terminal spines and by the contraction of the bladder. The enzyme is a toxin specifically for damaging (necrosis) the tissue. Under normal situation, the eggs released into the bladder do not cause pathological symptoms. But eggs often fail to penetrate the bladder mucosa and remain trapped in the bladder wall; it is these which produce the lesions by releasing their antigens and provoking granuloma formation. Granulomata in turn coalesce to form tubercles, nodules or masses that often ulcerate. This is the condition behind the pathological lesions found in the bladder wall, ureter and renal; and also tumour, both benign and malignant. The fluke continuously lays eggs throughout their life. An average lifespan is 3–4 years.  Diagnosis  Traditionally, diagnoses has been made by examination of the urine for eggs. In chronic infections, or if eggs are difficult to find, an intradermal injection of schistosome antigen to form a wheal is effective in determining infection. Alternatively diagnosis can be made by complement fixation tests. , commercial blood tests included ELISA and an Indirect immunofluorescence test, but these have low sensitivity ranging from 21% to 71%.  Prevention  The main cause of schistomiasis is the dumping of human waste into water supplies. Hygienic disposal of waste would be sufficient to eliminate the disease. Water for drinking and bathing should be boiled in endemic regions. Infested water should be avoided. However, agricultural activities such as fishing and rice cultivation involve long contact with water, making avoidance impractical. Systematic eradication of snails is an effective method.  Pathology  Egg of S. haematobium. Note the pointed spine on the left tip. Normal infection of adults does not produce symptoms. When eggs are released, they sometimes become permanently stuck in the bladder and cause pathological symptoms. The eggs are initially deposited in the muscularis propria which leads to ulceration of the overlaying tissue. Infections are characterized by pronounced acute inflammation, squamous metaplasia, blood and reactive epithelial changes. Granulomas and multinucleated giant cells may be seen. The eggs induce a granulomatous host immune response which is indicated by lymphocytes (which mainly produce T-helper-2 cytokines such as interleukins 4, 5, and 13), eosinophils, and, also activated macrophages. This granuloma formation induces chronic inflammation. In response to infection, the hosts' antibodies bind to the tegument of the schistosome. But they are quickly removed the tegument itself is shed every few hours. The schistosome can also take on host proteins. Schistomiasis can be divided into three phases: (1) the migratory phase lasting from penetration to maturity,(2) the acute phase which occurs when the schistosomes begin producing eggs, and (3) the chronic phase which occurs mainly in endemic areas. In late stage, the infection may lead to extra- urinary complication named Bilharzial cor pulmonale. The distinct symptom for urogenital schistosomiasis is blood in the urine (haematuria), which is often associated with frequent urination, painful micturition, and discomfort in the groin. In endemic regions, haematuria is so widespread that it is thought a natural sign of puberty for boys, and is confused with menses in girls. Under serious infection, urinary tract can be blocked leading to obstructive uropathy (hydroureter and hydronephrosis), which can be further complicated by bacterial infection and kidney failure. In the most severe condition, chronic bladder ulcers and bladder carcinoma develop.  Treatment  The drug of choice is praziquantel, a quinolone derivative. But it has low cure rate (only 82-88%). Epidemiology S. hematobium is found in Africa and the Middle East, where infants and young children are most infected. Infection is most prevalent in both the Nile Delta and the Nile Valley South of Cairo. The first epidemiological survey in 1937 indicated that infection rate was as high as 85% among people in the Northern and Eastern parts of the Delta. Following construction of the Aswan Dam, basin irrigation is converted to perennial irrigation system, and this has significantly reduced the infection.

It was first described in 1988 in Peninsular Malaysia and appears to be a zooenotic infection. The species is named after the country of Malaysia. The natural vertebrate host is van Müller's rat (Rattus muelleri). The intermediate hosts are aquatic snails, Robertsiella kaporenisis. Among Robertsiella kaporenisis are two other Roberstiella species. Among humans exposed to this parasite the lifetime incidence appears to be 5-10%.Sagin D.D., Ismail G., Fui J.N., Jok J.J. (2001) Schistosomiasis malayensis-like infection among the Penan and other interior tribes (Orang Ulu) in upper Rejang River Basin Sarawak Malaysia. Southeast Asian J. Trop. Med. Public Health 32(1):27-32 The symptoms are unclear, because the symptoms have never been reported. The disease has been little studied and it is currently considered to be a relatively minor public health problem.  Taxonomy  Schistosoma malayensis is a member of the japonicum species complex along with Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma mekongi. While the three species are grouped together because of their similarity, Schistosoma malayensis is more closely related to Shistosoma mekongi.  Morphology  Size is the only morphological difference compared to its natural host possibly due to host-induced variation. The adult S. malayensis is typically smaller than S. mekongi and S. japonicum. S. malayensis eggs have been found in liver granulomas, embedded within dense, fibrous tissue. The eggs of S. malayensis have a thin-walled, yellowish shell. The eggs contain miracidia and are approximately 50 μm long × 28 μm wide. The ova is not operculated and has no bipolar plugs and the thin covering was not striated.  Epidemiology  Serologic surveys for schistosomiasis due to S. malayensis indicate of 3.9% prevalence in rural populations. It was unsuccessful at adapting to human host. Infected rodents are often found near snail habitats. Infections in humans are unlikely and are considered rare. Humans are most likely to become infected while fishing or canoeing on small streams.  Intermediate Host  Freshwater snails (Robertsiella sp.) act as an intermediate host for S. malayensis, that can infect humans and other mammals when cercaria are released from the snail and eventually get in contact with the definitive host. Robertsiella species are Caenogastropoda snails of the family Pomatiopsidae. This species is known to be located in limestone areas in the foothills of the mountain chains of Kedah and Perak States in West Malaysia.  Definitive Host  The final or definitive mammalian hosts include Rattus muelleri and R. tiomanicus. R. muelleri has been found in lowland secondary, and disturbed primary forests in wet conditions in Western Malaysia. R. muelleri is often found near river banks due to the species prioritization of crustaceans and mollusks over other food sources, such as insects. The predation of mollusks by R. muelleri allows S. malayensis a route into its definitive host. It is possible infected rodents defecate in bodies of water they hunt for prey in, maintaining a constant contamination with S. malayensis eggs and continuing the life cycle.

As a producer, Scott is noted for his work with David Bowie, Supertramp, Devo, Kansas, the Tubes, Ronnie Montrose, Level 42, among others. Scott was also influential in the evolution of jazz rock, pioneering a harder rock sound through his work with Mahavishnu Orchestra, Stanley Clarke, Billy Cobham, Dixie Dregs, and Jeff Beck. Career =Early years= Scott was born in South London, and grew up listening to 78 rpm records of artists like Elvis Presley, Bill Haley, and Eddie Cochran on a wind-up gramophone. In 1959 at the age of 12, he received a tape recorder which he used to record material from the BBC Light Programme Pick of the Pops, but it was an episode of Here Come the Girls, an Alan Freeman-hosted TV show about British female pop artists in recording studios, that first focused Scott's career aspirations as a recording engineer when it featured Carol Deene singing in a recording session from the point of view of Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios, where Malcolm Addey was behind the recording console. =The Abbey Road years= On Saturday, 18 January 1964, Scott wrote letters inquiring about recording engineer job openings and mailed them to several London recording studios. Three days later he was contacted by Abbey Road Studios and subsequently interviewed and offered a position the following day. Scott began working the following Monday at the age of just 16. He received the traditional Abbey Road studio training under engineers like Malcolm Addey and Norman Smith. His first job was in the tape library, and within six months he was promoted to 2nd engineer (known then as a \\"button pusher\\"), where his first session was on side two of the Beatles' album A Hard Days Night. Among the other artists he worked with as a button pusher were Manfred Mann (\\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\" was the first English number 1 hit he worked on), Peter and Gordon, the Hollies, Judy Garland, Johnny Mathis, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, and Peter Sellers. After a short time as an assistant engineer, Scott was promoted to \\"cutting\\" (known as mastering today), where he spent approximately two years cutting not only acetates for artists, but the masters for many of the hits that EMI also distributed at the time, including the American Motown catalogue. In September 1967, Scott was promoted to engineer, where his first session was with the Beatles on their song \\"Your Mother Should Know\\". His first orchestral recording session came a few days later when he recorded the strings, brass and choir for the band's song \\"I Am the Walrus\\". During his time with the Beatles, Scott also worked on the songs \\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"Hello, Goodbye\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\", as well as The Beatles and Magical Mystery Tour albums. Among the notable songs from those albums that he worked on are \\"The Fool on the Hill\\", \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Not Guilty\\", the last of which was recorded for the White Album, but not included on it. As an engineer at Abbey Road, Scott also worked with numerous other artists including the Jeff Beck Group, Pink Floyd, the Pretty Things, Scaffold and Mary Hopkin. In late 1969, shortly after completion of the Procol Harum album A Salty Dog, he left Abbey Road for Trident Studios, at the suggestion of Elton John and producer Gus Dudgeon. =The Trident years= Scott soon found himself working with the Beatles again on their various solo projects, including John Lennon's \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" and \\"Cold Turkey\\", Ringo Starr's \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" and George Harrison's All Things Must Pass. After a short time he took over the mixing of Elton John's Madman Across the Water, after fellow Trident engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable suffered severe injuries in a traffic accident. That led him to work on John's Honky Château and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. Also during this period he reconnected with David Bowie (he had previously worked on Bowie's Man of Words/Man of Music and Man Who Sold the World albums) on a project with Bowie protege Freddie Burretti. By this time Scott wanted to move into production, and Bowie said he was about to start a new album and didn't feel comfortable about solely producing himself, so it was agreed that they would co-produce what became Hunky Dory. After the album was completed, but before it was even released, work began on his next album – The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars – again with Scott as co-producer. Scott went on to co- produce Bowie's Aladdin Sane and Pin Ups albums, as well as the little-seen Midnight Special television program episode \\"The 1980 Floor Show\\". During his time at Trident Studios, Scott also teamed up with Supertramp for Crime of the Century in what amounted to a breakthrough album nearly everywhere in the world except the United States. While most albums were routinely recorded in two weeks at the time, Crime of the Century was an exception, taking a painstaking six months, as Scott and the group sought a precision to the recording and mixing not found in much of the music recorded at the time. Crime of the Century is regularly mentioned as one of the top albums of all time, and was often used as a stereo demonstration record in music stores. The album featured two songs that still get substantial radio play today: \\"Dreamer\\" and \\"Bloody Well Right.\\" The follow-up, Crisis? What Crisis?, attempted to reach those same sonic heights, but it was subject to the limitations of a timetable, because Supertramp had gained a measure of stardom, and a release date and tour had already been planned. The album was also recorded at other studios besides Trident, including Studio D at A&M; Records in Hollywood, the Who's Ramport Studios, and the now defunct Scorpio Studios. Other artists Scott worked with while at Trident included America, Harry Nilsson, Lou Reed, Rick Wakeman, the Rolling Stones, Al Kooper and Lindisfarne, as well as the Clio-winning Coca-Cola ad \\"I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke\\". =Jazz rock= Scott also helped change the sound of the cross-pollination genre known as jazz rock or progressive jazz, adding a much harder edge rock sound (especially to the drums) to albums like Mahavishnu Orchestra's Birds of Fire, Visions of the Emerald Beyond and The Lost Trident Sessions, Billy Cobham's Spectrum, Crosswinds, Total Eclipse, and Shabazz, Stanley Clarke's Stanley Clarke and School Days, and Jeff Beck's There and Back. Although not strictly jazz nor progressive rock, he also worked with the southern fusion band Dixie Dregs (What If and Night of the Living Dregs) and the symphonic progressive band Happy the Man (Happy the Man and Crafty Hands). =Los Angeles= After spending three months in Hollywood recording Supertramp on the A&M; lot, and receiving more production work from the company as a result of the success of Supertramp, Scott decided to permanently move his family to Los Angeles in 1976, just by chance renting a house across the street from Frank Zappa. Subsequent to that move he produced albums with David Batteau, the Tubes, Devo, Kansas, Level 42, Dada and others. At the behest of Zappa's wife Gail, Scott was asked to check out a demo featuring ex- members of Frank's band, Terry Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo, along with Bozzio's wife Dale, who had formed a band eventually to be named Missing Persons. With Scott at the helm, and thanks to massive airplay from the fledgling rock radio station KROQ, the band went on to record one of the biggest selling EPs ever, which eventually led to a deal with Capitol Records, which then released their first album, entitled Spring Session M. When the group was not able to find a suitable manager, Scott also assumed that role. After \\"artistic differences\\" caused a split, he went on to produce and manage other acts including Christine in the Attic and Cock Robin, although neither went on to achieve the level of success of Missing Persons. Scott's previous relationship with Warren Cuccurullo, who went on to join Duran Duran, led to his mixing an MTV Unplugged episode, as well as doing engineering work on the Thank You and Pop Trash albums. In 2000, Scott reunited with former Beatle George Harrison to work on the reissue of his catalogue, included the huge hit All Things Must Pass. He was also responsible for the organization of Harrison's entire tape library during that period. =Current work= Scott continues to be active in the studio and gives talks around the world. In 2012, he released a memoir entitled Abbey Road To Ziggy Stardust, co-written with Bobby Owsinski and published by Alfred Music Publishing. Scott is currently a Senior Professor at Leeds Beckett University's School of Film, Music and Performing Arts.  Personal life  Originally from South London, Scott resided in Los Angeles from 1976 to 2013, then relocated to Nashville. In 2016, Scott and his wife, Cheryl, moved to Hampsthwaite near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in the UK.

Anti-Italianism or Italophobia is a negative attitude regarding Italian people or people with Italian ancestry, often expressed through the use of prejudice, discrimination, or stereotypes. Its opposite is Italophilia. In the United States Anti-Italianism arose among some Americans as an effect of the large-scale immigration of Italians to the United States during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. The majority of Italian immigrants to the United States arrived in waves in the early-twentieth century, many of them from agrarian backgrounds. Nearly all the Italian immigrants were Roman Catholic, as opposed to the nation's Protestant majority. Because the immigrants often lacked formal education, and competed with earlier immigrants for lower-paying jobs and housing, significant hostility developed toward them.Mangione, Jerre and Ben Morreale, La Storia – Five Centuries of the Italian American Experience, Harper Perennial,1992 The established Protestant Americans of Northern European ancestry aggressively displayed and acted upon ethnocentric chauvinism and racism against Italian immigrants, especially in the American South, the population there being overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant. In reaction to the large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe, Congress passed legislation (Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and Immigration Act of 1924) severely restricting immigration from those regions, but putting comparatively less restrictions from Northern European countries. Anti-Italian prejudice was sometimes associated with the anti-Catholic tradition that existed in the United States, which was inherited as a result of Protestant/Catholic European competition and wars, which had been fought between Protestants and Catholics over the preceding three centuries. When the United States was founded, it inherited the anti-Catholic, anti-papal animosity of its original Protestant settlers. Anti-Catholic sentiments in the U.S. reached a peak in the 19th century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the large number of Catholics who were immigrating to the United States. This was due in part to the standard tensions that arise between native-born citizens and immigrants. The resulting anti-Catholic nativist movement, which achieved prominence in the 1840s, led to hostility that resulted in mob violence, including the burning of Catholic property. The Italian immigrants inherited this anti- Catholic hostility upon arrival; however, unlike some of the other Catholic immigrant groups, they generally did not bring with them priests and other religious who could help ease their transition into American life. To remedy this situation, Pope Leo XIII dispatched a contingent of priests, nuns and brothers of the Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo and other orders (among which was Sister Francesca Cabrini), who helped establish hundreds of parishes to serve the needs of the Italian communities, such as Our Lady of Pompeii in New York City. Some of the early 20th-century immigrants from Italy brought with them a political disposition toward socialism and anarchism. This was a reaction to the economic and political conditions which they had experienced in Italy. Such men as Arturo Giovannitti, Carlo Tresca, and Joe Ettor were in the forefront of organising Italians and other immigrant labourers in demanding better working conditions and shorter working hours in the mining, textile, garment, construction and other industries. These efforts often resulted in strikes, which sometimes erupted into violence between the strikers and strike-breakers. The anarchy movement in the United States at that time was responsible for bombings in major cities, and attacks on officials and law enforcement.Bruce Watson, Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream, New York, NY: Viking [2005] As a result of the association of some with the labour and anarchy movements, Italian Americans were branded as \\"labor agitators\\" and radicals by many of the business owners and the upper class of the time, which resulted in further anti-Italian sentiment. The vast majority of Italian immigrants worked hard and lived honest lives, as documented by police statistics of the early- twentieth century in Boston and New York City. Italian immigrants had an arrest rate which was no greater than those of other major immigrant groups.pg. 123, Cleveland Memory As late as 1963, James W. Vander Zander noted that the rate of criminal convictions among Italian immigrants was less than that among American-born whites. A criminal element which was active in some of the Italian immigrant communities which were located in the large eastern cities used extortion, intimidation and threats in order to extract protection money from the wealthier immigrants and shop owners (known as the Black Hand racket), and it was also involved in other illegal activities as well. When the Fascists came to power in Italy, they made the destruction of the Mafia in Sicily a high priority. Hundreds fled to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s in order to avoid prosecution. When the United States enacted prohibition in 1920, the restrictions proved to be an economic windfall for those in the Italian-American community who were already involved in illegal activities, as well as those who had fled from Sicily. They smuggled liquor into the country, wholesaled and sold it through a network of outlets and speakeasies. While members of other ethnic groups were also deeply involved in these illegal bootlegging activities, and the associated violence between groups, Italian Americans were among the most notorious.Fox, Stephen, Blood and Power, William Morrow and Co., 1989 Because of this, Italians became associated with the prototypical gangster in the minds of many, which had a long-lasting effect on the Italian-American image. The experiences of Italian immigrants in North American countries were notably different than those in South American countries, where many of them immigrated in large numbers. Italians were key in developing countries such as: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. They quickly joined the middle and upper classes in those countries.Latin American Hyphenated Italians – Italian culture in Argentina and Brazil at LifeInItaly.com In the U.S., Italian Americans initially encountered an established Protestant-majority Northern European culture. For a time, they were viewed mainly as construction and industrial workers, chefs, plumbers, or other blue collar workers. Like the Irish before them, many entered police and fire departments of major cities. In the 1930s, Italians, together with Jews were targeted by Sufi Abdul Hamid Black Hitler Jailed To Await Sentence. The New York Times, Jan. 16, 1935. His name, he said, was Sufi Abdul Hamid. \\"A year ago he was acquitted in the same court when the police accused him of urging his Negro followers to drive the Jews and Italians out of Harlem.\\"an Anti-Semite, an admirer of Mufti of Palestine Amin al-Husseini. What Went Wrong?..., Murray Friedman, Simon and Schuster, Sep 11, 2007, p.93 The Jewish Floridian, January 10, 1986, p.12-a: Farrakhan In Top Echelon ... of that era was Sufi Abdul Hamid. New York's self-styled \\"Black Hitler.\\" An admirer of Haj Amin el Husseim. the notorious Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Sufi also courted both the German-American Bund and the Christian Front. =Violence against Italians= After the American Civil War, during the labour shortage that occurred as the South converted to free labour, planters in southern states recruited Italians to come to the United States and work, mainly as agricultural workers and labourers. Many soon found themselves the victims of prejudice, economic exploitation, and they were sometimes victims of violence. Anti-Italian stereotypes abounded during this period as a means of justifying the maltreatment of the immigrants. The plight of the Italian immigrant agricultural workers in Mississippi was so serious that the Italian embassy became involved in investigating their mistreatment in cases that were studied for peonage. Later waves of Italian immigrants inherited these same virulent forms of discrimination and stereotyping which, by then, had become ingrained in the American consciousness. One of the largest mass lynchings in American history was of eleven Italians in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1891. The city had been the destination for numerous Italian immigrants. Nineteen Italians who were thought to have assassinated police chief David Hennessy were arrested and held in the Parish Prison. Nine were tried, resulting in six acquittals and three mistrials. The next day, a mob stormed the prison and killed eleven men, none of whom had been convicted, and some of whom had not been tried. Afterward, the police arrested hundreds of Italian immigrants, on the false pretext that they were all criminals. Teddy Roosevelt, not yet president, famously said the lynching was indeed \\"a rather good thing\\". John M. Parker helped organize the lynch mob, and in 1911 was elected as governor of Louisiana. He described Italians as \\"just a little worse than the Negro, being if anything filthier in their habits, lawless, and treacherous\\". In 1899, in Tallulah, Louisiana, three Italian-American shopkeepers were lynched because they had treated blacks in their shops the same as whites. A vigilante mob hanged five Italian Americans: the three shopkeepers and two bystanders. In 1920 two Italian immigrants, Sacco and Vanzetti, were tried for robbery and murder in Boston, Massachusetts. Many historians agree that Sacco and Vanzetti were subjected to a mishandled trial, and the judge, jury, and prosecution were biased against them because of their anarchist political views and Italian immigrant status. Judge Webster Thayer called Sacco and Vanzetti \\"Bolsheviki!\\" and said he would \\"get them good and proper\\". In 1924 Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer: \\"Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day?\\" the judge said. Despite worldwide protests, Sacco and Vanzetti were eventually executed. Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis declared August 23, 1977, the 50th anniversary of their execution, as Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti Memorial Day. His proclamation, issued in English and Italian, stated that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that \\"any disgrace should be forever removed from their names.\\" He did not pardon them, because that would imply they were guilty. Anti-Italianism was part of the anti-immigrant, anti- Catholic ideology of the revived Ku Klux Klan (KKK) after 1915; the white supremacist and nativist group targeted Italians and other Southern Europeans, seeking to preserve the supposed dominance of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. During the early 20th century, the KKK became active in northern and midwestern cities, where social change had been rapid due to immigration and industrialization. It was not limited to the South. It reached a peak of membership and influence in 1925. A hotbed of anti-Italian KKK activity developed in Southern New Jersey in the mid-1920s. In 1933, there was a mass protest against Italian immigrants in Vineland, New Jersey, where Italians made up 20% of the city population. The KKK eventually lost all of its power in Vineland, and left the city. =Anti-Italian-American stereotyping= Since the early decades of the 20th century, Italian Americans have been portrayed with stereotypical characterizations.Giorgio Bertellini, \\"Black Hands and White Hearts: Italian Immigrants as 'Urban Racial Types' in Early American Film Culture,\\" Urban History 2004 31(3): 375–399 Italian Americans in contemporary U.S. society have actively objected to pervasive negative stereotyping in the mass media. Stereotyping of Italian-Americans as being associated with organized crime has been a consistent feature of movies, such as The Godfather (all three works in the series), GoodFellas and Casino, and TV programs such as The Sopranos.Campbell, R., Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1998 Such stereotypes of Italian Americans are reinforced by the frequent replay of these movies and series on cable and network TV. Video and board games, and TV and radio commercials with Mafia themes also reinforce this stereotype. The entertainment media has stereotyped the Italian American community as tolerant of violent, sociopathic gangsters. Other notable stereotypes portray Italian Americans as overly aggressive and prone to violence. MTV's series Jersey Shore was considered offensive by the Italian-American group UNICO. A comprehensive study of Italian-American culture on film, conducted from 1996 to 2001, by the Italic Institute of America, revealed the extent of stereotyping in media. More than two-thirds of the 2,000 films assessed in the study portray Italian Americans in a negative light. Nearly 300 films featuring Italian Americans as mobsters have been produced since The Godfather (1972), an average of nine per year. According to the Italic Institute of America: > The mass media has consistently ignored five centuries of Italian American > history, and has elevated what was never more than a minute subculture to > the dominant Italian American culture.\\"Hollywood vs Italians\\", The Italic > Way, a publication of The Italic Institute of America, Vol XXVII, 1997 According to recent FBI statistics, Italian-American organized crime members and associates number approximately 3,000. Given an Italian-American population estimated to be approximately 18 million, the study concludes that only one in 6,000 has any involvement with organized crime. In the United Kingdom An early manifestation of anti-Italianism in Britain was in 1820, at the time when King George IV sought to dissolve his marriage to Caroline of Brunswick. A sensational proceeding, the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820, was held at the House of Lords in an effort to prove Caroline's adultery; since she had been living in Italy, many prosecution witnesses were from among her servants. The prosecution's reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian sentiment in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs,Robins, pp 187–188 and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal.Robins, pp. 188–191 Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury.Robins, p. 191 Anti-Italianism broke out again, in a more sustained way, a century later. After Benito Mussolini's alliance with Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, there was a growing hostility towards Italy in the United Kingdom. The British media ridiculed the Italian capacity to fight in a war, pointing to the poor state of the Italian military during her imperialistic phase. A comic strip, which began running in 1938 in the British comic The Beano, was entitled \\"Musso the Wop\\". The strip featured Mussolini as an arrogant buffoon. Wigs on the Green was a novel by Nancy Mitford, first published in 1935. It was a merciless satire of British fascism and the Italians living in the United Kingdom who supported it. The book is notable for lampooning the political enthusiasms of Mitford's sister Diana Mosley, and her links with some Italians in Great Britain who promoted the British Union of Fascists of Oswald Mosley. Furthermore, the announcement of Benito Mussolini's decision to side with Adolf Hitler's Germany in spring 1940 had a devastating effect. By order of Parliament, all enemy aliens were to be interned, although there were few active Italian fascists. This anti-Italian feeling led to a night of nationwide riots against the Italian communities in June 1940. The Italians were now seen as a national security threat linked to the feared British Fascism movement, and Winston Churchill instructed \\"collar the lot!\\". Thousands of Italian men between the ages of 17 and 60 were arrested after his speech. World War II Adolf Hitler acknowledged the ancient history of the Roman civilization. He regarded the Italians as more artistic but less industrious than the Germanic population. The fact that the Kingdom of Italy \\"stabbed the German Empire in the back\\" by siding with the allies in the First World War was not brought up (Treaty of London, 1915). During the Second World War, the United States and the United Kingdom designated Italian citizens living in their countries as alien, irrespective of how long they had lived there. Hundreds of Italian citizens, suspected by ethnicity of potential loyalty to Fascist Italy, were put in internment camps in the U.S. and Canada. Thousands more Italian citizens in the U.S., suspected of loyalty to Italy, were placed under surveillance. Joe DiMaggio's father, who lived in San Francisco, had his boat and house confiscated. Unlike Japanese Americans, Italian Americans and Italian Canadians never received reparations from their respective governments, but President Bill Clinton made a public declaration admitting the U.S. government's misjudgement in the internment.Di Stasi, Lawrence (2004). Una Storia Segreta: The Secret History of Italian American Evacuation and Internment during World War II, Heyday Books. . Because of Benito Mussolini's brutal conquest of Ethiopia and Italy's alliance with Nazi Germany, in the United Kingdom popular feeling developed against all the Italians in the country. Many Italian nationals were deported as enemy aliens, with some being killed by German submarines torpedoing the transportation ships.David Cesarani, Tony Kushner, The Internment of Aliens in Twentieth Century Britain, Routledge;, 1 ed. (1 May 1993), pp. 176–178 During and after World War II, much British propaganda was directed against Italian military performance, usually expressing a stereotype of the \\"incompetent Italian soldier\\". Historians have documented that the Italian Army suffered defeats due to its being poorly prepared for major combat as a result of Mussolini's refusal to heed warnings by Italian Army commanders.William B. Helmreich. The Things They Say Behind Your Back: Stereotypes and the Myths Behind Them. Fifth Printing. Transaction Publishing, 1984. Objective World War II accounts show that, despite having to rely in many cases on outdated weapons, Italian troops frequently fought with great valor and distinction, especially well trained and equipped units such as the Bersaglieri, Folgore and Alpini.Luciano Garibaldi, Century of War, Friedman/Fairfax, 2001 Bias includes both implicit assumptions, evident in Knox's title The Sources of Italy's Defeat in 1940: Bluff or Institutionalized Incompetence?, and the selective use of sources.

Sims, in The Fighter Pilot, ignored the Italians, while D'Este in World War II in the Mediterranean shaped his reader's image of Italians by citing a German comment that Italy's surrender was \\"the basest treachery\\". Further, he discussed Allied and German commanders but ignored Messe, who commanded the Italian First Army, which held off both the U.S. Second Corps and the British Eighth Army in Tunisia.

In the aftermath of the end of imperial colonies and other political changes, many ethnic Italians were violently expelled from these areas, or left under threat of violence. Libya and Yugoslavia have shown high levels of anti-Italianism since WWII, as illustrated by the following manifestations: * Libya. During the years of administering Libya as an Italian colony, some 150,000 Italians settled there, constituting about 18% of the total population.Libya – Italian colonization, Encyclopædia Britannica During the rise of independence movements, hostility increased against colonists. All of Libya's remaining ethnic Italians were expelled from Libya in 1970, a year after Muammar al-Gaddafi seized power (a \\"day of vengeance\\" on 7 October 1970).\\"Libya cuts ties to mark Italy era\\", BBC * Yugoslavia. At the end of World War II, former Italian territories in Istria and Dalmatia became part of Yugoslavia by the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947. Economic insecurity, ethnic hatred and the international political context that eventually led to the Iron Curtain resulted in up to 350,000 people, nearly all ethnic Italians, choosing to or being forced to leave the region.\\"Election Opens Old Wounds In Trieste\\", New York TimesHistory in Exile: Memory and Identity at the Borders of the Balkans, Princeton University Press Scholars such as R. J. Rummel note that the number of Dalmatian Italians has dropped from 45,000 in 1848, when they comprised nearly 20% of the total Dalmatian population under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to 300 in modern times, related to democide and ethnic cleansing. Some minor forms of antiitalianism showed up in Ethiopia and Somalia in the late 1940s, as happened with the Somali nationalist rebellion against the Italian colonial administration that culminated in violent confrontation in January 1948 (:it:Eccidio di Mogadiscio). 54 Italians (mostly women and childrenDomenica del Corriere: Mogadiscio massacre (January 11, 1948) died in the ensuing political riots in Mogadishu and several coastal towns.

Others have March 20, 1900. – April 20, 1959) had a Master of Science Degree in astronomy and, though employed for most of his life as an automobile-parts salesman and a photographer, is probably best remembered for his writings on UFOs. Early life Born near Rockville, Indiana, Jessup grew up with an interest in astronomy. He earned a bachelor of science degree in astronomy from The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1925 and, while working at the Lamont-Hussey Observatory, received a master of science degree in 1926. Though he began work on his doctorate in astrophysics, he ended his dissertation work in 1931 and never earned the higher degree. Nevertheless, he was sometimes referred to as \\"Dr. Jessup\\". He apparently dropped his career and studies in astronomy and worked for the rest of his life in a variety of jobs unrelated to science, although he is sometimes erroneously described as having been an instructor in astronomy and mathematics at the University of Michigan and Drake University.Morris K. Jessup, annotated by three unknown individuals, The Case for the UFO, Varo Edition, (Garland, TX: Varo Corporation, 1957); available at . Career Jessup has been referred to in ufological circles as \\"probably the most original extraterrestrial hypothesiser of the 1950s\\", and it has been said of him that he was \\"educated in astronomy and archeology and had working experience in both.\\"Jerome Clark, The UFO Encyclopedia, 2nd Edition, (Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1988), p. 210. Actual evidence of an educational background in archaeology or archaeological field work is absent from Jessup's resume, but Jerome ClarkClark, Jerome, The UFO encyclopedia: the phenomenon from the beginning, volume 2, L-Z, Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1998, reports that Jessup took part in archeological expeditions to the Yucatan and Peru in the 1920s. Jessup documented an expedition to Cuzco he took part in during 1930.Jessup, M.K., \\"Inca Masonry at Cuszco\\", American Anthropologist, 35, (1934), pp. 239-241, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1934.36.2.02a00100/abstract Jessup achieved some notoriety with his 1955 book The Case for the UFO, in which he argued that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) represented a mysterious subject worthy of further study. Jessup speculated that UFOs were \\"exploratory craft of \\"solid\\" and \\"nebulous\\" character.\\"David Richie, UFO: The Definitive Guide to Unidentified Flying Objects and Related Phenomena, (New York: Facts on File, 1994), p. 116. Jessup also \\"linked ancient monuments with prehistoric superscience\\";Clark, p. 210. years later similar claims were made by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods? in 1968 and other books. Jessup wrote three further flying-saucer books, UFOs and the Bible, The UFO Annual (both 1956), and The Expanding Case for the UFO (1957). The latter suggested that transient lunar phenomena were somehow related to UFOs in the earth's skies. Jessup's main flying-saucer scenario came to resemble that of the Shaver Hoax perpetrated by the science-fiction magazine editor Raymond A. Palmer--namely, that \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" groups of space aliens were/are meddling with terrestrial affairs. Like most of the writers on flying saucers and the so-called contactees that emerged during the 1950s, Jessup displayed familiarity with the alternative mythology of human prehistory developed by Helena P. Blavatsky's cult of Theosophy, which included the mythical lost continents of Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria. Death Jessup attempted to make a living writing on the subject of UFOs, but his follow-up books did not sell well and his publisher rejected several other manuscripts. In 1958 his wife left him, and his friends described him as being somewhat unstable when he traveled to New York City. After returning to Florida, he was involved in a serious car accident and was slow to recover, apparently increasing his despondency. On April 19, 1959, Jessup contacted Manson Valentine and arranged to meet with him the next day, claiming to have made a breakthrough regarding an event known as the Philadelphia Experiment. However, on April 20, 1959, Jessup was found dead in Dade County, Florida, with a hose between the exhaust pipe and a rear window of the vehicle, filling the car with toxic exhaust fumes. The death was ruled a suicide. Some people believed that \\"The circumstances of Jessup's apparent suicide remain mysterious\\"Richie, p. 197. and conspiracy theorists contended that it was connected to his knowledge of the \\"Philadelphia Experiment\\".William L. Moore with Charles Berlitz, The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility, (New York: Fawcett Crest, 1979), chapter 3. Although some friends claimed that he possibly had been driven to suicide by the \\"Allende Case,\\"Moore, pp. 79-81. other friends said that an extremely depressed Jessup had been discussing suicide with his friends for several months before committing suicide.

He has also worked as the first base coach for the Milwaukee Brewers. Career After attending College of the Redwoods in Eureka, California, Iorg was drafted in the 8th round (181st overall) in the 1973 Major League Baseball Draft by the New York Yankees. He was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays from the Yankees organization in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. He made his MLB debut on April 9, 1978.In his debut season in 1978, he wore uniform number 29. He was in the minor leagues in 1979, and in 1980, he was recalled to the Blue Jays wearing uniform number 16 until his retirement. Garth was called up to the Jays in the 1978 season and played 19 games mostly at second base. He played nine seasons for the Jays, batting .258/.282/.347 with 20 home runs in 931 games played. He was a utility player who spent most of his career as the right-handed half of a third-base platoon with Rance Mulliniks called \\"Mullinorg\\". During his major league career, he also appeared at 2B, 1B, SS, DH and OF. Although he was an emergency catcher, he never played this position at the major league level. After he retired, he played shortstop for the Bradenton Explorers in the Senior Professional Baseball Association. Iorg was most recognizable for his strange batting stance, on the toes of his front foot and leaning back toward the catcher as the ball was being pitched. Usually a singles hitter, Iorg had the highest batting average (.313) and a .469 slugging percentage on the Blue Jays in their division-winning 1985 season. In his final major league plate appearance, Iorg made Toronto's last out of the 1987 season when a win would have tied the Blue Jays with the Detroit Tigers for the American League East title. The Jays collapsed during the last week of the season, losing their last seven games. At the time of his retirement, Iorg was the Blue Jays's career leader in pinch hits. After the end of his playing career, Garth went into coaching. He managed at every minor league level in the Toronto Blue Jays system. He also worked for the Sosnick Cobb Sports Agency and was agent for a handful of young players. Iorg was hired by the Milwaukee Brewers as a roving instructor and served as a third base coach for the final 12 games of the 2008 season, after Dale Sveum became the interim manager. He stayed with the team until the 2014 season, when he was fired on October 10. He is the current Manager of the Texas AirHogs baseball team in Grand Prairie, Texas. Personal life Garth Iorg is the brother of Dane Iorg, another former Major League Baseball player. They played against each other in the 1985 American League Championship Series. He is also the father of three sons who either play or have been drafted into professional baseball, including Cale Iorg, who represented Canada at the 2013 World Baseball Classic. His daughter played NCAA softball. Iorg is the founder of the Yard Baseball School in Knoxville, Tennessee. He is honored in his home town of Blue Lake, California, which named its baseball field after him.

The Pokémon themselves spawn randomly, with some conditions; nocturnal Pokémon like Lunatone only spawn at night, and Magikarp spawn near water. Gyms are used to battle and train Pokémon against other players in the area, and nearby PokéStops give free items when spun (they have a 5-minute cooldown per use). It originally featured the 151 original Generation 1 Pokémon. In February 2017, generation 2 Pokémon were added excluding the legendaries such as Suicune, Raikou, Entei, Celebi, Lugia, and Ho-Oh.

Cookie Crisp is a cereal made to recreate the taste of chocolate chip cookies. It is manufactured by General Mills in the United States and Cereal Partners (under the Nestlé brand) in other countries. Introduced in 1977, it was originally manufactured by Ralston Purina until they sold the trademark to General Mills in 1997, who soon after changed the recipe. Varieties Cookie Crisp cereal In 1977 during its introduction until the early 1990's when Cookie Crisp was owned by Ralston three flavors were available. The old Cookie Crisp mascot, Cookie Jarvis was used on three versions of Cookie Crisp: Ralston’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Crisp, Vanilla Wafer Cookie Crisp, and Oatmeal Cookie Crisp. Peanut Butter Cookie Crisp was introduced in 2005. It was phased out by 2007. Double Chocolate Cookie Crisp was a double chocolate-flavored variety of Cookie Crisp introduced in 2007. In July 2009, Cookie Crisp Sprinkles were introduced. They are vanilla cookies with small sprinkles on them. The cereal is said to be gluten free. In Summer 2009, Nestlé released new packaging for the UK version of Cookie Crisp with sprinkles. Cookie Crisp Brownie was introduced in the U.K. in 2013, which has the flavor of brownies, In March 2018 Birthday Cake Cookie Crisp was introduced to the U.S. market. Imitations In 1997, Ralston sold their cereal line to General Mills, who soon after changed the recipe, prompting many Cookie Crisp lovers to seek the original taste in knock-off and foreign brands. Keebler Cookie Crunch was introduced by Kellogg’s in 2008. This cereal has cookie pieces that represent Chips Deluxe and are strikingly similar to Cookie Crisp. It also includes round O shapes that represent Keebler’s popular fudge stripe cookies. Advertising =Cookie Jarvis= A box of Cookie Crisp from 1984, featuring Cookie Jarvis. Introduced in 1977, the first Cookie Crisp mascot, Cookie Jarvis, was a wizard in the Merlin mold, who with one wave of his wand, magically turned cookie jars into cereal bowls, usually chanting rhyming incantations along with it. He was voiced by Lennie Weinrib. =Cookie Crook and Cookie Cop= Cookie Jarvis was joined by Cookie Crook, an anti-hero robber who attempts to steal the Cookie Crisp, in the mid-1980s, followed by his opponent Cookie Cop (full name Officer Crumb), a police officer (reminiscent of the Keystone Cops) with an Irish accent who thwarts the Cookie Crook's attempts to steal the Cookie Crisp. A typical ad would begin with the Cookie Crook attempting to steal the cereal from a live-action breakfast table; often he and the Cookie Cop were portrayed as no larger than mice, so their pictures on the cereal bowl were “life size\\". The Crook would have some new gadget or scheme to steal the cereal, but then the Cookie Cop would arrive and save the kid’s cereal in the nick of time. Eventually, the format of the ads changed to full animation, and the duo was portrayed as the size of normal humans; an even more slapstick approach (similar to Looney Tunes) was used in these commercials. =Chip the Dog= From Right: the Cookie Crook, the Cookie Cop, and Chip the Dog. In 1990, the Cookie Crook was given a sidekick named Chip the Dog. Chip would howl the cereal's name (\\"Coo- oooooooooookie Crisp!\\") in each ad before he and his master were inevitably foiled by the Cookie Cop. After General Mills bought the Cookie Crisp trademark Chip the Dog continued to be the mascot with the Cookie Crook and Cookie Cop from 1997 to 2005. In the format of the advertisements, Chip was a friendly pooch, no longer wearing a mask, who offered Cookie Crisp to a group of kids. Typically an adult would interfere on the grounds that cookies are not breakfast food. Near the end of the ads, the adults would change their minds once Chip gave them a taste of his Cookie Crisp.

Her soaring, wide-ranging voice — from contralto croon to soul-wrenching wail — made her a pillar of gospel music. The Chicago Tribune stated that \\"Andrews' throaty contralto made her low notes thunder, while the enormous range of her instrument enabled her to reach stratospheric pitches without falsetto\\" and that \\"her dramatic delivery made her a charismatic presence in church and on stage.\\" Andrews started singing in the church as a child and performed gospel music on the road in various gospel groups from the 1940s before joining The Caravans in 1957. Fellow member from The Caravans in the 1950s, Shirley Caesar, once dubbed Andrews \\"The High Priestess\\" for her ability to hit high notes, and, in 2013, stated, \\"there never was and never will be another voice like Inez Andrews.\\" Another early member of the Caravans, Albertina Walker often said, \\"nothing ever worked for the Caravans until Inez started whistling\\" — hitting the high notes. She sang lead on The Caravans first breakthrough hit, \\"Mary Don't You Weep\\", and also had hits as a solo artist with crossover recordings such as \\"Lord Don't Move The Mountain\\". (#48 in 1973 on Billboard R&B; chart on Song Bird label). She was referred to in 2012 by the New York Times as \\"the last great female vocalist of gospel's golden age,\\" ranking among the likes of other music legends from the \\"Golden Era\\" of Black Gospel (1945–60) - Mahalia Jackson, Marion Williams, Dorothy Love Coates, Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Clara Ward. Biography Inez McConico was born in Birmingham, Alabama, United States to Theodore and Pauline McConico. Her mother died when she was two years old. Her father, a coal miner, was often out of work during the Great Depression. Andrews traveled a tough road to gospel stardom. She began singing as a child in church and began songwriting as a young mother in Birmingham. Andrews was working six days a week, ten hours a day for 18 dollars a week, while \\"washing, ironing, cooking, keep up with the kids.\\" With her busy life in her youth, she felt that life had to have more to offer her. As she pondered that prayerfully, she picked up \\"a pencil and a brown paper bag\\" and began to write. Thus began her songwriting career. Andrews began her singing career in the 1940s with two groups in Birmingham, Alabama: Carter's Choral Ensemble and the Original Gospel Harmonettes. By the mid-1950s, the Harmonettes were one of the nation's top gospel groups, with Andrews the understudy for the group's lead singer, Dorothy Love Coates. Coates recommended Andrews to the Caravans, and she eventually moved north to Chicago to become widely known as that group's first successful singer, leading them to the high of their popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1962, Andrews left the Caravans to start her own group, Inez Andrews and the Andrewettes. They toured the country performing songs such as \\"It's in My Heart\\" and her composition \\"(Lord I Wonder) What Will Tomorrow Bring?\\". But by 1967 she was touring as a soloist. In the 1960s, Andrews solo work and songwriting further ensconced her in the gospel pantheon. Her songs were recorded by many artists, including The Mighty Clouds of Joy and Aretha Franklin. Andrews became one of the major stars of gospel's golden age, with The Caravans songs such as \\"Lord Keep Me Day By Day\\", \\"Remember Me\\", \\"I Won't Be Back\\" and several other hits in which Andrews was lead vocalist, including \\"Mary Don't You Weep\\", \\"I'm Not Tired Yet\\", \\"Make It In\\", \\"He Won't Deny Me\\" and \\"I'm Willing\\". In 2006, she released a reunion album with The Caravans, Albertina Walker, Dorothy Norwood, and original soprano Delores Washington, entitled Paved the Way. = Solo career = After a stellar career with the Caravans, she left the group in 1962 and had huge success with her 1972 crossover hit, \\"Lord Don't Move the Mountain\\". Andrews recorded on many labels since the 1950s and has many albums and hit songs to her credit, some of which she composed herself. Andrews enjoyed further solo success throughout the 1970s and 1980s with songs such as \\"Just For Me\\", \\"A Sinner's Prayer\\" and a live 1981 recording of James Cleveland’s hit song \\"I Appreciate\\". Andrews claimed to have wrote the gospel standard \\"No Tears In Heaven\\" early in her singing career. The writing credits for the song was disputed between her and Sallie Martin whom Andrews claimed wrote down the lyrics to the song while she was singing it at a program. Andrews recorded her version of the song in 1983. =Personal life= Andrews was a dedicated Christian and family person. She raised seven children during her career in gospel music. She died on December 19, 2012, at the age of 83. She had been diagnosed with cancer months earlier. Andrews is survived by seven children, 19 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. She is the paternal great- grandmother of female impersonator LeJeune Davis, known professionally as Tina Kennedy (formerly Tina Thompson). Honors and awards In 2002 Andrews was inducted into the Gospel Hall of Fame. It was announced prior to her death that Andrews would be honoured with the Ambassador Dr. Bobby Jones Legend Award at the 2013 Stellar Awards. The award ended up being presented posthumously.

Peabody Trust housing on Marshalsea Road in Southwark. The Peabody Trust was founded in 1862 as the Peabody Donation Fund and now brands itself simply as Peabody.Peabody report and financial statements 2009 , Peabody, UK. It is one of London's oldest and largest housing associations with around 55,000 properties across London and the South East. It is also a community benefit society and urban regeneration agency, a developer with a focus on regeneration, and a provider of an extensive range of community programmes. History The Peabody Trust estate in Horseferry Road. The Trust was founded in 1862 by London-based American banker George Peabody, who in the 1850s had developed a great affection for London, and determined to make a charitable gift to benefit it. His initial ideas included a system of drinking fountains (comparable to the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association scheme actually set up by Samuel Gurney and Edward Thomas Wakefield in 1859), or a contribution to the \\"ragged schools\\" of the Earl of Shaftesbury. In March 1859, however, he settled on establishing a model dwellings company. Three years later, in a letter to The Times on 26 March 1862, he launched the Peabody Donation Fund, with an initial gift of £150,000. The aim of the organisation, he said, would be to \\"ameliorate the condition of the poor and needy of this great metropolis, and to promote their comfort and happiness\\". The paper reported, \\"We have today to announce an act of beneficence unexampled in its largeness and in the time and manner of the gift\\".\\"Unprecedented Munificence\\" and untitled leader article, The Times, 26 March 1862, p. 9. Shortly before his death in 1869, Peabody increased his gift to £500,000. The Peabody Trust was later constituted by Act of Parliament, stipulating its objectives to work solely within London for the relief of poverty. This was to be expressed through the provision of model dwellings for the capital's poor. Commercial Street, Spitalfields. A wood-engraving published in the Illustrated London News in 1863, shortly before the building opened. The first block, designed by H. A. Darbishire in a red-brick Jacobethan style, opened in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, on 29 February 1864. It cost £22,000 to build, and contained 57 \\"dwellings\\" (i.e. flats) for the poor, nine shops with accommodation for the shopkeepers, and baths and laundry facilities on the upper floor. Water-closets were grouped in pairs by the staircases, with one shared between every two flats.The block was sold by the Trust in the late 1970s, being considerably smaller than most of the later estates and outdated in its facilities. However, it still stands, and is now a private residential block named The Cloisters. This first block was followed by larger estates in Islington, Poplar, Shadwell, Chelsea, Westminster, Bermondsey, and elsewhere. By 1882 the Trust housed more than 14,600 people in 3,500 dwellings. By 1939 it owned more than 8,000 dwellings. In its early days, the Trust imposed strict rules to ensure that its tenants were of good moral character. Rents were to be paid weekly and punctually; there was a night-time curfew and a set of moral standards to be adhered to; and the dwellings could not be used for certain trades. Current mission Peabody states that in pursuit of its mission it will: \\"put the most vulnerable first\\"; \\"design, build and maintain homes and neighbourhoods which people are proud to live in\\"; \\"help people, households and communities to be more resilient\\"; and \\"[g]row and use our position of influence to create positive change\\". =Thamesmead regeneration= Peabody is leading a £1 billion regeneration of Thamesmead, Abbey Wood and Plumstead in South-East London. The Group worked with the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Bexley to successfully bid for Greater London Authority housing zone status, which led to a c£80 million investment. As well as providing thousands of new homes in the area, Peabody says it will provide firm foundations for Thamesmead’s long term, sustainable rejuvenation by investing in existing homes, infrastructure and services to improve the quality of life for existing residents. Going beyond \\"bricks and mortar\\", Peabody says its work with partners will enhance employment, enterprise, cultural, social and leisure opportunities for people which is supported by socio-economic outputs locally. Thamesmead and the surrounding area is a major growth and opportunity area for London. Crossrail will open at nearby Abbey Wood from 2019, and Peabody has said it will capitalise on this, ensuring the right amenities, infrastructure and transport connections are available for the long term sustainability of the area. Peabody Group In 2014 Gallions, Trust Thamesmead and Tilfen Land became part of the Peabody Group. The Peabody Group now comprises two housing associations, Peabody and Gallions, and a number of trading companies.. In July 2017 Peabody merged with Family Mosaic housing association under the \\"Peabody\\" name. =Funding= Housing associations borrow money to pay for new homes and improvements. In March 2011, Peabody raised £200 million on a corporate bond, at a rate among the best secured by a housing association borrowing in its own name.Peabody issues £200m bond, Inside Housing, UK, 11 March 2011. In 2013 it issued a public bond for £350 million. Family Mosaic Prior to its merger with Peabody, Family Mosaic was a housing association in the United Kingdom. It had over 25,000 homes housing over 45,000 people and was one of the largest housing providers in London, Essex and the South East of England. Family Mosaic also provided care and support services to over 8,000 people. Family Mosaic worked with young people, helping them into work and promoting better health. In addition to offering specialist housing for people with support needs and social housing for general needs tenants, a third strand of Family Mosaic was its role in assisting people to get onto the property ladder through leasehold shared ownership properties. In April 2017, Family Mosaic announced that it would be launching a 111 home development for private rental tenants. Family Mosaic also ran employment training courses and activity groups for its residents. It also offered welfare benefits advice. Family Mosaic was a member of the G15 group of housing associations in London. In July 2017 Family Mosaic merged with Peabody Trust housing association under the \\"Peabody\\" name. = Subsidiaries = *Charlton Triangle Homes – Owned and managed 1,162 homes in the London Borough of Greenwich. *Old Oak Housing Association – Owns and manages 669 homes in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. = Controversies = In 2012, Family Mosaic was paid an out of court settlement by Haringey London Borough Council because of the council's failure to pay additional costs of over £108,000 for two care home residents. A number of complaints have been made against Family Mosaic in the national and local press, including heating being cut-off for five months of the year, a ceiling collapsing, poor administration at one of its care homes, and a rodent infestation. In 2014, Family Mosaic took the unusual step of apologising to its tenants after a malfunctioning computer system led to an increase in complaints about its repairs service.

One of her films was Granny, which earned her a special jury prize at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2003.  Early life  Lidyia Bobrova was born in 1952 in the far east area of Amur. She studied History in university before moving on to the study of screen writing and directing.  Career  After graduating from VKSR (Higher Courses for Scriptwriters and Directors) Bobrova started making films in 1991. Her directorial debut Oi, vy, gusi (Hey, You Geese, 1991), depicted the life of three brothers struggling a world that has forgotten them. Her next film was V toi strane (In That Land..., 1997) which followed life in a Russian village in the 1890s. The film was critically acclaimed but was not accepted into the Moscow Film Festival due to \\"unprofessionalism.\\" While it was successful abroad it never achieved the same success in Russia. Her next film Babusia was her most successful winning the audience prize in the Paris film festival in 2003. Following a granny in Russia who takes care of her children, grand-children and neighbours children. Eight years later Bobrova released her final film, Veruiui (I Believe, dir. Lydia Bobrova 2006) based on three short stories by Vasilii Shukshin adapted for a more modern period.  Style  Bobrova was heavily influenced by village life in Russia often centring her movies around Russian villages and the slow pace of rural life. Her films juxtaposed wide shots of Russian landscapes with confined interiors of farm houses. Depicting a world where the central characters of her films struggled to survive against harsh natural elements. Dedicating her career to representing life in Russian farm lands. Bobrova created a filmography based around glubinka, Russian rural peasant life which she grew up in. She has been described as a member of the Russian new wave, with her films being released in the years immediately after the fall of communism. Her films deal with preoccupations of nature and societal fabric. Scholars have argued that these traditional examinations of society are an examination of the current life in Russia. She represents these movies with long takes, realist mis-en-scene and static camera work. Bobrova, took realism to a high degree even using non- professional actors even in critical roles, such as the titular grandmother in Babusyia.  Gender themes  Bobrova foregrounds gender in her filmography. Her award winning film Babousia examines the life of a grandmother as her family changes in the soviet era. The struggling matriarch in Babuysia for one, in other films Bobrova has reversed traditional gender norms, depicting women doing tasks of physical labour or men doing domestic work. Family relationships and brotherly connection are at the centre of her first film Oi, vy, gusi. Examining their male relationship. Her films correlate male cultivation of land toward Russian communist values or oppose them. Bobrova expands on this parable throughout her filmography, with the question of women as primary caretakers at the forefront of her work. She also uses age as a cinematic technique of representation in her work.

It broadcasts to the San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area from a its transmitter on Cerro Bola. XHLNC-FM airs a Spanish variety format and is branded as Click XM. From 2000 to 2018, XHLNC was a classical music station known as XLNC1, broadcasting from studios in Chula Vista, California. Since then, it has been operated by several Mexican and United States groups. History as a classical music station =Foundation and early years= The station was founded by Víctor Díaz, who owned Califórmula Broadcasting, a company that controlled numerous stations in Tijuana. Upon his death in 2004, Diaz stipulated that XHLNC-FM continue with its classical format, from funding Díaz had set aside, as well as contributions from listeners. The station permit was transferred to Martha Margarita Barba de la Torre, one of Díaz's descendants. XLNC1 began in 1998 as an internet radio project showcasing classical music. In January 2000, it transitioned into a physical radio station on 90.7 MHz upon receiving its permit. = Frequency change = XHLNC, which for its first six months was known as XHTNA-FM, was originally permitted to sign-on with a Class A 1,000-watt signal, broadcasting from a tower located in the Mount San Antonio area of Tijuana that had been used by other Califórmula stations. 90.7 is also the frequency for KPFK in Los Angeles, which operates at a grandfathered 110,000 watts. (Southern California is in the Class B zone, where FM stations would normally have a maximum power of 50,000 watts.) Due to KPFK's enlarged coverage area, XLNC1's signal suffered co-channel interference in many sections of San Diego County. However, due to a treaty between the US and Mexico concerning radio stations near the border, XLNC1 could not increase its coverage much north of the border. Despite this, Díaz solicited a power increase for XHLNC to 10 kW, which the SCT approved on July 14, 2003. On June 29, 2007, Cofetel, the Mexican Federal Telecommunications Commission, cleared XHLNC-FM to switch frequencies to 104.9 MHz and move its transmitter to Cerro Bola in Tecate (also used by XHHIT-FM and XHPRS-FM). The move was announced by XLNC1 the next month. The switch would bring less interference to the station, resolve interference to KPFK, allow the station to boost its power from 1,000 watts to 7,500 watts, and move its tower to \\"the highest point in Baja\\", above sea level. =Transmitter problems= The frequency change took place on February 10, 2008. At first, the 90.7 frequency aired a pre-recorded message by Gordon Brown stating that XLNC1 had moved to 104.9 FM. Unfortunately, the new transmitter had problems, causing some listeners to experience reception problems on XLNC1's new frequency. About two weeks after the frequency change, XLNC1's e-mail newsletter reported that there was a faulty component in the transmitter that would take some time to replace. On February 26, XLNC1 decided to simulcast programming on both 90.7 and 104.9 frequencies. By fall of that year, XLNC1 had its 90.7 frequency taken back by the Mexican government, and the station was broadcasting only on 104.9 FM. In 2010, XHTIM-FM was authorized to move from 97.7 to 90.7 and increase its power by using the frequency on which XHLNC once broadcast.IFT Registro Público de Concesiones: XHTIM-FM moves to 90.7, 2010 =Moving away from longer works= Final logo as a classical music station In July 2010, XLNC1 decided to remove the label \\"Classical Music\\" from its advertising and replace it with more generic terms such as \\"Great Music\\", \\"Beautiful Music\\", and \\"Music for All Generations.\\" The decision was also made to remove lengthy repertoire and opera from general programming in favor of lighter classical and crossover works. This was explained as a method to reach out to younger listeners. The station continues to broadcast lengthier works in the evenings with programs entitled \\"Gala Concerts\\". As a classical station serving a binational audience, XLNC1 typically introduced pieces in Spanish and gave the information in English at the end. Announcers included Kingsley McLaren, Sue Harland, Gabriela Guinea-Johnston (chief Spanish announcer) and Gordon Brown. Most of the programming was automated, with the announcers prerecording their identifications of titles, artists and composers. The end of classical and Toño era Logo as Toño from March 2018 to December 2019 On February 9, 2018, XLNC1 announced through their official Facebook account that they would no longer be broadcasting on FM and would only continue online, effective March 1, due to a lack of continued donations. The announcement read: \\"Dear listeners, it is with a heavy heart that we inform you that as of March 1st, XLNC1 will no longer be broadcasting on the air (104.9FM). We will, however, maintain our streaming service online via our website at www.xlnc1.org, and you will still be able to listen to us through our App on iPhone and Android devices. We are truly grateful for all the years we have been able to reach our wonderful audience in San Diego and Baja California, and we sincerely thank you for all of your generous support through the years.\\" The station ended FM transmissions on March 2, and on March 3, the new format was announced: the 104.9 frequency was taken over by Grupo Larsa Comunicaciones, the largest broadcaster in Sonora which had assumed control of stations in Mexicali in 2017, and began to carry its flagship Toño Spanish Adult Hits formatTweet from @LARSAVISIONTV in a non-commercial version,XLNC1 San Diego Flips To Spanish Adult Hits Toño 104.9 owing to XHLNC's status as a social station. =Más Flo and Click XM= On December 17, 2019, MLC Media, a Spanish-language radio syndication company based in Los Angeles, announced it would assume control of XHLNC and run it as Spanish rhythmic \\"Más Flo\\" beginning the next day, with programming originating from its LA studios. On April 1, 2020, MLC Media pulled the plug on the “Mas Flo” Spanish rhythmic format and changed their format to Spanish adult hits, citing the noncommercial nature of the XHLNC concession. The station then returned to Spanish adult contemporary/adult hits as \\"Click XM\\".

Stark is the hero of a series of pulp adventures set in a time when the Solar System has been colonized. His origin-story shares some characteristics with feral characters such as Mowgli and Tarzan; his adventures take place in the shared space opera planets of 1940s and 1950s science fiction. Back-story Stark was born on Mercury. His parents were employees of the mineral extraction company Mercury Metals and Mining. After his parents died in a cave-in caused by a quake, Stark was adopted by a tribe of Mercurian aborigines who are described as hairy and possessing snouts.The Reavers of Skaith chapter 3 They gave him the name N'Chaka, meaning \\"the man without a tribe\\". He believed himself to be one of them, rather than a human, and endured their rigorous way of life in the Mercurian Twilight Belt, surviving by hunting rock-lizards. Before Stark was fully grown, another group of human miners exterminated his tribe, captured Stark and imprisoned him in a cage. They would ultimately have killed him if he had not been rescued by the police official Simon Ashton, who raised Stark to adulthood. The stories of the adult Stark are fast-paced adventures, but Brackett manages to insert more pathos than most authors. Because of his background, Stark is keenly aware of the injustices visited on the planetary \\"primitives\\" by the colonialist Earth, and tends to side with them against official bodies. At the opening of the story in which he first appears, Stark is evading a twenty-year sentence placed on him for running guns to a Venusian native group that has been resisting Terran colonizers. Appearance A point about Stark's physical appearance which has been studiously ignored by every one of his illustrators until the James Ryman's covers from the Paizo Publishing Planet Stories line:http://paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO8010_500.jpeg years of exposure to heightened sunlight on the planet Mercury has permanently given Stark very dark, almost black skin. His skin is \\"almost as dark as his black hair\\" and an antagonist refers to him scornfully as a \\"great black ape\\". The darkness of Stark's skin is reiterated in Enchantress of Venus. Brackett's other Mercurian characters also have black skin (e.g. Jaffa Storm in The Nemesis from Terra). Brackett's professional illustrators have universally drawn Stark as light-skinned, even sometimes blond. Brackett's use of a strong, independent, and attractive black-skinned character as hero for several of her stories was very unusual for the 1940s and 1950s. The artists' choice to ignore Brackett's written description and substitute a generic light-skinned blond pulp hero, even as late as 1982, may reflect prejudice against dark-skinned people. The effect of these misleading illustrations has been such that Stark is never remembered or referred to by critics as a black- skinned character, though he is clearly described as such in the stories. While Stark is described many times as having very dark skin, he appears to be of Caucasian rather than African descent; Brackett repeatedly tells her readers that Stark's unusual coloring is due to prolonged exposure to extreme sunlight while growing up on the planet Mercury. Brackett openly created Stark as a pastiche of Edgar Rice Burroughs' popular John Carter of Mars and Tarzan characters, and Stark's sun-blackened skin is the Mercurian version of Tarzan's sun-bronzed skin. Stories =Solar System= Stark first appeared in a group of novellas published in the pulp magazine Planet Stories. These were: \\"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\\" (Summer 1949); \\"Enchantress of Venus\\" (Fall 1949), once published as \\"City of the Lost Ones\\"; and \\"Black Amazon of Mars\\" (March 1951). The first and last stories were expanded into short novels: \\"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\\" as The Secret of Sinharat and \\"Black Amazon of Mars\\" as People of the Talisman. The expanded versions were first published in 1964 as an Ace Double paperback, and again in 1982 under the title Eric John Stark: Outlaw of Mars. The internal chronology of the stories is different from the publishing order; in \\"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\\" Stark is on Mars, having fled capture on Venus; \\"Black Amazon of Mars\\" takes place soon after, but in an unexplored and barbaric area close to the north pole of Mars; and in \\"Enchantress of Venus\\", Stark has returned from Mars to Venus to look for a missing friend. The two expanded novels have inconsistencies with their novella originals. The Secret of Sinharat is almost identical with \\"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\\" up to the point at which Stark arrives at Sinharat, but a crucial plot point is revealed earlier in the novella, and further developments diverge from (while occasionally overlapping) the storyline of \\"Catacombs\\". \\"Black Amazon of Mars\\" is largely different from People of the Talisman, though founded on a similar premise. =Skaith= Many years later, Brackett returned to the character in a trilogy of books titled The Ginger Star (1974), The Hounds of Skaith (1974) and The Reavers of Skaith (1976). These stories are science fantasies set on a distant but primitive extrasolar planet, since Stark's original Solar System venue had become unacceptable to publishers. As a result, although the character's personality and origins are retained, there are few other links between the Skaith novels and the earlier Stark novellas. =Other= A final story, Stark and the Star Kings (2005), places Stark into the world of her husband Edmond Hamilton's Star Kings series, making it a rare collaboration between the two.

Career The band formed in 2001 when lead vocalist Connor Lovat- Fraser and current guitarist Jeff Davis started collaborating on songs. The work eventually led to the four-song You Are My Canvas demo, an EP influenced by fellow Burlington hardcore act Grade. Following the release of this demo, the band signed to One Day Savior Recordings and subsequently released the Broken Bones & Bloody Kisses EP. Interest in the band was immediate, and a short while later they signed to New Jersey-based Ferret Records. Their debut full-length album, 2003's Make Yourself Sick, was a shock to some fans. It was much lighter and pop-punk-oriented, but with the same heavy screaming and guitars found on earlier releases. The band toured heavily in support of the record with acts such as My Chemical Romance, Catch 22, Saves the Day, and a stint on the Warped Tour circuit. Boys Night Out also was featured in the Nintendo Fusion Tour with Fall Out Boy, Motion City Soundtrack, The Starting Line, and Panic! at the Disco. The band's next effort, 2005's Trainwreck, is a somewhat more subdued, experimental concept album based on a man's loss of sanity. Trainwreck opens with a doctor dictating his notes into a tape recorder. The album chronicles the arrest, trial, treatment and subsequent release of a man who, in a waking dream, murders his wife and then cuts both his hands off with a machine at his work so that he can not kill again. Kara Dupuy's vocals act as the deceased wife's voice heard by the patient throughout the album. The band released their third album, Boys Night Out, on June 26, 2007. The first single from the album was \\"Up with Me\\". Boys Night Out played their first show in two years at the Opera House in Toronto using the original five members, on 24 October 2009. The band played both Broken Bones And Bloody Kisses and Make Yourself Sick in their entirety. Connor posted the following regarding the band's status on the Boys Night Out Facebook group: \\"No breakup. No lost members. No getting dropped. We're just taking it easy for a while. Once we finished our contract with Ferret we opted to leave the label. We've been touring non-stop for the past few years and we're all feeling the wear and tear of constant life on the road. We started this band as a means of escape from everyday life...this is a return to that frame of mind. Easy like Sunday morning. It's pretty refreshing to just sit back and write songs without pressure from all sides telling you that there HAS to be a new record on day x. Before we release another full-length we're going to take our time to make sure that it's as wickedly radical and gnarly as it can possibly be. So, yeah...that's the gist of it. You won't be seeing us playing a whole lot of shows in the coming months - and we definitely won't be playing extended tours - but we're still alive and kickin'.\\" In 2009, Lovat-Fraser and Davis joined producer Scott Komer to form a band called Hard Calibers. The main purpose of the band was to record a version of ESRT Page 14 by Justin Veatch of the Ivoryton Piano Factory. The song is featured on a compilation album of music by Veatch, who died in 2008 at the age of 17. Recently Connor has been working with local acts such as the punk band 'The Eff Holes', and Electro-Pop group 'Crazy Diamond' featuring Regan and Matt Davis. The band's song \\"I Got Punched in the Nose for Sticking My Face in Other Peoples Business\\" was used on the last episode of an anime titled Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad. As of early 2013 the band has still yet to make an official announcement on its split, but lead singer Lovat-fraser had this to say about the band's future, \\"I'm sorry to say it, but I can't really see BNO getting back together for any shows. It seems that everyone is getting back together for reunion shows these days, but sadly, I don't think BNO will be counted among them.\\" In March 2013, Boys Night Out's Twitter account posted the following in regards to a new album: \\"Just finished recording the new full-length. Sounds like shit.\\". Two days later the band followed up by revealing their previous statement wasn't a reality, but finally provided fans with some closure on the band's end. They tweeted the following: \\"There is no new album, but if we recorded one right now it would absolutely sound like shit.\\". The former band's Twitter page description also states they are no longer a band though they still used the account from time to time. On January 12, 2015, the band's Twitter account changed its heading to \\"2015. Stuff is a-brewin'.\\" Connor's Twitter also confirms that the band is working on new material. On October 10, 2015, the band's Official Instagram posted an image of Bassist Dave Costa and Drummer Ben Arseneau in the studio with the caption \\"Day one with @derekbrightest at @fox_sounds - new album on the way!\\" On January 21, 2016, the band released a press release announcing the release of a new album, \\"Black Dogs\\", in spring of 2016. =Line-up changes= In early 2006, Kara Dupuy left Boys Night Out. As seen on the live show footage of Dude, You Need to Stop Dancing, she had recently become engaged and chose to pursue a new life off the road. In March, 2006, Andy Lewis, left his former band, The Fullblast, to join Boys Night Out on guitar. In late 2006, Brian Southall left the band to join The Receiving End of Sirens.

He played as a shortstop in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres, and New York Mets from 1976 to 1991. Playing career Born in Lockney, Texas, Templeton was hailed by many as one of the best players in baseball early in his career, which featured All-Star Game selections in and . In the latter year, Templeton made history as the first switch-hitter to collect 100 hits from each side of the plate, a feat achieved only once more by Willie Wilson in 1980. His total of 211 hits led the National League, and with 19 triples, he led the league for a third consecutive season. He led the Cardinals in hits in 1977, 1978, and 1979. He caused some controversy in 1979 when, despite having better numbers than either Dave Concepción or Larry Bowa, two of the National League's premier shortstops at the time, he wasn't selected to start at shortstop for the National League All-Star team. He was named to the team as a reserve, but refused to go. Templeton with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1980 The quote, \\"If I ain't startin', I ain't departin'\\" regarding the 1979 MLB All- Star Game is often mistakenly attributed to Templeton over his refusal to play. In reality, Jack Buck, Cardinals sportscaster at the time made the statement.https://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/aug-garry-templeton-s-ladies- day-eruption/article_e2ebeb70-ce60-592f-a506-99c938347842.html He continued to hit well in and ; however, he was not popular with Cardinals fans. The situation with the home fans came to a head when, during an August 26, 1981, home game in St. Louis, Templeton made an obscene gesture twice to some fans who had allegedly been heckling him after he had failed to run to first on a ground ball; manager Whitey Herzog physically pulled Templeton off the field following the incident. After the end of the season the Cardinals traded him to the Padres for Ozzie Smith. The trade was welcomed by everyone involved: Smith was (then) a light-hitting defensive wizard going to a team which needed to improve its defense (and he was also embroiled in a contract dispute with Padres' management), while Templeton was a better hitter going to a team which needed to improve its offense (and who was, due to his actions, no longer popular with the fans or the team). In his ten years with the Padres, he played in 1,286 games, while having 1,135 hits, 43 home runs, 427 RBIs, and a .252 batting average, with one Silver Slugger Award win and one All-Star Game appearance in 1985. He was named team captain of the Padres by manager Larry Bowa in 1987, serving as captain for four years. 1991 was his final season in the majors. He played in 32 games for the Padres before being traded to the New York Mets on May 31 for Tim TeufelBASEBALL; Mets Send Teufel to Padres In Exchange for Templeton Teufel played in 80 more games for the Mets for a total of 112 that year. He hit for .221 with three home runs and 26 RBIs in the season. Templeton was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015. Managing career After his retirement as an active player in 1991, Templeton remained in the game as a coach and minor league manager. From 1998 through 2001, he managed in the Anaheim Angels organization for four teams, posting a 294-272 record. From 2003 to 2004, he managed the Gary Railcats of the Northern League, moving on to manage the Golden Baseball League's Fullerton Flyers in 2005. After three years with the Flyers, he would move on to manage the Arizona Winter League's Palm Springs Chill in 2008, then would return to the GBL to manage the Long Beach Armada in 2009.

It is bounded by Baxter Street, Pearl Street, the Brooklyn Bridge and the East River on the east, Upper New York Bay on the south, the Hudson River on the west and Canal Street on the north. Manhattan Community Board 1's current Chairperson is Anthony Notaro, Jr. and its staff includes: District Manager Lucian Reynolds, Director of Land Use and Planning Diana Switaj, Planning Consultant Michael Levine, Community Liaison Tamar Hovsepian and Community Coordinator Lucy Acevedo. The Manhattan Community Board 1 office is located at 1 Centre Street, Room 2202 North, New York, NY 10007. Demographics As of the United States Census, 2010, the Community District has a population of 60,978, up from 34,420 in 2000, 25,366 in 1990, and 15,918 in 1980. Of them (as of 2010), 40,810 (66.9%) are white non-Hispanic, 2,595 (4.3%) are African American, 10,627 (17.4%) Asian or Pacific Islander, 55 (0.1%) American Indian or Native Alskan, 264 (.4%) of some other non-Hispanic race, 1,780 (2.9%) of two or more non-Hispanic races, 4,847 (7.9%) of Hispanic origins. 5.6% of the population benefit from public assistance as of 2011, down from 9.6% in 2005. After 9/11, many buildings converted from commercial to residential uses, drawing many new residents. Formerly a hub of financial and commercial activity, Community District 1 is quickly transforming into a mixed-use 24/7 area. A component of this transformation is a rapidly growing child population. In 2013, Community Board 1 planning staff conducted a demographic analysis to document the district's increasing youth population. Using block-level data from the 2000 and 2010 Census, the analysis showed that each Community District 1 neighborhood had experienced an extreme increase in its youth populations; particularly in the 0-4 and 5-9 age groups. For instance, the average growth of the 0-4 population in the entire borough of Manhattan increased .7% between 2000 and 2010, but increased 149% in Battery Park City, 196% in Tribeca, 57% in the Seaport/Civic Center, and 242% in the Financial District. Similarly, between 2000 and 2010, the 5-9 age group decreased 16.4% in the entire borough of Manhattan, but increased 75% in Battery Park City, 69% in Tribeca, 44% in the Seaport/Civic Center, and 158% in the Financial District. On April 15, 2015, Manhattan Community District 1 conducted a follow-up study on the population increase and demographic changes in the area. The study utilized a compilation of built and expected new residential units in the area and multiplied by the average household size (1.94).U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2010 Summary File 1. Esri forecasts for 2012 and 2017. The residential units count was tabulated from 2012 to 2015 and beyond using various news media sources in addition to data from the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center and the New York City Department of Transportation Construction Project list. Final residential unit counts may vary as they are continuously being updated. The results of the study showed that an estimated total of 8,466 additional residential units have been constructed or are planned for construction since 2012. Furthermore, based on the residential units tabulation, total population in Manhattan Community District 1 has steadily increased at an average rate of approximately 5% annually. Demographic changes in Manhattan Community District 1 including the rapidly growing residential population and subsequent increase in children ages 0–18 have major implications for the area. In many cases, the development of community infrastructure has not matched the changing demographics. For instance, Community District 1 has severe school overcrowding issues. Trends in birth rates and residential development indicate that the residential and youth populations of Community District 1 are likely to continue to increase. The land area is 955.6 acres, or .

Biography Born in Barangay Sto. Niño, Guagua, Pampanga, Santos was the fourth of seven children of Gaudencio Santos, an overseer of farmland near Mount Arayat, and Rosalia Jiao. Rufino's three elder brothers were Manuel, Emiliano, and Quirino; his three sisters were Clara, Jovita, and Exequiela. Santos, nicknamed \\"Pinong\\", grew up in a house located 30 meters from what is now the Immaculate Conception Parish. He was active in church activities as an acolyte, and was later a choir member of the Manila Cathedral School. Two factors influenced his priestly vocation: his stint as an altar server, and the encouragement of Father Jose Tahon, Manila Cathedral's parish priest. He entered San Carlos Seminary on July 25, 1921 and earned a Baccalaureate in Canon Law in 1929 and a Doctorate in Sacred Theology in July 1931 at the Pontificia Universita Gregoriana. In 1927, the 19-year-old Santos and Leopoldo A. Arcaira, 24--both outstanding students of San Carlos Seminary--were the first recipients of the scholarships at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy. Pinong was granted a papal dispensation to be ordained below the canonical age of 24. On October 25, 1931, two months shy of his 23rd birthday, Rufino J. Santos was ordained a priest at the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome. pia.gov.ph, PGMA unveils commemorative statue of Cardinal Santos in Pampanga He then served as an assistant parish priest in Imus, Cavite and as a parish priest in Marilao, Bulacan. His later successor as archbishop, Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, said during the Second World War, =Archbishop of Manila= In 1953, Santos was appointed Archbishop of Manila on February 10 and was installed on March 25 of the same year. Pope John XXIII made him a cardinal on March 28, 1960. He was the first native Filipino to become a cardinal. Santos paved the way for the founding of Catholic Charities (eventually known as Caritas Manila) and the reconstruction of St. Paul Hospital (now the Cardinal Santos Medical Center), which was established by the Maryknoll Sisters but was damaged by American bombardment during the Second World War. Santos also re-instituted the Philippine Trust Company and the Catholic Travel Office. During his years in Manila, he rebuilt the Manila Cathedral, which had been destroyed by Allied bombardment during the 1945 Liberation of Manila. It was dedicated on December 10, 1958. He hosted the visit of Pope Paul VI to the Philippines to attend the Asian Bishops' Meeting. Santos served as Archbishop of Manila from 1953 to 1973. Santos established the Church-run Radio Veritas and built important structures including the Our Lady of Guadalupe Minor Seminary along EDSA in Makati City; the Pius XII Catholic Center in Paco, Manila; and Villa San Miguel, the archbishop's palace in Mandaluyong.gmanews.tv, Pampanga venue of 1st Filipino cardinal's centennialsunstar.com.ph, Rosales, Arroyo guests at Cardinal Santos centennial Cardinal Rosales said that Santos was a diabetic and that he suffered from a malignant brain tumor. newsinfo.inquirer.net, Arroyo joins Pampanga rites for 1st Filipino cardinal He died in Manila on September 3, 1973, eight days after his 65th birthday. Following his death, a diplomatic report from the United States Embassy in Manila assessed his activities: > Santos' opposition to \\"Social Action\\" programs, which he frequently > expressed in heavy-handed fashion, did much to perpetuate the Church's image > as a conservative organization, allied with the country's economic and > social elite.William Healy Sullivan (US Ambassador to the Philippines) to > the Sec. of State, September 4, 1973  Legacy  Monument of Rufino Cardinal Santos (Guagua, Pampanga). Marker (in Capt. Ruben P. Sonco Freedom Square). Rufino Cardinal Santos Catholic Center Caritas Manila’s history began with a Cardinal that \\"walked the talk\\". Cardinal Santos, the first Filipino Cardinal, became the 29th Archbishop of Manila in a post-war scenario that saw a nation plagued with the following: a high dependency on the upper class in the country's social, economic and political growth; a growing inequality in the distribution of wealth; a critical unfairness in labor, land and tenancy—all catalysts to the resurgence of the communist movement. It was to this disparate social order that Cardinal Santos spoke upon his installation: This plan took shape soon after when the Cardinal appointed an eleven-man Administrative Board on October 1, 1953. And so a new era had dawned when the establishment of Caritas Manila (first known as Catholic Charities) brought structure and organization to the way the Church’s charitable works in the Archdiocese of Manila were being implemented. The initial years were largely a period of identifying those who needed help the most, prioritizing and allocating medical aid, food and clothing when needed. These were superseded by programs that harnessed talents and opened up work opportunities for Manila's teeming masses, such as the educational assistance program and job placement program. Nonetheless, it was medical assistance, crisis intervention and emergency relief that had the greatest impact, reaching thousands of the sick and indigent. Cardinal Santos was \\"reviled\\" for his \\"conservatism on social issues and business acumen\\" . However, it was his vision and altruism that had made Caritas Manila a success and his most noteworthy accomplishment. =Birth centennial= The CBCP announced that Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales would lead the August 26, 2008 centennial rites for Santos at his hometown of Sto. Nino, Guagua, Immaculate Conception Parish Church. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was to lead the event by unveiling a historical marker and a 6-foot statue of Santos (sculpted by Edillardo Paras) and donated by Cesar L. Villanueva's wife, Arlyn Sicangco- Villanueva, president of Holy Angel University in Angeles. The rites also included the exhibit of Cardinal Santos memorabilia, loaned by the Archdiocese of Manila and the Kapampangan Museum at Clark. The bronze statue will sit atop a 7-foot concrete pedestal outside the Rufino J. Cardinal Santos Convention Hall adjacent to the parish church. Villanueva also presented to the President, a copy of the book “Padre Pinong, the First Filipino Cardinal” authored by Francis Musni. On September 3, 2018, his 45th death anniversary, to commemorate the legacy of Cardinal Santos, and for the preparation for the 60th anniversary of the renovation of the post-war Manila Cathedral, a Mass and the ceremonial tradition of raising of the galero was officiated by then Archbishop of Manila, Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle.

What sets the ACCA apart from most such Churches is that it espouses the theology and embraces many distinctive practices of the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Indian Orthodox Church, from which the clergy of the ACCA claim to derive apostolic succession primarily via the lineage of René Vilatte. The orders of the ACCA are also derived from the Old Catholic movement, in this case by way of Arnold Mathew. The ACCA, however, is not in communion with any of the Oriental Orthodox Churches. It ordains women to the diaconate and does not require celibacy of its bishops, allowing them, like priests and deacons, to marry. The ACCA states that its approach to theology and practice is a process of \\"critical reappropriation\\" which is open to influences from all sectors of trinitarian Christianity but is, at the same time, rooted in the Syriac Christian tradition, particularly with regard to such foundational matters as Christology (miaphysitism), soteriology, ecclesiology, and Christian ethics. The see city of the ACCA is Knoxville, Tennessee. It is led by a metran, or archbishop, Victor Mar Michael Herron.

In 1974 it was transferred from Berkshire to Oxfordshire, and from Wallingford Rural District to the district of South Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded Cholsey's parish population as 3,457. Cholsey's parish boundaries, some long, reach from the edge of Wallingford into the Berkshire Downs. The village green is called \\"The Forty\\" and has a substantial and ancient walnut tree. Winterbrook was historically at the north end of the parish adjoining Wallingford and became within Wallingford parish (run by its Town Council) since 2015. Winterbrook Bridge, which carries a by-pass road across the River Thames, is in the parish. Cholsey was one of the two main homes of the late author Dame Agatha Christie (the other being the village of Galmpton on the south Devon coast). John Masefield, poet laureate, lived in Cholsey. History A Bronze Age site has been found beside the River Thames at Whitecross Farm in the northeast of the parish. A pre-Roman road, the Icknield Way, crosses the River Thames at Cholsey. A recent find has been a substantial Roman site in Celsea Place. Archaeologists discovered the best examples of corn dryers they have seen, with precision suggesting they were built by an engineer. Sites of burials and cremation pots have also been found. There is also part of a Roman villa, the majority of which appeared to have extended out under the existing road and houses and will have suffered significant unrecorded damage. The section of villa remaining within the archaeologically excavated area has been preserved in situ. The village itself was founded on an island (\\"Ceol's Isle\\") in marshy ground close to the Thames. There is evidence that the House of Wessex royal family owned land in Cholsey in the 6th and 7th centuries. At this time the town was home to a Saint Wilgyth who was venerated locally in the Middle Ages. A royal nunnery, Cholsey Abbey, was founded in the village in AD 986 by Queen Dowager Ælfthryth on land given by her son, King Ethelred the Unready. The nunnery is thought to have been destroyed by invading Danes in 1006 when they camped in Cholsey after setting nearby Wallingford ablaze. However, Saxon masonry still survives in the Church of England parish church of St Mary. Most of this flint and stone church was built in the 12th century. The church is cruciform. Additions were made to it in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the 13th-century a tithe barn was built in the village. It was, at the time, the largest aisled building in the world, being high, wide and over long. It was demolished in 1815. Fair Mile Hospital, a former psychiatric hospital, opened near Cholsey in 1870 and closed in 2003. In 2011–14 its Victorian buildings were converted to homes and new housing was built in its grounds. Notable residents Writer and poet John Masefield lived in the parish, for several years during World War I, as tenant of Lollingdon Farm, at the foot of the Berkshire Downs. He was Poet Laureate from 1936 to his death in 1967 and is most famous for a series of poems and sonnets called Lollingdon Downs and his poem Sea-Fever, which has been set to music by John Ireland. The grave of novelist Dame Agatha Christie is in the churchyard of St Mary's. She lived with her second husband, archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, at Winterbrook House, in the north of the parish, from about 1934 and died there in 1976. She and her husband Sir Max had chosen a burial plot in the mid 1960s just under the perimeter wall of the churchyard. About 20 journalists and TV reporters attended her funeral service, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned her grave including one from the cast of her long-running play The Mousetrap, and another sent \\"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\\" from the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers. Edward Prioleau Warren (1856–1937), lived at Breach House, in Halfpenny Lane, Cholsey, built in 1906, which he designed for himself. Transport Cholsey railway station Cholsey is served by Cholsey railway station, a calling point for Great Western Railway stopping services on the Great Western Main Line between Reading and Didcot. The station was also the junction for a branch line to , nicknamed the \\"Wallingford Bunk\\", which the heritage Cholsey and Wallingford Railway now operates on Bank Holidays and some weekends. From Mondays to Saturdays Thames Travel bus route 136 links Cholsey with Wallingford and Benson. There is no evening, Sunday or bank holiday service.

It aired as part of Noggin's nighttime programming block, The N. When the show started development, Sesame Workshop co-owned Noggin, and Out There was launched as a tween-oriented project for the network. The show was written, produced, and commissioned in New York, and it originated as an entirely American series with a storyline set in New York. During development, it became an American-Australian co-production (then titled Two Down Under), and filming took place mostly in Australia. The show's plot mirrors its co-development between the United States and Australia. It follows the trials and tribulations of an American high school boy named Reilly (Douglas Smith), who moves to Australia from Connecticut as his father flees the authorities. He stays with his aunt and uncle, who are the owners of a nature reserve and veterinary clinic. Reilly befriends his co-worker Aggie (Jade Ewen), a local boy named Miller (Richard Wilson), and the girl next door, Fiona (Molly McCaffrey). The series premiered on Noggin on May 23, 2003, as the inaugural show of a scheduling event called \\"Summer in The N.\\" The first four episodes were shown as a two-hour series premiere, and the remainder of the first season aired on Fridays at 9 p.m. in June and July 2003. The show ran for two seasons and 26 episodes in total. It aired its last new episode on July 1, 2004, with reruns continuing throughout the year. Production The show's concept was developed by Sesame Workshop and Noggin, both headquartered in New York. The show's plot started out as a \\"purely North American concept set in New York,\\" without any Australian elements. It began production when the Noggin channel was co-owned and jointly operated by Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop. When the show was pitched to potential broadcasters overseas, two buyers—the ABC in Australia and the BBC in Britain—wanted to see the story regionalized so that it would appeal to viewers in their respective regions. The crew \\"went back to the drawing board\\" and revised the concept, turning the main character Reilly from an average American into an American displaced in Australia. The character of Aggie was added to hold appeal to British audiences. Both the ABC and the BBC provided funding for the show. The show was first announced under the working title Two Down Under, which refers to two outsiders moving \\"down under\\" to Australia. The show aired as part of The N, a nighttime block on the Noggin channel for tween and teen-oriented shows. The show was specifically aimed at 9- to 13-year-olds, and it was marketed as a \\"tween drama.\\" According to executive producer Claire Henderson, accurately representing the American and British characters was easy, while faithfully depicting Australia was more difficult. She said, \\"Now this actually naturally worked with Reilly being the American and Aggie coming over from Britain. But you have to make sure also that Australia is represented as something that Australian kids can relate to and not some sort of false identity that might suit the other partners.\\" Synopsis In the series, Reilly moves from Greenwich, Connecticut to work with his aunt and uncle, Ellen (Genevieve Hegney) and Jonathon (David Roberts) in Australia. He is joined at the clinic by a girl named Aggie Thackery (Jade Ewen), an intern from England. She is initially annoyed at his stubborn demeanor, but grows to like him. Reilly also makes friends with an eccentric local boy, Miller McKee (Richard Wilson), and the girl next door, Fiona McDaniels (Molly McCaffrey), who both work at the clinic. In the first season, Miller is repeatedly turned down by Aggie, who does not yet return his strong feelings for her. In the second season, Reilly returns to the United States and is absent for the remainder of the series. A supposed intern from Texas named Tom (Cody Kasch) arrives, hoping for a \\"new start,\\" only to be discovered as a fraud and almost sent back to America. This season also develops three new supporting characters: the captain of Aggie's Netball team, Alice (Ashleigh Murray), who has secret affections for Miller, Gregor Krauss (Sean Kennedy), Aggie's short-lived love interest, and Miller's newfound stray dog, Hendrix.

In the most dependent parts of the body (those hanging distally), it may be called dependent edema.  Cause  The condition is commonly associated with vascular and cardiac changes associated with aging but can be caused by many other conditions, including congestive heart failure, kidney failure, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, trauma, alcoholism, altitude sickness, pregnancy, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, a compromised lymphatic system or merely long periods of time sitting or standing without moving. Some medicines (e.g. amlodipine, pregabalin) may also cause or worsen the condition. Prognosis Successful treatment depends on control of the underlying cause.

He was the earl of Northumbria from 1065 to 1066, when he was replaced by William the Conqueror with Copsi. Dispute with the Godwins Morcar and his brother Ēadwine, now Earl of Mercia, assisted the Northumbrian rebels to expel Tostig Godwinson. In October 1065 the Northumbrians chose Morcar as earl at York. He at once satisfied the people of the Bernicia by making over the government of the country beyond the River Tyne to Osulf of Bamburgh the eldest son of Eadwulf III of Bamburgh, the Bernician earl, whom Siward had slain in 1041. Marching southwards with the rebels, Morcar gathered into his forces the men of Nottingham, Derby, and Lincoln, members of the old Danish confederacy of towns, and met Ēadwine, who was at the head of a considerable force at Northampton. There the brothers and their rebel army considered proposals for peace offered to them by Earl Harold Godwinson. Negotiations continued at Oxford, where, the Northumbrians insisting on the recognition of Morcar, Harold yielded on the 28th, and Morcar's election was legalised. Events of 1066 On the death of Edward the Confessor, Morcar professedly supported Harold, but the people of his earldom were dissatisfied. Harold visited York, the seat of Morcar's government, in the spring of 1066, and overcame their disaffection by peaceful means. In the summer, Morcar joined his brother Edwin in repulsing Tostig, who was ravaging the Mercian coast. When, however, Tostig and his ally Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September, Morcar evidently was not ready to meet them; and it was not until York was threatened that, having then been joined by Edwin, he went out against them with a large army. The two earls were defeated at Fulford Gate, near York, in a fierce battle, in which, according to a Norse authority, Morcar seems to have been prominent. York was surrendered, and Harold Godwinson had to march in haste to save the north by the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Ungrateful for this deliverance, Morcar and his brother held back the forces of the north from joining Harold, in the defence of the kingdom against the Normans. After the battle of Hastings, Morcar and his brother arrived at London, sent their sister Ealdgyth, Harold's widow, to Chester, and urged the citizens to raise one or other of them to the throne. They concurred in the election of Edgar the Ætheling, but disappointed of their hope left the city with their forces and returned to the north, believing that the Conqueror would not advance so far. Before long, however, they met William of Normandy either at Berkhamstead, or more probably at Barking, after his coronation. William accepted their submission, received from them gifts and hostages, and they were reinstated. The Conqueror carried Morcar and his brother with him into Normandy in 1067, and after his return kept them at his court. Demise and death In 1068, they withdrew from the court, reached their earldoms, and rebelled against William. They were supported by a large number both of English and Welsh; the clergy, the monks, and the poor were strongly on their side, and messages were sent to every part of the kingdom to stir up resistance. Morcar's activity may perhaps be inferred from the prominent part taken in the movement by York. It seems probable, however, that Edgar was nominally the head of the rebellion, and that he was specially upheld by the Bernician district under Gospatric. Morcar and his brother were not inclined to risk too much; they advanced with their men to Warwick, and there made submission to the Conqueror, were pardoned, and again kept at court, the king treating them with an appearance of favour. On their defection, the rebellion came to nothing. In 1071, some mischief was made between them and the king, and William, it is said, was about to send them to prison, but they escaped secretly from the court. After wandering about for a while, keeping to wild country, they separated, and Morcar joined the insurgents in the Isle of Ely, and remained with them until the surrender of the island. Morcar, it is said, surrendered himself on the assurance that the king would pardon him and receive him as a loyal friend. William, however, committed him to the custody of Roger de Beaumont, who kept him closely imprisoned in Normandy. When the king was on his deathbed in 1087, he ordered that Morcar should be released, in common with others whom he had kept in prison in England and Normandy, on condition that they took an oath not to disturb the peace in either land. He was not long out of prison, for William Rufus took him to England, and on arriving at Winchester put him in prison there. Nothing further is known about him, and it is therefore probable that he died in prison. Popular culture Morcar has been portrayed by Noel Johnson in the two-part BBC TV play Conquest (1966), part of the series Theatre 625, and by Simon Rouse in the TV drama Blood Royal: William the Conqueror (1990). He is a significant character in Man With a Sword by Henry Treece, where he and Hereward the Wake are shown becoming allies and friends in spite of some past clashes. He is mentioned in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland when the Mouse attempts to dry itself and other characters by reciting a dry example of English history, this inclusion in Carroll's book is made interesting as he is distantly related to both Morcar and Edwin.

Għana has two literal meanings. The first is richness, wealth and prosperity; the second is associated with singing, verse, rhyme and even kantaliena, a type of singing with a slow rhythm. Għana can be broken up into formal and informal practices. A singer in this field is locally called \\"Għannej\\" (literally 'the singer'). Informal Għana Throughout its history, informal għana situations frequently occurred among both men and women. The informal sessions shed light on the importance of the music in day-to-day life of the Maltese. The very origins of għana can be traced back to early peasant farmers. Ciantar (2000), in his article 'From the Bar to the Stage' puts together the writings of a number of foreign and Maltese scholars who make the claim early għana instances represents both the \\"simple life of the Maltese peasant life\\", and the \\"intact natural environment of the island\\". Ciantar argues that the roots of għana are buried deep within traditional Maltese way of life, so much so that the two become synonymous with each other. Such a description by the scholar Aquilina (1931), for instance, emphasises this link between the people and għana: > How lovely it is, to hear from a remote and abandoned village amidst our > island's hills, during a moonlit evening, while the cricket is hidden among > the tomato plants, breaking the evening's silence, a handsome and healthy > young man, swarthy as our country makes him, singing his għana ceaselessly. > His soul would seemingly burst open with his singing! iantar argues that > these songs evoke the very roots of Maltese poetry and literature, a claim > that is also supported by 'Dun' Karm Psaila, Malta's national poet. In an > article on the origin of Maltese poetry, Psaila goes on to link għana to the > modest recreation and aspirations of the common people. Both scholars, Aquilina and Psaila, place għana in the 'intact' natural environment of the island: > ... one could listen to għana songs, accompanied by a guitar or an > accordion, sung by men and women on sea costs and during popular feasts such > as Lapsi (Ascension Day). Youths used to sing għana love-songs in the open > country, or the streets, or in houses during work-time even at bars such as > \\"Viva iz-zejza\\". The għajn tal-ħasselin at Msida Għana was a way to pass the time during hours of recreations and while completing household tasks. In particular, għana was practiced by the women singing on roof tops or in old communal wash houses, known as the għajn tal-ħasselin (\\"spring of the washers\\"). Wash houses were carved out of naturally forming caves around the island where water flows in a constant stream, providing a place to wash clothes. Like many other societies, men were the labourers and the women tended to the needs of the household. The women would converse with each other using rhyming song. It was a way of gossiping and passing time while they went about their household work. After washing, clothes were hung out to dry on the flat roofs typical of Maltese houses. From one roof it is easy to see – and indeed sing – across to neighbouring roofs over waist height fences. So essentially, there existed a pseudo community across the skyline of residential Malta, one in which women often took part in informal and unaccompanied għana sessions. Formal Għana There are 3 main types of għana: fil-Għoli, tal-Fatt and Spirtu Pront. Għana fil-Għoli is also known as Bormliża, taking its name from the city of Bormla where it was popular. Bormliża singing requires males to reach into extraordinarily high soprano ranges without breaking into falsetto. This style mimicked the early informal għana sung by women, but due to its extreme vocal demands, this style is very seldom practised. Għana tal-Fatt literally means 'fact' or 'actually happened'. This melancholic ballad style involves one għannej recounting a story about well known local identities, events or recent interesting or humorous, Maltese folktales and legends. Spirtu pront translates as 'quick wit', and originated from the informal 'song duels'. Other types of għana are: bil-Qamsa and Makjetta Spirtu Pront In Spirtu Pront sessions, two or more għannejja (singers) are paired together and take part in an improvised song duel that demonstrates their knowledge of a wide range of social topics as well as their command of the Maltese language. Sessions take around an hour in duration, and there may be a number of sessions that make up a whole performance. The għannejja are the living poets of the Maltese language, singing in a highly expressive, free flowing style. Their improvised melodic lines borrow heavily from Arabic influenced scales. Although improvisation is definitely an element, it is never the focus. Once a session has commenced, għannejja must participate for the entire duration, and no new singer can join. The ghannejja usually begin with an introductory comment about who is taking part in the session. This section acts as a way of easing into the bout, but has more recently been used as a way of identifying participants during taped performances. The għannejja then begin discussing the topic. This would either be predetermined, or it will be established during the course of a session, just as a conversation would. Għana is not used to settle personal differences or arguments between singers. The song subjects themes themselves are dramatic and grave, even if dealt with wittily. They may be personal honour, reflections on social values, or political (in the narrow sense of the word) (Fsadni, 1993). Singers must display their superior knowledge in the topic, while adhering to a number of formal constraints. For instance, their improvised responses must rhyme, phrases should be in an 8, 7, 8, 7 syllabic structure, and singers must use 'high- flown' language. This form of language is not one that is used in ordinary social intercourse. It is highly elaborate making use of wit and double- entendre, and drawing on the many Maltese proverbs and idiomatic phrases. The Maltese language is a very ancient language, and compared to English, it does not contain many adjectives or adverbs. Instead, over the centuries, the Maltese have developed a rich and colourful library of proverbs to act as their descriptors. Occasionally, depending on the għannej, the language used is overtly self-righteous. Ultimately, this type of practice creates tension between competing għannejja. In most cases, the għannejja would be shaking hands with their opponent, similar to a sporting match, showing that what they are saying is only for entertainment and they do not mean to cause any offence. The accompaniment is provided by three guitars usually strumming Western influenced tonic to dominant chordal progressions. This gives għana a very unusual sound, not quite Eastern, but not quite Western. In between sung verses, the next għannej (singer) is given time to prepare a respond to his opponents' remarks while the prim (first) guitar improvises melodies based on traditional għana melodies. The għana guitar is modelled on the Spanish guitar, and is described by Marcia Herndon as: > ... a standard instrument, with metal frets and turning keys, metal strings, > and traditional decorations on the front. It differs from the standard > guitar only in that there are two sizes. The solo guitar is slightly smaller > than the accompanying instruments. This, along with the method of tuning, > indicates the presence in Malta of an older tradition of guitar playing > which has almost died out elsewhere in the Mediterranean. The guitars are > played with or without the use of a pick. Prejjem During spirtu pront, the \\"prim\\" begins improvising along a motive chosen from a 'restricted' repertory of Ghana motives. This section is known as the prejjem. These motives are popular, not only among the dilettante, but are well known outside of the għana community by the general Maltese public. The lead guitarist begins with an introductory section accompanied by the strumming of triadic, diatonic chords provided by the other guitarists. As soon as the former completes his improvisation he joins the other guitarists in the accompaniment based on the tonic and dominant of the established key. The function of this introductory section is to establish the tonality and tempo for the session. Tonality changes from one session to another in a whole performance, depending on what collectively suits the għannejja (singers). In the most frequently used 'La' accompaniment (akkumpanjament fuq il-La), the strings of the lead guitar will be tuned to e a d' g' b' e² while those of the second accompanying guitars will be tuned a minor third lower, except for the bottom string: e f# b e' g#' c#². The tone quality of these locally produced guitars is described by Ciantar (1997) as \\"very compact, with very low bass resonance\\". Such tuning is through to better facilitate the technical demands imposed on the lead guitarist in the creation of new motifs and variations. In the introductory section a series of rhythmic and intervallic structures are created and developed; this same rhythmic and melodic material is then reiterated in the second section by both the ghannejja and the lead guitarist. The frequent use of syncopation and descending melodic movements, for instance, form part of the formal structure of both the singing and instrumental soloing in the spirtu pront; these are structural elements announced in the introductory section as to establish the style of both Ghana singing and playing.

Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about coping with grief is a primary focus. Death education is formally known as thanatology. Thanatology stems from the Greek word thanatos, meaning death, and ology meaning a science or organized body of knowledge.Corr, 2013, p. 5 A specialist in this field is referred to as a thanatologist. Death education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people who are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up with others. With the right education about death, the less taboo it may become. History Historically death education in American society has been seen as a taboo topic, not worthy of scholarly research or for educational purposes. In the 1960s pioneering professionals like that of Herman Feifel (1959), Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (1969), and Cicely Saunders (1967) encouraged behavioral scientists, clinicians, and humanists to pay attention and to study death-related topics. This initiated the death-awareness movement and began the widespread study of death-related behavior, developing new programs of care for the dying and bereaved, as well as new research on death- related attitudes.Corr, 2013, p. 5 Goals \\"Death is no enemy of life; it restores our sense of the value of living. Illness restores the sense of proportion that is lost when we take life for granted. To learn about value and proportion we need to honor illness, and ultimately to honor death.\\"Frank, 2002, p. 120 Death education honors death by educating about death, dying, and bereavement to enrich personal lives, inform and guide individuals in their transactions with society, prepare individuals for their public roles as citizens, help prepare and support individuals in their professional and vocational roles, and lastly to enhance the ability of individuals to communicate effectively about death-related matters.Corr, 2013, p. 13-14 Hospice One of the major organizations that educates people on death is Hospice. Hospice offers support for the caregiver, and Hospice also offers information on what to expect before death and what the family can expect after death. One of the major subjects that hospice addresses within death are the myths that come along with death. Hospice will also walk caretakers through the signs and symptoms to look for that signify death. Hospice is an important type of care that helps spread and explain death education to the people. When people have a loved one that is not able to get anymore help from medication or doctors, it would be a good recommendation for them to go to hospice. They would be able to receive great support and comfort during the end of their life journey. Not only does hospice give care to the terminally ill, they also give grief suggestions to family members and close friends. \\"With proper care, proper support, and love, we can share the miracle that is life\\". The end of a person's life should be centered on being alive instead of being dead. Curriculum Students of a death education course need to clearly understand the complex knowledge of the subject, learn the five key areas of knowledge, and to learn the physical, psycho-social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of death. The five key areas are: understanding the dying process, decision making for end of life, loss, grief, and bereavement, assessment and intervention, and traumatic death. Death education should be taught in perspective and one's emotional response should be proportionate to the occasion. In addition death education can be taught formally or informally. Formally planned death education is associated with learning in organized educational settings including: schools, colleges, graduate education, professional workshops, and volunteer training programs.Corr, 2013, p. 7 Stages of dying In her book, In Death and Dying (1969), Elisabeth Kubler-Ross proposed the five stages of the dying process. Though her work has often been referred to as the \\"five stages of grief,\\" the original work was based on her clinical observations of the psychosocial responses of terminally ill patients to their impending death. Much scholarly debate has surrounded the legitimacy of her five \\"stages\\"—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Experienced psychosocial clinicians have largely rejected the accuracy of the model because it addresses only emotional states, sets up false expectations of the process, and have not been empirically verified as a descriptive model. The first stage is denial and isolation. When you first hear about a loved one who has a deathly illness your first instinct is to deny the reality of the situation. This is known as a defense mechanism because we block out the words by not fully processing them and also hide from the facts. The second stage is anger. Once the blocking out subsides the reality of the situation becomes overwhelming and the pain from the news emerges. The third stage is bargaining. This stage you will feel more vulnerable and helpless. In order to gain control again you'll start thinking of ways that would have made it better like: • \\"If only we had sought medical attention sooner…\\" • \\"If only we got a second opinion from another doctor…\\" • \\"If only we had tried to be a better person toward them…\\" All of these are defense lines to try and protect us from the reality of pain in a lost one. The fourth stage is depression. In this stage there can be two different types of depression that you deal with. The first type of depression can be a more quiet and private feeling. The second type of depression is the kind where sadness and regret overtake your body and become the predominate factors in your life. The fifth and final stage is acceptance. This stage does not always reach everyone but for the people who actually get it should consider this stage as a gift. It does not mean that you will not be sad anymore but it does mean that there is going to be some kind of peace that you are able to reach with the loved one that died. Summary Even though people are still conservative towards the idea of death and dying, with help and the education of death, people will come to know death as a natural part of life that everyone will someday have to go through. Instead of being timid and scared of death, people will become comfortable towards the topic and be able to prepare for what will come in the future. Death education is not just for medical professionals and those dealing with the terminally ill but rather death education is beneficial to everyone for it reveals the importance of quality in living and the human search for meaning. \\"Dying was what human life moved toward and therefore dying was what a human being constantly prepared for.\\"Moran, 2003 References =Works cited= *Corr, C.

It is positioned on an elevated grade above and between the nearby parallel West Mulberry and West Franklin Streets (U.S. Route 40) at 400 North Smallwood Street. Three large surface lots are available for commuters. The station is not handicapped accessible, with four low-level side platforms next to the outer tracks, but MTA Maryland plans to later renovate the outdoor station with accessible platforms and entrances. History =Edmondson= The former Edmondson station building in 2017 The Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P;), owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, opened to Baltimore in 1873. By the early 1900s, the PRR stopped at Lafayette and Calverton (also known as Gwynns Falls) west of Baltimore, serving local residential areas. Because both the B&P; and the Northern Central Railway approached Penn Station from the west, PRR through trains from Washington to Harrisburg had to operate in reverse from Baltimore to Washington. To correct this, the PRR planned to replace the two stops with a single intercity-oriented station located between them, along with a wye at the north end of the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel to allow trains to bypass Penn Station. The PRR opened bidding for station construction, with an estimated cost of $50,000 (), in July 1916. The Spanish Mission style station, constructed of red brick with a terra-cotta tile roof, was designed by PRR staff architect William Holmes Cookman. The station, named Edmondson, opened on May 1, 1917. Original plans called for the installation of high-level platforms and a footbridge connecting them to the station building. However, this was delayed by the nationalization of railroads during World War I, and neither the station improvements nor the wye was ultimately built. Unlike the comparable North Philadelphia station, Edmondson was not a success. It was far from the city center without a good transit connection to it, and without the wye the station did not serve Harrisburg trains. Instead of being a major intercity stop, Edmondson was mostly served by local commuter service between Washington and Baltimore. Local service continued under Penn Central from 1968 to 1976, then under Conrail until 1983, and finally as the Amtrak-operated, state-funded AMDOT service (renamed the MARC Penn Line in 1984). The station was briefly closed in March 1979 after an accident destroyed the stairway to the platform. Amtrak's Chesapeake, a limited-stop commuter train between Washington and Philadelphia, began stopping at Edmondson on July 29, 1979. The Chesapeake was discontinued on October 30, 1983. =West Baltimore= Americans with Disabilities Act. Edmondson continued to be a stop on the state-funded commuter service. The Edmondson and Frederick Road stops were closed on April 27, 1984; they were replaced with West Baltimore station, two blocks to the south of Edmondson Avenue, on April 30. The stairs and platforms were removed, but the station building remains in place as a private business (which it had been converted to even before the stop closed). In 2009, it was announced that approximately 400 parking spaces east of Pulaski Street would be added, as part of the project to remove the portion of Interstate 170 (now Route 40) that had never carried vehicular traffic. The spots were not to be permanent, but instead only available until redevelopment of the surrounding neighborhood. The expressway was demolished in the fall of 2010, and the spaces opened soon after. West Baltimore station has attracted criticism for being unsafe due to crime and the poor conditions of the platforms and staircases, which are crumbling and rusted. As part of the larger project to repair the Interstate 170 area, the station will be improved over a period of several years. Immediate repairs to the stairs and platforms, as well as improved shelters and lighting, were made in 2014. Ultimately, the platforms will be extended to serve more cars per train and raised for handicapped accessibility, and ramps built to surrounding streets. The Red Line light rail service, originally planned to begin construction in 2015 (before its cancellation that year) and open in 2022, was to run along the Route 40 corridor in the median of the highway underneath the elevated city streets with a stop at West Baltimore. Escalators and elevators would be used to transport commuters from the station to the streets above the Route 40 corridor in West Baltimore.

He was soon recognised as the true incarnation of Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, (1570–1662), the Fourth Panchen Lama of Tibet, and was installed with great ceremony at Tashilhunpo Monastery. He received novice vows when he was 8 (9 by Western reckoning) in Lhasa from Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama (1617 – 1682), when he was given the name of Lobsang Yeshe.

It is on the Sokolnicheskaya line, serving as its eastern terminus. The station was opened in 1990. Riders may make an out-of-station transfer to Bulvar Rokossovskogo on the Moscow Central Circle line.  History  = Name = The station was originally named \\"Ulitsa Podbelskogo\\" for Podbelskogo Street, which was named for the Bolshevik revolutionary Vadim Podbelsky. Even after the street was renamed in 1991 to Ivanteyevskaya Street, the station's name was unchanged until 2014. On 10 April 2014 Moscow City Commission on Names recommended renaming the station to \\"Bulvar Marshala Rokossovskogo\\", for Rokossovsky Boulevard, which was named for Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. On 8 July, the station was officially renamed to \\"Bulvar Rokossovskogo\\". = Future plans = Rather than continuing the straight path of the Sokolnicheskaya line to the northeast, Bulvar Rokossovskogo was built to the northwest of Cherkizovskaya, forming a right angle with the rest of the line. This would allow Bulvar Rokossovskogo to eventually become part of a planned second ring line around the city, at which time the Sokolnicheskaya line could presumably be further extended in its original direction. Beyond Bulvar Rokossovskogo are reversal sidings which are planned to become part of the future \\"Big Ring\\" line. A junction between Bulvar Rokossovskogo and Cherkizovskaya is used by southbound trains entering and leaving the Cherkizovo depot (No. 13), since the depot is directly connected only to the southbound tunnel.  Design  Station platform Bulvar Rokossovskogo is a shallow column tri-vault station. The station was designed by architects Nina Aleshin and Natalya K.

He subsequently played for the Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals. A solid hitter with power, Peralta has rated average defensively. He throws and bats right-handed, stands , and weighs . Peralta was the 2004 Indians Minor League Player of the Year as well as the International League Most Valuable Player for one of Cleveland's minor league affiliates, the Buffalo Bisons, after batting .326 with 44 doubles, 15 home runs and 86 runs batted in. Buffalo was also the International League champion that same season. Each year from 2005 through 2015, Peralta reached at least 100 hits, and double figures in both home runs and doubles. He is a three-time MLB All-Star selection. He set single-season home run records for shortstops for two franchises – for the Indians in 2005, and the Cardinals in 2014. While a member of the Tigers in 2013, he served a 50-game suspension for his role in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal. In 2017 he batted .204/.259/.204, and in July 2017 he was released by the Red Sox. Playing career (1999–2017) =Minor leagues (1999–2004)= The Cleveland Indians signed Peralta as an amateur free agent in 1999 and assigned him to the Dominican Summer League Indians that season. Peralta batted .303 with a .398 on-base percentage (OBP) and a .514 slugging percentage (SLG); 41 percent of his hits went for extra bases. Those figures were boosted by an unsustainable .373 batting average on balls in play (BABIP). Nevertheless, the Indians promoted him aggressively. In 2000, the 18-year-old Peralta played for the Columbus RedStixx, the Class A affiliate of the Indians in the South Atlantic League. He batted .241 in 106 games, playing all but one game at shortstop (the other was at third base). The following season he advanced to the Kinston Indians, the Cleveland Indians High-A affiliate in the Carolina League. In 125 games, he batted .240. In 2002, Peralta moved up to the Double-A Akron Aeros, where he hit .281. In 2003, he batted .257 in 63 games with the Buffalo Bisons. After his 2003 call up to the major leagues, Peralta began to draw widespread attention for his hitting with the Aeros and Bisons. In 2004, he batted .326 with 15 home runs (HR) and 86 runs batted in (RBI). He also scored 109 runs and stroked 44 doubles, the most ever in the Bisons' modern era, followed by 39 for Kevin Pillar in 2014. This offensive leap helped him win the International League Most Valuable Player Award that year and helped Buffalo win the Governors' Cup as the International League champions. He also received the Lou Boudreau Award as the Indians' 2004 Minor League Player of the Year. =Cleveland Indians (2003–10)= Cleveland Indians in 2009 Peralta made his Major League debut with Cleveland on June 12, 2003, filling in for the injured Gold Glove shortstop Omar Vizquel. He finished with a .227 batting average with four HR and 21 RBIs. The next season, despite his accomplishments at the Triple-A level, Peralta saw just 25 at bats (AB) in eight games at the major league level due to the presence of perennial fan- favorite Vizquel, who left the Indians as a free agent following the 2004 season. Peralta became Cleveland's full-time starting shortstop early in 2005 and batted .292. On July 3, he became affixed in the Indians' third slot in the batting order. Cleveland then won 23 of their next 33 games to put them one game behind the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card race late in August. He joined Woodie Held as the only shortstops in Indians' history to hit at least 20 HR. His 24 HR and 78 RBI set records for an Indians shortstop. On March 10, 2006, Peralta agreed to a five-year contract with an option for a sixth year to stay with the Indians until the 2011 season. However, his 2006 season saw a decline both offensively and defensively from the previous season. At the start of spring training in 2007, it was revealed that Peralta suffered from vision problems in 2006 and had corrective LASIK eye surgery to deal with it. After breaking an 0 for 8 skid on May 1, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers, Peralta's 86th career home run with the Indians broke the team record for shortstops Woodie Held had held. His HR was solo, providing the margin of victory for Cleveland in a 6–5 score. Peralta hit his first inside-the-park home run on July 18, 2010, against Tigers pitcher Andy Oliver on a play in which outfielder Ryan Raburn crashed through the bullpen door attempting to catch the ball.Castrovince, Anthony. Peralta hits improbable inside-the-parker MLB.com. Retrieved July 9, 2012 =Detroit Tigers (2010–13)= Ten days after hitting his first inside-the-park-home-run against the Tigers, the Indians traded Peralta to the Tigers for minor league pitcher Giovanni Soto and cash considerations. Because the club had already retired the number 2 – Peralta's uniform number as an Indian – in honor of Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer, he chose the number 27 instead. On July 30, Peralta hit a home run in his first plate appearance (PA) as a Tiger, and then, another, two plate appearances later. After joining the Tigers, he returned to primarily playing shortstop. He made 46 appearances shortstop, nine at third base, four at designated hitter and two at first base for the remainder of the 2010 season. Detroit Tigers in 2011 Peralta was named to his first career All-Star Game as a replacement for Derek Jeter on July 8, 2011. He finished the regular season with a career-high .299 batting average and collected 21 home runs and 86 RBI. Playing a full season at shortstop for the first time since 2008, he committed just seven errors in 608 chances for a career-best .988 fielding percentage. Peralta hit his first walk-off home run as a Tiger against the Chicago White Sox on May 4, 2012. On June 20, 2013, Peralta hit a walkoff two-run home run off Boston Red Sox closer Andrew Bailey to secure the Tigers' victory, 4–3. It was the Tigers' first walkoff win of the season. That season, Peralta was named to his second AL All-Star team as a reserve shortstop. This was his first selection by player vote (his previous selection was as an injury replacement). Peralta entered the All-Star break with a .303 batting average, eight home runs and 46 RBIs. However, a cloud overshadowed what was shaping to be one of Peralta's best seasons. On August 5, he accepted a 50-game suspension for his role in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal.Twelve players get 50-game suspensions MLB.com August 6, 2013 On September 25, the Tigers announced that Peralta would be activated to the 40-man roster following his suspension. He returned two days later for the final series of the regular season. In his shortened regular season, Peralta batted .303 with 11 home runs and 55 RBI in 107 games. Because Detroit had acquired rookie shortstop José Iglesias from the Boston Red Sox during the suspension, manager Jim Leyland installed Peralta mainly in left field for the remainder of the season and playoffs. The Tigers, including general manager Dave Dombrowski, expressed exoneration of Peralta's breach following the suspension. Despite derisive chants from fans and actions such as the San Francisco Giants leaving similar violator Melky Cabrera off their playoff roster during their World Series-winning season, the Tigers saw the 50-game suspension as sufficient punishment. With the Tigers down 3–0 and facing elimination against the Athletics in Game 4 of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Peralta connected for a three-run home run in the fifth inning. It was \\"perhaps the biggest swing of the playoffs for the Tigers so far\\", surmised sportswriter Noah Trister. The Tigers eventually won the ALDS but lost to the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. In ten playoff games, Peralta batted .333 with four doubles, one home run and six runs batted in. =St. Louis Cardinals (2014–2017)= Peralta batting in 2014 On November 24, 2013, Peralta signed a four-year contract worth $53 million with the St. Louis Cardinals. Featuring a declining salary structure, the contract commenced with his salary at $15.5 million in 2014, then $15 million, $12.5 million, and finally $10 million in 2017. Without a qualifying offer from the Tigers, the Cardinals were not obligated to return a first-round draft pick. Controversy with free agent signing However, the signing drew scrutiny because he had served the suspension for his connection to the Biogenesis scandal. Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Brad Ziegler spearheaded a cacophony of complaints that the 50-game suspension was not enough of a deterrent, because he viewed that it failed to prevent players who violated the collective bargaining agreement's banned substances use policy to receive compensation for their performances equal to those who had not been found to violate the policy. Cabrera had signed with the Toronto Blue Jays for two years and $16 million following his suspension in 2012; however, little protest had arisen from those relatively modest figures. Peralta scoring in 2014 Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak countered by illustrating that the Cardinals were not self-appointed \\"morality police. ... Character and makeup are something we weigh into our decision-making. In his case, he admitted what he did, he took responsibility for it. I feel like he has paid for his mistakes, and obviously if he were to make another one, then it would be a huge disappointment.\\" New teammate and Cardinals outfielder Matt Holliday, an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing drugs (PED), declared indemnity. \\"I am against PEDs and always will be,\\" he said at the Cardinals' winter fan festival. \\"But I also am a forgiving person and he served his suspension. That's the rules of the game. I'm happy to have him as a teammate. ... His teammates in Detroit welcomed him back.\\" Manager Mike Matheny echoed a similar averment. 2014 On April 27, 2014, Peralta hit his first multi-homer game in Busch Stadium against the Pittsburgh Pirates. It also gave him six home runs for the month, surpassing Édgar Rentería's club record of five in April he set for shortstops in 2000. Peralta surpassed another team record for shortstops Rentería set in 2000, hitting his 17th home run of the season on August 20. While he produced his usual amount of home runs, his batting average was inconsistent early in the season. In each month from April to August, it progressed from .196 to .237 to .241 to .252 to .270. With the second-place Pirates just a game behind in the standings with two left to play for the season, Peralta drove in the go-ahead run in the 10th inning against the Diamondbacks as part of a three-RBI night. He ended the season leading the Cardinals in home runs with 21. Peralta also led the club in doubles (38) and was second in slugging percentage (.443), RBI (75), total bases (248) and games played (157). His batting average was .263 and OBP .336. In his first season in the National League (NL), Peralta ranked seventh in the league in doubles and sixth in games played. According to Baseball-Reference.com's advanced metrics, he had his best season defensively, finishing fifth in the NL among all players – third among shortstops – with 2.6 defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR). His combined offensive and defensive WAR placed tenth among all NL players at 5.8. In counting and rate defensive statistics among NL shortstops, he finished second in double plays turned (98), and fifth in fielding percentage (.981), putouts (191), assists (418), and range factor per nine innings (4.17). On October 23, The Sporting News announced Peralta was selected to their NL All-Star team. He finished 15th in the NL MVP voting, the first time in his career he received consideration for the award. Third All-Star selection (2015) On May 25, 2015, Peralta hit a walk-off home run in the tenth inning against the Diamondbacks, his seventh home run of the season. In his time with the Cardinals through June 1, he ranked first in extra-base hits (80) and home runs (29), third in RBI (101), second in slugging percentage (.461) and OPS (.804) and fourth in on-base percentage (.361) among MLB shortstops. On defense, he did not rely heavily on range, but on smart positioning and making the routine plays, qualifying him for +1 defensive runs saved after saving 17 the year before. He was selected as the National League's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati after batting .298 with 13 home runs and 46 RBI over the first 87 games in 2015. After the All-Star break, he batted .243, and produced three doubles and two home runs over the final two months, or 54 games. Peralta finished the season with a .275 batting average, 17 home runs, 71 RBI, 26 doubles, and 159 hits in 155 games played. Final years with St. Louis (2016-2017) Thumb injuries caused Peralta to miss significant time in 2016. While fielding a ball during spring training on March 7, he damaged an ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb. He underwent surgery to repair the ligament and was expected to miss 10 to 12 weeks of play. He began a rehabilitation assignment with the Single-A Peoria Chiefs on May 20, 2016, and the club activated him for game action before a series against Cincinnati on June 7. The Cardinals placed him back on the on disabled list on July 19 due to swelling in the left thumb, although that injury appeared unrelated to the torn ligament and an MRI had revealed no structural damage, per Mozeliak. In 2017 he batted .204/.259/.204. He was designated for assignment by the Cardinals on June 9, 2017 and he was released on June 13. =Boston Red Sox= The Boston Red Sox signed Jhonny Peralta on June 23, 2017. The Red Sox were in serious need of a third baseman after Hernandez and Holt suffered season- ending injuries, Rutledge juggled 2B and 3B after an injury to Pedroia, Marrero was struggling with his bat, and an injury-plagued Pablo Sandoval made multiple mistakes at the plate and at the hot corner before an ear infection. The Red Sox were left with Marrero at third, when Dombrowski announced the team would be making serious improvements at third. That came on the same day as the Peralta signing. Peralta never played in a Major League game for the Red Sox, and on July 13, 2017, he was released by the Red Sox. Skills profile The metrics for Peralta's overall career defense show him as an average shortstop. However, his numbers have improved to the point where he was once a below-average shortstop to being a well above-average defender.

It was released on 4 May 1998 by Creation Records. The American spelling of humor is used in the title as the band were, according to Sarah Cracknell, \\"fed up with the 'quintessentially English' tag, so there was a bit of a backlash against that.\\"O'Hara, Gail (2010). \\"How is it your least 'English' album?\\". In Good Humor, deluxe edition [CD booklet]. Universal Music. The album was a departure for the group, who had been associated with the indie dance genre. Tiger Bay, their previous album, had added many acoustic and orchestral elements but still belonged to the synthpop and dance genres, while Good Humor is more acoustic, having more in common musically with their 1993 hit single \\"You're in a Bad Way\\". Good Humor was demoed in the UK using synths and drum machines, but was recorded in Sweden under the guidance of Tore Johansson, who augmented their sound with a full band and a horn section. Production Good Humor was recorded in two weeks at Tambourine Studios, Malmö, Sweden. The album was produced by Tore Johansson, who had produced all of The Cardigans' previous studio albums. Most of the B-sides were also recorded and produced during the two-week sessions. Sarah Cracknell cut short the promotion of her solo album Lipslide and single \\"Goldie\\" to record the album. The album's opening track, \\"Wood Cabin\\", contains the lyrics \\"Never write a love song/Never write a trip out/Never write a ballad\\". These lines are paraphrased from an interview that the Manic Street Preachers did for BBC2's Snub TV in 1991 (\\"We'll never write a love song, ever. Full stop. Or a ballad, or a trip-out...\\"), when the Manics and Saint Etienne were both signed to Heavenly Records. Release Saint Etienne had always been affiliated with Creation Records through Heavenly Records, but Good Humor was their first release for the label proper. Its original release date was planned for summer 1997 but was delayed by Creation because they were committed to promoting Oasis's album Be Here Now. In the United States, the group was signed to the Sub Pop label. A limited edition of the US release contained a bonus disc titled Fairfax High, consisting mostly of B-sides from UK singles. Each of the tracks on the bonus disc is available as part of the 2010 deluxe edition of Good Humor. Fairfax High was the first of a series of US-only singles, albums and EPs. The first single was \\"Sylvie\\", which reached number twelve on the UK Singles Chart. The band wanted \\"Lose That Girl\\" to be the second single from the album, but Creation decided on \\"The Bad Photographer\\", which reached number twenty-seven. \\"Lose That Girl\\" was scheduled for release by Creation in late 1998 but was scrapped at close to the last minute.Saint Etienne Heaven!

Joshua \\"Jack\\" Huddy (November 8, 1735April 12, 1782), the commander of a New Jersey Patriot militia unit and a privateer ship during the American Revolutionary War, was noted as a figure of controversy after he was executed by irregular forces of the Associated Loyalists. He had been twice captured by Loyalist forces, escaping after the first time. His execution was noted for precipitating one of the first international incidents of the fledgling United States. To retaliate for Huddy's execution, the Continentals wanted to execute a young captive British officer, which would have violated the terms of the Yorktown surrender and was known as the \\"Asgill Affair\\". The French government, allies of the US, put pressure on the Americans to show the officer mercy, and the Continental Congress voted to order his release, as Washington had turned the issue over to them. Early life Huddy was born November 8, 1735, to a prosperous family in Salem County, Province of New Jersey, the oldest of seven brothers. His grandfather, Hugh Huddy, was a well-known judge in Burlington. Huddy spent most of his early life in Salem, where he was considered rebellious and a troublemaker. He was disowned by Quakers in Salem in 1757 for his \\"disorderly\\" conduct. His \\"rough ways\\" continued into adulthood; he was tried and convicted several times for crimes including assault and theft and repeatedly had financial difficulties. He was forced to sell a 300-acre (1.2 km²) plantation in Salem to pay his debts and was forced into debtor's prison for a time. In 1764, he married his first wife, the widowed Mary Borden, by whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Martha, before her death. In the 1770s, Huddy moved to Colts Neck in Monmouth County. There, on October 27, 1778, he married his second wife, Catherine (Applegate) Hart, also a widow and owner of the Colts Neck Tavern, which she had inherited from her first husband, Levy Hart. Huddy was later accused by the Monmouth County sheriff of trying to steal the tavern from his wife and to force her children out onto the street. He often appeared in civil and criminal court, either as plaintiff or defendant. Military career Huddy allied with the American revolutionists and engaged in the raids and revenge executions that characterized the intense violence among Monmouth County residents, often involving personal feuds. The actions continued even after the war. He served as captain of the Monmouth Militia from March to December 1779. Huddy led several raids in which he and his men seized materials allegedly sold illegally to the British in New York; he captured and sometimes executed Loyalists. He was accused of hanging Stephen Edwards, the first Loyalist to die in the county, and 14 others. He denied at least one of the murders. In August 1780, Huddy was issued a commission to operate a gunboat, The Black Snake, as a privateer. One month later, he was captured in his house in Colts Neck at night by 25 Loyalist raiders led by Colonel Tye, a former slave. Huddy and his mistress Lucretia Edmonds held off the attackers in a two-hour-long gun battle, but after the Loyalists set fire to his house, Huddy agreed to surrender to if they would extinguish the blaze. Colonel Tye marched Huddy to what is now West Park in Rumson, New Jersey, where he was put on a boat to go to New York, which was occupied by the British. However, Patriots on the other side of the Shrewsbury River fired on the boat, which capsized. Huddy, wounded in the thigh, managed to swim to shore and escape. Capture and execution On February 1, 1782, Huddy was given command of the blockhouse, a small fort, at the village of Toms River that was built to protect the local salt works. The salt was needed to cure meat destined for American troops, and the Toms River was an important launch point for Patriot privateers. On March 24, a large irregular force of the Associated Loyalists, an organization headed by William Franklin, overwhelmed Huddy's small band of defenders and took the fort. They destroyed the blockhouse, salt works, local mills, and all but two houses in the village, leaving dozens of people homeless.Virginia Watson Reeve, \\"The Story of Captain Joshua Huddy,\\" Joshua Huddy Chapter, National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, Ocean County, NJ, March 30, 1950. As an officer, Huddy was transferred to a military prison ship at New York, then held by the British.Benjamin Johnson, \\"General Washington's Terrible Dilemma,\\" Massachusetts Historical Society, October 2007, www.masshist.org/ Soon, however, Huddy was removed from British custody by a band of Associated Loyalists, headed by Captain Richard Lippincott, ostensibly for the purpose of making a prisoner exchange. No such exchange was planned, however. Instead, Lippincott's forces took Huddy by boat to Middletown Point, a location on the south coast of Sandy Hook Bay. They landed on the beach at the foot of the Navesink Hills. There, on April 12, 1782, they hanged Huddy after they had allowed him to dictate and sign his will. In the rounds of retaliation, Huddy's summary execution by the Loyalists was retaliation for the death in Patriot custody of Loyalist farmer Philip White. The Loyalist executioners left a note on Huddy's breast: \\"Up Goes Huddy for Phillip White.\\" It was reported in a letter to Washington that Huddy died calmly and bravely, declaring that he would \\"Dye [sic] Innocent, and in a good Cause.\\" The next morning, Patriots found Huddy's body hanging from the gallows, cut it down, and brought it to Freehold, where they buried him at Old Tennent Church. More than 400 people gathered to protest his execution, and a petition was sent to General George Washington to demand retribution by execution of a British officer of similar rank if Captain Lippincott was not surrendered. Both Washington and the commander of British forces in New York, General Sir Henry Clinton, condemned the hanging. The British forbade the Board of Loyalists from removing any additional prisoners. Sir Guy Carleton, Clinton's successor, later abolished the organization. \\"Asgill Affair\\" Sir Charles Asgill, slated by random lot for execution to avenge the killing of Joshua Huddy. Patriotic sentiment ran high following the killing of Huddy. In an effort to avert independent reprisals by the New Jersey militia, Washington agreed to the proposition to select a British prisoner of war for retaliatory execution. Washington issued an order to General Moses Hazen to select a British prisoner by lot to be hanged in retribution. Straws were drawn on May 26, 1782 and a young British officer, Captain Charles Asgill, drew the short straw. If Lippincott was not turned over to the Patriots for trial, Asgill was to be killed. The situation was complicated by the fact that Asgill and the other British captive officers were protected under the terms of surrender agreed to between British General Charles Cornwallis and Washington following the Siege of Yorktown in October of the previous year. Executing Asgill would have violated the terms of the surrender and created a black eye for the rebellious colonials who were intent upon establishing an independent nation. Washington turned to an old associate, General Benjamin Lincoln, formerly the second in command of the Continental Army and the acting Secretary of War of the Americans. While he and other ranking Continental Army officers continued to favor a retaliatory killing, they urged patience. The delay ultimately allowed sufficient time for intercession by the Americans' French allies. The mother of the condemned British captain appealed directly for help to French King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette. French Foreign Minister Comte de Vergennes was directed to plead Asgill's case to Washington. Catherine Hart, Huddy's widow, also said that she wanted Asgill's life spared since the captain was innocent. Backed by diplomatic pressure to lift the execution order, the military turned the issue over to the Continental Congress for decision. Asgill was freed by order of Congress passed on November 7, 1782. Asgill was issued a pass to British lines and returned to Britain. After the war, Lippincott emigrated to Canada, where the Loyalist was granted 3,000 acres (12 km²) by the Crown as a reward for his services to Britain. Legacy Huddy Park sign Huddy's legacy lives on throughout Central New Jersey, specifically Monmouth County. In Highlands, New Jersey, Huddy Park as well as a street are named after him.

It resembles a common watermelon vine, but bears small, hard fruits with a bitter pulp. It originally bore the scientific name Colocynthis citrullus. Origin, distribution, and ecology C. colocynthis is a desert viny plant that grows in sandy, arid soils. It is native to the Mediterranean Basin and Asia, and is distributed among the west coast of northern Africa, eastward through the Sahara, Egypt until India, and reaches also the north coast of the Mediterranean and the Caspian Seas. It grows also in southern European countries as in Spain and on the islands of the Grecian archipelago. On the island of Cyprus, it is cultivated on a small scale; it has been an income source since the 14th century and is still exported today. It is an annual or a perennial plant (in wild) in Indian arid zones and has a great survival rate under extreme xeric conditions. In fact, it can tolerate annual precipitation of 250 to 1500 mm and an annual temperature of 14.8 to 27.8 °C. It grows from sea level up to 1500 meters above sea level on sandy loam, subdesert soils, and sandy sea coasts with a pH range between 5.0 and 7.8. Characteristics and morphology =Roots and stems= The roots are large, fleshy, and perennial, leading to a high survival rate due to the long tap root. The vine- like stems spread in all directions for a few meters looking for something over which to climb. If present, shrubs and herbs are preferred and climbed by means of auxiliary branching tendrils. =Leaves= Very similar to watermelon, the leaves are palmate and angular with three to seven divided lobes. =Flowers= The flowers are yellow and solitary in the axes of leaves and are borne by yellow-greenish peduncles. Each has a subcampanulated five- lobed corolla and a five-parted calyx. They are monoecious, so the male (stamens) and the female reproductive parts (pistils and ovary) are borne in different flowers on the same plant. The male flowers’ calyx is shorter than the corolla. They have five stamens, four of which are coupled and one is single with monadelphous anther. The female flowers have three staminoids and a three-carpel ovary. The two sexes are distinguishable by observing the globular and hairy inferior ovary of the female flowers. A C. colocynthis female flower Iranian C. colocynthis Ripe fruit of C. colocynthis =Fruits= The fruit is smooth, spheric with a 5– to 10-cm-diameter and extremely bitter taste. The calyx englobe the yellow-green fruit which becomes marble (yellow stripes) at maturity. The mesocarp is filled with a soft, dry, and spongy white pulp, in which the seeds are embedded. Each of the three carpels bears six seeds. Each plant produces 15 to 30 fruits. =Seeds= The seeds are grey and 5 mm long by 3 mm wide. They are edible but similarly bitter, nutty- flavored, and rich in fat and protein. They are eaten whole or used as an oilseed. The oil content of the seeds is 17–19% (w/w), consisting of 67–73% linoleic acid, 10–16% oleic acid, 5–8% stearic acid, and 9–12% palmitic acid. The oil yield is about 400 l/hectare. In addition, the seeds contain a high amount of arginine, tryptophan, and the sulfur-containing amino acids. Cultivation C. colocynthis, a perennial plant, can propagate both by generative and vegetative means. However, seed germination is poor due to the extreme xeric conditions, so vegetative propagation is more common and successful in nature. In the Indian arid zone, growth takes place between January and October, but the most favorable period for the vegetative growth is during summer, which coincides with the rainy season. Growth declines as soon as the rains and the temperature decrease and almost stops during the cold and dry months of December and January. Colocynth prefers sandy soils and is a good example of good water management which may be useful also on research to better understand how desert plants react to water stress. To enhance production, an organic fertilizer can be applied. Colocynth is also commonly cultivated together with cassava (intercropping) in Nigeria. Adrar Desert (Mauritania). Cultivated colocynth suffers of climatic stress and diseases such as cucumber mosaic virus, melon mosaic virus, Fusarium wilt, etc. as any other crop. To improve it, a relatively new protocol for regeneration has been developed with the aim of incorporating disease and stress resistance to increase yield potential and security avoiding interspecific hybridization barriers. Uses C. colocynthis can be eaten or elaborated for further uses in medicine and as energy source, e.g. oilseed and biofuel. The characteristic small seed of the colocynth have been found in several early archeological sites in northern Africa and the Near East, specifically at Neolithic Armant, Nagada in Egypt; at sites dating from 3800 BC to Roman times in Libya; and the pre-pottery Neolithic levels of the Nahal Hemar caves in Israel. Zohary and Hopf speculate, \\"these finds indicate that the wild colocynth was very probably used by humans prior to its domestication.\\" =Traditional medicine = Colocynth has been widely used in traditional medicine for centuries. In premodern European medicine, it was an ingredient in the electuary called confectio hamech, or diacatholicon, and other laxative pills. In Arabia the colocynth had numerous uses in traditional medicine, such as a laxative, diuretic, or for insect bites. The powder of colocynth was sometimes used externally with aloes, unguents, or bandages. Troches made of colocynth were called \\"troches of alhandal\\" used as an emetic. In traditional Arab veterinary medicine, colocynth sap was used to treat skin eruptions in camels. =Culinary uses= The seeds of colocynth, which must be heated to make edible, have been used since antiquity as a food source in areas of the Sahara and Sahel where crops frequently fail or regular farming is impossible. The enigmatic early Egyptian ceramic Clayton rings found in the Western Desert may have been portable ovens for roasting colocynth seeds. The desert Bedouin are said to make a type of bread from the ground seeds. The closely related watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb)) was domesticated in Ancient Egypt, and may have been developed for edible seed from cultivated colocynth. In West Africa, some confusion exists between this species and watermelon, whose seeds may be used in much the same way. In particular, the name \\"egusi\\" may refer to either or both plants (or more generically to other cucurbits) in their capacity as seed crops, or to a popular soup made from these seeds. The seed flour is rich in micronutrients, and could therefore be used in food formulations especially in regions with endemic micronutrient deficiencies, such as West Africa. =Other uses and research= The oil obtained from the seeds (47%) can be used for soap production. The production is not very time- and energy-consuming due to the ability of colocynth to grow on poor soils with just a little moisture and organic fertilizer. The fruits are harvested still unripe by hand, the rind is removed by peeling and the inner pulp filled with seeds is dried in the sun or in ovens. The seeds yield is about 6.7-10 t/ha, which means that for an oil profit of 31-47%, oil yields may reach up to 3 t/ha. Oleic and linoleic acids isolated from C. colocynthis petroleum ether extracts show larvicidal activity against mosquitoes.

He was also a visiting Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1956 to 1964. Terrington was an expert on Greek affairs after he first got involved with the resistance forces in Greece against the Germans during World War II, and then having served in the British Embassy. Biography =Early life and military service= Montague Woodhouse was the son of Horace Woodhouse, 3rd Baron Terrington, and Valerie Phillips, and was educated at Winchester College, and then at New College, Oxford, where he took a double first in Classics. After completing his education, he enlisted in the Royal Artillery in 1939 and served for the duration of World War II, being commissioned as an officer in 1940 and rising to the rank of colonel by 1943. He was awarded a DSO and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944. He served most of his time in the War in Greece where his love for this country grew strong, as shown in his writings. In 1941 he was one of the SOE officers sent to Crete to organize the resistance forces behind enemy lines. In September 1942 he was parachuted to mainland Greece as the Second-in-Command of the Harling Force, headed by Eddie Myers, whose task was to blow up the Gorgopotamos bridge. Following the success of this operation Myers and Woodhouse were ordered by SOE Cairo to stay on in mainland Greece and form the British Military Mission. Initially their presence had only been intended for Operation Harling. Woodhouse, being one of only a few British officers on the mission who could speak Greek, was often sent off alone to make contact with political elements in Athens. Due to his imposing appearance of being tall with burning ginger beard this was no mean feat, but he succeeded in numerous trips into the Athenian suburbs, often still wearing British Army uniform. After Myers' dismissal in July 1943, at the request of the Foreign Office, Woodhouse became the head of the British Military Mission. =Government service= After the conclusion of World War II, Woodhouse served as Second Secretary at the British Embassy in Athens, Greece, until 1946, whereupon he returned to Britain, and served in a variety of industrial and academic appointments. In 1951, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. From 1951 to 1952, he worked at the British Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and in 1952 and 1953 was involved in organising British aspects of the US/UK organised 1953 Iranian coup d'état. From July 1955 to October 1959 was the Director General at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. =Operation Boot= In 1941, the Soviets and the British jointly invaded Iran to secure the oilfields and supply lines and deny support for the Germans. By the 1950s, Britain was concerned by possible chaos in Iran and an invasion by the USSR. From 1951 Woodhouse was a MI6 agent in Tehran, operating under cover of a Foreign Office appointment. In 1952, he was ordered to arm tribesmen in northern Iran to resist any Soviet attack.\\"With Sten guns and sovereigns Britain and US saved Iran's throne for the Shah\\" He brought weapons into Iran, flying them from RAF Habbaniya in Iraq, for a \\"resistance\\" movement that did not exist as yet. Later in 1953 a covert mission to remove Mohammed Mossadegh from power was instigated by Britain's Churchill government and the U.S. Eisenhower administration. Mossadegh had become Iran's democratically elected prime minister and he had nationalised oil possessions of the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now British Petroleum) after Britain had refused to negotiate away its single most valuable foreign asset.Mary Ann Heiss in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, pp. 178–200 Robin Zaehner had developed contacts in Iran and when the British were expelled, Woodhouse took his contacts to the CIA station chief. Thus a conspiracy to overthrow Mossadegh was staged in a joint mission between the CIA and MI6. The CIA named the operation Operation TPAjax, erroneously referred to as Operation Ajax, TP standing for the Soviet-backed communist Tudeh Party of Iran. British activities were codenamed Operation Boot. Woodhouse proposed Operation Boot to the Eisenhower administration. It would use \\"disenchanted\\" Iranian elements of the army, the clergy and the political parties to oust Mossadegh. Together with the CIA he instigated and orchestrated the \\"bazaaris\\" of Tehran to demonstrate against Mossadegh, demonstrations which led to the deaths of hundreds or possibly thousands of Iranian people. Woodhouse, through the Shah's sister, encouraged the ruler not to abandon the throne. =Parliamentary career= Woodhouse entered Parliament in 1959 and later served in the Conservative governments of Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas- Home as Parliamentary Secretary for Aviation from 1961 to 1962 and then Under- Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1962 to 1964. He was defeated by Evan Luard in the 1966 Labour landslide and then worked at the Confederation of British Industry until 1970, when he was once again returned to Parliament for Oxford. He retained his seat in the February 1974 general election, but lost it (again to Evan Luard) in October. Woodhouse succeeded to the barony on the death of his elder brother David Woodhouse, 4th Baron Terrington, in 1998. He lost his seat in the House of Lords in the following year as a result of the changes introduced by the House of Lords Act 1999. =Marriage and children= Lord Terrington married Lady Davidema Katharine Cynthia Mary Millicent Bulwer-Lytton (1909–1995), daughter of Victor Bulwer- Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, on 28 August 1945. They had three children: * Christopher Richard James Woodhouse, 6th Baron Terrington (born 20 September 1946) * Hon. Nicholas Michael John Woodhouse (born 27 February 1949) * Hon.

Domestic career Davis gradually established himself as a bowler, taking 5-42 against Trinidad and Tobago in the 1981/82 Shell Shield, and he was signed by Glamorgan for the 1982 English season to replace the injured Ezra Moseley. Despite sending down rather too many no-balls at times, Davis finished the season with 42 first-class wickets and was retained for the following season. Returning to Glamorgan after World Cup, Davis had another successful season, taking 52 wickets at 26.71 from 15 first-class matches, including three five-wicket innings hauls. 1984 was a successful season for Davis: he took 62 first-class wickets at 27.82 apiece and was unlucky not to be retained by Glamorgan for the following season; they decided instead to employ a certain Javed Miandad. In 1985/86 Davis played Sheffield Shield cricket in Australia for Tasmania with moderate success. In 1987 he returned to English county cricket with Northamptonshire. For three years he found considerable success, taking a total of 195 wickets at 25.46; his career-best first-class bowling figures of 7-52 came in 1988 in the first innings of the County Championship game against Sussex - noteworthy also for the fact that Davis and David Capel (3-59) bowled unchanged throughout the 32.5 overs of that innings. Davis endured a final, less than happy, season with Northamptonshire in 1990: he averaged above 60 with the ball in both first- class and one-day cricket, and went for more than five an over in the latter form of the game. His final bowling spell for his county, in the Championship game against Essex, was a disastrous 5-0-37-0 as Graham Gooch and John Stephenson ran riot. With that, Davis bowed out of county cricket for good, and in 1990/91 he went to play for Wellington in New Zealand. It proved a shrewd choice as Davis took 20 first-class wickets at 19.50 in just five matches. After that, there were a couple of exhibition matches against his old county of Glamorgan in 1991, and 54 not out for a World XI against the West Indians at Scarborough, before he returned to the Caribbean for three final domestic games. He did little in any of them, and retired from cricket. International career =Early days= Davis played his first representative match for West Indies Young Cricketers against their English counterparts at Port-of-Spain in August 1976, making an immediate impact by taking 4-35 in his first innings, including the wickets of future Test cricketers David Gower, Mike Gatting and Paul Downton. In 1978 he went to England for the return matches, but it was not until 1979/80 that he made his first-class debut, for Windward Islands against Leeward Islands at St John's. In the meantime in 1982, he had made his Test and One Day International debuts for in the 1982/83 series against India, his first wicket in Test cricket being that of Mohinder Amarnath. =Success= In 1983 Davis was selected for West Indies' World Cup squad, and when brought into the side for the second group match against Australia at Headingley, immediately hit the headlines by taking 7-51, at the time a world record return in ODIs. He was retained for the other four group matches, but took only one more wicket in total and was not selected for the semi-final or final - perhaps unsurprising when one considers that players of the calibre of Marshall, Garner, Holding and Roberts were all in West Indies' squad for the tournament. He played in all six Tests in India that winter, taking 14 wickets, but when Australia visited the West Indies in the spring of 1984, Davis was selected for only one Test and one ODI, and despite his experience of English conditions he was at first left out of the party to play England that summer, although when Milton Small was ruled out by a knee injury part-way through the series Davis was drafted into the squad. He played in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, and though he was not particularly effectual with the ball beyond managing to fracture Paul Terry's ulna he did score 77, his highest first-class innings, coming in as nightwatchman on the first day. In 1984/85 Davis performed well on home soil after being selected for the last two Tests of the four-game series against New Zealand, taking 10 wickets at 18.80 including a career-best 4-19 at Kingston, and took part in no less than 15 ODIs in Australia. =Late career= In 1986, Davis had fallen away from the Test side as West Indies' fast-bowling production line continued to churn out high-quality pacemen. During success in 1987 county tournament, he was recalled to international duties for one last time in India in 1987/88, taking 13 wickets at exactly 30 in four Tests but only three in his three ODIs, and captained the Windward Islands team in the same season. Beyond cricket In 1998 Davis, a committed Christian, was left a tetraplegic after suffering spinal injuries as a result of a fall from a tree in St Vincent suffered whilst helping clear land for a new church. He was flown to England for treatment unavailable on the island, and now lives in Worcestershire, England. He has appeared in a film, Because of You, made by Worcestershire County Council's Social Services department; he said of this film, \\"People with a disability can often be seen as just takers and so for me, starring in this film gave me the opportunity to give something back to the community\\". Several benefit matches have been held with the object of raising money to help him live a more comfortable life, and have featured a number of high-profile cricketers: in 2005 a Lashings Cricket Club side beat a Winston Davis XI by 87 runs in a match graced by such names as Chris Cairns, V. V. S. Laxman and Alvin Kallicharran. References External links * * A glittering affair – Because of you..

Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969. Clobazam was originally marketed as an anxioselective anxiolytic since 1970, and an anticonvulsant since 1984. The primary drug-development goal was to provide greater anxiolytic, anti- obsessive efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine-related side effects. Medical uses Clobazam is used for its anxiolytic effect, and as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy. Clobazam is approved in Canada for add-on use in tonic- clonic, complex partial, and myoclonic seizures. Clobazam is approved for adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures, certain types of status epilepticus, specifically the mycolonic, myoclonic-absent, simple partial, complex partial, and tonic varieties, and non-status absence seizures. It is also approved for the treatment of anxiety. In India, clobazam is approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy, and in acute and chronic anxiety. In Japan, clobazam is approved for adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant epilepsy featuring complex partial seizures. In New Zealand, clobazam is marketed as Frisium In the United Kingdom clobazam (Frisium) is approved for short-term (2–4 weeks) relief of acute anxiety in patients who have not responded to other drugs, with or without insomnia and without uncontrolled clinical depression. It was not approved in the United States until October 25, 2011, when it was approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 2 years of age or older. As an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy, it is used in patients who have not responded to first-line drugs and in children who are refractory to first-line drugs. It is unclear if there are any benefits to clobazam over other seizure medications for children with Rolandic epilepsy or other epileptic syndromes. It is not recommended for use in children between the ages of six months and three years, unless there is a compelling need. In addition to epilepsy and severe anxiety, clobazam is also approved as a short-term (2–4 weeks) adjunctive agent in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders to manage anxiety or agitation. Clobazam is sometimes used for refractory epilepsies. However, long-term prophylactic treatment of epilepsy may have considerable drawbacks, most importantly decreased antiepileptic effects due to drug tolerance which may render long-term therapy less effective. Other antiepileptic drugs may therefore be preferred for the long-term management of epilepsy. Furthermore, benzodiazepines may have the drawback, particularly after long-term use, of causing rebound seizures upon abrupt or over-rapid discontinuation of therapy forming part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Contraindications Clobazam should be used with great care in patients with the following disorders: * Myasthenia gravis. * Sleep apnea. * Severe liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatitis. * Severe respiratory failure. Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Side effects In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. =Common= Common side effects include fever, lethargy, sleepiness, drooling, and constipation. =Post- marketing experience= * Hives. * Rashes. =Warnings and precautions= In December 2013, the FDA added warnings to the label for clobazam, that it can cause serious skin reactions, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, especially in the first eight weeks of treatment.FDA. December 3rd, 2013 FDA Drug Safety Podcast: FDA warns of serious skin reactions with the anti-seizure drug Onfi (clobazam) and has approved label changes =Drug interactions= * Alcohol increases bioavailability by 50%; compounded depressant effect may precipitate life-threatening toxicity. * Cimetidine increases the effects of clobazam. * Valproate. =Overdose= Overdose and intoxication with benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may lead to CNS depression, associated with drowsiness, confusion, and lethargy, possibly progressing to ataxia, respiratory depression, hypotension, and coma or death. The risk of a fatal outcome is increased in cases of combined poisoning with other CNS depressants, including alcohol.Fruchtengarten L Inchem - Clobazam. Created July 1997, Reviewed 1998. =Abuse potential and addiction= Classic (non-anxioselective) benzodiazepines in animal studies have been shown to increase reward-seeking behaviours which may suggest an increased risk of addictive behavioural patterns. Clobazam abuse has been reported in some countries, according to a 1983 World Health Organisation report. =Dependence and withdrawal= In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam may occur and withdrawal seizures may occur during abrupt or overrapid withdrawal. Clobazam as with other benzodiazepine drugs can lead to physical dependence, addiction, and what is known as the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from clobazam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dosage and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepine treatment should only be discontinued via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Pharmacology Clobazam is predominantly a positive allosteric modulator at the GABAA receptor with some speculated additional activity at sodium channels and voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Like other 1,5-benzodiazepines (for example, arfendazam, lofendazam, or CP-1414S), the active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam has less affinity for the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to the 1,4-benzodiazepines. It has higher affinity for α2 containing receptors, where it has positive modulatory activity. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial published in 1990 comparing it to clonazepam, 10 mg of clobazam was shown to be less sedative than either 0.5 mg or 1 mg of clonazepam. The α1 subtype of the GABAA receptor, was shown to be responsible for the sedative effects of diazepam by McKernan et al. in 2000, who also showed that its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties could still be seen in mice whose α1 receptors were insensitive to diazepam. In 1996, Nakamura et al. reported that clobazam and its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam), work by enhancing GABA-activated chloride influx at GABAA-receptor-coupled calcium channels, creating a hyperpolarizing, inhibitory postsynaptic potential. It was also reported that these effects were inhibited by the GABA antagonist flumazenil, and that clobazam acts more efficiently in GABA-deficient brain tissue. =Metabolism= Clobazam has two major metabolites: N-desmethylclobazam and 4′-hydroxyclobazam, the former of which is active. The demethylation is facilitated by CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 and the 4-hydroxyclobazam by CYP2C18 and CYP2C19. Chemistry Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine, meaning that its diazepine ring has nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 5 positions (instead of the usual 1 and 4). It is not soluble in water and is available in oral form only. History Clobazam was discovered at the Maestretti Research Laboratories in Milan and was first published in 1969; Maestretti was acquired by Roussel Uclaf which became part of Sanofi.

It was built at Harvard University under the supervision of Howard Aiken for the US Navy. Technical overview The Mark III's word consisted of 16 bits. It used 5,000 vacuum tubes and 1,500 crystal diodes. It weighed . It used magnetic drum memory of 4,350 words. Its addition time was 4,400 microseconds and the multiplication time was 13,200 microseconds (times include memory access time). Aiken boasted that the Mark III was the fastest electronic computer in the world. The Mark III used nine magnetic drums (one of the first computers to do so). One drum could contain 4,000 instructions and has an access time of 4,400 microseconds; thus it was a stored-program computer. The arithmetic unit could access two other drums – one contained 150 words of constants and the other contained 200 words of variables. Both of these drums also had an access time of 4,400 microseconds. This separation of data and instructions is known as the Harvard architecture. There were six other drums that held a total of 4,000 words of data, but the arithmetic unit couldn't access these drums directly. Data had to be transferred between these drums and the drum the arithmetic unit could access via registers implemented by electromechanical relays. This was a bottleneck in the computer and made the access time to data on these drums long – 80,000 microseconds. This was partially compensated for by the fact that twenty words could be transferred on each access. The Mark III was finished in September 1949 and delivered to the U.S. Naval Proving Ground at the US Navy base at Dahlgren, Virginia in March 1950.

One of the oldest traditional military prep schools in the United States, KMI was maintained in the vein of the Virginia Military Institute, in that all of its students were classified as cadets. It was founded in 1845 by Colonel Robert Thomas Pritchard Allen (September 26, 1813, to July 9, 1888) and chartered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1847. As the Civil War approached, a student \\"set the buildings on fire and the school was closed down,\\" according to E. F. Bleiler. During the Civil War, the school remained closed. KMI wintered in Eau Gallie, Florida, beginning in 1907 (when it bought that ghost town) to 1921 (when the Eau Gallie campus burned to the ground). Due to financial troubles, the Florida campus moved many times in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was closed in 1924; it reopened the next year. It moved to Venice, Florida, in 1932, where winter classes were already being held. Charles B. Richmond was appointed as superintendent and the school thrived until the late 1960s. The main campus in Lyndon, Kentucky, which was located on the outskirts of Louisville, Kentucky, began its decline when dwindling interest in enrolling in the military, coupled with higher tuition fees, caused the school further financial trouble. Its final class of cadets graduated in 1971, and closed for good that summer. It re-opened the next year as the Kentucky Academy and became a non-military co-ed school.

In the 1990s, Werner Kaiser and Günter Dreyer translate Iry-Hor's name as \\"Companion of Horus\\".Werner Kaiser, Günter Dreyer: Umm el-Qaab. Nachuntersuchungen im frühzeitlichen Königsfriedhof: 2. Vorbericht, in: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Kairo (MDAIK), 38th edition. Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Orient-Abteilung (Hrsg.). de Gruyter, Berlin 1982, pp. 211–246. Toby Wilkinson, who contested that Iry-Hor was a king, translated the signs as \\"Property of the king\\". Following the excavations at Abydos and the discovery of an inscription of Iry-Hor in the Sinai in 2012, Wilkinson's hypothesis is now rejected by most Egyptologists and Iry-Hor is widely accepted as a predynastic king of Egypt.Edwin C. M. van den Brink: The incised serekh signs of Dynasties 0–1. Part I: complete vessels, in: J. Spencer editions, Aspects of Early Egypt (1996), pp. 140–158, pl.s 24-32, London, British Museum Press, .E. C. M van den Brink: The incised serekh signs of Dynasties 0–1. Part II: Fragments and Additional Complete Vessels. The Egyptologists Jürgen von Beckerath and Peter Kaplony also initially rejected the identification of Iry-Hor as a king and proposed instead that the known inscriptions refer to a private person whose name is to be read Wer-Ra, wr-r3 (lit. \\"great mouth\\"), i.e. reading the bird above the mouth-sign as the swallow hieroglyph G36 rather than the Horus falcon. They translated the name as \\"Spokesman\\" or \\"Chief\\".Peter Kaplony: Inschriften der Ägyptischen Frühzeit, vol. 1, p. 468 However, continuing excavations of Iry- Hor's tomb at Abydos by Günter Dreyer established that the tomb was of similar dimensions and layout as those of Ka and Narmer and must, therefore, have belonged to a king. This was consequently accepted by von Beckerath and Iry- Hor is now the first entry in the latest edition of von Beckerath's Handbook of Egyptian Pharaohs.Jürgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen, Münchner ägyptologische Studien, Volume 49, Mainz: P. von Zabern, 1999, , pp. 9, 36–37 Identity Clay seal with the signs r-Ḥr. =Controversy= Until 2012, the name of Iry-Hor had not been found in or next to a serekh, so the identification of Iry-Hor as a king was controversial. Egyptologists Flinders Petrie, Laurel BestockLaurel Bestock: The Development of Royal Funerary Cult at Abydos, pp. 16, 17, 21 & 28 and Jochem KahlJochem Kahl: Das System der ägyptischen Hieroglyphenschrift in der 0.-3. Dynastie, pp.96–101. nonetheless believed that he was indeed a real ruler. They pointed to the distinctive spelling of Iry-Hor's name: the Horus falcon holds the mouth hieroglyph in its claws. On several clay seals, this group of characters is found accompanied by a second, free-standing mouth hieroglyph. This notation is reminiscent of numerous anonymous serekhs held by a Horus falcon with individual hieroglyphs placed close to it rather than within the serekh, as would be expected. Finally, the serekh could have been a convention that started with Ka, whose name has been found both with and without a serekh. Therefore, they concluded that the argument that Iry-Hor was not a king because his name was never found in a serekh was insufficient. Supporters of the identification of Iry-Hor as a king, such as Egyptologist Darell Baker, also pointed to the size and location of his tomb. It is a double tomb, as big as those of Ka and Narmer, located within a sequential order linking the older predynastic \\"U\\" cemetery with the First Dynasty tombs. Furthermore, Iry-Hor's name is inscribed on a large jar exhibiting the royal Horus falcon and is similar to those found in the tombs of other kings of this period. In contrast, some Egyptologists doubted Iry-Hor even existed, precisely because his name never appeared in a serekh, the Horus falcon being simply placed above the mouth sign. Ludwig D. Morenz and Kurt Heinrich Sethe doubted the reading of Iry-Hor's name and thus that he was a king. Morenz, for example, suspected that the mouth sign may simply have been a phonetic complement to the Horus falcon.Ludwig D. Morenz: Bildbuchstaben und symbolische Zeichen, p. 88 Sethe understood the group of characters forming Iry-Hor's name as an indication of origin (of the content of a jar and other goods to which clay seals were usually attached). Toby Wilkinson dismissed the tomb attributed to Iry-Hor as a storage pit and the name as a treasury mark. Indeed, r-Ḥr may simply mean property of the king.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt, pp. 19, 55 & 234. Supporting his hypothesis, Wilkinson also noted that Iry-Hor was poorly attested and, until 2012, the only inscription of Iry-Hor outside of Abydos was located in Lower Egypt at Zawyet el'Aryan, while Ka and Narmer have many inscriptions located as far north as Canaan. =Resolution= Günter Dreyer's excavations of the necropolis of Abydos revealed that Iry-Hor was in fact well attested there with over 27 objects bearing his name and that his tomb was of royal proportions.Edwin C. M. van den Brink: Two Pottery Jars Incised with the Name of Iry-Hor from Tomb B1 at Umm El-Ga'ab, Abydos, available online, in : Zeichen aus dem Sand, Streiflichter aus Ägyptens Geschichte zu Ehren von Günter Dreyer, Eva-Maria Engel, Vera Müller and Ulrich Hartung editors, Harrassowitz Verlag, Wiesbaden, 2008, Furthermore, in 2012 an inscription mentioning Iry-Hor was discovered in the Sinai, the inscription comprising furthermore an archaic empty serekh on the right of Iry-Hor's name. The inscription mentions the city of Memphis, pushing back its foundation to before Narmer and establishing that Iry-Hor was already reigning over it. Following this discovery, most Egyptologists, including G. Dreyer and the discoverers of the inscription, Pierre Tallet and Damien Laisney, now believe that Iry-Hor was indeed a king. Reign and attestations Name of Iry-Hor as found in Abydos. Iry-Hor was most likely Ka's immediate predecessorWinfried Barta: Zur Namensform und zeitlichen Einordnung des Königs Ro, in: GM 53, 1982, pp. 11–13. and thus would have reigned during the early 32nd century BC. He probably ruled from Hierakonpolis over Abydos and the wider Thinite region and controlled Egypt at least as far north as Memphis, since the Sinai rock inscription relates a visit of Iry-Hor to this city.Owen Jarus, Live Science, Early Egyptian Queen Revealed in 5,000-Year-Old Hieroglyphs, The Egyptologists Tallet and Laisney further propose that Iry-Hor also controlled parts of the Nile Delta. He was buried in the royal cemetery of Umm el-Qa'ab near Ka, Narmer and the First Dynasty kings. Iry-Hor's name appears on clay vessels from his tomb in Abydos and a clay seal with the hieroglyphs for r-Ḥr was found in Narmer's tomb and may refer to Iry-Hor. In total no less than 22 pottery jars incised with Iry-Hor's name have been in Abydos as well as at least 5 ink-inscribed fragments and a cylinder seal. A similar seal was also found far to the north in the tomb Z 401 of Zawyet el'Aryan in Lower Egypt.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300–1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 156 An incision on a spindle whorl found in Hierakonpolis during James E.

P[etrie], London 1900, available online Finally, the discovery of a rock inscription of Iry-Hor in the Sinai constitutes his northernmost attestation. The inscription shows the name of Iry-Hor on a boat, next to the word Inebu-hedj meaning \\"white walls\\", the ancient name of Memphis.P. Tallet, D. Laisnay: Iry-Hor et Narmer au Sud-Sinaï (Ouadi 'Ameyra), un complément à la chronologie des expéditios minière égyptiene, in: BIFAO 112 (2012), 381-395, available online Tomb Iry-Hor's tomb at the Umm el-Qa'ab comprises two separate chambers B1 and B2, shown in inset. Iry-Hor's tomb is located close to Ka's (B7, B8, B9) and Narmer's tombs (B17, B18). Iry-Hor's tomb is the oldest tomb of the Abydos necropolis B in the Umm el-Qa'ab. It comprises two separate underground chambers B1 (6m × 3.5m) and B2 (4.3m × 2.45m) excavated by Petrie in 1899 and later by Werner Kaiser. A further chamber, now known as \\"B0\\", was uncovered during re-excavations of Iry-Hor's tomb in the 1990s. These chambers have a size similar to those found in the tombs of Ka and Narmer. No superstructure, if there ever was one, survives to this day. Chamber B1 yielded jar fragments incised with his name. Chamber B2 produced another incised jar fragment, a seal impression, several ink inscriptions and vessel fragments bearing the names of Ka and Narmer. Parts of a bed were also found onsite.

Initially titular king only of a lesser part of the kingdom, he gained the crown of León (and with it, Galicia) after supplanting his brother Alfonso IV and cousin Alfonso Fróilaz in 931. The scant Anales castellanos primeros are a primary source for his reign. He actively campaigned against the Moors, who referred to him as the Devil due to his ferocity and fervor in battle. He defeated the hosts of the Umayyad caliph, Abderramán III, at the Battle of Simancas (939). Succession When, shortly before his death in 910, Alfonso III of Asturias was forced by his sons to abdicate, the Kingdom of Asturias descended into a period of successional crises among the royal family and their supporters from the regional marcher aristocracies. The kingdom was initially partitioned, with García I receiving León, Ordoño II Galicia and Fruela II the Asturian heartland. With the successive deaths of García I (914) and Ordoño (924), these were re- consolidated, Fruela ruling the entirety of what would thenceforth be referred to as the Kingdom of León. His death the next year, 925, again brought about disputed succession and partition. A younger brother, Ramiro, appears to have married Fruela's widow and adopted the royal title, but gained no traction. Instead it was the next generation that rose to the forefront. As eldest son of the prior king, Alfonso Fróilaz was crowned but proved unable to extend his power to the entire kingdom and was marginalized by his cousins the three sons of Ordoño II, who had the backing of the Kingdom of Pamplona. These brothers again partitioned the portion of the kingdom they controlled: the eldest, Sancho Ordóñez, ruling in Galicia, Alfonso IV in León, and Ramiro II in the newly conquered lands to the south (al-Andalus chronicler Ibn Hayyan located his court at Coimbra). When Sancho died in 929 his kingdom was absorbed by Alfonso IV, but in a quick succession of events taking place in Leon and Zamora, Ramiro forced the abdication of Alfonso IV, and had him and Fruela II's three sons blinded in order to make them incapable of ruling. Reign Ramiro stood out as an excellent military commander, and expanded his territories south to a remarkable extent (e.g., into Salamanca and Ledesma) as well as founding or repopulating frontier strongholds (e.g., Osma, Clunia). Ramiro masterminded a Pamplona/León coalition that defeated a joint Andalusian counter-offensive in the Battle of Simancas (939). This victory allowed the advance of the Leonese border of the Duero to the Tormes. In the last years of his reign, he lost the support of his Pamplona brother-in-law/son-in-law García Sánchez I, who then helped another brother-in-law, the count Fernán González of Castile, to gain brief de facto independence. Still in 950 Ramiro launched an expedition to the valley of the Edge and defeated the Cordovan Umayyads at Talavera. Family Ramiro II married twice, first to his first cousin Adosinda Gutiérrez, daughter of Gutier Osóriz and Ildonzia Menéndez (a sister of Ramiro's mother, queen Elvira Menéndez), and second to Urraca Sánchez of Pamplona, daughter of Sancho I of Pamplona and Toda. By Adosinda, who was also cousin of San Rosendo, Ramiro had Bermudo and Ordoño III, and presumably also daughter Theresa, wife of García Sánchez I of Pamplona. García is referred to as Ramiro's son-in-law by chronicler Ibn Hayyan, and his eldest son by his documented second wife Theresa was named Ramiro, while Theresa would not have been daughter of Ramiro II's second wife, who was her husband's sister. By Urraca, Ramiro had two children, Sancho I of León and Elvira Ramírez. He figures prominently in the romantic poem, the Miragaia, which tells the apocryphal story of Ramiro bedding Ortega, the daughter of a local Arab lord. By her he is given a son Aboazar, the progenitor of the Galician/Portuguese Maia family.While this Maia founder is a historical individual, contemporary documents indicate his father was named Lovesendo. This Maia tradition was subsequently linked to another legend, that told in the Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara by giving Ramiro and Ortega a daughter Ortega Ramírez, who is made to marry Gustios Gonzalez, grandfather of the legendary infantes and of hero Mudarra González. Subsequent elaboration of this legend gave further supposed descendants among the Lara family, but these Lara connections are dismissed by modern scholars.

Attestations  Nebra's name appears on several stone vessels, mostly made of schist, alabaster and marble. Most of the bowls were found at Abydos, Giza and Saqqara. The inscriptions contain depictions of cultic buildings such as the Ka-house, depictions of deities such as Bastet, Neith and Seth and also the mentionings of cultic feasts.

Clay seal impressions with Nebra's name were found beneath the causeway of the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara and inside a large gallery tomb, also at Saqqara. This tomb also yielded several seal impressions with Hotepsekhemwy's name and for this reason it is debated whether the tomb belongs to Nebra or his predecessor Hotepsekhemwy.Eva-Maria Engel: Die Siegelabrollungen von Hetepsechemui und Raneb aus Saqqara.

In 2012, Pierre Tallet and Damien Leisnay reported three rock inscriptions with Nebra's horus name found in the south of the Sinai Peninsula. Each rock inscription can be found in a different wadi: Wadi Abu Madawi, Wadi Abu Koua and Wadi Ameyra. The places where Nebra's name is displayed lie along a very old route used for expeditions from the western shore of the Sinai to its inland, where copper and turquoise mines existed. Along the wadis the names of predynastic kings up to pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty are located at the same places.Pierre Tallet, Damien Laisnay: Iry-Hor et Narmer au Sud-Sinaï (Ouadi 'Ameyra), un complément à la chronologie des expéditios minière égyptiene. In: Bulletin de l'Institut Français D'Archéologie Orientale (BIFAO), vol. 112, 2012, p. 389-398.  Name sources  Tomb stela of Nebra, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Nebra's serekh name is of great interest to Egyptologists, since it is written with the hieroglyphic sign of the sun, which had not yet become the object of divine adoration during his lifetime. At the time of king Nebra, the most important religious cults were concentrated on the preservation of the dualistic equal status of the state patrons Horus and Seth. Nothing was more important than keeping that divine balance. The kings themselves were seen as the living representation of that godlike pair. The sun was seen as a celestial object controlled either by Horus or, as in the case of king Seth-Peribsen, by Seth. Therefore, the sun was no independent deity yet. The first definite proof of the existence of the sun-deity Ra occurs at the beginning of the 3rd dynasty during the reign of king Djoser in the names of high officials such as Hesyre. And the first definitive detectable proof for a fully established royal sun cult occurs under king Radjedef, the third ruler of the 4th Dynasty. He was the first king who connected his birth name with the name of Ra, starting the great religious belief that Egyptian kings were the living representation of the sun alongside Horus and Seth. Therefore, Nebra's Horus name is problematic regarding its translation and meaning. The typical translation of Nebra's name as \\"Ra is my lord\\", which would be read \\"Raneb\\", is questionable, as this would assume that the Sun was already being worshiped as an independent deity. Consequently, Egyptologists have proposed the translation \\"Lord of the sun (of Horus)\\" which is read \\"Nebra\\" and implies the pharaoh's rule over the Sun (as a celestial body), which was indeed also under Horus' or Seth's control. Any solar religion or solar symbolism were not yet established in any useful form and it is now thought that king Nebra might actually have been the first king who adopted extended religious thought about the sun and the sky.Jochem Kahl: Ra is my Lord. Searching for the Rise of the Sun God at the Dawn of Egyptian History. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2007, . page 4–14.Steven Quirke: Ancient Egyptian Religions. Dover Publishing, London 1992, , page 22.  Family  The wife of Nebra is unknown. A “son of the king” and “priest of Sopdu” named Perneb might have been his son, but since the clay seals providing his name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which is attributed to two kings equally (Nebra and his predecessor, Hotepsekhemwy), it is unclear whose son Perneb really was.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early dynastic Egypt: Strategy, Society and Security. Routledge, London u. a. 1999, , page 296.Peter Kaplony: Inschriften der Ägyptischen Frühzeit. Volume 3, (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen vol. 8). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, , page 96 as Obj. 367.  Identity  Statue of Hotepdief, priest of the mortuary cults of the first 3 rulers of the dynasty, Hotepsekhemwy, Nebra and Nynetjer. The serekh of Nebra is the middle one on the shoulder of the priest. King Nebra is commonly identified with the Ramesside-era cartouche-name Kakau, which can be translated as \\"The bull of Apis\\". This links to the anecdote written by Manetho, who said that under king Kêchoós (the Greek version of the name Kakau) the deities Apies, the goat of Mendes and Menevus were \\"introduced and worshipped as gods\\". This view is questioned by modern Egyptologists, as there was already a cult of Apis established during the 1st Dynasty, if not earlier. The name \\"Kakau\\" itself is problematic for this early pharaoh, as there was no name source from Nebra's time that could have been used to form the word.Walter Bryan Emery: Ägypten. Geschichte und Kultur der Frühzeit. Fourier, München 1964, page 103 & 274. The birth name of Nebra also remains unclear. A theory by Egyptologist Jochem Kahl says that Nebra was the same person as the mysterious king Weneg-Nebti. He points to a vessel fragment made of volcanic ash, which was found in the tomb of king Peribsen (a later ruler during the 2nd dynasty) at Abydos. On the pot sherd he believes there are traces of the weneg-flower beneath the incised name of king Ninetjer. To the right of Ninetjer's name the depiction of the Ka-house of king Nebra is partially preserved. This arrangement led Kahl to conclude that the weneg-flower and Nebra's name were connected to each other and king Ninetjer replaced the inscription. Kahl also points out that king Ninetjer wrote his name mirrored, so that his name deliberately runs in the opposite direction to Nebra's name.Jochem Kahl: Ra is my Lord - Searching for the rise of the Sun God at the dawn of Egyptian history. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2007, , page 12–14 & 74. Kahl's theory is the subject of continuing discussion since the vessel inscription is damaged, thus leaving plenty of room for varying interpretations. Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Battiscombe Gunn identify Nebra with another mysterious early pharaoh: Nubnefer. This link is questioned by other scholars, since the rulers of 2nd Dynasty often wrote their birth and Horus names in the same way (for example: Hor-Nebra → Nisut-Bity-Nebty-Nebra). Thus the name \\"Nubnefer\\" may be the birth name of a different king.Battiscombe Gunn in: Annales du service des antiquités de l'Égypte - Suppléments, Volume 28. Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale, Kairo 1938, page 152.Jürgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der Ägyptischen Königsnamen. Deutscher Kunstverlag, München Berlin 1884, , page 48 & 49.  Reign  Little is known about Nebra's reign. The discovery of sealings bearing Nebra's name together with sealings of Hotepsekhemwy at Saqqara suggests that Nebra conducted the burial of Hotepsekhemwy and was his direct successor.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt: Strategies, Society and Security. Routledge, London/New York 2001, , p. 71 Additional confirmation of this succession is provided by a statue and a stone bowl both bearing Hotepsekhemwy and Nebra's serekhs in juxtaposition. Other pot inscriptions and seal impressions surviving from his time only name cult- related and administrative events, such as the \\"Erecting of the pillars of Horus\\". Under Nebra, the first depiction of the goddess Bastet occurs. The exact duration of Nebra's reign is the subject of investigations. Reconstructions of the well known Palermo Stone, a black basalt table presenting the yearly events of the kings from the beginning of the 1st dynasty up to king Neferirkare in the shape of clearly divided charts, leads to the conclusion that Nebra and his predecessor, king Hotepsekhemwy, ruled altogether for 39 years. Since Nebra has fewer records of his rule than Hotepsekhemwy, Nebra is thought to have ruled for a shorter time. The calculations differ from 29 and 10 years to 25 and 14 years.Wolfgang Helck in: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Institut Kairo 30.

Although his chronological position is clear to Egyptologists, it is unclear for how long King Weneg ruled. It is also unclear as to which of the archaeologically identified Horus-kings corresponds to Weneg.  Name sources and contradictions  The name \\"Weneg\\" is generally accepted to be a nebti- or throne name, introduced by the crest of the Two Ladies (the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet) and the sedge-and-bee-crest. Weneg's name appears in black ink inscriptions on alabaster fragments and in inscriptions on schist-vessels. Seventeen vessels bearing his name have been preserved; eleven of them were found in the underground galleries beneath the step pyramid of king Djoser at Sakkara. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Francesco Tiradritti point out that all the inscriptions are made in the place of existing inscriptions, which means that the names that were originally placed on the vessels were completely different. The symbol that was used to write Weneg's name is the object of significant dispute between Egyptologists to this day. The so-called \\"weneg flower\\" is rarely used in Egyptian writing. Mysteriously, the weneg flower is often guided by six vertical \\"strokes\\", three of them on each side of the flower bud. The meaning of these strokes is unknown. After Weneg's death, his heraldic flower was not used again until king Teti (6th dynasty), when it was used in his pyramid texts to name a “Weneg” as a sky and death deity which was addressed with \\"Son of Ra\\" and \\"follower of the deceased king\\". So it seems that the weneg flower was somehow connected with the Egyptian sun and death cult. But the true meaning of the flower as a king's name remains unknown.B. Grdseloff: King Uneg. In: Annales du Service des Antiquités de l’Égypte, No. 44, 1944, page 279–306.Winfried Barta in: Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde, No.108.

Identification  Since Weneg's name first became known to Egyptologists, scholars have been trying to match the nebti name of Weneg to contemporary Horus-kings. The following sections discuss some of the theories. = Weneg corresponds to Hor- Nebre (or Raneb) = BM EA 35556, the stone vessel used by Jochem Kahl to equate Weneg with Raneb.Jochem Kahl: Ra is my Lord - Searching for the rise of the Sun God at the dawn of Egyptian history. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2007, , pp. 12–14, 74. Egyptologist Jochem Kahl argues that Weneg was the same person as king Raneb, the second ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He points to a vessel fragment made from an igneous material, which was found in the tomb of king Peribsen (a later ruler of the 2nd dynasty) at Abydos. He believed he had found on the pot sherd weak, but clear, traces of the weneg flower beneath the inscribed name of king Ninetjer. On the right side of Ninetjer's name the depiction of the Ka house of king Raneb is partially preserved. The complete arrangement led Kahl to the conclusion that the weneg flower and Raneb's name were connected to each other and king Ninetjer later replaced the inscription. Kahl also points out that king Ninetjer wrote his name mirrored, so that his name points in the opposite direction to Raneb's name. Kahl's theory is the subject of continuing debate since the vessel inscription is badly damaged and thus leaves plenty of room for varying interpretations. = Weneg corresponds to Hor-Sekhemib-Perenmaat = Egyptologists such as Nicolas Grimal, Wolfgang Helck and Walter Bryan Emery identify Weneg with king Sekhemib-Perenmaat and with the Ramesside royal cartouche-name Wadjenes. Their theory is based on the assumption that Sekhemib and Seth-Peribsen were different rulers and that both were the immediate successors of king Ninetjer. But this theory is not commonly accepted, because clay seals of Sekhemib were found in the tomb of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. The clay seals set Sekhemib's reign close to Khasekhemwy's, whilst the Ramesside name \\"Wadjenes\\" is placed near the beginning of the 2nd dynasty.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit. Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , page 103–107.Walter Bryan Emery: Ägypten. Geschichte und Kultur der Frühzeit. Fourier-Verlag, Wiesbaden 1964, , page 105.Gunter Dreyer in: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Kairo, No.59. Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Orient-Abteilung (Hrsg.). de Gruyter, Berlin 2003, S. 115. = Weneg as an independent ruler = Egyptologists such as Peter Kaplony and Richard Weill argue that Weneg was a separate king from other kings of the period. They suggest that Weneg succeeded Ninetjer and his name is preserved in Ramesside kinglists under the name \\"Wadjenes\\". Their assumption is firstly based on the widely accepted theory that Ramesside scribes interchanged the weneg flower with the papyrus haulm, changing it into the name \\"Wadjenes\\". Secondly, Kaplony and Weill's theory is based on the inscription on the Cairo stone. They believe that the name \\"Wenegsekhemwy\\" is preserved over the third line of year events.Peter Kaplony: Steingefäße der Frühzeit und des Alten Reiches. In: Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskund, Volumes 133-135. Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 1981, . This theory is also not widely accepted, as the Cairo stone is badly damaged and the very weak traces of the hieroglyphs leave too much room for different interpretations.  Reign  Little is known about Weneg's reign. The vessel inscriptions mentioning his name only show reports about ceremonial events, such as the \\"raising up of the pillars of Horus\\". This feast is frequently reported on vessels from Ninetjer's reign, which brings Weneg's chronological position very close to that of Ninetjer. The length of Weneg's rulership is unknown. If he was the same person as king Wadjenes, he ruled (according to the Royal Canon of Turin) for 54 years. If Weneg was the same person as king \\"Tlas\\", mentioned by the historian Manetho, he ruled for 17 years. But modern Egyptologists have doubts about both statements and evaluate them as misinterpretations or exaggerations. If Weneg was actually a separate ruler, as Richard Weill and Peter Kaplony believe, he may have ruled for 12 years, depending on their reconstructions of the Cairo stone inscriptions. One theory suggests that the once unified kingdom of Egypt was divided after Ninetjer's death into two parts. Consequently, for a period after king Weneg's death, two kings ruled at the same time over Egypt suggesting that Weneg was an independent ruler. This assumption is based on the observation that both the Thinite and Memphite king lists of the Ramesside era mention the names \\"Wadjenes\\" and \\"Senedj\\" as the immediate successors of king Ninetjer. The Abydos king lists, for example, mention only six kings for the 2nd dynasty, whilst all the other kinglists mention nine kings. So Weneg may have been the last king who had ruled over the whole of Egypt, before sharing his throne (and control over Egypt) with another king. It remains unclear who the other king may have been.Aidan Dodson: The Mysterious Second Dynasty.

In: Geographical Journal, volume 136, 1970, page 569–573.Hans Goedike in: Journal of Egypt Archaeology. volume 42, 1998, page 50. Weneg's successor may have been Senedj but even that is uncertain in this shadowy period of the 2nd dynasty of Egypt.

She is known for her portrayal of the title character on the soap opera satire Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. She was married to Woody Allen and appeared in several of his early films. She is also a life member of The Actors Studio and studied with both Sanford Meisner and Robert X. Modica. Early life and career Born in New York City, Lasser is the daughter of tax expert S. Jay Lasser, author of the successful Everyone's Income Tax Guide series in the '70s and '80s. Louise Lasser's family was Jewish and Lasser was an only child. For three years, she studied political science at Brandeis University. In 1964, Lasser's mother Paula committed suicide following the breakup of her marriage to S. Jay, who eventually also took his own life. Lasser was the understudy for Barbra Streisand in the Broadway musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale. She also acted on the soap opera The Doctors and in television commercials. She appeared in the Woody Allen films Take the Money and Run (1969), Bananas (1971), and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (1972), as well as being one of the voices for his earlier spoof dubbing of a Japanese spy movie, What's Up Tiger Lily? (1966). Lasser was also featured in comedies such as Such Good Friends (1971) and Slither (1973). She appeared in episodes of Love, American Style in 1971, The Bob Newhart Show in 1972 and The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1973. In 1973, she also appeared in the TV-movie version of Ingmar Bergman's The Lie and as Elaine in \\"The Roller Coaster Stops Here\\" episode of the NBC romantic anthology series Love Story. Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman =Production= Lasser became a household name for starring as the neurotic, unhappy housewife Mary Hartman in the serialized satire Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and during the show's run appeared on the covers of Newsweek, People, and Rolling Stone. Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman aired five nights a week for two seasons from 1976 to 1977. In his autobiography, producer Norman Lear says that the casting of Lasser took less than a minute after Charles H. Joffe told him there was only one actress to play the part of Mary Hartman, and Lear met the former Mrs. Woody Allen. Lasser initially refused the role. Of the casting process, Lear said \\"when she read a bit of the script for me, I all but cried for joy ... Louise brought with her the persona that fit Mary Hartman like a corset.\\" Exhausted from the grueling schedule, Lasser left the series after two seasons (325 episodes), and the serial was re-branded Forever Fernwood, which continued for 26 weeks focusing on the trials and tribulations of the other Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman characters. Lasser was interviewed about the series in the bonus features of the Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman Complete Series DVD box-set from Shout! Factory, released in December 2013. In it, she reveals that the idea for Mary Hartman's nervous breakdown at the end of the first season came after she wrote a 12-page letter suggesting the idea to Norman Lear. =The dollhouse incident= In the spring of 1976 in Los Angeles, Lasser was arrested at a charity boutique, and police found $6 worth (or 88 milligrams) of cocaine in her purse. Authorities were called after Lasser's American Express card was denied and Lasser refused to leave without possession of a $150 dollhouse. Lasser was initially apprehended for two unpaid traffic tickets (one for jaywalking), but the officers then found the drug in her handbag. Lasser claimed the coke had been given to her several months earlier by a fan. Ultimately, Lasser was ordered to do six months in counseling, which was easily satisfied as she was already seeing an analyst. A fictionalized version of the dollhouse incident was also incorporated into Mary Hartman's first season. =Legacy= In 1976, Ted Morgan assessed in The New York Times: \\"The dreams and nightmares of the American people are reflected darkly through the glass of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.....No longer merely a television program, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman has become a cultural event, in the same league as those other sociological signposts that culture watchers...are always on the lookout for to help us explain ourselves.\\" Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman offers \\"Kitchen Sink Theater of the Absurd\\" wherein a Candide-esque TV-watching housewife believes that a consumer culture broadcasting the evils of waxy yellow buildup and virtues of frozen tacos is seeking to make her a better person. In one signature episode, Mary brings a sick neighbor a bowl of chicken soup, only to have him fall asleep and drown in it. \\"I have actually taken a human life with my chicken soup,\\" Mary laments. While some called the production ahead of its time, Lasser has pointed out that it also reflects its time period perfectly: The program is perhaps an amusing-if-downbeat post- Watergate tribute in which we record and re-listen to each one of our thoughts to figure out if any of them actually makes any sense, or if they all should be redacted. During her appearance on The David Susskind Show, Mary memorably mutters, \\"Erase, erase.\\" As author Claire Barliant writes: \\"For some, the 1970's...was a descent into chaos, a dissolution of self, but also a kind of awakening....The Seventies' nervous breakdown coincides with women's lib. and a strengthening gay rights movement....MH2 is relevant today because it entertains but still shocks, because the social commentary and satire and bravery of the show are as fresh as ever.\\" Moreover, Lasser as the series' figurehead aptly embodies both the insanity and enlightenment of the epoch. In 2000, Lasser appeared on a panel with her former MH2 cast and crew members at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills. The seminar, entitled Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman: Reunion, Reunion, was moderated by Steven A. Bell and taped for the museum archives. In 2004 and 2007, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman was ranked #21 and #26 on \\"TV Guides Top Cult Shows Ever\\". SNL and controversy On July 24, 1976, Lasser hosted the penultimate episode of Saturday Night Lives first season. Her performance is best known for her opening monologue in which she re-creates a Mary Hartman-esque nervous breakdown and locks herself in her dressing room. She is then coaxed out by Chevy Chase/Land Shark and the promise of appearing on the cover of Time. Some reports claim that Lasser's erratic behavior on the show led to her being the first person banned from SNL. Chase accused her of \\"solipsism,\\" and SNL writer Michael O'Donoghue called her \\"clinically berserk\\" and allegedly walked off that week's installment in disgust. On his experience with Lasser, O'Donoghue also elaborated: \\"She was a nice woman going through a few problems, but I wanted to force her to eat her goddamn pigtails at gunpoint.\\" However, Lasser denies that she was ever forbidden from coming back. By Lasser's account, she was initially told she would be able to write her own material but that term was later reneged on and she also refused to do sketches she deemed \\"salacious\\": one in particular featured Lasser and Gilda Radner as teenagers talking about male genitalia. Lasser attests: \\"At the last minute, my manager said they’re not going to cut it. So I said then I’m going to go. And he said are you serious, you’re going to make an ultimatum out of this? And I said, I think so.\\" Jane Curtin appeared in the skit with Radner instead. Lasser also asserts that her SNL antics—which include stream-of-consciousness rambling (already typical of her Mary Hartman character)—were \\"on purpose\\" and that Lorne Michaels pulled repeats of the broadcast only at her manager's request because her manager was not fond of the whole affair, including the final segment in which the actress sat onstage to discuss her rise to fame and the dollhouse incident. Lasser mostly performs by herself on the program but also appears in a vignette with a dog at a table. In terms of her interaction with the SNL cast members, Lasser called Chase \\"like-a-bully mean\\" but Radner \\"a doll.\\" Aside from the intro segment in which Radner and Dan Aykroyd knock on her changing room door, Chase was the only regular player with whom Lasser had any scenes. Lasser and Chase appear as lovers in an Ingmar Bergman parody; plus, the pair filmed a sequence at the Madison Square Garden DNC (although the footage was never aired). Instead, there is a video short in a diner in which she and her partner, played by Alan Zweibel, try to break up but forget their lines; in the end, Lasser moves to the bar and sits next to Michael Sarrazin. Lorne Michaels also briefly shows up in the clip, which ends with \\"a film by Louise Lasser\\" credit. According to Lasser, \\"He [Lorne Michaels] had invited me to come back; he said come back in two weeks and do another show... . It was sad because I believed in people and if they said they were going to do something... for me to threaten to walk off the show, I would never do that for spite. Banned—that’s a horrible thing to have said.\\" Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman producer Norman Lear and co-star Mary Kay Place also hosted Saturday Night Live (SNL) during the run of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Other roles and appearances Following her departure from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, Lasser wrote a made-for-TV movie titled Just Me and You (1978), starring in it with Charles Grodin. Her post-MH2 stage credits include Marie and Bruce (1980) and A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking. She had a recurring role as Alex's ex-wife on the hit series Taxi and starred in the 1981–82 season of It's a Living, playing waitress Maggie McBurney. Lasser had a recurring role on St. Elsewhere in the mid-1980's as Victor Ehrlich's Aunt Charise, a neurotic comic character. Her 1980's film appearances included Stardust Memories (1980), In God We Tru$t (1980), Crimewave (1985), Blood Rage (1987), Surrender (1987), Rude Awakening (1989), and as the mother of the main character in Sing (1989). Her 1990's films included Frankenhooker (1990), The Night We Never Met (1993), Sudden Manhattan (1996), Layin' Low (1996), and as the mother of the three main female characters in Todd Solondz's film Happiness. She appeared in Mystery Men (1999) as the mother of Hank Azaria's character. She also had roles in Darren Aronofsky's film Requiem for a Dream (2000), the romantic comedy Fast Food Fast Women (2000) and co-starred with Renée Taylor in National Lampoon's Gold Diggers (2003). Lasser acted in two episodes of HBO's Girls as a Manhattan artist for the series' third season (2014). Awards and recognition Lasser was the first woman to win a Clio Award, Best Actress in a Commercial (1967), and was also nominated for an Emmy for her performance in Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. She won the National Board of Review Award for Best Acting by an Ensemble for her participation in the film Happiness. Personal life and secondary career Lasser was married to Woody Allen from 1966 to 1970. She has been a faculty member of HB Studio, where she taught acting technique. In 2014, she directed the Off-Off-Broadway production of Ira Lewis' Chinese Coffee. Currently, she lives in Manhattan, New York, and runs her own Louise Lasser Acting Studio on the Upper East Side.

His historical standing remains uncertain. His name is included in the kinglists of the Ramesside era, although it is written in different ways: While the Abydos King List imitates the archaic form, the Royal Canon of Turin and the Saqqara King List form the name with the hieroglyphic sign of a plucked goose. It is unknown how long Senedj ruled over Egypt. The Royal Canon of Turin credits him with 70 years of rulership,Alan H. Gardiner: The Royal Canon of Turin. Griffith Institute of Oxford, Oxford (UK) 1997, , p. 15 & table I. the ancient Egyptian historian Manetho states that Séthenes (as he calls Senedj) ruled for 41 years.William Gillian Waddell: Manetho (= The Loeb Classical Library, Vol. 350). Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.) 2004, , p. 37-41.  Name sources  The possibly only known contemporary inscription from Senedj's reign was found in 1909 by Egyptologist Uvo Hölscher, who assisted the excavations at the Khephren- and Menkaura temple at Giza. Hölscher found a small, thin-walled and polished diorite shard, which once belonged to a flat bowl. At the left breakline an incised inscription gives the reading: \\"The king of Upper- and Lower Egypt, Senedj\\". The inscription goes from the right to the left and exceeds the breakline, but the king's name remains reconstructable. The precious artifact was published in 1912.Uvo Hölscher, Georg Steindorff: Das Grabdenkmal des Königs Chephren (= Veröffentlichungen der Ernst von Sieglin Expedition in Ägypten, 1st Volume). Hinrischs'sche Buchhandlung, Leipzig 1912. page 106ff. It was also examined by George Andrew Reisner, who mentioned it shortly in his book Mycerinus, the Temples of the Third Pyramid at Giza.George Andrew Reisner: Mycerinus, the Temples of the Third Pyramid at Giza. Harvard University Press, Boston 1931, page 105.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastc Egypt. Routledge, London 2002, , p. 74 & 75. The next source referring to king Senedj dates back to the beginning or middle of the 4th Dynasty. The name, written in a cartouche, appears in the inscription on a false door belonging to the mastaba tomb of the high priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held the title “overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj”, “overseer of the ka-priests of king Senedj” and “god's servant of Senedj”. Senedj's name is written in archaic form and set in a cartouche, which is an anachronism, since the cartouche itself was not used until the end of 3rd Dynasty under king Huni.Auguste Mariette: Les mastabas de l’Ancien Empire. Paris 1885, page 92–94Werner Kaiser: Zur Nennung von Sened und Peribsen in Sakkara, In: Göttinger Miszellen, no. 122, (1991), page 49–55. Egyptologist Dietrich Wildung points to two further priests and possible relatives of Shery, who both also participated the funerary cult of Senedj, Inkef and Siy.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewußtsein ihrer Nachwelt (= Münchener Ägyptologische Studien. Bd. 17). Deutscher Kunstverlag, München/ Berlin 1969, p. 44-47. Senedj is also mentioned in papyrus P. Berlin 3038, which contains medical prescriptions and therapies for numerous diseases. One of these gives instructions for treating foot cramps, and closes with the claim that the recipe for the ointment originates from a \\"book of vessels\\". This book is claimed to originate from the time of king Usáphais (identical with king Horus Den of Dynasty I). King Senedj allegedly received the book as an inheritance gift.Wolfhart Westendorf: Erwachen der Heilkunst: die Medizin im alten Ägypten. Artemis & Winkler, 1992, , p. 48. The latest mention of Senedj's name appears on a small bronze statuette in the shape of a kneeling king wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt and holding incense burners in its hands. Additionally, the figurine wears a belt which has Senedj's name carved at the back.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit. (Ägyptologische Abhandlungen, Volume 45), Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , page 103-106Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt. Part I (Münchener Ägytologische Studien 17). Deutscher Kunstverlag, München/Berlin 1969, page 45 Egyptologist Peter Munro has written a report about the existence of a mud seal inscription showing the cartouche name Nefer-senedj-Ra, which he thinks to be a version of “Senedj”.Peter Munro: Nefer-Senedj-Ra, In: Orientalia; Band 57 (1988); page 330. But since the finding was never photographed nor drawn and the alleged object meanwhile got lost, Munro's claim is highly questioned by many scholars.  Identity  The horus name of Senedj remains unknown. The false door inscription of Shery might indicate that Senedj is identical with king Seth-Peribsen and that the name \\"Senedj\\" was brought into the kinglists, because a seth-name was not allowed to be mentioned.Kenneth Anderson Kitchen: Ramesside Inscriptions. page 234–235Jürgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen.. Deutscher Kunstverlag, München/Berlin 1984, , page 171. Other Egyptologists, such as Wolfgang Helck and Dietrich Wildung, are not so sure and believe that Senedj and Peribsen were different rulers. They point out that the false door inscription has the names of both strictly separated from each other. Additionally, Wildung thinks that Senedj donated an offering chapel to Peribsen in his necropolis.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit. page 105-106.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt. page 45. This theory in turn is questioned by Helck and Hermann A. Schlögl, who point to the clay seals of king Sekhemib found in the entrance area of Peribsen's tomb, which might prove that Sekhemib buried Peribsen, not Senedj.Hermann Alexander Schlögl: Das Alte Ägypten. page 77-78 & 415.  Reign  Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer, the third ruler of 2nd dynasty, left a realm that was suffering from an overly complex state administration and that Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to his two sons (or, at least, two chosen successors) who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the two rulers could better administer the states.Nicolas Grimal: A History of Ancient Egypt. Wiley-Blackwell, Weinheim 1994, , page 55.Francesco Tiradritti & Anna Maria Donadoni Roveri: Kemet: Alle Sorgenti Del Tempo. Electa, Milano 1998, , page 80–85. In contrast, Egyptologists such as Barbara Bell believe that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long lasting drought affected Egypt. Therefore, to better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms until the famine came to an end. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period.Barbara Bell: Oldest Records of the Nile Floods, In: Geographical Journal, No. 136. 1970, page 569–573; M. Goedike: Journal of Egypt Archaeology, No. 42. 1998, page 50. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who corrected Bell's calculations. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell had overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription only takes into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. Any long-lasting drought can therefore be excluded.Stephan Seidlmayer: Historische und moderne Nilstände: Historische und moderne Nilstände: Untersuchungen zu den Pegelablesungen des Nils von der Frühzeit bis in die Gegenwart. Achet, Berlin 2001, , page 87–89. It is also unclear if Senedj already shared his throne with another ruler, or if the Egyptian state was split at the time of his death. All known kinglists such as the Sakkara list, the Turin King List and the Abydos table list a king Wadjenes as predecessor of Senedj. After Senedj, the kinglists differ from each other in respect of the successors. While the Sakkara list and the Turin canon mention the kings Neferka(ra), Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I as immediate successors, the Abydos list skips them and lists a king Djadjay (identical with king Khasekhemwy). If Egypt was already divided when Senedj gained the throne, kings like Sekhemib and Peribsen would have ruled Upper Egypt, whilst Senedj and his successors, Neferka(ra) and Hudjefa I, would have ruled Lower Egypt. The division of Egypt was brought to an end by king Khasekhemwy.Hermann Alexander Schlögl: Das Alte Ägypten: Geschichte und Kultur von der Frühzeit bis zu Kleopatra. Beck, Hamburg 2006, , page 77-78 & 415.  Tomb  It is unknown where Senedj was buried. Toby Wilkinson assumes that the king might have been buried at Saqqara. To support this view, Wilkinson makes the observation that mortuary priests in earlier times were never buried too far away from the king for whom they had practised the mortuary cult. Wilkinson thinks that one of the Great Southern Galleries within the Necropolis of King Djoser (3rd Dynasty) was originally Senedj's tomb.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt.

British Museum Press, London 1993, page 67–72 & 84. A cylinder seal of unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a cartouche and gives the epithet Merj-netjeru (\\"beloved of the gods\\"). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists to the conclusion that the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsen's name without a cartouche, but with the royal title Nisut-Bity (\\"king of Upper- and Lower Egypt\\") instead.Francesco Tiradritti & Anna Maria Donadoni Roveri: Kemet: Alle Sorgenti Del Tempo. Electa, Milano 1998, , page 84–85.Peter Kaplony: Die Rollsiegel des Alten Reichs II: Katalog der Rollsiegel, Part II. Fondation égyptologique Reine Elisabeth, Brüssel 1981, page 13; tav. 1 = Historical sources = Existing skeptical views about Peribsen's existence are based on New Kingdom Ramesside king lists, such as the Abydos King List, the Saqqara King List and the Royal Canon of Turin, which all omit Peribsen's name. These, however, are known to have been created nearly 1,500 years after his deathBernhard Grdseloff: Notes d'épigraphie archaïque. In: Annales du service des antiquités de l’Égypte. Vol. 44, 1944, , p. 279–306. and several Fourth Dynasty tombs of priests performing the funerary cult for Peribsen have been uncovered. These tombs report Peribsen's name correctly and their existence demonstrates that Peribsen was seen as a legitimate pharaoh, not subject to damnatio memoriae as Akhenaten later would be. Historians and Egyptologists therefore consider the possibility that Peribsen's name was actually forgotten over time or that his name was preserved in a distorted, misspelled form.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Royal annals of ancient Egypt - The Palermo stone and its associated fragments. Routledge, London 2012, , p. 200–206.  Name  Peribsen's royal name is a subject of curiosity for Egyptologists because it is connected to the deity Seth rather than Horus, as was traditional for the name of a pharaoh. Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a serekh: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see Egyptian hieroglyphs). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the Set animal, representing Seth, on his serekh. Although Peribsen is the only known pharaoh to have the Set animal preside alone over his serekh, he is not the only king to associate himself with Seth. Examples include the 13th Dynasty pharaoh Seth Meribre,Digital Egypt for Universities, 13th dynasty rulers the 19th Dynasty rulers Seti I and Seti II and the 20th Dynasty king Setnakhte.Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros Verlag, Düsseldorf 2002, , page 219, 228 & 231.Walter Bryan Emery: Ägypten - Geschichte und Kultur der Frühzeit. page 105 & 106. The debate continues over why Peribsen chose this name. Earlier theories favoured the idea that Egypt was split into two realms during Peribsen's time or that he was a heretic who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god. However, newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified, but witnessed a vast and profound reform during the Second Dynasty. Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory. Other contemporary inscriptions indicate that Egyptian grammar was perfected during his time: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.Herman te Velde: Seth, God of Confusion. A study of his role in Egyptian mythology and religion (= Probleme der Ägyptologie. Bd. 6). Reprint with come corrections. Brill, Leiden 1977, , p. 109-111.Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros, Düsseldorf 2002, , p. 219, 228 & 231. Peribsen's choice of patron, and his rule during the shadowy period of the mid-Second Dynasty, have led Egyptologists and historians to search for possible explanations for both his name and the troubled times he lived in. The following sections discuss some of the theories that they have put forth. = Religious theories uniting Peribsen with Seth = Inscription from a porphyry-vase displaying the serekh of Peribsen; note the Seth-animal with a sun-disk above.After Hermann Alexander Schlögl: Das Alte Ägypten. S.77ff. ;Older theories A theory that was popular until the mid-20th century, supported by Egyptologists Percy Newberry, Jaroslav Černý,Jaroslav Černý: Ancient Egyptian religion. Hutchinson’s University Library, London u. a 1952, p. 32–48, Online article . Walter Bryan EmeryWalter B. Emery: Ägypten. Fourier, Wiesbaden 1964, , p. 105–108. and Bernhard Grdseloff held that Peribsen was a heretic who sought to introduce a new, monotheistic state religion to Egypt, with Seth as the only worshipped god. Peribsen's actions were thought to be similar to those of the much later 18th Dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten, who had required Egyptians to serve only the Aten. Newberry proposed that the priests of Horus and Seth fought each other \\"in the manner of a War of the Roses\\" during the second half of the Second Dynasty. The \\"heretic Peribsen\\" theory was based on three observations: that the name \\"Peribsen\\" was excluded from later king lists, that the king's tomb had been destroyed and plundered during antiquity and, finally, that the tomb stelae of Peribsen, that once displayed the Set animal, were badly scratched with the clear intention of effacing the Seth image. Egyptologists hypothesized these were the actions of religious opponents to the Sethian priest-caste.P.E. Newberry: The Seth rebellion of the 2nd Dynasty, in: Ancient Egypt., no. 7, 1922, page 40–46. Lauer and Firth relied on the \\"heretic Peribsen\\" theory to explain the enormous quantity of stone vessels inscribed with the name of First and Second Dynasty kings found beneath Djoser's pyramid in bags bearing seals of Khasekhemwy and Djoser. They proposed that Peribsen had plundered the tombs of his predecessors, followers of Horus, and scattered their funerary equipment. These vessels were gathered in the royal treasury during Khasekhemwy's reign following his reunification of Egypt, and finally put beneath the Step Pyramid by Djoser, in an act of pious devotion.Phillipe Flandrin: Jean-Phillipe Lauer: Saqqarah, Une vie, Entretiens avec Phillipe Flandrin, Petite Bibliotheque Payot 107, 1988 ;Contemporary theories Today this theory, as well as Lauer and Firth's conclusions, is widely questioned. Archaeological evidence of Peribsen has been found almost entirely in Upper Egypt. In particular, his name does not appear in Lower Egyptian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the \\"heretic Peribsen\\" theory is the false door of the priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early Fourth Dynasty. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second Dynasty, Senedj. According to the addendum, Shery was \\"overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places\\". This implies that the funerary cult of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth Dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde point out that Shery was not the only Fourth Dynasty priest participating in the funerary cult of Peribsen. Inkef, possibly a brother or cousin of Shery, also held the title of a \\"supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen\\". Seal impressions found in Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's time on the throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism.Auguste Mariette: Les mastabas de l'Ancien Empire. Paris 1885, page 92–94.Nicolas Grimal: A History of Ancient Egypt. Wiley-Blackwell, Weinheim 1994, , page 55–56.Werner Kaiser: Zur Nennung von Sened und Peribsen in Saqqara B3. In: Göttinger Miszellen: Beiträge zur ägyptologischen Diskussion, No. 122. Ägyptologisches Seminar der Universität Göttingen, Göttingen 1991, , page 49–55. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the clay seal impressions found were still undeciphered and untranslated in their time. Vessel from the tomb of king Peribsen, Ashmolean Museum. In the opinion of Sainte Fare Garnot (1956) and te Velde (1956), the name of \\"Peribsen\\" accords religious meaning, even before association with a deity. The name \\"Peribsen\\" literally means \\"He who comes forth by their will\\" or \\"His heart and will comes forth for them.\\" The Egyptian syllable sn means \\"them, their, those\\", revealing a clear plural writing. Te Velde and Garnot are convinced that Peribsen used the heraldic Seth animal as a serekh patron, but also linked his name to Horus. If true, it would prove that Peribsen worshipped Horus and Seth on an equal footing during his lifetime.Jean Sainte Fare Garnot: Sur quelques noms royaux des seconde et troisième dynasties ègyptiennes. In: Bulletin de l'Institut d'Égypte. vol. 37, 1, 1956, , p. 317–328. An ostentatious plural meaning with religious ambiguity was not uncommon for pharaohs' names in the early Egyptian dynasties. Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure, just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore, Peribsen's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition; he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples, the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities, such as \\"she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth\\" and \\"she who carries Horus and Seth\\". Similarly, the unusual serekh of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second Dynasty, shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The two gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth, with power over all Egypt. Khasekhemwy's name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsen's serekh name. Egyptologists Ludwig David Morenz and Wolfgang HelckWolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen, Vol. 45). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , p. 103-111. remark that the targeted gouging of Seth-animals did not occur until the New Kingdom of Egypt. The erasure of the Seth chimera on Peribsen's tomb stelae had been attributed to activity shortly after his death under the \\"heretic\\" theory; new discoveries suggested the defamation occurred centuries later.Ludwig D. Morenz: Synkretismus oder ideologiegetränktes Wort- und Schriftspiel? Die Verbindung des Gottes Seth mit der Sonnenhieroglyphe bei Per-ib-sen. In: Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde. vol. 134, 2007, , p. 151–156. Historian Dietrich Wildung states that the necropolis of Abydos was not the only one plundered in antiquity: the tombs at Saqqara and Giza were also ransacked. Thus, he concludes that any targeted action against one particular pharaoh can be excluded.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt. Volume 1: Posthume Quellen über die Könige der ersten vier Dynastien (= Münchner ägyptologische Studien. vol. 17, ). B. Hessling, Berlin 1969, p. 47. =Political theories= The earlier theories of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff said that the Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic or political in origin. If he was held responsible for the putative misery in the past, this could explain why later king lists excluded Peribsen. In contrast, more recent theories now hold that, if the Egyptian kingdom was divided, the division happened peacefully. Egyptologists such as Michael Rice,Michael Rice: Who's Who in Ancient Egypt. Routledge, London/New York 2001, , page 72, 134 & 172. Francesco TiradrittiFrancesco Tiradritti & Anna Maria Donadoni Roveri: Kemet: Alle Sorgenti Del Tempo. Electa, Milano 1998, , page 80–85. and Wolfgang Helck point to the once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Saqqara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben and Nefer-Setekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second Dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen operated successfully during the entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings. The origin of the political division is unknown. It might have happened at the beginning of Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) propaganda.W. Helck in: Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und Altertum, No. 106. Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 1979, , page 132Francesco Raffaele: Names, titles, identities and the 'Sethian Period' theory Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne and ruled only Upper Egypt, whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne and ruled Lower Egypt.  Identity  Seal impression of king Sekhemib from Abydos Seal impression of Peribsen Egyptologists Walter Bryan Emery, Kathryn A. Bard and Flinders Petrie believe that Peribsen was also known as Sekhemib-Perenmaat, another Second Dynasty ruler that had connected his name with the falcon god Horus. As evidence, clay seals of Sekhemib found in the entrance of Peribsen's tomb support this hypothesis. Sekhemib's tomb has not yet been found.Kathryn A. Bard: The Emergence of the Egyptian State, page 86, in: Ian Shaw (editor): The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press (2000), .Walter Bryan Emery: Ägypten - Geschichte und Kultur der Frühzeit.

Band 2. page 7, 14, 19, 20 & 48. This theory is debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter KaplonyPeter Kaplony: Die Inschriften der ägyptischen Frühzeit (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen. Vol. 8, ), Vol. 3. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, p. 406-411. and Jochem KahlJochen Kahl: Inscriptional Evidence for the Relative Chronology of Dyns. 0–2. In: Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, David A. Warburton (Hrsg.): Ancient Egyptian Chronology (= Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 1: The Near and Middle East; Vol. 83). Brill, Leiden u. a. 2006, , p. 94–115. argue that the clay seals were only found at the entrance area of Peribsen's tomb and none of them depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury his predecessor and seal his tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals shows the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.Hermann A. Schlögl: Das Alte Ägypten. Geschichte und Kultur von der Frühzeit bis zu Kleopatra. Verlag C. H. Beck, München 2006, , page 78.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thintenzeit. (Ägyptologische Abhandlungen, Volume 45), Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , page 103–111. Scholars Toby Wilkinson and Helck believe that Peribsen and Sekhemib could have been related. Their theory is based on the stone vessel inscriptions and seal impressions that show strong similarities in their typography and grammar. The vessels of Peribsen show the notation \\"ini-setjet\\" (\\"tribute of the people of Sethroë\\"), whilst Sekhemib's inscriptions have the notation \\"ini-khasut\\" (\\"tribute of the desert nomads\\"). A further indication that Peribsen and Sekhemib were related is their serekh names; they both used the syllables \\"Per\\" and \\"ib\\" in their names.Siegfried Schott: Altägyptische Festdaten. Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz/Wiesbaden 1950, page 55.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. page 90–91; see also: Walter Bryan Emery: Ägypten – Geschichte und Kultur der Frühzeit. page 106. The false door inscription of Shery might indicate that Peribsen is identical with king Senedj (\\"Senedj\\" means \\"the frightening\\") and that this name was used in the king lists by proxy, as the Seth name was forbidden to mention.Kenneth Anderson Kitchen: Ramesside Inscriptions. page 234–235; see also: Jürgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen.. Deutscher Kunstverlag, München/Berlin 1984, , page 171. In contrast, Dietrich Wildung and Wolfgang Helck identify Peribsen with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. They think it is possible that the name Per-ib-sen was misread from a sloppy hieratic inscription of Wadj-sen.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt. Band 1: Posthume Quellen über die Könige der ersten vier Dynastien (= Münchner ägyptologische Studien. vol. 17, ). B. Hessling, Berlin 1969, page 45–47.  Reign  Seal impression from Peribsen's tomb with the first known complete sentence in Egyptian history As some archaeological records support the view that the Egyptian state was divided during Peribsen's reign, there is continued debate as to why his predecessors decided to divide the realm, and whether Peribsen ruled part or all of Egypt. = Proponents of the divided-realm-theory = Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander SchlöglHermann A. Schlögl: Das Alte Ägypten. Geschichte und Kultur von der Frühzeit bis zu Kleopatra. Beck, München 2006, , p. 77. and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer, the third ruler of the Second dynasty and predecessor to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler. Egyptologist Dimitri B. Proussakov supports his theory with notations on the famous Palermo stone concerning the year events of king Nynetjer. From the twelfth year event onward, \\"The king of Upper- and Lower Egypt appears\\" was amended to \\"The king of Lower Egypt appears\\". Proussakov sees this as a strong indication that Nynetjer's power over Egypt had diminished.Dimitri B. Proussakov: Early dynastic Egypt: A socio- environmental/anthropological hypothesis of \\"Unification\\". In: Leonid E. Grinin (Hrsg.): The early state, its alternatives and analogues. Uchitel Publishing House, Volgograd 2004, , p. 139–180. Egyptologists compare the situation to that of king Qa'a, one of the last rulers of the First Dynasty. When Qa'a died, obscure claimants appeared and battled for the throne of Egypt. The struggles reached an apex with the plundering of the royal cemetery at Abydos, whereupon the cemetery was abandoned and Saqqara became the new royal burial site. The conflict was ended by the ascension of king Hotepsekhemwy, the founder of the Second Dynasty.Walter Bryan Emery: Great tombs of the First Dynasty (Excavations at Saqqara, vol. 3). Gouvernment Press, London 1958, p. 28–31.Peter Kaplony: \\"Er ist ein Liebling der Frauen\\" – Ein \\"neuer\\" König und eine neue Theorie zu den Kronprinzen sowie zu den Staatsgöttinnen (Kronengöttinnen) der 1./2. Dynastie. In: Ägypten und Levante. vol. 13, 2006, , S. 107–126. Barbara Bell, another scholar, believes that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period.Barbara Bell: Oldest Records of the Nile Floods, In: Geographical Journal, No. 136. 1970, page 569–573; M. Goedike: Journal of Egypt Archaeology, No. 42. 1998, page 50. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.Stephan Seidlmayer: Historische und moderne Nilstände: Historische und moderne Nilstände: Untersuchungen zu den Pegelablesungen des Nils von der Frühzeit bis in die Gegenwart. Achet, Berlin 2001, , page 87–89. ;Rulers of Lower and Upper Egypt Egyptian historians such as Helck, Tiradritti, Schlögl, Emery and Grimal are convinced that Peribsen was a co-ruler. The investigation into the rulers of Lower Egypt is ongoing. The Rammesside king lists differ in their order of royal names from king Senedj onward. The royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin reflect Memphite traditions, which only allowed Memphite rulers to be mentioned. The Abydos king list reflects instead the Thinite traditions and therefore only Thinite rulers appear on that list. Until king Senedj, all the king lists are in agreement. After him, the Sakkara list and the Turin list mention three kings as successors: Neferkara I, Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I. The Abydos king list jumps forward to Khasekhemwy, calling him \\"Djadjay\\". The discrepancies are considered by Egyptologists to be the result of the division of Egypt during the Second dynasty.Nicolas Grimal: A History of Ancient Egypt. Wiley-Blackwell, Weinheim 1994, , page 55. Alabaster fragment with the nebti-name Weneg.see: P. Lacau, J.P. Lauer: La Pyramide a Degrees IV. Inscriptions Gravees sur les Vases. Cairo 1959; obj.104 Additional contradictory findings are the Horus and Nebty names of kings discovered in the Great Southern Gallery in the necropolis of the (Third dynasty) king Djoser at Sakkara. Stone vessel inscriptions mention the kings Nubnefer, Weneg-Nebty, Horus Ba, Horus \\"Bird\\" and Za; each of these is mentioned only a few times, suggesting their reigns were short. King Sneferka might be identical with king Qa'a or an ephemeral successor of his. King Weneg-Nebty might be identical with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. But kings such as \\"Nubnefer\\", \\"Bird\\" and \\"Za\\" remain a mystery. They never appear anywhere else and the number of objects surviving from their lifetimes is very limited. Schlögl, Helck and Peter Kaplony postulate, that Nubnefer, Za and Bird were contemporaries of Peribsen and Sekhemib and ruled over Lower Egypt, whilst the latter two ruled Upper Egypt.Peter Kaplony: A building named \\"Menti-Ankh\\". In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Kairo (MDAIK), volume 20. de Gruyter, Berlin 1965, page 1–46. = Opponents of the divided-realm-theory = Scholars such as Herman TeVelde, I. E. S. EdwardsI. E. S. Edwards (Hrsg.): Early history of the middle east (= The Cambridge ancient history. Vol. 1–2), 3rd edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1970, , p.31-32. and Toby Wilkinson believe the inscription of the famous Annal stone of Fifth dynasty, a black olivin-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, argues against the division of the realm. On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called Palermo Stone and Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now). The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers Wadjenes, Nubnefer or Sened might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone. The Annal stone gives absolutely no indication of a division of the Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely. = Political accomplishments = During his time on the throne, Peribsen founded an administrative center called \\"The white house of treasury\\" as well as a new royal residence, called the \\"protection of Nubt\\", located near Ombos (\\"Nubt\\" being the Ancient Egyptian name of Naqada).Jean-Pierre Pätznik: Die Siegelabrollungen und Rollsiegel der Stadt Elephantine im 3. Jahrtausend vor Christus. Spurensicherung eines archäologischen Artefaktes (= BAR, International Series. Bd. 1339). Archaeopress, Oxford 2005, , p. 62–66. The administrative titles of scribes, seal-bearers and overseers were adjusted to correspond to the divided bureaucratic state administration. For example, titles like \\"sealer of the king\\" were changed into \\"sealer of the king of Upper Egypt\\". This bureaucratic reform may indicate an attempt by Peribsen to limit the power of these officials, further evidence for a bloated and unwieldy state administration under Nynetjer. The administration system under Peribsen and Sekhemib had a clear and well-defined hierarchy; as an example, from highest to the lowest rank: Treasury house (royal and therefore highest in ranking) → pension office → property → vineyards → private vineyard (property of citizens and therefore lowest in ranking). King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty, was able to re-unify the state administration of Egypt and therefore unite the whole of Ancient Egypt. He brought the two treasury houses of Egypt under the control of the \\"House of the King\\", bringing them into a new, single administration centre.Christian E. Schulz: Schreibgeräte und Schreiber in der 0. Bis 3. Dynastie. Grin, München 2007, , p. 9–15.Peter Kaplony: Die Inschriften der ägyptischen Frühzeit (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen. vol. 8, 3, ). Volume 3, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, p. 406–411. Peribsen also founded royal edifices such as Per-nubt (\\"house of Ombos\\") and Per-Medjed (\\"house of meetings\\") and created several cities of economic importance. Their names, Afnut (\\"city of the headdress-makers\\"), Nebj (\\"protector's city\\"), Abet-desheret (\\"city of the red granite jars\\") and Huj-setjet (\\"city of the Asians'), are mentioned on numerous clay seals alongside Peribsen's serekh, often preceded by the phrase \\"visit of the king at ...\\".Eva-Maria Engel: Neue Funde aus alten Grabungen – Gefäßverschlüsse aus Grab P in Umm el-Qa'ab im Ägyptischen Museum Kairo.

Jahrtausend vor Christus. 2005, p. 64–66. Inscriptions on stone vessels also mention an \\"ini-setjet\\" (\\"tribute of the people of Sethroë\\"), which might indicate that Peribsen founded a cult centre for the deity Seth in the Nile Delta. This may suggest Peribsen ruled over the whole of Egypt, or, at least, that he was accepted as king across all of Egypt.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/New York, 1999, , page 89–91. One official from Peribsen's reign, Nefer-Setekh (\\"Seth is beautiful\\"), the \\"wab-priest of the king\\", is known to Egyptologists by his stela. His name may highlight the appearance and popularity of Seth as a royal deity.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/New York, 1999, , page 295. In Peribsen's tomb at Abydos, clay seals were found that demonstrate the first complete written sentence in recorded Egyptian history. The inscription reads:Jochem Kahl: \\"Ra is my Lord\\" : searching for the rise of the Sun God at the dawn of Egyptian history, Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 2007, , see p. 3 > \\"The golden one/He of Ombos hath unified/handed over the two realms for/to > his son, the king of Lower and Upper Egypt, Peribsen\\". The title \\"The golden one\\", also read as \\"He of Ombos\\", is considered by Egyptologists to be a religious form of address to the deity Seth.Susanne Bickel: Die Verknüpfung von Weltbild und Staatsbild: Die Verknüpfung von Weltbild und Staatsbild Aspekte von Politik und Religion in Ägypten, In: Hermann Spieckermann: Götterbilder, Gottesbilder, Weltbilder.

Cambridge University Press, 1970, , page 31 & 32. = Religious changes = Despite his alignment with Seth, numerous deities were worshipped by the populace under Peribsen. Numerous clay seal impressions and jar inscriptions mention the gods Ash, Horus, Nekhbet, Min, Bastet and Kherty. The depictions of the deities are followed by the name of the place or town where they had their principal cult center. On the Cairo stone, a statue of Ash and a fetish of Seth are credited to Peribsen, complementing the clay seal impressions. Curiously, several seal impressions show a sun disc over the Seth chimera atop the royal serekh: the ancient symbol for the god Ra. There is no archaeologic proof that the sun god Ra was part of the Egyptian pantheon at this early date; the appearance of the disc may be the first evidence of the evolving sun cult and theistic change. The sun disc appears in connection to one of the state patrons (for example, under Peribsen's predecessor Raneb the sun was connected to Horus); under Peribsen it was connected to Seth. Under king Khasekhemwy the sun finally received its own name (ra) and, at the time of throne change between Khasekhemwy and his follower Djoser, several priests and officials also connected their name to Ra.Jochem Kahl: »Ra is my Lord«: Searching for the Rise of the Sun God at the Dawn of Egyptian History.

Tomb Peribsen's tomb at Abydos, in the background the Great Enclosure of king Khasekhemwy is visible Mehen game board from Peribsen's tomb in Abydos, on display at the Louvre. Peribsen was buried in the tomb P of the royal cemetery at Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos. The first excavation of the tomb started in 1898 under the supervision of French archaeologist and Egyptologist Émile Amélineau.Émile Amélineau: Mission Amélineau. Tome 4: Les nouvelles fouilles d'Abydos 1897–1898. Compte rendu in extenso des fouilles, description des monuments et objets découverts. Partie 2. Leroux, Paris 1905, page 676–679. This first foray was followed by excavations in 1901 and 1902 under the supervision of British archaeologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. Further exploration of the tomb was undertaken in 1928 by the Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville.Èdouard Naville: The cemeteries of Abydos. Part 1: 1909–1910. The mixed cemetery and Umm El- Ga'ab (= Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund. vol. 33, ). Egypt Exploration Fund u. a., London 1914, page 21–25 & 35–39. The tomb's construction is straightforward and, compared to the size of other royal tombs in the same area, surprisingly small. The design model was the tomb of king Djer (third pharaoh of the First dynasty), thought to be the 'Tomb of Osiris' from the Middle Kingdom. The architecture of Peribsen's tomb is similar to the residential palace. The tomb measures x and comprises three independent structures nested into one another: in the center is the main burial chamber, measuring x , and which is made of mud bricks, reeds, and wood. On the north, east and west sides the burial chamber is surrounded by nine small storage rooms leading into one another; on the south face is a long antechamber. A passageway runs between the inner structures and the outer wall. Excavations under the supervision of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.Laurel Bestock: The Early Dynastic Funerary Enclosures of Abydos. In: Archéo-Nil. Bd. 18, 2008, , page 42–59, especially page 56–57.Günter Dreyer and others.: Umm el-Qaab – Nachuntersuchungen im frühzeitlichen Königsfriedhof (16. / 17. / 18. Vorbericht). In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo. (MDAIK). vol. 62, 2006, , page 75–77 & 106–110. =Findings= The tomb had been extensively plundered by tomb robbers during antiquity, yet numerous stone vessels and earthen jars remained. Some of the stone vessels had copper-coated rims and are similar to the better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and Raneb were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and carnelian and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib. The two stone stelae from the entrance, common to burial chambers of the First and Second dynasties, are now on display in two different museums. =Royal funerary enclosure= A royal funerary enclosure made of mud bricks was found close to Peribsen's tomb. Clay seals with Peribsen's serekh name on them were located near the eastern entrance and inside a destroyed offering shrine. The findings support the view that the building was part of Peribsen's burial site. The funerary enclosure is commonly known as \\"Middle Fort\\". This was first discovered in 1904 under the supervision of Canadian archaeologist Charles Trick Currelly and British Egyptologist Edward Russell Ayrton. The enclosure wall was located on the north-west side of Khasekhemwy's funerary enclosure \\"Shunet ez Zebib\\" (\\"raisin barn\\"). Peribsen's measures x and housed only a few cult buildings. The enclosure has three entrances: one to the east, one to the south and one to the north. A small shrine, measuring x was located at the south-east corner of the funerary enclosure. It once comprised three small chapels. No subsidiary tombs were found.Laurel Bestock: The development of royal funerary cult at Abydos. Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2009, , page 47 & 48.W. M.

But the biography by Jacoby, his personal friend, uses the americanized spelling Agron exclusively throughout. The book contains numerous examples of personal correspondence from its subject, and he signs himself Agron, even when writing in Spanish, for example, \\"Tu amigo y hermano, Salvador Agron #16846\\" (Jacoby, p. 70). Reports of his arrest use the conventional americanized spelling. He was described as \\"Salvador Agron, the Cape Man\\" in the New York Herald Tribune on September 3, 1959 (reprinted in Jacoby, p. 181). (April 24, 1943 – April 22, 1986), a.k.a. \\"The Capeman\\", was a Puerto Rican gang member who murdered two teenagers in a Hell's Kitchen park in 1959. Agron mistook both teenagers for members of a gang called the Norsemen who were supposed to show up for a gang fight. Agron was the subject of the musical The Capeman by Paul Simon. Early years Agron was born in the city of Mayagüez on the western coast of Puerto Rico. When he was young, his parents divorced and his mother had custody of him and his sister, Aurea. She earned a living by working at a local convent; however, according to Agron, he and his sister were mistreated by the nuns. His mother met and married a Pentecostal minister and the family moved to New York City. Agron's relationship with his stepfather was negative, and he asked his mother to send him back to Puerto Rico to live with his father. In Puerto Rico, his father had remarried. One day the teenage Agron found the body of his stepmother, who had committed suicide by hanging herself. Agron began to get into trouble and was sent to the Industrial School of Mayagüez. The Capeman His father sent him back to his mother in New York, and in 1958 he became a member of notorious teenage street gang the Mau Maus from the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn. He later joined another gang called the Vampires after meeting Tony Hernandez,The correct spelling of his surname in Spanish is Hernández. The biography by Jacoby uses the americanized spelling Hernandez (Jacoby, p. 182). the gang's president. On August 29, 1959, the Vampires were on their way to \\"rumble\\" (street gang fight) with a gang composed mostly of Irish Americans called the Norsemen. When they arrived, they mistook a group of teenagers for members of the Norsemen. Agron stabbed two of the teenagers to death and fled the scene. The two victims were Anthony Krzesinski and Robert Young, Jr. The murders made headlines in New York and the city went into an uproar. Agron was called \\"The Capeman\\" because he wore a black cape with red lining during the fight, while Hernandez was labeled \\"The Umbrella Man\\" because he used an umbrella with a sharp end as a weapon. After Agron was captured, he was quoted as saying: \\"I don't care if I burn, my mother could watch me.\\" Incarceration Agron was sentenced to death, which made the 16-year-old the youngest prisoner ever sentenced to death row in New York. While many New Yorkers were outraged about the killings, others like former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Robert Young, the father of one of the victims, campaigned for leniency. While on death row, Agron became a born- again Christian. In prison he learned to read and write, earning his high school equivalency diploma. He wrote poems about his life and street life, including \\"The Political Identity of Salvador Agron; Travel Log of Thirty-Four Years\\", \\"Uhuru Sasa! (A Freedom Call)\\", and \\"Justice, Law and Order\\", which were published by some newspapers. He later earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and philosophy from the State University of New York in New Paltz, New York. His death sentence was commuted to life in prison by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1962. Escape and release from prison In December 1976, Governor Hugh Carey reduced Agron's sentence, making him eligible for release in 1977. Agron was enrolled at SUNY New Paltz while spending his nights at the Fishkill Correctional Facility. However, in April 1977, Agron took flight and absconded to Phoenix where he was captured two weeks later and brought back to New York. In November 1977, Agron went on trial for his escape (his lawyer was William Kunstler), but was found not guilty of absconding due to \\"mental illness.\\" Agron was finally released from prison on November 1, 1979. A television movie based on his life was proposed and he set up a fund for the families of his victims with the money he received. Later years Agron began working as a youth counselor, and spoke out against gang violence for over five years. On April 16, 1986, he was admitted to a hospital with pneumonia and internal bleeding and died six days later at age 42.

The officer was responding to a report of drug trafficking when she pulled over a dark Chevrolet Suburban carrying Rocha and two others. Events According to officers reports, soon after being pulled over near the intersection of South Pleasant Valley Road and Quicksilver Boulevard, a scuffle between Rocha and Officer Julie Schroeder took place. It was during this time when Schroeder shot Rocha in the back at point blank range. Schroder's testimony was that she used lethal force to protect both officer Sgt. Don Doyle and herself from a taser gun, which, she argued, Rocha could have used. Witnesses at the scene say that he was on the ground face down, unarmed, with Officer Schroeder's knee in his back when he was shot at point blank range. Austin Police Department Policy provides that cameras in patrol cars be on during traffic stops. Three police cars participated in the stop, yet two of the three available cameras were not on during the incident and the third arrived after Rocha was shot. Multiple tests were conducted on Rocha to determine whether narcotics were in his blood the night he was killed. Rocha was initially reported drug-free by Travis County Medical Examiner Robert Bayardo. On July 18, 2005, Bayardo reversed this position, stating investigators found traces of marijuana in a \\"subsequent toxicology screen\\". This reversal resulted in criticism against the findings from some members of the community. Aftermath Julie Schroeder was fired from the Austin Police Department for violating multiple department policies during the incident, including her failure to use in-car recording equipment and improper use and handling of taser weapons. Schroeder's use of deadly force was found to be inappropriate. Stan Knee—chief of the Austin Police Department—stated \\"this was a deadly force encounter that, in my opinion, was avoidable\\". In June 2005, the city of Austin agreed to a $1million settlement in a lawsuit related to the death of Daniel Rocha.

The soft count rooms are usually among the most secure places due to the large amounts of cash that can be on hand at any one time. Traditionally, a count room would be operated by at least three people. The first two people independently counted stacks of currency and recorded the results on a count card. The third person examined the two count cards to ensure that the first two people recorded the same amount. If there was a difference between the amounts recorded on the two count cards, the currency would be recounted. Some smaller volume cash businesses still operate a count room in this fashion. The counting is currently done by accounting professionals called soft counters, usually using computer spreadsheets. Typically, a soft count room contains a large table upon which the currency to be counted is placed, known as the \\"count table\\". Count room personnel manually organize the currency so that it can be easily counted by hand or by a counting machine. Most modern count rooms are equipped with high-speed computerized machines that perform the counting process. Typically, these machines are capable of counting between ten and twenty banknotes per second. After currency is prepared on the count table, it is transferred to the machine's operator, who inserts the prepared stacks into the machine. The machine authenticates each banknote, separates the counted banknotes according to denomination, and provides a printed or electronic report of the results. The opposite of soft count is hard count in which coins and chips are counted.

He is the brother of former big league outfielder Prentice Redman. Early years Prior to high school, Redman played little league baseball at Duncanville, Alabama against teams from Taylorville and Moundville.

Pal Mickey was discontinued and no new stock is available for purchase as of October 2008. The toy is a ten-inch (26.5 cm) plush model of Mickey Mouse, soft and easy for children to hold. Inside, it contains a microprocessor, a speaker, three AA batteries, three squeeze sensors (one in each hand and one in its belly), and an infrared receiver in its nose. A loop on the back of its head fits a clip or a lanyard hook for ease of carrying. Pal Mickey was sold for use at the four theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom. Guests could previously purchase Pal Mickey at various on site hotel gift shops, all four theme parks, and Downtown Disney. It communicates invisibly with more than four hundred infrared transmitters around these parks. It will periodically giggle and vibrate to indicate that it has information to provide; when its belly or hand is squeezed, it will speak up with information about the immediate area, parade and showtime reminders, tips on what costumed walkaround characters may be nearby, and attractions with short queue times. It \\"remembers\\" where it has been so as to avoid repeating itself. If it is squeezed when it has no tips to provide or when it is not at a park, it will tell jokes and play simple games. The toy is programmed with over seven hundred pre-recorded phrases. In September 2014, Disney ceased supporting Pal Mickey at the parks. As of July 2017 Pal Mickey continues to automatically provide information about its immediate area, but no longer provides updates on character meet and greets or parade and showtime reminders. Versions The original version of Pal Mickey (commonly referred to as \\"1.0\\") was introduced in May 2003. It was dressed in red shorts with white buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes. It sold for US$50, with rentals available for $8 per day plus a $50 deposit to return it by noon the following day; if not returned, that deposit was forfeited and the toy was considered sold. This version of the toy came with a clip. The rental program was discontinued at the end of 2004. The \\"Happiest Celebration On Earth\\" version of the toy (commonly referred to as \\"2.0\\") was introduced on May 5, 2005 with the start of the Happiest Celebration on Earth events. It is priced at US$65. It is dressed in red shorts with gold buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes; it wears a tailcoat and a gold bowtie, both of which fasten with velcro. It comes with a clip and a lanyard for carrying it. This version improves on the original in many small ways, such as by having a louder speaker, and it is able to sing Disney songs and ask Disney character trivia questions. Permanently attached to its right hand is a golden medallion; squeezing its right hand will make Mickey giggle and will make a \\"Happiest Celebration on Earth Glow Medallion\\" (sold during 2005) light up. In September 2006, the \\"Pal Mickey Sorcerer Costume\\" (commonly referred to as \\"3.0\\") replaced the previous version of the toy. This Pal Mickey is dressed in a (removable) blue Sorcerer Mickey hat, red robe, and blue shorts (sewn on over Mickey's red shorts, which have white buttons like the first release). It does not have the medallion on its hand. A Spanish language version of Pal Mickey was also available. Four costumes for the toy were made available in early 2006. The costumes are \\"Mickey Mouse Club\\", \\"Pin Trading\\", \\"Safari\\", and \\"Rain Wear\\", and sell for US$10 each. In October 2006, \\"Pirate Cap'n\\" and \\"Santa Mickey\\" costumes were made available for US$12 each. The \\"Santa Mickey\\" sold out during December 2006 and was not available for order through the WDW Mail Order department. However, it returned for the 2007 Holiday season. The toy was discontinued in fall 2008. The toy continued to work until September 2014. At that point Disney stopped servicing the infrared technology to focus more on their RFID technology used in their magic bands.http://www.wdwmagic.com/other/mymagicplus/news/22sep2014-pal-mickey- support-to-end-this-week.htm Games The original version of the toy provided a choice of three games, triggered by squeezing both of its hands at the same time. *That Isn't Here: Pal Mickey will choose a theme park and will speak the names of park attractions, and the player has to squeeze the toy's hand or tummy depending on whether or not that attraction is in the chosen park. If Pal Mickey is used within any of the four Walt Disney World theme parks, Pal Mickey will automatically select the theme park that it is already in and will keep selecting the park until the person either turns off Pal Mickey or leaves the park. *Mickey Says: Similar to Simon Says. The player must only follow Pal Mickey's direction if it is preceded by \\"Mickey says\\". *Fast Friends: Pal Mickey will speak the names of Disney characters, and the player must respond to each in a specific way. For example, \\"when I say Goofy, squeeze my left hand\\" or \\"when I say the name of someone who can fly, squeeze my right hand.\\" These games are added in the \\"Happiest Celebration on Earth\\" and later versions of the toy, for a total of six games. The above three games are triggered by squeezing the toy's tummy and right hand at the same time; the below three games are triggered by squeezing its tummy and left hand at the same time. *Follow Me: Similar to Simon. The player has to repeat a sequence of actions as directed by Pal Mickey, with one additional action being added to the sequence each time. *Try 'n' Keep Up: The player must react quickly to Pal Mickey's directions. *Repeating Myself: Pal Mickey will speak the names of Disney characters, and the player must squeeze its tummy if it repeats a name it has already said. Technical information Pal Mickey's electronics and batteries are encased in plastic housings (the original version's housing is black or white, the second version's is yellow, and the third version's is white) which can be accessed by unzipping the back of the toy. Beneath the zipper is an on/off switch which enables or disables the toy's squeeze and infrared sensors to prolong battery life. The toys are shipped with batteries installed, and they are set to \\"demo mode\\" while they are on store shelves: they ignore infrared signals, and squeezing them will make them recite a sample of tips as if they were near park attractions. It has been reported that the infrared transmitters in the parks are able to identify individual Pal Mickey toys and roughly track their locations as they are carried around, thereby letting Disney collect information about guests' progress through the parks. If this is true, the information collected would be anonymous, since nothing identifies a specific Pal Mickey as belonging to a specific person or family.

It was released by Heavenly Records. In an interview with Record Collector, band member Bob Stanley stated that the title is a reference to the 1959 film Tiger Bay.http://www.saint.etienne.net/ec/Tiger_Bay.disc.html The album is described by Bob Stanley as \\"an album of modern folk songs done in twentieth century styles like techno and dub\\".Bob Stanley, interview with Melody Maker. Qtd. in \\"Like a Motorway\\". Saint Etienne Heaven . 29 June 2002. \\"Like a Motorway\\", for example, blends Kraftwerk-style techno with the melody from the nineteenth century folk song \\"Silver Dagger\\". Some of the songs, such as \\"Marble Lions\\" and \\"Former Lover\\" forsake electronics for classical folk instrumentation and orchestral arrangements. One, \\"Western Wind\\", is a traditional English folk song. Composition The band wrote most of the songs in the Forest of Dean, in the hope that the countryside would inspire folk ideas. The original intention was for all the songs to be about death. Releases Tiger Bay was released in the UK in June 1994. The original cover art is James Clarke Hook's \\"Welcome Bonny Boat\\", doctored to include the band members.http://halfmanhalfbikekit.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/hebden- bridge-14-15-july/ The American edition of the album replaced the UK cover art with a photograph of the band smartly dressed at a table. It does not include the \\"Western Wind\\"/\\"Tankerville\\" suite. In place of the cut songs is the single \\"I Was Born On Christmas Day\\" and remixes by Daniel Abraham of \\"Hug My Soul\\" and \\"Like a Motorway\\". Tiger Bay was reissued in 1996 by Creation Records, in part because of Saint Etienne's absence from the music scene, but also because of their formal move to Creation Records. The reissue featured another new cover, this time showing Giuditta del Vecchio (from the film Léolo); the back shows a picture of the group. The inner sleeve was updated, and includes a short commentary on the album by journalist and friend of the group Simon Price, as well as a new selection of photographs with a summery theme. The album itself features a slightly shuffled track listing. \\"Marble Lions\\" is moved to appear after \\"Pale Movie\\". The second occurrence of \\"Western Wind\\" is removed completely; instead \\"Tankerville\\" fades into \\"Boy Scouts of America\\". \\"Former Lover\\" is also edited, although less noticeably, with only the opening guitar chords being removed. The reissue also features four extra tracks – \\"I Buy American Records\\", \\"Grovely Road\\", \\"Hate your Drug\\" and the single edit of \\"He's on the Phone\\". In 2010 the album was re-released once more. The new deluxe version reinstates the original sleeve art and includes a booklet with an interview with Bob Stanley and additional bonus disc containing a number of demos and all of the b-sides. Response The British release of Tiger Bay was commercially successful and reached #8 on the UK Album Chart. Three singles were released, but none matched the popularity of those from their previous album. The first, \\"Pale Movie\\", peaked at No. 28. \\"Like a Motorway\\" was more disappointing, missing the top forty completely and making only No. 47. \\"Hug My Soul\\" was released as a two-disc set and managed better, peaking at No. 32. \\"Hug My Soul\\" was the only single that charted in the US and reached No. 40 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. In a 2009 interview, Bob Stanley said that in retrospect the band should have included some more obvious singles on Tiger Bay, to be commercial: \\"it definitely could have done with a couple more obvious songs\\". He also acknowledged that the original cover was a commercial mistake.Scott Plagenhoef, Interviews: Saint Etienne, Pitchfork, 5 February 2009.

Sanchez was ordained on May 12, 1946, as a priest from Sorsogon, where he was asked to teach at the Peñafrancia Seminary.

Return to the Philippines and death Sánchez returned to the Philippines in December 2010, ostensibly to fight the Reproductive Health Bill, which he believed will destroy the Filipino family due to the promotion of extramarital sex and premarital sex that comes with the distribution of contraceptives.Philippine Daily Inquirer, 9 April 2011. \\"His constant prayer was that Europe’s loss of its Christian faith would never happen in the Philippines,\\" wrote former Senator Francisco Tatad. \\"And he would contribute his last strength to the fight of the Filipino family against the international reproductive health lobby, which has destroyed the family and killed the Christian faith in many parts of the world.\\"Francisco Tatad, In Memoriam Cardinal Jose Tomas Sanchez, March 9, 2012.

He is best known for playing Dr. Donald Westphall in the medical drama series St. Elsewhere (1982–1988). Flanders was nominated for eight Primetime Emmys and won three times in 1976, 1977, and 1983. He received a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for his performance in the 1973 production of A Moon for the Misbegotten.  Early life  Flanders was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Bernice (née Brown) and Francis Michael Grey Flanders. His mother was killed in an automobile accident when he was 14. After graduating from Patrick Henry High School (where he played hockey) in 1952, he enlisted in the United States Army, where he served as an X-ray technician.  Early career  After his service with the United States Army ended, Flanders began his acting career on Broadway before moving on to guest parts in television series. From 1967 through 1975, Flanders appeared in more than a dozen American TV shows, including six appearances on Hawaii Five-O (as six different characters). During this time, he was also prolific in TV movies. He married actress Ellen Geer, with whom he had a son, Ian Flanders (born 1966) before they divorced. In the late 1970s, Flanders moved away from small TV roles to take major credits in both TV and feature films, while continuing his stage career. In 1974, Flanders won a Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actor in a Dramatic Presentation for A Moon for the Misbegotten by Eugene O'Neill on Broadway. He also won an Emmy award in 1976 for the TV movie adaptation of A Moon for the Misbegotten.  St. Elsewhere  In 1982, he began his role in St. Elsewhere that earned him five Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead Actor in a TV Series, winning the award in 1983. After a stormy departure from the series in 1987, he returned for two more episodes in 1988, including the series finale. During a scene in which Westphall addressed the staff, Flanders began speaking extemporaneously about the quality of art and had to be edited for broadcast. His exit on St. Elsewhere as a regular cast member was titled Moon for the Misbegotten after the play that won him a Tony Award. The episode gained much publicity as Westphall left the hospital after \\"mooning\\" his new boss, Dr. John Gideon (played by Ronny Cox). Flanders continued his working relationship with executive producer Bruce Paltrow in the short-lived 1994 CBS series The Road Home.  Notable roles  In addition to his six-year role as Dr. Donald Westphall, Flanders is noted as the actor who has played President Harry Truman more times, and in more separate productions, than any other. He portrayed Truman at the end of World War II and during the Korean War in Truman at Potsdam, Harry S Truman: Plain Speaking, and MacArthur. In the last, Flanders had second billing to Gregory Peck's lead as General Douglas MacArthur. Along with Jason Robards, Robin Williams and Anthony Hopkins, Flanders is on a short list of actors who have portrayed two U.S. presidents having also portrayed Calvin Coolidge in the television miniseries Backstairs at the White House. In feature films, Flanders performed major roles in two dark movies based on novels by William Peter Blatty. In the first, The Ninth Configuration (1980), he plays Col. Richard Fell, a self-effacing medic at a secret U.S. Army psychiatric facility who assists Marine psychiatrist Col. Vincent Kane (Stacy Keach). The film was based on Blatty's darkly satirical novel Twinkle, Twinkle, \\"Killer\\" Kane. In 1990, Flanders played Father Dyer alongside star George C. Scott in Blatty's The Exorcist III based on the novel Legion. One of Flanders's best-remembered TV guest roles was in the first season M*A*S*H episode \\"Yankee Doodle Doctor\\", playing film director Lt. Duane William Bricker, who is making a documentary about M*A*S*H units and visits to the 4077th. After Hawkeye and Trapper sabotage his effort, Bricker abandons the project and leaves. Flanders also played nationally known journalist William Allen White in the 1977 made-for-TV movie Mary White. This movie was based on the famous eulogy White wrote about his daughter after her death in 1922 due to a blow to the head while riding her horse. He also appeared in the 1979 made-for-TV-horror-miniseries Salem's Lot as Dr. Bill Norton. He also played news anchor John Woodley in the 1983 made-for-TV suspense drama Special Bulletin, about a group of environmentalists who threaten to detonate a nuclear weapon in Charleston, South Carolina.  Later life and death  After three divorces, chronic pain from a back injury sustained in automobile accident in 1989, and a lifelong battle with depression, Flanders died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on February 22, 1995, in Denny, California at the age of 60. No suicide note was found, and his remains were cremated.

There are over 300 computers available to be booked. The library offers a Writer-in-Residence program to assist budding authors and has done so for over 20 years. The staff at the library are members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 500. History = Original City of Winnipeg Public Library System = The Winnipeg Public Library began as a public service to city residents in 1905.  Carnegie Branch  Winnipeg's first public library was the Carnegie Library (380 William Ave.), opened in 1905. American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie had funded the construction of three public libraries in the city. All the city had to do was to choose suitable locations. The main branch would be located downtown. The Free Press asked their readers in May 1902 where they'd prefer to locate the Carnegie branch. The top responses were: Ellice Ave. at Smith St., former Trinity Hall (Portage and Garry), Central Park, Victoria Park, and Market site of City Hall Square. After the site on William Avenue had been chosen, the architect chosen to design the building was Samuel Hooper. The Carnegie branch had been under construction in 1904 when it was described in a Free Press article as \\"most pretentious of our civic buildings…There are not many buildings with an all-[lime]stone exterior. Hitherto, such buildings have been considered too expensive for the city.\\" The Library was officially opened in October 12, 1905 by Lady Evelyn, Earl Grey, daughter of the Governor General of Canada. The branch was closed after the Centennial Library opened in the spring of1977. It subsequently re-opened as a library for new immigrants wanting to learn English. Later on, it was used to store and provide access to the city's archival records. In 2013 while the roof was being repaired, a hole had let water seep inside the building from a heavy rainstorm, damaging a portion of the archive. As at May 2018, the City had not yet decided what to do with the now damaged building — repair it and move the archives back into the building or sell it to a developer. The worst case scenario would have the building demolished for something newer.  River Heights Branch  Two potential sites had been considered for a new River Heights branch, budgeted at $70,000, in May of 1958, serving the new and growing subdivision of Winnipeg. The city's Library Committee had preferred the Corydon at Ash St. location next to a football field or by purchasing a property worth $15,000 on Corydon at Niagara, while the Recreation Committee preferred it on Haskins (now Grosvenor) Avenue, next to River Heights School. A large delegation appeared before the city's Recreation Committee on June 18 1958 opposing putting the River Heights Library at the corner of Corydon and Ash. They said it would decrease the amount of space for sports. The next day the Recreation Committee, due to public pressure from the Community Club, voted against the Corydon at Ash site.By April 1960 a firm decision on the site was made. It would be located next to Brock-Corydon elementary school and would now cost $75,000. The new River Heights branch opened to the public on September 1, 1961. The final cost of construction was $77,500. In that month, 1,500 new memberships were created and book circulation in the River Heights area grew to 17,600. In July 1968 the City of Winnipeg purchased a new bookmobile for $10,000, because the library committee had stated that the current vehicle was so dilapidated that it might not last till the end of the year. Earlier in the 2010s, it was determined that the 1961 era River Heights branch had reached \\"end of life\\". Various locations were sought, one of them at the corner of Nathaniel and Taylor which was not found suitable. Later on the final decision was made to locate the new River Heights branch at the corner of Nathaniel and Grant Avenue and to name it the Bill and Helen Norrie Library. A groundbreaking took place on October 29, 2019. = St. James Public Library = On February 7, 1958 the new $60,000 St. James Library opened its doors to the public, at the time the first new library building in Manitoba to be built since the mid-1910s. The Lions Club of St. James contributed a portion of the cost of the new construction. Prior to the new building, the St. James Public Library had been housed in one room of St. James Collegiate (next door) since 1955. The current size of the Library is , making it one of the largest in the WPL system.

Some judges and members of upper chambers (e.g., senators for life) have life tenure. The primary goal of life tenure is to insulate the officeholder from external pressures. Certain heads of state, such as monarchs and Presidents for Life, are also given life tenure.

Prattville in Autauga County, and Birmingham's Pratt City in Jefferson County (on the Pratt coal seam) are both named for him. He is buried in Pratt Cemetery, located on top of Ginshop Hill near downtown Prattville, Alabama. Pratt was born in Temple, New Hampshire. He left New England in 1819 after earning a release from an architect apprenticeship that he started at age 16. He sailed for Savannah, Georgia and within two years moved to Milledgeville, Georgia. There he became a successful architect- builder and was a leader in his trade in the South by 1827. While in Georgia he met Samuel Griswold, another New Englander, who manufactured cotton gins. He had Pratt manage his factory and within a year Pratt had been promoted to partner. Pratt urged Griswold to expand into Alabama. Griswold agreed to the venture at first, but later decided against it due to conflicts there between settlers and Native Americans. Pratt decided to go it alone, and moved to central Alabama in 1833 with his wife, two slaves, and enough materials to construct 50 gins. He relocated to an area known as McNeil's Mill and leased land along a creek in Autauga County in 1836, where he began manufacturing cotton gins. He moved further up the creek, bought , and built a permanent cotton gin factory in 1838. He founded the new town of Prattville for the workers in his venture. This operation quickly became the largest producer of cotton gins in the world, and Alabama's first major industry. As his business grew, he branched out with a sawmill, gristmill, window factory, iron foundry, woollen mill, railroad, bank, and the Oxmoor Blast Furnace in Birmingham. Pratt's businesses were badly affected by the American Civil War, as many of his workers joined the military and his customer base shrank as the economy soured. Much credit is given Pratt's efforts for easing Alabama's economic recovery during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. His ability to call in debts on Northern accounts allowed him to rebuild his own operations, which helped make Autauga County exceptionally stable and prosperous in the period immediately after the war. It was his backing which opened the Birmingham District to its initial development as an iron-making center. One of Pratt's slaves, Charles Atwood, purchased a house in the center of Prattville immediately after emancipation and became one of the founding investors in his former master's railroad ventures. The presence of a respected middle-class black family in the center of a 19th-century Southern city was exceptional. References * Tarrant, Mrs. S. F. H., editor, Hon.

Kaiser. The town is located at the entrance of the now-defunct Eagle Mountain iron mine, once owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad, then Kaiser Steel, and located on the southeastern corner of Joshua Tree National Park. The town's fully integrated medical care system, similar to other Kaiser operations in California, was the genesis of the modern-day Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization.Rickey Hendricks, A Model for National Health Care: The History of Kaiser Permanente (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1993), , 13-26 Eagle Mountain is accessible by Riverside County Route R2, twelve miles (19 km) north of Desert Center, midway between Indio and the California/Arizona state line along Interstate 10. History Founded in 1948 by Kaiser Steel Corporation, Eagle Mountain is located at the entrance of the now-defunct Eagle Mountain iron mine. As the mine expanded, Eagle Mountain grew to a peak population of 4000. It had wide, landscaped streets lined with over four hundred homes, some with as many as four bedrooms. Two hundred trailer spaces and several boarding houses and dormitories provided living space for Kaiser's itinerant workforce. Other amenities included an auditorium, a park, a shopping center, a community swimming pool, lighted tennis courts, and a baseball diamond. Businesses included a bowling alley, two gas stations, eight churches and three schools. In the late 1930s, Kaiser decided to build the West Coast's first fully integrated steel mill. In 1942, Kaiser built such a mill at Fontana, California, which is located 112 miles (180 km) west of the Eagle Mountain Mine. Today the Fontana mill site includes other successor mills and the Auto Club Speedway (formerly the California Speedway). Kaiser then purchased the idle mines from the Southern Pacific as a source of high-grade iron ore. This was a contingent strategy Kaiser used to utilize rail and raw materials for an industrial operation in a previously agricultural (pig farm) area. Production at Fontana was initiated during World War II, increased iron shipments began in 1948, and a mining town was constructed below what was soon to become Southern California's largest iron mine. It connected to the Southern Pacific via a 51-mile-long (82 km) railroad branch known as the Eagle Mountain Railroad. It ran southwest from the mine to the northeast shore of the Salton Sea, just north of the Riverside–Imperial county line. Ore shipments to Fontana steel plant began in October, with five to eight 100-car trains running weekly. The mine's 100 millionth ton of iron ore shipped was commemorated in a ceremony on August 17, 1977. End times Increased environmental concerns in the 1970s and a stiff foreign competition led to a reduction in iron output and a drop in population to a low of 1980. In the summer of 1980 the mine shut down briefly, reopening on September 23. Only 750 workers were brought back to the town with an additional 150 (with uncertain employment futures) in Indio, some 60 miles (97 km) west. On November 3, 1981, Kaiser Corporation announced the phasing out of half the Fontana works and the entire Eagle Mountain Mine operation over several years. The population dwindled as layoffs began. The grocery store closed in October 1982 and the post office, which had been active since 1951, closed in 1983. In June of that year the last official graduating class celebrated their commencement at Eagle Mountain High School, followed by closing of both the mine and mill. The old high school is now the current site of Eagle Mountain Elementary School, which continues in operation (as of 2019). The ZIP code was 92241 until Eagle Mountain shut down, mail is now sent to nearby Desert Center at 92239. The community is within area codes 442 and 760. Resurgence Eagle Mountain experienced a resurgence in 1986 when the California Department of Corrections proposed placing a unique privately operated prison for low-risk inmates in the town. The shopping center was converted by 1988 into the Eagle Mountain Community Correctional Facility, which operated until state budget problems and a fatal riot led to the closing of the prison in December 2003. Talks resumed in 2005 to reopen the prison facility. 1988 also saw a proposal to turn the gigantic 1.5-mile-long (2.4 km) by half-mile-wide (800 m) open-pit mine into a massive, high-tech sanitary landfill. The landfill, to be operated by a partnership of two privately operated trash collection firms and the successor to Kaiser Steel, Kaiser Ventures, would ship trash by train from metropolitan Los Angeles area via the Eagle Mountain Railroad. A company subsidiary, Mine Reclamation Corp. of Palm Desert, is the landfill developer. Due to numerous lawsuits regarding the environmental effects of the landfill, the project was repeatedly delayed. The private partnership decided in late 1999 to terminate the project. Their share of the project was bought by Kaiser Ventures, making it controlling owner of the project. The Riverside County Board of Supervisors approved the project in October 1992 after EPA approval of the project. In August 2000, Kaiser Ventures reached an agreement with the Los Angeles Sanitation District (LASD – a public entity comprising several public waste collection agencies), to purchase the landfill project as a replacement for the Puente Hills Landfill, which would be nearing the end of its useful life. Trash was to be shipped by rail from the Los Angeles area via the abandoned Eagle Mountain Railroad line. However, the sale agreement states that all lawsuits and claims regarding the project were to be resolved. As of 2008, there was one lawsuit pending. However, much has changed in the waste business since 2000. A reduction in waste generated because of recycling has reduced the urgency for the new landfill. In addition, the Los Angeles Sanitation District purchased another landfill site in Imperial County. In May 2013, the LASD discontinued plans to convert the Eagle Mountain mine into a landfill. The Eagle Mountain mine is currently the location of a proposed 1300 MW hydroelectric plant by Eagle Crest Energy. The company agreed to buy the land from CIL&D; (the new name of Kaiser Ventures) in July 2015. The Eagle Mountain Pumped Storage Project would pump groundwater from the Chuckwalla Valley aquifer into two reservoirs comprising former mining pits, where water would be pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir during low electricity demand, and pumped back down through turbines during high electricity demand. In November 2016, NextEra Energy announced their partnership with Eagle Crest in the project. The project is praised by supporters for the purpose of bringing more renewable energy in California, while also being criticized by environmentalists for potential damages to plant and animal life in and around Joshua Tree National Park. As of July 18, 2007, the town of Eagle Mountain is no longer openly accessible. The perimeters of both the town and mine have been fenced and gated, with a site manager appointed to handle access requests. Schools The Desert Center Unified School District at one time operated four schools in the Eagle Mountain and Desert Center areas. Eagle Mountain Elementary School was located in the center of the town, Henry J. Kaiser Junior High School and Eagle Mountain High School were located on the east and Desert Center Elementary School was located in Desert Center, 11 miles away. The class of 1983 was the last to graduate from Eagle Mountain High School. In 1983, the school district converted the high school into the Eagle Mountain Elementary School, in operation since 1983, educating students in the grades kindergarten through 8th grade. The remaining three school sites were closed and boarded up. Local high school students are bused to Palo Verde High School in Blythe, California, making the 120-mile round trip every day. The remaining students in the school district are children of the few full-time residents of Desert Center and children of the employees of the two nearby Metropolitan Water District pumping plants. In popular culture =Film= A portion of the Eagle Mountain Railroad was used in the filming of the 1986 movie Tough Guys in a scene wherein a train is hijacked - pulled by famed locomotive Southern Pacific 4449 - and run full throttle to the Mexican border. During the filming of the exterior shots of Southern Pacific 4449, the train was stored nightly at the Eagle Mountain rail yards. The local school children from Eagle Mountain School took a field trip in early 1986 to see and tour the train on the location of the shoot along the Eagle Mountain Railroad south of Interstate 10. Also filmed on Eagle Mountain was Terminator 2:3D. The 3D film was made for a Universal Studios theme park attraction and is an action sequence based on the original Terminator 2 – Judgment Day movie. Universal Studios in Los Angeles premiered its version of the Terminator 2 3D ride in 1999. The ride is also at Universal's Orlando, Florida, location. The entire crew spent weeks at Eagle Mountain. Other films using Eagle Mountain locations include :* The Professionals (1966) :* Impostor (2001) :* Live from Baghdad (2002) :* Constantine (2003) :* The Island (2005) :* Unknown (2006) :* Battle of Los Angeles (2011) :* Video Game High School (2012) :* Tenet (2020) =Television= Top Gear USA has used Eagle Mountain twice so far. In season 2's third episode, \\"America's Strongest Pickup,\\" Eagle Mountain was used for the final challenge including pulling down a house. The final challenge in the 13th episode of Top Gear USA third season was staged at Eagle Mountain. Entitled 'Doomsday Drive,' Eagle Mountain served as a stand-in for a post- apocalyptic setting.

He was Minister of Defense between the victory of the Sandinista revolution in 1979 under the National Reconstruction Government, through the first presidency of his brother Daniel Ortega, and through the presidency of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro who defeated Daniel Ortega in the elections of 1990. Biography Humberto Ortega, his brother, the current President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, and Victor Tirado López founded the Tercerista tendency of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1975. He, among others leaders, crafted the urban insurrection strategy that ignited civil war in Nicaragua in October 1977 which led to the fall of the Somoza dynastic dictatorship in July 1979. As Minister of Defense during the decade of Sandinista rule, Ortega oversaw the buildup of the Sandinista Popular Army (EPS) and the prosecution of the war against the \\"contra\\" resistance factions and their peasant support base. Following the electoral defeat of Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Party in 1990, Humberto maintained control of the military. Later that year accusations arose against Humberto claiming his involvement in the murder and cover up of sixteen-year- old Jean Paul. Ortega's bodyguards allegedly shot and killed the young man when he attempted to pass the generals motorcade on October 28, 1990. In November 1990 the Nicuraugan National Assembly along with experts from the Venisualan Ministry of Justice began an investigation of this incident. Most of the evidence found by the investigators proved to be circumstantial and the travel records for the motorcade were never found. Civil District Judge Boanerges Ojeda suggested Ortega's bodyguards, two officers, and Humberto be tried in court before he passed the case to the military prosecutors office where it was closed in July 1992. He retired in 1995, turning the job over to his second in command, Joaquín Cuadra. General Humberto Ortega started transforming the EPS into the non-political Nicaraguan National Army. Allegedly, he was behind the assassination of many retired anti-sandinistas rebels.https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/16/opinion/assassins-in-managua.html This allegation has not been put forward by any legal authority inside or outside of Nicaragua. Published writer In December 2004 he released a book titled La Epopeya de la Insurrección (Epic of the Insurrection). Ortega says he worked 10 hours a day on the book for two years using his own records, meeting notes, archives and analytical schemes to reconstruct the history of the struggle that ultimately brought down the 43-year Somoza family dictatorship. Among his other books are, 50 Años de Lucha Sandinista, Sobre la Insurrección and Nicaragua Revolución y Democracia. =Works= *A diez años de la rendición total de la guardia somocista (1989). *Sobre la insurrección (1981). *50 años de lucha sandinista (1978). *La Epopeya de la Insurrección (2004). *Nicaragua (1992). *Sobre la insurrección (1981). *Insurrección y Nicaragua Revolución *Democracia de Sobre.

MSA exists to enrich and expand gifted education for individual students and gifted programs. MSA is a member of the National Conference of Governor's Schools. Missouri Scholars Academy should not be confused with the Missouri Student Association, with which it shares an acronym. History Missouri Scholars Academy began in 1985, and has been held every year since. Each year is represented by a distinct pair of colors to identify its participants beyond their time at the Academy. The flags of each MSA year (1985-2006). Classes Participating scholars attend a \\"major\\" and \\"minor\\" class for three hours and one and one half hours per day, respectively, during the program. These classes are usually college level or experimental. Past MSAs have featured unique classes covering topics such as Japanese language and culture, Intelligence & Counterintelligence, Game Theory, Time travel, Infinity, Terrorism & Counterterrorism, Education, Philosophy, Biology, Physics, Neurology, The Constitution, Censorship, current events, spelunking, creative writing, and art. Participants are encouraged to choose classes of different disciplines, as one of the primary focuses of the program is to promote academic diversity and the expansion of interests in its Scholars.  Programming  = Afternoon Activities = After minor classes end, multiple extracurricular activities are offered to continue activity and learning for scholars. Activities include, but are assuredly not limited to: Scrabble Tournaments, math and logic puzzles, lectures and discussions, conducting lessons, yoga, African drumming and song, and other multidisciplinary and contemporary programs. Notable guests of the Academy include motivational speaker Kevin Wanzer and harpist Maria Duhova.  Traditions  = Alumni Day = Alumni of Missouri Scholars Academy (scholars who have gone through the program) are invited back to participate in activities, including Afternoon Activities, on a weekend day during the Academy. A dance occurs; current scholars and alumni are invited. = Teacher Appreciation Day = Scholars are asked to invite influential teachers from their home high school to visit Missouri Scholars Academy for a day. Teachers are invited to attend Afternoon Activities, dinner, and Evening Programming. Residency Participating scholars have in years past stayed in assigned rooms at the Mark Twain Residence Hall. Due to Mark Twain renovations, the academy was held in Wolpers and Johnston halls in 2012, and Hawthorn and Galena halls in 2013. In 2014, Scholars were moved back into Mark Twain after renovations were completed the previous fall. Scholars are separated by gender to different floors and given a roommate. Students are not allowed on floors of the opposite gender. Residential Assistants are also assigned to monitor and work with 16-22 scholars each. Meetings occur every night between Residential Assistants and Scholars to discuss upcoming events, rules reminders, and general questions scholars may have. Procedures =The Name Tag= For safety reasons, scholars are required to wear their name tag at all times when they are not on their floor of the residence hall. Name tags must be displayed on the upper torso.  Funding  Funding for the Academy varies from year to year. The state of Missouri has budgeted money for Missouri Scholars Academy and Missouri Fine Arts Academy in the past but it has fluctuated for both programs. Philanthropic donation to Missouri Scholars Academy are accepted and are tax-deductible . The Gifted Association of Missouri also is a regular contributor to funding to the Academy.

Structure Odontoblasts are large columnar cells, whose cell bodies are arranged along the interface between dentin and pulp, from the crown to cervix to the root apex in a mature tooth. The cell is rich in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, especially during primary dentin formation, which allows it to have a high secretory capacity; it first forms the collagenous matrix to form predentin, then mineral levels to form the mature dentin. Odontoblasts form approximately 4 μm of predentin daily during tooth development.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 170 During secretion after differentiation from the outer cells of the dental papilla, it is noted that it is polarized so its nucleus is aligned away from the newly formed dentin, with its Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum towards the dentin reflecting its unidirectional secretion. Thus with the formation of primary dentin, the cell moves pulpally, away from the basement membrane (future dentinoenamel junction) at the interface between the inner enamel epithelium and dental papilla, leaving behind the odontoblastic process within the pulp. The odontoblastic cell body keeps its tapered structure with cytoskeletal fibres, mainly intermediate filaments. Unlike cartilage and bone, as well as cementum, the odontoblast's cell body does not become entrapped in the product; rather, one long, cytoplasmic attached extension remains behind in the formed dentin. The differentiation of the odontoblast is done by signaling molecules and growth factors in the cells of the inner enamel epithelium. Like enamel, dentin is avascular. Nutrition for odontoblasts within the dentin comes through the dentinal tubules from tissue fluid that originally traveled from the blood vessels located in the adjacent pulp tissue. Within each dentinal tubule is a space of variable size containing dentinal fluid, an odontoblastic process, and possibly an afferent axon (see next discussion). The dentinal fluid in the tubule presumably also includes the tissue fluid surrounding the cell membrane of the odontoblast, which is continuous from the cell body in the pulp. It has been shown that odontoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix protein reelin. A pulpal A-delta (noxious, short sharp pain) nerve fibre is either wrapped around the base of this process, or travels a short way into the dentinal tubule with the odontoblast process (max ~0.1 mm) This process lies in the dentinal tubule. In an erupted tooth, this process rarely extends beyond 1/3 the depth of the dentin, which is why the odontoblast transduction theory of dentinal hypersensivity is unlikely. =Development= Odontoblasts first appear at sites of tooth development at 17–18 weeks in utero and remain present until death unless killed by bacterial or chemical attack, or indirectly through other means such as heat or trauma (e.g. during dental procedures). Odontoblasts were originally the outer cells of the dental papilla. Thus, dentin and pulp tissue have similar embryological backgrounds, because both are originally derived from the dental papilla of the tooth germ.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 156 Function # To aid in the secretion of intertubular and peritubular dentin (the dentin surrounding odontoblastic process) that forms the dentinal tubule, which further organizes and strengthens the dentin as a whole # General maintenance of both the dentinal tubule and dentinal fluid (ion/protein content etc.) # To channel hydrokinetic forces of water movement to the A delta fibre wrapped around its base, maintaining its sensitivity # To secrete sclerotic dentin upon carious attack to block off dentinal tubules, slowing the progress of the attack (air space above blockage is known as a dead tract) # To channel signals of attack to the odontoblastic cell body, thus initiating secretion of reactionary dentin The odontoblasts secrete dentin throughout life, unlike enamel, which is considered secondary dentin once root formation is complete, which may be an attempt to compensate for natural wear of the enamel. This is because of the retention of the odontoblasts within the tooth, along the outer pulpal wall. Odontoblasts also secrete tertiary dentin when irritated. Tertiary dentin secreted by odontoblasts is often due to chemical attack, either by chemicals diffusing through the dentin and insulting the odontoblasts, or by diffusion of toxic bacterial metabolites down the dentinal tubules in the instance of a carious attack with dental decay. This tertiary dentin is called reactionary dentin. This is an attempt to slow down the progress of the caries so that it does not reach the pulp. In the case of an infection breaching the dentin to or very near the pulp, or in the instance of odontoblast death due to other attack (e.g. chemical or physical), undifferentiated mesenchymal cells can differentiate into odontoblast-like cells which then secrete another type, reparative dentin, underneath the site of attack. This is not only to slow the progress of the attack, but also prevents the diffusion of bacteria and their metabolites into the pulp, reducing the probability of partial pulp necrosis. The distinction of the two kinds of tertiary dentin is important, because they are secreted by different cells for different reasons. Reactionary dentin is secreted at varying speeds, dependent on the speed of progression of caries in the outer dentin surface. Histologically, it is easily distinguishable by its disordered tube structure, the location of the secretion (it protrudes into the pulpal cavity) and its slightly lower degree of mineralization than normal.

During this time he reportedly formed a close relationship with former Xinjiang governors Seyfuddin Eziz and Ismail Emet and was involved in the translation of Eziz's works. Tohti began studying for his PhD at Tokyo University's School of Humanities in Japan in 1995, specializing in Uyghur history and ethnic relations. He has reportedly published several papers on Uyghur history in Japan and has published a book in Beijing. Arrest Tohti was first arrested by Chinese authorities on February 6, 1998, a few weeks into a trip to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for research purposes. His only proven \\"crime\\" appears to be that of obtaining and copying part of a 50-year-old document for his research with the help of an official librarian, which the authorities claimed was \\"stealing state secrets.\\" According to Amnesty International an article published in the January 2001 issue of China's national security newsletter, Tohti Tunyaz “turned his back on his homeland” by going to Japan to study for his PhD, where he “came under the influence of western liberal thinking” and “engaged in Xinjiang minority splittist activities”. Trial On November 10, 1998, Chinese authorities charged Tohti with \\"stealing state secrets for foreign persons\\" and \\"inciting national disunity,\\" the latter charge allegedly for publishing a book in Japan in 1998 entitled The Inside Story of the Silk Road. According to the Chinese government the book advocates ethnic separation; scholars in Japan, however, insist no such book exists. He was convicted by the Ürümqi Intermediate People's Court on March 10, 1999, and following an appeal, was sentenced by China's Supreme Court on February 15, 2000 to 11 years in prison with an additional two years' deprivation of political rights. =Views against the Court Decision= The court decision was based on the supposition that the defendant intended to publish a book in Japanese for the purpose of instigating national disunity, and made copies of confidential documents at Urmuchi in order to leak them to foreigners. However, according to the decision handed down at Urumchi in August 1999, neither the book nor its manuscript was submitted to the court as evidence. As far as his teachers and colleagues know, Tohti wrote no such book in Japan. As to leaking confidential documents, Tohti received copies from a librarian after he had been given permission from the authorities to do so. Furthermore, the foreigner who was alleged to have received the documents was never identified at the trial. Consequently, it can be concluded that the decision was based on a misrepresentation of the facts concerning Tohti's scholarly activities. His real and only intention was to collect source materials in order to complete his doctoral thesis dealing with the modern history of the Uyghur people. Current status Tohti served his 11-year sentence in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Prison No. 3 in the provincial capital of Ürümqi, and according to English language reports, he was released from prison on February 10, 2009. According to his friends and supporters in Japan: 1) After his release, he was taken to Beijing to serve the additional two-year sentence (until February 2011) of deprivation of political rights under the strict surveillance of local authorities. 2) Although technically \\"a free man\\" and therefore free to return to Japan to continue his studies (where the University of Tokyo still considers him as a matriculating student), the Chinese government has stopped issuing passports to Uyghurs under its jurisdiction. 3) Today Tohti earns a living as a language adviser for the English language edition of a Chinese magazine, while making efforts to recover his research from the shambles in which he found it after his release from prison. It is unknown whether his wife, a Japanese citizen, and children are with him or not. Hopefully so. In December 2001, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an official opinion declaring Mr. Tohti to be arbitrarily detained. Tohti was honoured in 2002 with a PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award.

Sometimes also used as a gaslight term to shift blame onto a victim (no longer a victim but a \\"martyr\\"). In some cases, this results from the belief that the martyr has been singled out for persecution because of exceptional ability or integrity. Theologian Paul Johnson considers such beliefs a topic of concern for the mental health of clergy. Other martyr complexes involve willful suffering in the name of love or duty. This has been observed in women, especially in poor families, as well as in codependent or abusive relationships. The desire for martyrdom is sometimes considered a form of masochism. Allan Berger, however, described it as one of several patterns of \\"pain/suffering seeking behavior\\", including asceticism and penance.

Dentinogenesis is performed by odontoblasts, which are a special type of biological cell on the outer wall of dental pulps, and it begins at the late bell stage of a tooth development. The different stages of dentin formation after differentiation of the cell result in different types of dentin: mantle dentin, primary dentin, secondary dentin, and tertiary dentin. Odontoblast differentiation Odontoblasts differentiate from cells of the dental papilla. This is an expression of signaling molecules and growth factors of the inner enamel epithelium (IEE).Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 170 Formation of mantle dentin They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the IEE, closest to the area of the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1-0.2 μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move toward the center of the tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix (mineralisation occurs due to matrix vesicles). This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 20-150 μm thick. Formation of primary dentin Whereas mantle dentin forms from the preexisting ground substance of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted. There is some dispute about the control of mineralization during dentinogenesis.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 173 The dentin in the root of a tooth forms only after the presence of Hertwig epithelial root sheath (HERS), near the cervical loop of the enamel organ. Root dentin is considered different from dentin found in the crown of the tooth (known as coronal dentin) because of the different orientation of collagen fibers, as well as the possible decrease of phosphophoryn levels and less mineralization.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 174 Maturation of dentin or mineralization of predentin occurs soon after its apposition, which takes place two phases: primary and secondary. Initially, the calcium hydroxyapatite crystals form as globules, or calcospherules, in the collagen fibers of the predentin, which allows for both the expansion and fusion during the primary mineralization phase. Later, new areas of mineralization occur as globules form in the partially mineralized predentin during the secondary mineralization phase. These new areas of crystal formation are more or less regularly layered on the initial crystals, allowing them to expand, although they fuse incompletely. In areas where both primary and secondary mineralization have occurred with complete crystalline fusion, these appear as lighter rounded areas on a stained section of dentin and are considered globular dentin. In contrast, the darker arclike areas in a stained section of dentin are considered interglobular dentin. In these areas, only primary mineralization has occurred within the predentin, and the globules of dentin do not fuse completely. Thus, interglobular dentin is slightly less mineralized than globular dentin. Interglobular dentin is especially evident in coronal dentin, near the DEJ, and in certain dental anomalies, such as in dentin dysplasia.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 156-157 Formation of secondary dentin Secondary dentin is formed after root formation is finished and occurs at a much slower rate. It is not formed at a uniform rate along the tooth, but instead forms faster along sections closer to the crown of a tooth. This development continues throughout life and accounts for the smaller areas of pulp found in older individuals. Formation of tertiary dentin Tertiary dentin is deposited at specific sites in response to injury by odontoblasts or replacement odontoblasts from the pulp depending on the severity of the injury. Tertiary dentin can be divided into reactionary or reparative dentin. Reactionary dentin is formed by odontoblasts when the injury does not damage the odontoblast layer. Reparative dentin is formed by replacement odontoblasts when the injury is so severe that it damages a part of the primary odontoblast layer. Thus a type of tertiary dentin forms in reaction to stimuli, such as attrition or dental caries.

In Eastern philosophy The concept of Maya in the non-dual Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism is a form of acosmism. Maya means \\"illusion, appearances\\".PD Shastri, The Doctrine of Maya Luzac & Co, London, page 3S. Radhakrishnan, The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul., 1914), pages 431-451 The universe is considered to be Māyā, however this does not mean the universe is considered as unreal. Wendy Doniger explains, \\"to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge to things that are epistemologically and ontologically second-rate.\\"Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, , page 119 In the Vedanta school of Hinduism, the perceived world is Maya that hides the Absolute and Ultimate Reality (Brahman).Donald Braue (2006), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 19-21 The human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the \\"perceived world including people are not what they appear to be, there is more to them than their perceived physical forms\\".HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, , pages 122-123 Māyā is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false duality (or divisional plurality). This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles, primarily that the individual Self (Soul) is the same as the Self in others and the Self in everything (Brahman).PD Shastri, The Doctrine of Maya Luzac & Co, London, page 58-73 Advaita Vedanta school is best described as monistic, absolute idealism, while Dvaita Vedanta school as pluralistic idealism.Edward Craig (1998), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, , pages 197-198 Both have elements of ontological acosmism, where the material aspect of cosmos is considered an \\"illusion, appearance, incomplete reality\\" compared to that \\"which is spiritual, eternal, unchanging\\". In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: Vyavaharika (empirical reality) and Paramarthika (absolute, spiritual reality).Frederic F. Fost (1998), Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405 Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Absolute, Cosmic Soul) is held by Advaitins as the metaphysical truth. The perceived world, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not considered by Vedantins as the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is \\"untrue\\" in spiritual context of Brahman. True Reality, to Advaita scholars, includes both Vyavaharika (empirical) and Paramarthika (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize one's soul as same as Cosmic Soul (Brahman), realize the eternal, fearless, resplendent Oneness.Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86 Advaita Hinduism and Buddhism have both been called as examples of acosmism.Eduard von Hartmann, LP Jack, Other scholars state Buddhism cannot be accurately classified as a philosophy based on acosmism,Encyclopedia of World Religions, Encyclopædia Britannica (1986), page 9, (2006 Reprint) and that Advaita Vedanta is not acosmism either.PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, , page 409 In Western philosophy Acosmism has been seen in the work of a number of Western philosophers, including Parmenides, Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and British and American idealists, such as F.H. Bradley.Stace, W.T. (1952). Time and Eternity, Princeton University Press. p.122.Nicholson, Hugh. (2011) Comparative Theology and the Problem of Religious Rivalry, OUP. p.118 The word acosmism is often traced to Hegel who used it in his discussion of the philosophy of religion, in particular his understanding of pantheism and refutation of the charge that Spinoza was an atheist.OED Acosmism entry.Inwood, M.J. (2002) Hegel, Psychology Press. . pp.232-233Beiser, Frederick. (2005). Hegel, Routledge. . pp.143-144 Hegel explains that for Spinoza it is the infinite 'substance' which is real, while the finite world does not exist. \\"But the accusers of Spinozism are unable to liberate themselves from the finite; hence they declare for Spinozism everything is God, because it is precisely the aggregate of finitudes (the world) that has there disappeared. If one employs the expression \\"All is One\\" and [claims] therefore that unity is the truth of multiplicity, then the \\"all\\" simply is no longer. The multiplicity vanishes, for it has its truth in the unity.\\"Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. Hodgson, Peter C. Ed. (2006) Hegel: Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion: One-Volume Edition, The Lectures of 1827, OUP. . pp.28-29 & 123-126 W.T. Stace sees all philosophical acosmism as rooted in the mystical experience, whether or not the authors are aware of this. Stace points out that most Western philosophers tend to a form of qualified acosmism, where the world is less real rather than utterly illusory. He sees two mystical sources of acosmism from within the eternal moment, firstly the mystical moment contains all eternity and infinity and thus there is nothing outside it, and secondly because the eternal moment is experienced as the supreme value.Stace.

Speed of transmutation varies greatly by nuclide, and percentages are relative to total transmutation and decay. After removal of fuel from reactor, decay will predominate for shorter-lived isotopes such as 238Pu, 241Pu, 242–244Cm; but 245–248Cm are all long-lived. Fertile material is a material that, although not itself fissionable by thermal neutrons, can be converted into a fissile material by neutron absorption and subsequent nuclei conversions. Naturally occurring fertile materials Naturally occurring fertile materials that can be converted into a fissile material by irradiation in a reactor include: *thorium-232 which converts into uranium-233 *uranium-234 which converts into uranium-235 *uranium-238 which converts into plutonium-239 Artificial isotopes formed in the reactor which can be converted into fissile material by one neutron capture include: *plutonium-238 which converts into plutonium-239 *plutonium-240 which converts into plutonium-241 Some other actinides need more than one neutron capture before arriving at an isotope which is both fissile and long-lived enough to probably be able to capture another neutron and fission instead of decaying. *plutonium-242 to americium-243 to curium-244 to curium-245 *uranium-236 to neptunium-237 to plutonium-238 to plutonium-239 *americium-241 to curium-242 to curium-243 (or, more likely, curium-242 decays to plutonium-238, which also requires one additional neutron to reach a fissile nuclide) Since these require a total of 3 or 4 thermal neutrons to eventually fission, and a thermal neutron fission generates only about 2 to 3 neutrons, these nuclides represent a net loss of neutrons. In a fast reactor, they may require fewer neutrons to achieve fission, as well as producing more neutrons when they do fission. Fissile materials from fertile materials A fast-neutron reactor, meaning one with little or no neutron moderator and hence utilising fast neutrons, can be configured as a breeder reactor, producing more fissile material than it consumes, using fertile material in a blanket around the core, or contained in special fuel rods. Since plutonium-238, plutonium-240 and plutonium-242 are fertile, accumulation of these and other nonfissile isotopes is less of a problem than in thermal reactors, which cannot burn them efficiently. Breeder reactors using thermal-spectrum neutrons are only practical if the thorium fuel cycle is used, as uranium-233 fissions far more reliably with thermal neutrons than plutonium-239. Applications Proposed applications for fertile material includes a space-based facility for the manufacture of fissile material for spacecraft nuclear propulsion. The facility would notionally transport fertile materials from Earth, safely through the atmosphere, and locate them at a space facility at the Earth–Moon L1 Lagrangian point where manufacture of fissile material would occur, eliminating the safety risk of transport of fissile materials from Earth.

The game is based around packs of werewolves battling each other and various evil monsters while trying to save the world. Product information =White Wolf= Rage had five sets of cards: * Limited/Unlimited * Umbra * Wyrm * War of the Amazon * Legacy of the Tribes The game was discontinued by White Wolf after Legacy and the license sold to Five Rings Publishing Group (FRPG). =Five Rings= FRPG produced a new version of the game with the same card backs and set in the same world, but with completely different mechanics making it incompatible with the first version of the game. The second version of the game had seven card sets. The first 6 were numbered and released once a month. They were known as Phase 1 through 6. The final set, Equinox, combined together three of the smaller numbered sets (7-9) into one larger set. =Various producers= FRPG was bought out by Wizards of the Coast (the makers of Magic: The Gathering), who were in turn bought out by Hasbro. Hasbro discontinued many of the games it had acquired in the take over, including Rage. The license for the game lapsed back to White Wolf. Azrael Productions, who produced an online magazine, acquired permission from White Wolf to provide tournament support for both versions of Rage. However, Azrael was unable to acquire the license to bring Rage back into print. While under Azrael's care, there were two notable developments. The first version of Rage came to be called \\"Rage: Apocalypse\\" and the second version \\"Rage: Tribal War\\" so people would not be confused as to which version people were talking about. Azrael Productions also assembled a group of dedicated fans to start designing new cards for the game. They started playtesting these cards before Azrael eventually abandoned the project. Azrael gave up rights to the partially tested cards, leaving the path clear for the playtesters to produce fan-made sets of cards. The first set of these fan made cards, Intermezzo, was released in 2003. A total of five fan made sets for Rage: Apocalypse (Intermezzo, Periphery, Gauntlet, and Coda. They are collectively known as the New England Block. War Council is the fifth set and starts the Ahadi block.) and two for Tribal War (Web of Deceit and Christmas Present '04) have been released since then. The cards are hosted on the official Rage site, River Von, but are considered legitimate by White Wolf and are allowed in regular tournaments and for use in online play. They are not hosted on the main White Wolf server due to copyright issues with the artwork. Online play Rage was available for online play for several years via the gatlingEngine, produced by CCG Workshop. They had a licensing agreement with White Wolf allowing them to develop online versions of White Wolf's CCG properties (Rage, Vampire: the Eternal Struggle, and Arcadia: the Wyld Hunt). That platform is now defunct. Due to complex legal issues, only Rage: Apocalypse is available for online play. Hasbro retains some partial rights to Rage: Tribal War and was unwilling to license it to CCG Workshop. While Rage is currently out of print, it can be played online using a program called LackeyCCG. Instructions on how to get started are at the Rage website. It runs on both PC and Mac and includes all printed cards, all fan sets and sets in playtesting. Changes since online play began A major rules overhaul for Rage's rules was released in March 2006. The update clarified many card interactions and converted rulings about individual cards to global rulings. There was an additional update (Rage's Least Wanted) that errata'd the 18 most broken cards in the game and introduced new rules for Past Lives that returned them to play. November 2006 saw the release of the first set in the Ahadi block, War Council. This set introduced updates to the frenzy rules, Moot and Board Meeting rules, changed when the first combat hand was drawn, and allowed some Prey and Allies access to additional Gifts. War Council also introduced a new Wyrm faction to the game, the Unbound, and made the 7th Generation part of a larger faction, Cults. Additional Gaia and Wyrm factions will be introduced throughout the Ahadi block. September 2007 has a flurry of Rage activity. Rainmakers, the second set in the Ahadi block, was released. It introduced the new Ajaba (werehyena) faction, fleshed out the Pentex Executives and Mokole, and introduced the first of the new Rogue characters. The new Revised rules were introduced. These were largely a reorganization of the old rules book, but also introduced a new timing system. The long overdue rewrite to the rules for Battlefields was also released for Beta testing. Hellcats (2011) introduced the Simba (werelions) and Bagheera (wereleopards) to Rage, as well as the eponymous Hellcats. This mixture of corrupted Caelican and fallen Simba was only briefly mentioned in Apocalypse and Rage expanded significantly on the source material. Curse of Set (2012) introduced a new subfaction of Cults, the vampiric Walid Set. Call of the Sea is a four set block released in 2013 and 2014 with a semi-constructed deck format. It was also intended as a new introductory set for new or returning players which would make it easier to learn the game. Three faction decks and one combat set were released for use in either regular or sealed deck format. Chulorviah introduced a new Cults faction featuring mind controlling squid beasts. (Chulorviah originally appeared in World of Darkness: Blood Dimmed Tides source book). Rokea expanded the shark shapeshifters to a full playable faction. Sea Dogs was a split deck with one captain each for Gaia and WYrm with most of the rest of the characters being Rogues, so would be either Gaia or Wyrm characters depending on which captain you selected for your ship. The combat set works with any of the three decks, but had six cards for each deck that were specially marked as working best with that faction. 2014 also saw rerelease of Least Wanted with a second update to account for additional rules updates and the new sets that had been released in the previous 8 years. 2015 the 20th anniversary rules update was released along and a major overhaul of errata for previous sets was started. Conclave block entered playtesting and the first set of the Conclave block was released at the end of the year. Rise of Kupala expanded the Cults faction to include infernalists. A fan vote was held at end of the year to determine new members of the Silver Pack for the Conclave block. The New England block was revised and remastered in higher quality in 2016.

The Colorado River Delta is the region where the Colorado River flows into the Gulf of California (also known as the Sea of Cortez) in eastern Mexicali Municipality in the north of the state of Baja California in northwesternmost Mexico. The delta is part of a larger geologic region called the Salton Trough. Historically, the interaction of the river's flow and the ocean's tide created a dynamic environment, supporting freshwater, brackish, and saltwater species. Within the delta region, the river split into multiple braided channels and formed a complex estuary and terrestrial ecosystems. The use of water upstream and the accompanying reduction of freshwater flow has resulted in the loss of most of the wetlands of the area, as well as drastic changes to the aquatic ecosystems. However, a scheme is currently in place which aims to rejuvenate the wetlands by releasing a pulse of water down the river delta. Natural history Until the early 20th century, the Colorado River ran free from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado southwest into Mexico, where it flowed into the Gulf of California. Significant quantities of nourishing silt from throughout the Colorado River Basin were carried downstream, creating the vast Colorado River Delta. Prior to the construction of major dams along its route, the Colorado River fed one of the largest desert estuaries in the world. Spread across the northernmost end of the Gulf of California, the Colorado River delta's vast riparian, freshwater, brackish, and tidal wetlands once covered 7,810 km2 (1,930,000 acres) and supported a large population of plant, bird, aquatic, and terrestrial life. Because most of the river's flow reached the delta at that time, its freshwater, silt, and nutrients helped create and sustain a complex system of estuarial wetlands that provided feeding and nesting grounds for birds, and spawning habitat for fish and marine mammals. In contrast to the surrounding Sonoran Desert, the Colorado River delta's abundance was striking. Human history =Early history= Early explorers reported jaguars, beavers, deer, and coyotes in the delta, in addition to the abundance of waterfowl, fish, and other marine and estuary organisms (Spamer, 1990; {Aldo Leopold, 1948}). Early explorers also encountered local people known as the Cucapá, or the people of the river. The Cucapá are descendants of the Yuman-speaking Native Indigenous peoples of the Americas and have inhabited the delta for nearly a thousand years. Spanish explorer Hernando de Alarcón made the first recorded contact with the Cucapá in 1540 and reported seeing many thousands. The Cucapá used the delta floodplain extensively for harvesting Palmer's saltgrass (Distichlis palmeri), a wild grain that grows in salty soil, and for cultivating maize (corn), beans, and squash. =After dam construction= Today, conditions in the delta have changed. Like other desert river deltas, such as the Nile Delta and the Indus River Delta, the Colorado River delta has been greatly altered by human activity. Decades of dam construction and water diversions in the United States and Mexico have reduced the delta to a remnant system of small wetlands and brackish mudflats. As reservoirs filled behind dams and captured floodwaters, freshwater could no longer reach the delta. The construction of Hoover Dam in the 1930s marked the beginning of the modern era for the Colorado River Delta. For six years, as Lake Mead filled behind the dam, virtually no freshwater reached the delta. Even spring flooding was captured. This ecologically devastating event was repeated from 1963 to 1981 as Lake Powell filled behind the Glen Canyon Dam. With these reservoirs now filled, the dams are used to regulate flow so that water can be reliably apportioned among the users of the Colorado River Compact, and its use maximized. Most flood flows can be contained, regulated, and added to the river's capacity to sustain the Western United States' urban centers and agriculture. Floodwaters are released only when the Bureau of Reclamation, the agency managing the dams, predicts flows that exceed the system's capacity for use and storage. The loss of freshwater flows to the delta over the twentieth century has reduced delta wetlands to about 5 percent of their original extent, and non-native species have compromised the ecological health of much of what remains. Stress on ecosystems has allowed invasive plants to out-compete native species along Colorado River riparian areas. Native forests of cottonwood and willow have yielded to sand and mudflats dominated by the nonnative tamarisk (also known as salt cedar), arrow-weed, and iodine bush, a transformation that has decreased the habitat value of the riparian forest. =High flows in 1980s= Full reservoir conditions coupled with a series of flood events throughout the 1980s and early 1990s resulted in flood releases that reached the delta. These flows reestablished an active floodplain and revegetated many areas of the floodplain within irrigation and flood control levels, and helped to reestablish riparian forests. Ecology Part of the Colorado River Delta in Mexico, showing the Ciénega de Santa Clara wetland, formed by accident in the 1970s. The delta supports a variety of wildlife, including several threatened and endangered species. Mexico's Environmental Regulations on Endangered Species lists the following endangered species found in the terrestrial and aquatic regions of the delta (Diario Officiel, 1994): *the desert pupfish, also listed as an endangered species in the U.S., the largest remaining population anywhere is in the Ciénega de Santa Clara \\"As the Colorado River Basin Dries, Can an Accidental Oasis Survive?\\". Arizona Public Media, April 10, 2019 *the Yuma rail, also listed as endangered in the U.S. *the bobcat *the vaquita porpoise, the world's smallest marine cetacean, listed as a species of special concern by the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission. There are thought to be 12 vaquitas left in the world. *the totoaba, now virtually extinct, a steel-blue fish that grows up to 2 m (7 ft) and 136 kg (300 pounds), and once supported a commercial fishery that closed in 1975 (Postel et al., n.d.). * the Colorado delta clam, once an extremely abundant species and important in the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. Although not extensively studied, the delta's significance for migratory birds is indisputable, as it is the principal freshwater marsh in the region. A total of 358 bird species have been documented in the Colorado River Delta and the upper Gulf of California region. From these, two are listed as endangered, six as threatened, and sixteen are under special protection in Mexico. Two wintering species and five breeding species have been locally extirpated, including the southwestern willow flycatcher, the Fulvous whistling duck, and the sandhill crane. Biosphere reserve The Gulf of California lies within the jurisdictional boundaries of Mexico and its states of Baja California and Sonora. In 1974, the Mexican government designated portions of the upper Gulf and lower Colorado River Delta as a reserve zone. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) designated over 12,000 km2 (3 million acres) of Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve as a Biosphere Nature reserve in June 1993. Within this 12,000 km2 (3 million acres), over 4,000 km2 (1 million acres) nearest the Colorado River Delta are designated as the Reserve \\"core area\\", with the remaining 8,000 km2 (2 million acres) of open water and shoreline designated as a \\"buffer area\\". UNESCO considers areas for designation as Biosphere Reserves only after the nation in which the site is located submits a nomination. Once designated, Biosphere Reserves remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the countries where they are located. Federal Mexican governmental agencies with administrative authority over the Biosphere Reserve include the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP) and the Secretary of the Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries (SEMARNAP). In addition to designation as a Biosphere Reserve, 2500 km2 (618,000 acres) within Colorado River Delta (Humedales del Delta del Río Colorado) are designated as a Ramsar Wetland under the U.N. Convention on Wetlands. Ramsar Wetlands are wetlands of international importance in terms of their ecology, botany, zoology, limnology or hydrology. The U.N. designation is considered following a nomination by the nation in which the site is located. View The region from orbit.

Baxley and starring Tom Berenger, Bokeem Woodbine, Dan Butler and Linden Ashby. The film premiered on Cinemax, on December 28, 2002 and was released to video on March 11, 2003. The film follows a Marine sniper and a spotter who are tasked with assassinating a Serbian general responsible for ethnic cleansing attacks. It is the sequel to the 1993 film Sniper and the second installment in the Sniper film series. Plot Former U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Scout Sniper Thomas Beckett (Tom Berenger), who was discharged after his finger was amputated in the first film, is met by CIA officer James Eckles (Dan Butler) and Colonel Dan McKenna (Linden Ashby) at his home. Despite losing his index finger he uses to shoot, Beckett still has the capability of firing a gun. Considering this, along with his impressive career from his time in the Marine Corps, Beckett is given a mission to assassinate renegade Serbian General Mile Valstoria (Peter Linka), who is responsible for conducting hit-and-run ethnic cleansing operations in the Muslim-populated areas of Serbia. The CIA fears that Valstoria's actions are threatening to inflame a larger conflict in the region. Beckett agrees to participate, but requests that an additional man, a spotter, must come with him. Beckett is introduced to his spotter, Jake Cole (Bokeem Woodbine), an experienced U.S. Army sniper who is on death row for killing a federal officer who allegedly betrayed him. Cole is released and offered a pardon if he takes part in the mission. After being dropped off into Serbia, Beckett and Cole make their way to a Catholic basilica. There, they meet an underground resistance member named Sophia (Erika Marozsán). Sophia takes them to her apartment, which is perched high above the designated area where Valstoria is due to show up, near a government building. The next morning, Beckett assassinates his target. Valstoria's killing puts the city into lockdown. After their original extraction point is compromised, Cole and Beckett are forced to find an alternative plan. When they hitch a ride on a public tram, nearby soldiers stop the vehicle and try to arrest them, but the two operatives take over the tram and ram it into some police cars. They soon exit the tram, running through the streets. Cole is captured and put into a prison where Valstoria's men keep their so-called 'special enemies', but Beckett is able to escape. Beckett meets Sophia that night, and the two make a plan to rescue Cole. With the help of Sophia's brothers, Zoran and Vojislav (Ferenc Kovács and Barna Illyés), the next day the box in military trucks carrying Cole and a fellow prisoner to a prison where Cole was to be executed. They ambush the convoy and then help Cole and Pavel (Tamás Puskás), who is a pacifist and political dissident, out of the truck and into a van that Zoran brought. Cole admits to Beckett that the assassination of Valstoria was set up to get Cole caught and then rescue Pavel from jail and brought out of Serbia. That night, at an abandoned factory that was meant to be the designated extraction zone, the group is ambushed by a tank and infantry. Both Vojislav and Zoran are killed in the attack and, after escaping from the factory through a sewer, Beckett orders Sophia to break off from the group and leave. A distance away from the factory, Pavel insists that they should head to Komra, a Muslim town where a friend of Pavel's, Nauzad (Zoltán Seress), lives. As the group meets Nauzad, he offers to help get the men to the border by getting them to a bus that would get them there. Within a couple of hours they are on their way but, as they cross a river, they come across an unexpected checkpoint and end up heading to Simand, the secondary extraction point, on foot. Meanwhile, Cpt. Marks (Can Togay) inspects the bus that the three men just departed from and suspects that they are attempting to head to Simand. Marks orders a tracker, (Béla Jáki), to take his special forces unit to Simand. As the three men arrive at Simand, they are ambushed by the special forces team in a forest outside of town, and Pavel suffers a slight flesh wound in the arm. After the trio kills the entire team, they are forced to proceed into town. The tracker holds up in the town factory and snipes down the team. Beckett demands that Cole take Pavel to the extraction zone while he deals with the tracker. Cole is severely wounded by the sniper, but Beckett picks him off. Pavel and Becket carry the wounded Cole into the helicopter and leave, just as Serb reinforcements led by Cpt. Marks arrive. In the helicopter, Beckett and Pavel look at Cole as he is badly wounded. Cole says, \\"Freedom!\\" and succumbs to his wounds.

He was the founder of the Sunni Ikhshidid dynasty, which ruled the region until the Fatimid conquest of 969. The son of Tughj ibn Juff, a general of Turkic origin who served both the Abbasids and the autonomous Tulunid rulers of Egypt and Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj was born in Baghdad but grew up in Syria and acquired his first military and administrative experiences at his father's side. He had a turbulent early career: he was imprisoned along with his father by the Abbasids in 905, was released in 906, participated in the murder of the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i in 908, and fled Iraq to enter the service of the governor of Egypt, Takin al-Khazari. Eventually he acquired the patronage of several influential Abbasid magnates, chiefly the powerful commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar. These ties led him to being named governor first of Palestine and then of Damascus. In 933, he was briefly named governor of Egypt, but this order was revoked after the death of Mu'nis, and Ibn Tughj had to fight to preserve even his governorship of Damascus. In 935, he was re-appointed to Egypt, where he quickly defeated a Fatimid invasion and stabilized the turbulent country. His reign marks a rare period of domestic peace, stability and good government in the annals of early Islamic Egypt. In 938 Caliph al-Radi granted his request for the title of al- Ikhshid, which had been borne by the rulers of his ancestral Farghana Valley. It is by this title that he was known thereafter. Throughout his governorship, al-Ikhshid was engaged in conflicts with other regional strongmen for control over Syria, without which Egypt was vulnerable to invasion from the east, but unlike many other Egyptian leaders, notably the Tulunids themselves, he was prepared to bide his time and compromise with his rivals. Although he was initially in control of the entirety of Syria, he was forced to cede the northern half to Ibn Ra'iq between 939 and 942. Following Ibn Ra'iq's murder, al-Ikhshid reimposed his control over northern Syria, only to have it challenged by the Hamdanids. In 944 al-Ikhshid met Caliph al-Muttaqi at Raqqa; the caliph had fled there from the various strongmen vying to kidnap him and control the caliphal government in Baghdad. Although unsuccessful in persuading the caliph to come to Egypt, he received recognition of hereditary rule over Egypt, Syria and the Hejaz for thirty years. Following his departure, the ambitious Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla seized Aleppo and northern Syria in the autumn of 944, and although defeated and driven out of Syria by Ibn Tughj himself in the next year, a treaty dividing the region along the lines of the agreement with Ibn Ra'iq was concluded in October. Ibn Tughj died nine months later, leaving his son Unujur as ruler of his domains, under the tutelage of the powerful black eunuch Abu al-Misk Kafur. Origin and early life Map of the Tulunid domains ca. 893 According to the biographical dictionary compiled by Ibn Khallikan, Muhammad ibn Tughj was born in Baghdad on 8 February 882, on the street leading to the Kufa Gate. His family was of Turkic origin from the Farghana Valley in Transoxiana, and claimed royal descent; the name of his ancestor, \\"Khaqan\\", is a Turkic royal title. Muhammad's grandfather Juff left Farghana to enter military service in the Abbasid court at Samarra, as did the father of Ibn Tulun, the founder of the Tulunid dynasty. Juff and his son, Muhammad's father Tughj, both served the Abbasids, but Tughj later entered the service of the Tulunids, who since 868 had become autonomous rulers of Egypt and Syria. Tughj served the Tulunids as governor of Tiberias (capital of the district of Jordan), Aleppo (the capital of the district of Qinnasrin) and Damascus (capital of the homonymous district). He played a major role in repelling the Qarmatian attack on Damascus in 903; although defeated in battle, he held the city itself against the Qarmatians for seven months until, with the arrival of reinforcements from Egypt, the Qarmatians were driven away. Thus Muhammad ibn Tughj spent a great part of his youth in the Tulunid Levant at his father's side, gaining his first experiences in administration—he served as his father's sub-governor of Tiberias—and war. After the death of Ibn Tulun's son Khumarawayh in 896, the Tulunid state quickly began crumbling from within, and failed to put up any serious resistance when the Abbasids moved to re-establish direct control over Syria and Egypt in 905. Tughj defected to the invading Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, and was named governor of Aleppo in return; Muhammad al-Katib himself fell victim to court intrigues soon after, and Tughj along with his sons Muhammad and Ubayd Allah were imprisoned in Baghdad. Tughj died in prison in 906, and the brothers were freed shortly after. The sons of Tughj participated in the palace coup that tried to depose the new caliph, al- Muqtadir (reigned 908–932), in favour of the older Ibn al-Mu'tazz in December 908. Although the attempt failed, Muhammad ibn Tughj and his brother were able to avenge themselves for their imprisonment on the vizier al-Abbas ibn al- Hasan al-Jarjara'i, whom they struck down with the aid of Husayn ibn Hamdan. After the coup's failure, the three fled: Ibn Hamdan returned to his native Upper Mesopotamia and Ubayd Allah fled east to Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, while Muhammad fled to Syria. In Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj joined the service of the tax supervisor of the local provinces, Abu'l-Abbas al-Bistam. He soon followed his new master to Egypt, and after al-Bistam's death in June 910 he continued serving the latter's son. Eventually, he gained the attention of the local governor, Takin al-Khazari, who sent him to govern the lands beyond the Jordan River, with his seat at Amman. In 918, he rescued a hajj caravan, among which was one of the ladies-in-waiting of al-Muqtadir's mother, from Bedouin raiders, thereby improving his standing at the Abbasid court. Two years later, Ibn Tughj gained an influential patron when he briefly served under the powerful Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, when he came to help defend Egypt from a Fatimid invasion. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj commanded the finest troops of the Egyptian army. The two men evidently established a rapport, and remained in contact thereafter. When Takin returned to Egypt as governor in 923, Ibn Tughj joined him there, but the two men fell out in 928 over Takin's refusal to give Ibn Tughj the post of governor of Alexandria. Ibn Tughj escaped the capital Fustat by a ruse, and managed to obtain for himself an appointment as governor of Palestine from Baghdad; the incumbent, al- Rashidi, fled the governor's seat at Ramla for Damascus, whose governorship he assumed. His flight, according to historian Jere L. Bacharach, may indicate that Ibn Tughj commanded a significant military force. Three years later, in July 931, Muhammad ibn Tughj was promoted to governor of Damascus, while al- Rashidi returned to Ramla. Both these appointments were likely the result of Ibn Tughj's relation with Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, who at this time was at the zenith of his power and influence. Takeover of Egypt Takin died in March 933, and his son and nominated successor, Muhammad, failed to establish his authority in Egypt. Ibn Tughj was named as the new governor in August but the appointment was revoked a month later before he could reach Egypt, and Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was appointed in his place. The timing of Ibn Tughj's recall coincides with the arrest (and subsequent murder) of Mu'nis by Caliph al-Qahir () on 22 September, suggesting that Ibn Tughj's nomination was in all likelihood also due to Mu'nis. The fact that al-Qahir sent a eunuch called Bushri to replace Ibn Tughj in Damascus after the fall of Mu'nis reinforces this view. Bushri was able to take over the governorship of Aleppo (to which he also had been appointed), but Ibn Tughj resisted his replacement, and defeated and took him prisoner. The caliph then charged Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh with forcing Ibn Tughj to surrender, but although Ahmad marched against Ibn Tughj, both avoided a direct confrontation. Instead, the two men met and reached an agreement of mutual support, upholding the status quo. Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh soon proved incapable of restoring order to the increasingly turbulent province. By 935, the troops were rioting over lack of pay, and Bedouin raids had recommenced. At the same time, Takin's son Muhammad and the fiscal administrator Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali al-Madhara'i—the heir of a dynasty of bureaucrats that had handled the province's finances since the time of Ibn Tulun and amassed enormous wealth—undermined Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and coveted his position. Infighting broke out among the troops between the Easterners (Mashariqa), chiefly Turkish soldiers, who supported Muhammad ibn Takin, and the Westerners (Maghariba), probably Berbers and Black Africans, who backed Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh. With the support this time of the former vizier and inspector-general of the western provinces al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat, whose son was married to one of Ibn Tughj's daughters, Ibn Tughj was once more named the governor of Egypt. Taking no chances, Ibn Tughj organized an invasion of the country by land and sea. Although Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was able to delay the advance of the army, Ibn Tughj's fleet took Tinnis and the Nile Delta and moved on to the capital Fustat. Outmanoeuvred and defeated in battle, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh fled to the Fatimids. The victorious Muhammad ibn Tughj entered Fustat on 26 August 935. With the capital under his control, Ibn Tughj now had to confront the Fatimids. The Maghariba who refused to submit to Ibn Tughj had fled to Alexandria and then to Barqa under the leadership of Habashi ibn Ahmad, and invited the Fatimid ruler al-Qa'im () to invade Egypt with their assistance. The Fatimid invasion met with initial success: the Fatimid army's Kutama Berbers captured the island of al-Rawda on the Nile and burned its arsenal. Ibn Tughj's admirals Ali ibn Badr and Bajkam defected to the Fatimids, and Alexandria itself was captured in March 936. Nevertheless, on 31 March, Ibn Tughj's brother al-Hasan defeated the Fatimid forces near Alexandria, driving them out of the city and forcing the Fatimids to once again retreat from Egypt to their base at Barqa. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj notably prohibited his troops from looting, which, according to J. L. Bacharach, was indicative of his \\"long-term view towards his stay in Egypt\\". Government of Egypt Dinar minted in Palestine under al-Ikhshid, 944 CE. From 942 on, Ibn Tughj included his name and title (\\"Muhammad al-Ikhshid\\"), alongside that of the caliph in his coinage. Writing to Caliph al-Radi () in 936, Muhammad ibn Tughj could present a commendable record: the Fatimid invasion was defeated and first measures for improving the financial situation in the province had been undertaken. The caliph confirmed him in his post and sent robes of honour. As Hugh N. Kennedy writes, \\"in some ways the Fatimid threat actually helped Ibn Tughj\\" since, as long as he supported the Abbasids, \\"the caliphs were prepared to give their approval to his rule in return\\". His standing in the Abbasid court was sufficient for him to ask in 938 for the honorific title (laqab) of al-Ikhshid, originally held by the kings of his ancestral homeland Farghana. Caliph al-Radi granted the request, although formal approval was delayed until July 939. After receiving official confirmation, Ibn Tughj required that he be henceforth addressed solely by his new title. Very little is known about al-Ikhshid's domestic policies. Nevertheless, the silence of the sources about domestic troubles during his reign—apart from a minor Shi'ite revolt in 942, which was swiftly suppressed—stands in stark contrast to the usual narrative of Bedouin raids, urban riots over high prices, or military and dynastic revolts and intrigues, and indicates that he was successful in restoring internal tranquillity and orderly government in Egypt. According to the biographical dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, he was \\"a resolute prince, displaying great foresight in war, and a close attention to the prosperity of his empire; he treated the military class with honour and governed with ability and justice\\". His potential rivals Muhammad ibn Takin and al-Madhara'i were quickly won over and incorporated in the new administration. The latter had tried to resist al-Ikhshid's takeover in vain, as his troops had immediately defected, and was initially imprisoned by al-Ikhshid, only to be released in 939. He soon recovered his status and influence, and briefly served as regent of al-Ikhshid's son and heir, Unujur in 946, before being overthrown and imprisoned for a year. Thereafter, and until his death in 957, he retired into private life. Like the Tulunids before him, al-Ikhshid also took particular care to build up a considerable military force of his own, including Turkic and Black African slave soldiers. Foreign policy and the struggle for Syria As commander and ruler in Egypt, al- Ikhshid was a patient and cautious man. He achieved his goals as much by diplomacy and ties to powerful personages in the Baghdad regime as by force, and even then he tended to avoid direct military confrontation whenever possible. His conflict with Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was indicative of his approach: instead of a direct clash, the truce between the two gave al-Ikhshid the time to reconnoitre the situation in Egypt before acting. Although following in the footsteps of Ibn Tulun, his ambitions were more modest and his objectives more practical, as became particularly evident in his policies towards Syria and the rest of the Caliphate. Historically, possession of Syria, and particularly Palestine, was a foreign policy objective for many rulers of Egypt, to foreclose the most likely invasion route into the country. Ibn Tulun before and Saladin after al-Ikhshid were two typical examples of Egyptian rulers who spent much of their reigns securing control of Syria, and indeed used Egypt mostly as a source of revenue and resources to accomplish this goal. Al-Ikhshid differed from them; Bacharach describes him as a \\"cautious, conservative realist\\". His goals were limited but clear: his main concern was Egypt proper and the establishment of his family as a hereditary dynasty over it, while Syria remained a secondary objective. Unlike other military strongmen of the time, he had no intention of entering the contest for control of Baghdad and the caliphal government through the all-powerful office of amir al-umara; indeed, when Caliph al-Mustakfi () offered him the post, he turned it down. =Conflict with Ibn Ra'iq= Map of the region of Syria and its provinces under the Abbasids Following the expulsion of the Fatimids from Egypt, al-Ikhshid had his troops occupy all of Syria up to Aleppo, allying himself, as Ibn Tulun had done, with the local tribe of Banu Kilab to strengthen his hold over northern Syria. As governor of Syria, his remit extended to the borderlands (thughur) with the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Thus in 936/7 or 937/8 (most likely in autumn 937) he received an embassy from the Byzantine emperor, Romanos I Lekapenos (), to organize a prisoner exchange. Although carried out in the name of Caliph al-Radi, it was a special honour and an implicit recognition of al-Ikhshid's autonomy, since correspondence and negotiations for such events were normally directed to the caliph rather than provincial governors. The exchange took place in autumn 938, resulting in the release of 6,300 Muslims for an equivalent number of Byzantine captives. As the Byzantines held 800 more prisoners than the Muslims, these had to be ransomed and were gradually released over the next six months. While the amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq was in power in Baghdad (936–938) with al-Ikhshid's old friend al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat as vizier, relations with Baghdad were good. Following Ibn Ra'iq's replacement by the Turk Bajkam, however, Ibn Ra'iq received a nomination by the caliph to the governorship of Syria and in 939 marched west to claim it from al-Ikhshid's forces. Ibn Ra'iq's appointment enraged al-Ikhshid, who sent an envoy to Baghdad to clarify the situation. There Bajkam informed him that the caliph might appoint whomever he chose, but that it ultimately did not matter: it was military strength that would determine who was governor of Syria and even of Egypt, not any appointment by a figurehead caliph. If either Ibn Ra'iq or al- Ikhshid emerged victorious from the conflict, caliphal confirmation would soon follow. Al-Ikhshid was even more infuriated by the reply, and reportedly for a time even threatened to give one of his daughters to the Fatimid caliph al- Qa'im and to have coins minted and the Friday prayer read in his name rather than the Abbasid caliph, until the Abbasids formally reconfirmed his position. The Fatimids themselves were preoccupied with the revolt of Abu Yazid and were unable to offer any assistance. From Raqqa, Ibn Ra'iq's troops swiftly took over the districts of northern Syria, where al-Ikhshid's brother Ubayd Allah was governor, while the Egyptian forces retreated south. By October or November, Ibn Ra'iq's men had reached Ramla and moved on into the Sinai. Al- Ikhshid led his army against Ibn Ra'iq, but after a short clash at al-Farama, the two men came to an understanding, dividing Syria between them: the areas from Ramla to the south would be under al-Ikhshid, and the areas to the north under Ibn Ra'iq. In May or June 940, however, al-Ikhshid learned that Ibn Ra'iq had once again moved against Ramla. Once more, the Egyptian ruler led his army to battle. Although defeated at al-Arish, al-Ikhshid was able to quickly rally his troops and ambush Ibn Ra'iq, preventing him from entering Egypt proper and forcing him to retreat back to Damascus. Al-Ikhshid sent his brother, Abu Nasr al-Husayn, with another army against Ibn Ra'iq, but he was defeated and killed at Lajjun. Despite his victory, Ibn Ra'iq opted for peace: he gave Abu Nasr an honourable burial and sent his son, Muzahim, as envoy to Egypt. True to his political strategy, al-Ikhshid accepted. The agreement saw the restoration of the territorial status quo of the previous year, but with al-Ikhshid paying an annual tribute of 140,000 gold dinars. The deal was cemented by the marriage of Muzahim with al-Ikhshid's daughter Fatima. =Conflict with the Hamdanids= Peace did not last for long, as the political turmoil in Baghdad continued. In September 941, Ibn Ra'iq assumed once more the post of amir al-umara at the invitation of Caliph al-Muttaqi (), but he was not as powerful as before. Unable to stop the advance of another strongman, Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi of Basra, both Ibn Ra'iq and the caliph were forced to abandon Baghdad and seek the help of the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul. The latter soon had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated (April 942) and succeeded him as amir al-umara with the laqab of Nasir al-Dawla. Al-Ikhshid used the opportunity to reoccupy Syria for himself, joining his forces in person in June 942, and venturing as far as Damascus, before returning to Egypt in January 943. The Hamdanids also staked claim on Syria at the same time, but the sources do not record details of their expeditions there. Nasir al-Dawla's position as amir al-umara also proved to be weak, and in June 943 he was ousted by the Turkish general Tuzun. In October, Caliph al-Muttaqi, fearing that Tuzun intended to replace him, fled the capital and sought refuge with the Hamdanids. Although Nasir al-Dawla and his brother Sayf al-Dawla sheltered the caliph, they also did not confront Tuzun's troops, and in May 944 they reached an agreement that gave Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria to the Hamdanids in exchange for recognizing Tuzun's possession of Iraq. Nasir al- Dawla sent his cousin al-Husayn ibn Sa'id to take over the Syrian provinces allotted to him in this agreement. The Ikhshidid forces either defected or retreated, and al-Husayn swiftly took over the districts of Qinnasrin and Hims. In the meantime, al-Muttaqi with Sayf al-Dawla had fled to Raqqa before Tuzun's advance, but the caliph grew increasingly suspicious of the Hamdanids, and wrote to al-Ikhshid (perhaps as early as the winter of 943), asking for aid. The latter immediately responded by leading an army into Syria. The Hamdanid garrisons withdrew before him, and in September 944, al-Ikhshid reached Raqqa. Distrusting the Hamdanids given their treatment of Ibn Ra'iq, he waited until Sayf al-Dawla had left the city before entering it to meet the caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried without success to persuade al-Muttaqi to come with him to Egypt, or at least to stay in Raqqa, while the caliph tried to get al- Ikhshid to march against Tuzun, which al-Ikhshid refused. The meeting was not entirely fruitless, as al-Ikhshid secured an agreement that virtually repeated the terms of a similar treaty between the Tulunid Khumarawayh and Caliph al- Mu'tamid in 886. The caliph recognized the authority of al-Ikhshid over Egypt, Syria (with the thughur), and the Hejaz (carrying with it the prestigious guardianship of the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina), for a period of thirty years, with the right of hereditary succession for al-Ikhshid's sons. This development had already been anticipated by al-Ikhshid the previous year, when he named his son Unujur as his regent during his absences from Egypt, although Unujur had not yet come of age, and had required an oath of allegiance (bay'a) to be sworn to him. Nevertheless, as Michael Brett comments, the territories conferred were \\"mixed blessings\\", as the holy cities were exposed to Qarmatian raids, while the marches of the thughur were increasingly menaced by the Byzantines, and Aleppo (with northern Syria) was coveted by the Hamdanids. As it happened, al-Muttaqi was persuaded by the emissaries of Tuzun, who protested his loyalty, to return to Iraq, only to be seized, blinded and deposed on 12 October and replaced by al-Mustakfi. Al- Mustakfi reconfirmed al-Ikhshid's governorship, but by this point it was an empty gesture. According to J. L. Bacharach, although the 13th-century historian Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi reports that al-Ikhshid immediately took the bay'a and read the Friday prayer in the new caliph's name, based on the available numismatic evidence, he appears to have delayed recognition of both al-Mustakfi and his Buyid-installed successor al-Muti () for several months by refraining from including them in his coinage, in an act that was a deliberate and clear statement of his de facto independence from Baghdad. This independence was also acknowledged by others; the contemporary De Ceremoniis records that in the correspondence of the Byzantine court, the \\"Emir of Egypt\\" was accorded a golden seal worth four solidi, the same as the caliph in Baghdad. Map of the fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th and 10th centuries Following his meeting with al-Muttaqi, al-Ikhshid returned to Egypt, leaving the field open for the ambitious Sayf al-Dawla. The Ikhshidid forces left behind in Syria were relatively weak, and the Hamdanid leader, having gained the support of the Banu Kilab, had little difficulty in capturing Aleppo on 29 October 944. He then began extending his control over the provinces of northern Syria down to Hims. Al-Ikhshid sent an army under the eunuchs Abu al-Misk Kafur and Fatik against the Hamdanid, but it was defeated near Hama and retreated back to Egypt, abandoning Damascus and Palestine to the Hamdanids. Al-Ikhshid was then forced to once again campaign in person in April 945, but at the same time he sent envoys proposing to Sayf al-Dawla an agreement along the lines of the one with Ibn Ra'iq: the Hamdanid prince would get to keep northern Syria, while al-Ikhshid would pay him an annual tribute for the possession of Palestine and Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla refused and reportedly even boasted that he would conquer Egypt itself, but al-Ikhshid held the upper hand: his agents managed to bribe several Hamdanid leaders, and he won over the citizens of Damascus, who barred their gates before the Hamdanid and opened them for al-Ikhshid. The two armies met near Qinnasrin in May, where the Hamdanids were defeated. Sayf al-Dawla fled to Raqqa, leaving his capital Aleppo to be captured by al-Ikhshid. Nevertheless, in October the two sides came to an agreement, broadly on the lines of the earlier Ikhshidid proposal: al-Ikhshid acknowledged Hamdanid control over northern Syria and even consented to sending an annual tribute in exchange for Sayf al-Dawla's renunciation of all claims on Damascus. The Hamdanid ruler was also to marry one of al-Ikhshid's daughters or nieces. For al-Ikhshid, the maintenance of Aleppo was less important than southern Syria with Damascus, which was Egypt's eastern bulwark. Provided that these remained under his control, he was more than willing to allow the existence of a Hamdanid state in the north. The Egyptian ruler knew that he would have difficulty in asserting and maintaining control over northern Syria and Cilicia, which had traditionally been influenced more by Upper Mesopotamia and Iraq. By abandoning its claims on these distant provinces, not only would Egypt be spared the cost of maintaining a large army there, but the Hamdanid emirate would also fulfil the useful role of a buffer state against incursions from both Iraq and a resurgent Byzantine Empire. Indeed, throughout al-Ikhshid's rule, and that of his successors, relations with the Byzantines were quite friendly, as the lack of a common border and the common hostility to the Fatimids guaranteed that the interests of the two states did not clash. Despite Sayf al-Dawla's attempt to push again into southern Syria soon after al-Ikhshid's death, the border agreed in 945 held, and even outlived both dynasties, forming the dividing line between Mesopotamian-influenced northern Syria and the Egyptian- controlled southern part of the country until the Mamluks seized the entire region in 1260. Death and legacy In mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines for yet another prisoner exchange (which eventually would take place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor Constantine VII () sent an embassy under John Mystikos in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due to the influence of the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by Kafur's demise, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country's history. Medieval historians noted the many parallels between al-Ikhshid and his Tulunid predecessors, especially Khumarawayh. Ibn Sa'id even reported that according to Egyptian astrologers, the two men had entered Egypt on the same day of the year and with the same star in the same ascendant. There were important differences, however: al-Ikhshid lacked the \\"flamboyance\\" (Hugh Kennedy) of the Tulunids. Al-Ikhshid's caution and self- imposed restraint in his foreign policy objectives also stood in stark contrast with his contemporaries and other rulers of Egypt who preceded and followed him, earning him a reputation of extreme caution, often misinterpreted as timidity by contemporaries. He was also described as less cultivated than his predecessor Ibn Tulun. Unlike Ibn Tulun, who built an entire new capital at al-Qatta'i and a famous mosque, al-Ikhshid was neither a patron of artists and poets nor a major builder. According to historian Thierry Bianquis, he was described by medieval chroniclers as \\"a choleric and gluttonous man, yet shrewd and inclined toward avarice\\", but with a fondness for luxuries imported from the east, and especially perfumes. His love of eastern luxuries soon spread among the upper classes of Fustat as well and influenced the style and fashion of local Egyptian products in turn, which began to imitate them.

He was the real thing.\\" According to Milius, TNT executives \\"said, \`We'll let you make it if you can make it at this price, write it quick, be in production in three months'... all these impossible things,\\" said Milius. \\"And I said yes.\\" \\"This one does sort of glorify war,\\" said Berenger, who eventually agreed to play Roosevelt. \\"But you have to consider that it was written by John Milius.\\" \\"In a sense, one man going up that hill, one battle, and a man became President and we acquired an overseas empire,\\" said Milius. \\"Courage and valor are no longer considered great attributes in our culture. But for Roosevelt, they were the only issues. I agree.\\" Milius says the script was also about the bonding of the men. \\"It shows you that things happen to people that they never get over. It's why vets can only talk to each other. Everyone of them is scarred for life... Men go off to war because they really want to, not knowing what it's going to be. They think it's an adventure, a romantic fantasy. And, of course, it never is. People are brought together and forced to do something that is truly unnatural to man – kill each other. But in doing this sort of extraordinary self-destruction, man seems to bring all of his virtues to bear.\\" =Shooting= The film was shot in Texas over 48 days on a budget of $19 million. \\"Believe me, there were no trailers for the stars or anything,\\" said Milius. \\"If anything, you got a chair.\\" \\"I was just pleased I got to do the subject matter; the shorter schedule didn't bother me,\\" Milius added. \\"It was just another way of telling a story. With the shorter schedule, I just did the best I could do, worked twice as hard and didn't get any sleep.\\" Six Texas locations served as stand-ins for Cuba, Florida, New York and Washington, D.C. - Palestine, a town southeast of Dallas, was the period railroad; the Cuban jungle scenes were done outside Houston and the hill country outside San Antonio stood in for the training camp and San Juan Hill. Milius considers the film one of his best. \\"They had a lot of controls on me, at Turner, and I just ran over them... They hated me, but I got the film made, didn't I?... That's what you have to do. You have to be true to the vision that you start out to do, otherwise what are you even there for?\\" Brian Keith, who played President McKinley, committed suicide after filming and before the mini-series aired.  Historical inaccuracies  *Bucky O'Neill commanded 'A' Troop of which Henry Nash was indeed a member, not 'G' Troop. Craig Wadsworth was a member of 'K' Troop and was not a member of O'Neill's troop. *Bucky O'Neill is implied to be older [56]; in fact the real Bucky O Neill was 38. *Henry Nash was not a stagecoach robber but a miner and a schoolteacher. Nash and O'Neill did not have an antagonistic relationship due to O'Neill's \\"6th Sense\\" that Nash was a criminal. Bucky O'Neill and Henry Nash were actually friends. It has been speculated that Milius based Nash's character on William Sterin. In 1889, Sterin and three other men robbed a train in Arizona. O'Neill led the posse that captured Sterin & the three men who were subsequently sent to the Yuma Territorial Prison. In 1897, the men were pardoned and in 1898 Sterin joined the Rough Riders under an assumed name. It is believed that Sternin may have been killed in action during the \\"Battle of San Juan Hill.\\" *Bucky O'Neill is not buried in the Arizona desert as portrayed in the final scene; instead he is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. *There would indeed be a statue dedicated to Bucky O'Neill as Nash stated there would be, however, Nash had nothing to do with it. The statue was created after Henry Nash died. *In reality, Theodore Roosevelt and Stephen Crane disliked each other and did not socialize during the Santiago campaign. *Major General Joseph Wheeler is implied to be older and more experienced than Major General William Rufus Shafter, the V Corps commander. In reality, Shafter was two years older than Wheeler and also a Civil War veteran (and Medal of Honor recipient). *Wheeler issued the order to attack San Juan Heights not to 1st Lieutenant John J. \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing of the 10th Cavalry, but to Brigadier General J. F. Kent, Commander of the 1st Division of the 5th Army Corps, who led his division in the main assault of San Juan Hill while the Rough Riders & the 10th Cavalry attacked Kettle Hill. *No Spanish machine gun was present at San Juan Hill. The volume of quick firing Mauser rifles was mistaken as machine gun fire. There also were no German advisors with the Spanish forces, but there were neutral German military observers. Milius however insisted there were German advisers. *Wheeler's son, a West Point graduate who was his aide- de-camp, was actually named Joseph Jr. (\\"Fighting Joe\\"), not William as depicted. *Roosevelt experts did not like a scene where Roosevelt, despite his patrician New York upbringing, attends a formal reception with his wife Edith (played by Illeana Douglas) and drags her around the room and harangues guests. \\"He was filled with wild enthusiasm,\\" Milius said, when questioned about the scene. *A historian said that the final charge at San Juan Hill took place in tall grass. \\"San Juan Hill looked exactly like our hill,\\" Milius said. \\"The vegetation was almost exactly the same. We went to meticulous detail.\\" *The final scene of the movie begins with the caption \\"22 Years Later.\\" Since the previous scene took place at the conclusion of the 1898 Battle of San Juan Hill, then the final scene must have taken place in 1920. The final scene is where Henry Nash, played by Brad Johnson, is in the desert, presumably Arizona, and is talking to the headstones of Buckey O'Neill and George Neville. In his conversation with the tombstones, Nash mentions 1) He just saw Teddy Roosevelt at Roosevelt's New York home and that Teddy was \\"doing poorly,\\" 2) that Nash was a millionaire, and 3) that Nash's son was at Harvard. However, Nash could not have met Roosevelt in 1920 because Roosevelt died in 1919 and Nash died in 1902 in Manila, Philippines. Nash was never a millionaire businessman; he was a schoolteacher and his last salary, in 1902 in Manila, was for $1,200 per year. Henry Nash never had a son who went to Harvard. In fact, he never married and never had any children.  Reception  =Critical= A reviewer for Variety said \\"it's not straight history, the name-dropping's something fierce, and fictional characters are mixed liberally with imaginary takes of legendary figures; the first two hours of the four- hour opus are colorful, the second disturbingly corny. \\"Rough Riders\\" is a rough, sometimes silly, take on extraordinary American history.\\" A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"it rarely manages to surface above a seemingly endless array of skirmishes, firefights, ambushes, infantry charges, hand-to-hand combat, carnage and killing.\\" The Baltimore Sun said the film \\"overstays its welcome by at least a third... so oozes with testosterone that your TV screen may start sprouting facial hair.... Milius gets so caught up in the male bonding, in relishing the way war makes men of boys and brothers of men, that he forgets there's a story to be told. In the end, what could have been a top-notch film about a brief little war, whose lasting import far outweighed its immediate impact, becomes an exercise in the minutiae of battle.\\" =Ratings= Rough Riders was the most watched basic cable original movie in July, delivering 16 million households over 10 plays.

It was a spin-off of Walker, Texas Ranger. As of March 2020, it briefly aired in syndication on getTV. Pilot The two-hour pilot, Sons of Thunder, was shown as episode 4.24 of Walker. This episode introduced the characters of childhood friends Carlos Sandoval, a Dallas PD Detective, and Trent Malloy, an Army sergeant and a protégé of Walker. When Rev. Thunder Malloy, a close friend of Walker, dies from a heart attack, his son Trent returns home and, eventually, quits the Army to stay. Walker and his partner Trivette go after a serial cop killer who has Carlos on his list, which Trent ends up getting involved in by accident when he saved Carlos' life and later helped Walker and Carlos take down the criminal. Seasons 5 and 6 of Walker During Seasons 5 and 6 of Walker, Carlos appeared on 15 episodes and Trent for 12 episodes (one of these episodes included a Hayes Cooper story in which both actors appeared in a dual role). During these episodes, Trent opens his own martial arts dojo as well as a protection agency to either help people who are too scared to go to the police or who the police can't help. Sometimes he has Carlos assist him in some of his cases and at other times they help Walker on several of his cases, which often involve personal issues, or Trent turns over his current case The spin-off series Finally, in 1999, they got their own spin-off series, which only lasted six episodes. Carlos resigns from the PD after his partner is murdered by a serial killer, who was a failed police applicant. He teams up with Trent to find the assassin and they later decide to form their own private investigation firm called Thunder Investigation. Cancellation Sons of Thunder was not picked up for the fall 1999 CBS line-up. While replacing Walker, Texas Ranger (which was on hiatus) in the 8 o'clock Saturday night time slot, the show beat Walker's ratings of the previous two seasons. Producers Chuck and Aaron Norris assumed that the show would be given a season's full of episodes to try to make it on to the CBS line-up. But CBS passed on the show citing budget concerns.

He was a founding member of the successful pop-folk group The Seekers, and co-composer of the song \\"I Am Australian\\". Woodley attended Melbourne High School with fellow Seekers, Athol Guy and Keith Potger. The Seekers Woodley had a 'residency' performing at the Treble Clef restaurant in Prahran. With former schoolmates, Athol Guy and Keith Potger, he formed a folk music trio, The Escorts, in the early 1960s. Soon before the arrival of vocalist Judith Durham in 1962 they became The Seekers, and had some success in Australia before travelling to London in 1964 and recording four international hit singles written and produced by Tom Springfield. Woodley played guitar, banjo, and mandolin, as well as one of the four-part vocal harmony, and was the chief songwriter. While Durham sang the majority of lead vocals for the group, Woodley usually handled the male lead vocals, including a number of album tracks. The Seekers first disbanded in 1968. During 1965, while in London, Woodley met Paul Simon, following the poor performance of Wednesday Morning 3 A.M. and just prior to the success of Simon and Garfunkel. Simon and Woodley co-wrote the million-selling \\"Red Rubber Ball\\"—later a Top Five hit for US group The Cyrkle. The Simon and Woodley collaboration also provided \\"I Wish You Could Be Here\\" and \\"Cloudy\\". The Seekers later recorded these three songs, and \\"Cloudy\\" became an album track on Simon and Garfunkel's hit 1966 album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme—the only Simon and Woodley song to appear on both groups' album. However, Woodley's relationship with Simon had deteriorated and Woodley later struggled to get his share of the royalties—his songwriting credit on \\"Cloudy\\" was omitted from the release of Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. However, Simon does receive a credit for the song on The Seekers' album, Seekers Seen in Green. Going solo Woodley's first solo venture was a production company called Pennywheel, which saw him release a number of products for children, including a \\"Build an Alphabet\\" set of blocks and the 1969 EP and board book, \\"Friday St. Fantasy\\". In 1969, Bruce headed off to America to sell the songs he had been writing, and was to remain there for several years. During this period he collaborated with a number of writers including John Farrar and Australian folk singer Hans Poulsen. Their compositions \\"Lady Scorpio\\" performed by Australian band The Strangers, \\"Monty and Me\\" performed by Zoot (which included a young Rick Springfield) and \\"Boom- Sha-La-La-Lo\\" which became a hit for Poulsen. In 1971, Woodley released his first solo album, entitled Just Good Friends. In a reaction to the folk stereotype of the Seekers, the original album cover featured two naked models having sex. This was deemed too raunchy for Australia and the cover was replaced by a photo of Woodley. The original cover, however, was allowed in New Zealand, and this version of the album is a collectors item today. Three years later, Woodley contributed to an Australian-themed album put out by Viscount cigarettes, called The Roaring Days Vol. 1 (after a Henry Lawson poem). A second volume never eventuated. He also had a hit song called \\"Love Me Tonight Baby\\". The album featured Woodley performing the traditional folk song \\"Eumerella Shore\\" and some of his own compositions, including \\"The Bush Girl\\", which he would later re-record for a double album in 1987, with The Seekers in 1997 and 2000, and with his daughter Claire Woodley in 2001. Seekers reunions Woodley reunited with the Seekers, composed of fellow original members Athol Guy and Keith Potger, and 23-year-old Dutch-born Louisa Wisseling (a semi-professional folk singer formerly with Melbourne band The Settlers). In a February 1975 newspaper article about the group's reunion, Louisa revealed that Bruce had approached her at a 1974 Settlers concert at Ferntree Gully's Swagman Restaurant with an offer to join the group, and she originally turned him down. The new group recorded two albums and a number of singles, some of which, like \\"The Nimble Song\\" and \\"I Saw It All With Trans Tours\\" (both written by Woodley) reflected the boys' other careers in advertising. Woodley's composition \\"The Sparrow Song\\" became the group's biggest 1970s hit and remains to this day the highest-charting Seekers single written by a member of the group. Other tracks he contributed to this line-up included \\"Giving and Takin'\\" (the title track of their second album), \\"Can We Learn to Get Along\\" (which began life as a solo recording for the TV documentary series Shell's Australia, and was released by Bruce on flexi- disc), \\"Reunion\\", \\"Country Ros\\", \\"Standing on Shaky Ground\\" (featuring Bruce on vocals which he felt were too low for him, but were impossible for Louisa to sing for the same reason), and \\"The Rose and the Briar\\". In 1977, Bruce left the group and was replaced by Buddy England. He continued to focus on song-writing and advertising, producing many TV jingles including one for Courage beer. His first, back in 1971 was a solo (advertising) single called \\"The ANZ Bank Travelling Man\\", and was given out free to employees of that institution as part of the promotion. I Am Australian The year 1987 saw Woodley involved in the preparations for the Australian Bicentenary, and the release of an Australian-themed double album, songbook and cassette tape, featuring covers of traditional songs and some of Woodley's own compositions. The set was called I Am Australian, after a jingle that he wrote to tie together the various threads of the project, tapping into the need he perceived for a national song in which people could take pride. One of his colleagues on the project was Dobe Newton of The Bushwackers, who helped compose the words of the title song; another was noted folk singer Rose Bygrave. The recordings also featured a children's choir including Claire Woodley. The following year he reunited with The Seekers, this time featuring Julie Anthony as the lead singer, to perform \\"The Carnival is Over\\" at Expo '88 and a musical about the Seekers' journey. This line-up released an album in 1989; \\"Live On\\", the title track, was composed by Woodley, as were many of the other new tracks like \\"The Streets of Serenade\\" (which charted the story of the Seekers rather more blatantly than his '70s composition \\"Reunion\\"), \\"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back\\", \\"How Can a Love So Wrong Be So Right\\" and \\"Taking My Chances With You\\". When Julie left to have a baby (daughter Tamara), former Young Talent Time singer Karen Knowles joined the group. The only studio recordings by this line-up are the Bruce Woodley written songs \\"Fools Tonight\\" and \\"Bright Star\\", sold as a cassingle at concerts. \\"Bright Star\\", originally written for Julie's voice, was also performed by both the Julie- and Karen-led Seekers at Carols by Candlelight. When original lead singer Judith Durham returned to The Seekers fold in late 1992 for the group's 25 Year Silver Jubilee, the theme song and CD-Single of the reunion was Woodley's composition \\"Keep A Dream In Your Pocket\\". A 1993 live album and DVD followed, featuring many of the group's hits and a song which would become one of their best known, Woodley's \\"I Am Australian\\". The success of \\"I Am Australian\\" took Woodley completely by surprise. In 1991, he performed it with Karen and the Australian Children's Choir on a televised drought appeal, featuring a new, drought themed verse which has not appeared on other recordings. \\"I Am Australian\\" has featured in all Woodley's solo tours and all Seekers tours since the reunion with Judith Durham; in 2000 the Seekers performed a condensed version at the televised Australia Day concert. Many artists have covered the song; in 1997, Durham released a version with Russell Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu which entered the Australian charts. For many , it has become the unofficial anthem, and is a staple performed at many national events, by such artists as Jon Stevens, Delta Goodrem and naturally Bruce and the Seekers. At the 2001 celebrations for the Centenary of Federation, Woodley performed the song with daughter Claire (now known for performing the song solo at many events herself) and co-writer Dobe Newton. Woodley divorced in the '80s after a 14-year marriage, and he and former wife Sally have two children, Claire and a son, Dan. With Claire, a burgeoning singer-songwriter in her own right who has performed on the cabaret and conference circuit, he recorded a CD in 2001 called, once again, \\"I am Australian\\". He has since recorded an ANZAC themed version of \\"I am Australian\\", titled \\"The Anzac Song\\", and appeared on Melbourne radio advertising the release of a CD-Single several weeks before Anzac Day in 2005. Apparently due to production difficulties, it never eventuated. In 2005 Bruce was interviewed by music journalist Debbie Kruger for a new book entitled Songwriters Speak, focusing on influential and successful Australian singer- songwriters. At the National Day of Mourning on 22 February 2009 for the victims of the Victoria bushfires, Woodley unveiled two new verses for \\"I am Australian\\". Other work Woodley's non-musical work includes public speaking through the Saxton Speakers Bureau, and he is the patron of various organisations such as the NIYPAA (National Institute of Youth Performing Arts Australia). He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the organisation TLC for Kids, and was for a time, beginning in 1997, the chairman of the Victorian branch of the Variety Club.

In mathematics, the universality of zeta- functions is the remarkable ability of the Riemann zeta-function and other similar functions (such as the Dirichlet L-functions) to approximate arbitrary non-vanishing holomorphic functions arbitrarily well. The universality of the Riemann zeta function was first proven by Sergei Mikhailovitch Voronin in 1975Voronin, S.M. (1975) \\"Theorem on the Universality of the Riemann Zeta Function.\\" Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Matem. 39 pp.475-486. Reprinted in Math. USSR Izv. 9, 443-445, 1975 and is sometimes known as Voronin's Universality Theorem. The Riemann zeta function on the strip 1/2 < Re(s) < 1; 103 < Im(s) < 109\\\\. Formal statement A mathematically precise statement of universality for the Riemann zeta-function ζ(s) follows. Let U be a compact subset of the strip :\\\\\\\\{ s\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mid 1/2 < \\\\mbox{Re } s < 1 \\\\\\\\} such that the complement of U is connected. Let be a continuous function on U which is holomorphic on the interior of U and does not have any zeros in U. Then for any there exists a such that for all s\\\\in U . Even more: the lower density of the set of values t which do the job is positive, as is expressed by the following inequality about a limit inferior. : 0 < \\\\liminf_{T\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ t\\\\in[0,T] \\\\;\\\\bigg\\\\; \\\\max_{s\\\\in U} \\\\left \\\\zeta(s+it)-f(s) \\\\right < \\\\varepsilon \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right) , where λ denotes the Lebesgue measure on the real numbers. Discussion The condition that the complement of U be connected essentially means that U doesn't contain any holes. The intuitive meaning of the first statement is as follows: it is possible to move U by some vertical displacement it so that the function f on U is approximated by the zeta function on the displaced copy of U, to an accuracy of ε. The function f is not allowed to have any zeros on U. This is an important restriction; if you start with a holomorphic function with an isolated zero, then any \\"nearby\\" holomorphic function will also have a zero. According to the Riemann hypothesis, the Riemann zeta function does not have any zeros in the considered strip, and so it couldn't possibly approximate such a function. The function which is identically zero on U can be approximated by ζ: we can first pick the \\"nearby\\" function (which is holomorphic and doesn't have zeros) and find a vertical displacement such that ζ approximates g to accuracy ε/2, and therefore f to accuracy ε. The accompanying figure shows the zeta function on a representative part of the relevant strip. The color of the point s encodes the value ζ(s) as follows: the hue represents the argument of ζ(s), with red denoting positive real values, and then counterclockwise through yellow, green cyan, blue and purple. Strong colors denote values close to 0 (black = 0), weak colors denote values far away from 0 (white = ∞). The picture shows three zeros of the zeta function, at about , and . Voronin's theorem essentially states that this strip contains all possible \\"analytic\\" color patterns that don't use black or white. The rough meaning of the statement on the lower density is as follows: if a function f and an is given, there is a positive probability that a randomly picked vertical displacement it will yield an approximation of f to accuracy ε. The interior of U may be empty, in which case there is no requirement of f being holomorphic. For example, if we take U to be a line segment, then a continuous function is nothing but a curve in the complex plane, and we see that the zeta function encodes every possible curve (i.e., any figure that can be drawn without lifting the pencil) to arbitrary precision on the considered strip. The theorem as stated applies only to regions U that are contained in the strip. However, if we allow translations and scalings, we can also find encoded in the zeta functions approximate versions of all non-vanishing holomorphic functions defined on other regions. In particular, since the zeta function itself is holomorphic, versions of itself are encoded within it at different scales, the hallmark of a fractal. The surprising nature of the theorem may be summarized in this way: the Riemann zeta function contains \\"all possible behaviors\\" within it, and is thus \\"chaotic\\" in a sense, yet it is a perfectly smooth analytic function with a rather simple, straightforward definition. =Proof sketch= A sketch of the proof presented in (Voronin and Karatsuba, 1992) follows. We consider only the case where U is a disk centered at 3/4: :U=\\\\\\\\{ s\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} : s-3/4 and we will argue that every non-zero holomorphic function defined on U can be approximated by the ζ-function on a vertical translation of this set. Passing to the logarithm, it is enough to show that for every holomorphic function and every there exists a real number t such that : \\\\left \\\\ln \\\\zeta(s+it)-g(s) \\\\right < \\\\varepsilon \\\\quad \\\\text{for all} \\\\quad s \\\\in U. We will first approximate g(s) with the logarithm of certain finite products reminiscent of the Euler product for the ζ-function: :\\\\zeta(s)=\\\\prod_{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p^s}\\\\right)^{-1} , where P denotes the set of all primes. If \\\\theta=(\\\\theta_p)_{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}} is a sequence of real numbers, one for each prime p, and M is a finite set of primes, we set :\\\\zeta_M(s,\\\\theta)=\\\\prod_{p\\\\in M}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\theta_p}}{p^s}\\\\right)^{-1}. We consider the specific sequence :\\\\hat\\\\theta=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4},\\\\frac{2}{4},\\\\frac{3}{4},\\\\frac{4}{4},\\\\frac{5}{4},\\\\ldots\\\\right) and claim that g(s) can be approximated by a function of the form \\\\ln(\\\\zeta_M(s,\\\\hat\\\\theta)) for a suitable set M of primes. The proof of this claim utilizes the Bergman space, falsely named Hardy space in (Voronin and Karatsuba, 1992), in H of holomorphic functions defined on U, a Hilbert space. We set :u_k(s)=\\\\ln\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\pi i k/2}}{p_k^s} \\\\right) where pk denotes the k-th prime number. It can then be shown that the series :\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty u_k is conditionally convergent in H, i.e. for every element v of H there exists a rearrangement of the series which converges in H to v. This argument uses a theorem that generalizes the Riemann series theorem to a Hilbert space setting. Because of a relationship between the norm in H and the maximum absolute value of a function, we can then approximate our given function g(s) with an initial segment of this rearranged series, as required. By a version of the Kronecker theorem, applied to the real numbers \\\\frac{\\\\ln 2}{2\\\\pi}, \\\\frac{\\\\ln 3}{2\\\\pi}, \\\\frac{\\\\ln 5}{2\\\\pi},\\\\ldots,\\\\frac{\\\\ln p_N}{2\\\\pi} (which are linearly independent over the rationals) we can find real values of t so that \\\\ln(\\\\zeta_M(s,\\\\hat\\\\theta)) is approximated by \\\\ln(\\\\zeta_M(s+it,0)). Further, for some of these values t, \\\\ln(\\\\zeta_M(s+it,0)) approximates \\\\ln(\\\\zeta(s+it)), finishing the proof. The theorem is stated without proof in § 11.11 of (Titchmarsh and Heath-Brown, 1986), the second edition of a 1951 monograph by Titchmarsh; and a weaker result is given in Thm. 11.9. Although Voronin's theorem is not proved there, two corollaries are derived from it: :1) Let \\\\tfrac12<\\\\sigma<1 be fixed. Then the curve ::\\\\gamma(t)=(\\\\zeta(\\\\sigma+i t),\\\\zeta'(\\\\sigma+i t),\\\\dots,\\\\zeta^{(n-1)}(\\\\sigma+i t)) :is dense in \\\\mathbb{C}^n. :2) Let \\\\Phi be any continuous function, and let h_1,h_2,\\\\dots,h_n be real constants. :Then \\\\zeta(s) cannot satisfy the differential-difference equation :: \\\\Phi\\\\\\\\{\\\\zeta(s+h_1),\\\\zeta'(s+h_1),\\\\dots,\\\\zeta^{(n_1)}(s+h_1), \\\\zeta(s+h_2),\\\\zeta'(s+h_2),\\\\dots,\\\\zeta^{(n_2)}(s+h_2),\\\\dots \\\\\\\\} =0 :unless \\\\Phi vanishes identically. Effective universality Some recent work has focused on effective universality. Under the conditions stated at the beginning of this article, there exist values of t that satisfy inequality (1). An effective universality theorem places an upper bound on the smallest such t. For example, in 2003, Garunkštis proved that if f(s) is analytic in s \\\\leq .05 with \\\\max_{ \\\\left  s \\\\right  \\\\leq .05} \\\\left  f(s) \\\\right  \\\\leq 1, then for any ε in 0 < \\\\epsilon < 1/2, there exists a number t in 0 \\\\leq t \\\\leq \\\\exp({ \\\\exp({10/\\\\epsilon^{13} }) }) such that : \\\\max_{\\\\left  s \\\\right  \\\\leq .0001} \\\\left  \\\\log \\\\zeta(s + \\\\frac{3}{4} + i t) - f(s) \\\\right  < \\\\epsilon . For example, if \\\\epsilon = 1/10, then the bound for t is t \\\\leq \\\\exp({ \\\\exp({10/\\\\epsilon^{13} }) }) = \\\\exp({ \\\\exp({10^{14} }) }) . Bounds can also be obtained on the measure of these t values, in terms of ε: : \\\\liminf_{T\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ t\\\\in[0,T] : \\\\max_{\\\\left  s \\\\right  \\\\leq .0001} \\\\left  \\\\log \\\\zeta(s + \\\\frac{3}{4} + i t) - f(s) \\\\right  < \\\\epsilon \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right) \\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\exp( {\\\\epsilon^{-13}} )} . For example, if \\\\epsilon = 1/10, then the right-hand side is 1/\\\\exp( {10^{13}} ) . See. Universality of other zeta functions Work has been done showing that universality extends to Selberg zeta functions The Dirichlet L-functions show not only universality, but a certain kind of joint universality that allow any set of functions to be approximated by the same value(s) of t in different L-functions, where each function to be approximated is paired with a different L-function. A similar universality property has been shown for the Lerch zeta function L(\\\\lambda, \\\\alpha, s), at least when the parameter α is a transcendental number. Sections of the Lerch zeta-function have also been shown to have a form of joint universality. References Further reading  * External links * Voronin's Universality Theorem, by Matthew R.

Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid, a Turkic mamluk soldier, was appointed governor by the Abbasid Caliph.C.E. Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, (Columbia University Press, 1996), 62. The dynasty carried the Arabic title \\"Wāli\\" reflecting their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids. The Ikhshidids came to an end when the Fatimid army conquered Fustat in 969.The Fatimid Revolution (861-973) and its aftermath in North Africa, Michael Brett, The Cambridge History of Africa, Vol. 2 ed. J. D. Fage, Roland Anthony Oliver, (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 622. History =Founding= The creation of the Ikhshidid state was part of the wider disintegration and decentralisation of the Abbasids after the Anarchy at Samarra, whereupon government became more decentralised. The founder, Muhammad ibn Tughj al- Ikhshid, possessed some form of military power and was on friendly relations with Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, a powerful military leader. Before he was appointed to Fustat he held the post of governor of Damascus. He was first appointed to the post of Governor of Egypt in 933 but did not enter it during the first stint. In 935 he was appointed a second time to the governorship whilst the country was in a state of war with multiple factions. He launched a campaign to conquer Egypt by land and sea, the naval forces taking Tinnis and able to outflank Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh, the main opponent, forcing his retreat and facilitating ibn Tughj's subsequent entry to Fustat in August. The Fatimids were a major threat at the time and considerable effort was put into repelling them, culminating in their defeat by Ubayd Allah, ibn Tughj's brother, by November 936. There was remarkable stability in the early years, with an absence of economic chaos and Bedouin raids, coupled with prohibition of looting, which helped pacify Egypt. Ibn Tughj sought the honorific title (laqab) of Al-Ikhshīd, which means \\"King of the Farghanians\\", from the Abbasids and official designation arrived in July 939. =Consolidation= Muhammad ibn Ra'iq took over Syria in 939, which threatened Egypt. Enraged, ibn Tughj threatened to recognise the Fatimids, the Abbasids' enemy as the Abbasid caliph did not formally declare for ibn Tughj, the de jure governor. Nonetheless, his simple goals resulted in mainly defensive actions and eventually came to terms with ibn Ra'iq where ibn Tughj would continue to have Egypt and the same for ibn Ra'iq in Syria, partitioned along Ramla-Tiberias. In 944, the governorships of Egypt, Syria and Hijaz were awarded for 30 years to ibn Tughj's family, and these posts would pass to his son, Abu'l-Qasim. In 942 he began striking coins in his own name, and the changes of power in Baghdad meant less central authority. In 945 he defeated Sayf al-Dawla, another adversary who took over Damascus, which resulted in a truce until his death in 946. Abu'l-Qasim inherited the conflict with Sayf al-Dawla and fought him at Damascus, and al-Dawla soon occupied Aleppo in 947. There was a simultaneous revolt by Ghabun, governor of Middle Egypt, who managed to occupy Fustat before his death in the same year. Nonetheless, Kafur's continuation of the appeasement policy managed to negotiate a settlement between the Ikhshidids and the Hamdanids where Damascus became Egyptian again and the tribute to the Hamdanids stopped, with borders largely in line with status quo ante bellum. This peace practically settled the Ikhshidid borders and left the Fatimids again as the main threat, with the Byzantines now the responsibility of the Hamdanids. Kafur wielded real authority following ibn Tughj's death in 946 and was highly regarded among contemporaries. =Troubles, decline and conquest by Fatimids= Nubian incursions occurred in 950 and a more serious invasion took place in 965, when Aswan was pillaged. This coincided with the famine of 963–968 while Berbers, Bedouins and Qarmatians all took advantage of the weakened state. In 966 Kafur took over after Abu'l-Hasan's death, which further increased uncertainty due to his status as a eunuch. Nonetheless he received the title 'Ustādh,' meaning \\"master,\\" from Baghdad, which gave him some legitimacy. Ibn Killis, Kafur's vizier, was arrested following Kafur's death in 968 and following his release traveled to Fatimid Ifriqiya and provided vital information to them. In 934 a Fatimid invasion led by the eunuch Raydan managed to capture Alexandria but was repulsed. Only a later attempt by the Fatimid general Jawhar al-Siqilli managed to conquer Egypt in 969. Ubayd Allah, brother of Muhammad ibn Tughj, held out in Syria until March 970, when he was defeated and taken prisoner by Ja'far ibn Fallah, signalling the end of the Ikhshidid dynasty as a ruling power. Ikhshidid rulers * 935–946 Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid (محمد بن طغج الإخشيد) * 946–961 Abu'l-Qasim Unujur ibn al-Ikhshid (أبو القاسم أنوجور بن الإخشيد) * 961–966 Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Ikhshid (أبو الحسن علي بن الإخشيد) * 966–968 Abu'l-Misk Kafur (أبو المسك كافور) * 968–969 Abu'l-Fawaris Ahmad ibn Ali ibn al-Ikhshid (أبو الفوارس أحمد بن علي بن الإخشيد) Military Like the Fatimids after them, the Ikhshidids made use of Black slave troops. The practice began with the Tulunids in 870 AD, where the Africans were used as infantrymen, and continued by the Ikhshidids due to financial reasons, as they were cheaper than Turkish military slaves which were used as cavalry. Coinage Only gold coins are common, with coppers being extremely rare. Dinars were mainly struck at Misr (Fustat) and Filastin (al-Ramla), and dirhams were usually struck at Filastin, and less often at Tabariya, Dimashq, and Hims. Other mints for dirhams are quite rare. Dinars from Misr are often well struck, while the Filastin dinars are more crude. Dirhams are usually crudely struck and often are illegible on half of the coin.Album, Stephen.

The title is of Iranian origin; scholars have derived it variously from the Old Iranian root khshaeta, \\"shining, brilliant\\", or from khshāyathiya, \\"ruler, king\\" (which is also the origin of the title shah). The Ikhshids of Soghdia, with their capital at Samarkand, are well attested during and after the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. The line survived into Abbasid times, although by then its seat was in Istikhan. Among the most notable and energetic of the Soghdian kings was Gurak, who in 710 overthrew his predecessor Tarkhun and for almost thirty years, through shifting alliances, managed to preserve a precarious autonomy between the expanding Umayyad Caliphate and the Türgesh khaganate. The Arab authors report that the title was also used by the ruler of Ferghana during the same period: Ibn al-Athir reports that it was the ikhshid of Ferghana who called upon the Chinese for aid against the Arabs, resulting in the Battle of Talas. The title's prestige in Central Asia remained high as late as the 10th century, when it was adopted by the Turkic commander and ruler of Egypt Muhammad ibn Tughj, whose grandfather had come from Ferghana. After his title the short-lived dynasty founded by Muhammad al-Ikhshid is known as the Ikhshidid dynasty.

Taiwanese and Vietnamese immigrants of Chinese descent opened up the first toy stores in the early 1980s, and at first these merchants sold toys only during holiday periods. Among them was the Woo family, and the most successful entrepreneur of that clan was Charles Woo, born in Hong Kong and settling in Los Angeles as a teenager in 1968. Woo was a physics student at UCLA when he took a summer off to help other family members launch ABC Toys, a wholesale business later operated by Shu Woo.

Ninety percent of the stores sell at wholesale prices.Bob Pool, \\"Blowing the Lid Off a Hot Commodity,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 10, 2005, page B-1 Charles Woo said that he built up volume in his business by halving the 40 to 50 percent markup typically sought by traditional small toy wholesalers. The growth of the toy industry in this area helped revive these economically stricken areas of Downtown Los Angeles, and the process gave birth to the Toy District, which by 2003 was home to hundreds of resellers of mostly Asian-made toys and other goods, with more than a billion dollars in sales each year.Michael Hiltzik, \\"No Joy in the Toy Trade as Price Cutting Persists,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 25, 2003, page C-1 Los Angeles County has emerged as the gateway to most of the toys sold in U.S. retail stores and increasingly abroad. More than five hundred companies make up the toy industry in the county – not only in the Toy District – and they are mainly wholesalers who import dolls, radio-controlled cars and other goods from Pacific Rim countries. They generally are small, and they employ few workers each. Business Improvement District Around 1998, a business improvement district, or BID, was established by property owners in the neighborhood to clean streets and improve security, but by 2009 there was widespread discontent among the owners about the role of the district, which had been paying for trash pickup and security patrols through special assessments on the properties. The Central City East Association, the nonprofit organization that managed the district, had been trying to husband the district's dwindling funds so a street-trash problem grew worse. The district went out of business in 2009 when property owners defeated a proposal to renew its mandate. On January 1, 2010, the Central City East Association stopped providing trash removal and other services in the Toy District. Even before that date, cardboard boxes and other garbage began to pile up on neighborhood streets. Workers from the BID had regularly hauled more than five tons of garbage daily from the area. Many landlords cited the poor economy and a dip in the rental market, saying they could not afford the BID's annual dues, which ranged from a few hundred to more than one hundred thousand dollars.Anna Scott, \\"From Toy District to Trash District:One Month Before Business Improvement District Expires, Garbage Piles Up,' DT News, November 25, 1009Gale Holland, \\"L.A. Business Improvement Districts' Value Questioned,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 15, 2013 Several factors contributed to the trash problem. Stores received large shipments of merchandise, and some business owners dumped the packing materials on the streets at the end of each day, assuming the city would take care of it. Additionally, many of the district's cramped shops were housed in larger, subdivided storefronts and they did not have ready access to alleys or other areas large enough to hold dumpsters. Homelessness and vandalism The district is also home to a portion of downtown's homeless population, with homeless people sleeping at night on the sidewalks. By 2010 street lights had been stripped of salable metal parts and entire blocks were left in darkness.

A winner of over 50 International titles, Bustamante is considered one of the greatest professional pool players of all time. Early life Bustamante is the youngest of eight siblings. People in his vicinity nicknamed him \\"Django\\" because of his scrappy nature and the way he often appeared with a cigarette in his mouth reminded them of the movie character of that name. The character was portrayed by an Italian actor. Their father made a living through building toilets and planting rice, and Bustamante engaged himself in the activities also. His life in pool began when he worked in his sister's pool hall, racking and spotting balls on the tables. When the patrons left and the place closed for the night, the young Bustamante would grab a stick and practice alone. He never completed high school and has been concentrating in pocket billiards from 10 years of age. He quoted: :\\"Magaling ako noon pa at 1975 pa halos hindi na natatalo sa aming lugar kaya naglibot ako, una sa buong Luzon tapos sa buong bansa na para lamang kumita ng pera.\\" (\\"I was great before and in 1975 I mostly don't lose in my hometown thus I started travelling, first in the entire Luzon then the entire country just to make some money.\\") After some success in the Philippines, Bustamante moved to Germany where he stayed for more than a decade, competing in a number of tournaments in Europe. Professional career Bustamante has been playing since the age of ten, and has won titles such as the Munich Masters, the German Nine-ball Championship, and the Japan Nine-ball Championship, making him one of billiards' greatest international stars. With his win in Tulsa, Bustamante locked up the 1998 Camel Pro Billiards Series year-long point fund's top spot. He then finished the season in record-breaking style, winning the Columbus 10-Ball Open and becoming the first player to win three Camel titles in one season. His Columbus 10-Ball title also completed the first ever Camel trifecta, with titles in each of the three games contested on the Camel Pro Billiards Series: eight-ball, nine-ball and ten-ball. Known for his style at the table and behind-the-back shots, Bustamante is one of the best Filipino players of the game along with fellow Kapampangan Efren Reyes, Marlon Manalo and Ronato Alcano. He also holds the world record for having the most powerful break shot. In 1999, Bustamante finished 3rd place in the WPA World Nine-ball Championship after losing to Efren Reyes, who later won it. Months later, he won the International Challenge of Champions. He won that tournament again three years later. The next year, Bustamante won the Motolite 9-ball Tournament, an event held in the Philippines, at the expense of Antonio Lining. The victory earned him $30K, which was the largest first prize offered in a Philippine-held tournament at that time (this was later surpassed when Alcano won $100K in the 2006 WPA World Nine-ball Championship, which was held in that country). The year 2002 was probably the darkest year for Bustamante, especially considering his experience at the World Pool Championships. While the tournament was still going on, Bustamante was most shocked when he received a phone call from his wife informing him that his daughter, who was less than a year old, had died. Devastated by this, Bustamante strongly considered forfeiting his contention at the tournament to return to the Philippines, but some people around convinced him to go on.Interview with Francisco Bustamante , AzBilliards.com. Retrieved June 18, 2007 On his way to the final, Bustamante bested Antonio Lining in the last 16, Efren Reyes in the quarter finals, and Ching Shun Yang in the semis. In the final, he met Earl Strickland, the 2-time winner of the tournament. Bustamante was leading most of the time and could have won the title. At one point, he went for a jump shot but missed. Strickland returned to the table and won three racks in a row to win the match 17–15. His loss in the finals of the World Championship was most definitely a big blow to him because his lack of focus on the match cost him the tournament. Later on, however, Bustamante regained momentum and began winning more tournaments. Bustamante won the Peninsula Nine-ball Open, Gabriel's Las Vegas International Nine-ball tournament, the IBC Tokyo Nine- ball International, and the All Japan Nine-ball Championship. He even won the Sudden Death Seven-ball tournament and dedicated the victory to his daughter, whom he had tragically lost. With such a string of victories, he became the AZBilliards 2002 Player of the Year.2002 AzBilliards Men's Player of the Year, Francisco Bustamante , AzBilliards.com. Retrieved June 18, 2007 Bustamante also won the tournament called the World Pool League in 2004 where he defeated the then world nine-ball champion Alex Pagulayan. He reached the finals of that event in 2001 but was bested by Steve Knight of Great Britain. In 2007, he was undefeated in the United States Pro Tour Championship held at the Normandie Casino in Los Angeles, California.Bustamante Wins US Pro Tour Championship at Normandie Casino , AzBilliards.com. Retrieved June 18, 2007 For 2007, he was ranked #7 in Pool & Billiard Magazine's \\"Fans' Top 20 Favorite Players\\" poll. He competed in the 2008 World Straight Pool Championship as the Philippines' only entry. This was his first-ever participation in straight pool event. In the end, he finished at 2nd place behind Niels Feijen, the tournament winner. In 2010, Bustamante again reached the finals of the World Nine-ball Championship. Unlike his first final eight years ago, fate did not deny him. Bustamante won the match and the title against Taiwan's Kuo Po-cheng, a second-placer in the 2005 event. On July 27, 2010, Francisco Bustamante, along with Terry Bell and Larry Hubbart who are founders of the American Pool Players Association (APA), were elected to the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame. In this, Bustamante would become the second player from the Philippines after Efren Reyes to be added. The three were inducted on October 21, 2010. Film On June 15, 2008, Efren Reyes, Francisco \\"Django\\" Bustamante, and 2007 Women's Amway World Pool Championships finalist, Rubilen \\"Bingkay\\" Amit, will begin photography and had been cast to star with American Jennifer Barretta in an independent film, 9-Ball, at Universal Studios.

History The Historic Core was the central business district of the city from the first decade of the 1900s through the 1950s. Before 1900 the business center was further north, between the Plaza and about Third Street.\\"Early Los Angeles Historical Buildings (1800s)\\", Water and Power Associates Starting in the 1950s what is now the Historic Core started to decline. Upscale shopping had moved west to the Seventh & Hope area starting in the 1920s, and to Mid-Wilshire by the 1930s. When consumers lived and worked near the prolific streetcar lines, it was relatively easy for them to reach downtown, the hub of both the Los Angeles Railway and Pacific Electric systems. Now, an ever increasing number of consumers had cars, lived further away from downtown, and due to the proliferation of suburban retail, were able to shop, dine, and go to the movies there without worries about downtown parking and traffic congestion. In addition, after World War II, financial institutions moved several blocks to the west, ending up on Figueroa Street, Flower Street, and Grand Avenue. In the 1950s the Historic Core became the center of Latino retail and entertainment in the city, e.g.: the Million Dollar Theatre featured the biggest names in the Spanish language entertainment world. This paralleled the general white flight occurring in Central Los Angeles at the time, which saw Broadway become a major center for Latino life in the city. Although prostitution and drug dealing had occurred in the area as far back as the early 1920s, they became epidemic in the 1960s. The area's movie palaces, built between 1911 and 1931, became grindhouses. The last of them closed in the 1990s; the Orpheum Theatre recently underwent a complete restoration at a cost of several million dollars, and is now used for major movie premieres (such as \\"Collateral\\" in 2005), celebrity events (Michael Jackson's birthday party), comedy shows (Bill Burr), fashion shows, concerts (Opeth), and plays. Most of the older buildings have stores that cater to the Latino immigrant working class. The developing street gang problem in Los Angeles which began to worsen at the end of the 1960s and got considerably worse in the late 1970s, also hurt traditional commercial activity in the area, as it did much of downtown. While the LAPD indicates that the area is a sort of neutral zone, which has not been claimed by any single gang and random gang violence is rare, the area remains one of the major areas for street drug sales in Los Angeles.

As of 2005, redevelopment projects in downtown Los Angeles have been divided about evenly between rentals and condominiums; though projects near the Staples Center arena in the South Park neighborhood have been overwhelmingly dedicated to condominiums.

It was founded early in 2005 with a view to contesting the municipal elections to the Lautoka City Council, scheduled for 22 October 2005. It failed to win any seats, however, either in the main election, or in the special election on 12 November for four seats in the Simla ward, which had been postponed. The party contested the election on an anti-corruption platform. The Fiji Labour Party, which dominated the council, had recently suspended nine councillors - its entire council membership - in the wake of revelations that they had granted taxi bases to friends and colleagues. The SCRA called for the same standards of accountability that are required of parliamentarians to be applicable to municipal councillors. The SCRA welcomed the Labour Party's decision to suspend its councillors, but claimed that the move did not go far enough. Alliance chairman Faaiaz Ali said that the same rules that required members of Parliament suspended from their parties to resign should be applied to local government office holders, as with no party to answer to, they could be an even greater threat to ratepayers. \\"Now these councillors who have been suspended can do anything they want and they will definitely do everything they please because their term will expire in October,\\" Ali said. He called for the Local Government Act to be amended to allow for their dismissal. On 11 October, Ali announced that the Alliance would contest 9 of the 16 seats on the council. The party has nominated three candidates for each of the Waiyavi, Tavakubu and Veitari wards (multi-member constituencies), but has chosen not to contest the Simla Ward. Ali gave no reason for the decision to leave Simla uncontested, but said that the party was confident of winning most, if not all, of the 9 seats it was contending for. There is one woman among the six Indo-Fijians and three indigenous Fijians standing for the party. Ali himself is standing for the Veitari ward. The same day, Ali warned city residents not to vote for candidates who hold permanent residency status in other countries. The Fijian constitution forbids dual citizenship, but permanent residency, which amounts to a kind of second-class in a number of other countries, is not covered by the ban. Ali said that holding Permanent Residency in another country made it too easy for councillors to abscond rather than face up to allegations of misconduct of council business, and that voters should be wary of such candidates. Considerable publicity for the Alliance failed to break the hold of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) on the City Council, however. The FLP ended up with 12 seats and the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) 4. Some time after the military coup of 2006, the SCRA was effectively dissolved.

It is loosely based on the posthumously published 1986 Anaïs Nin book of the same name, and tells the story of Nin's relationship with Henry Miller and his wife, June. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 63rd Academy Awards. It is one of three NC-17 films to receive Oscar nominations; the other films are Wild at Heart (1990) and Requiem for a Dream (2000). Plot synopsis In 1931 in Paris, France, Anaïs Nin is in a stable relationship with her husband Hugo, but longs for more out of life. When Nin first meets Henry Miller, he is working on his first novel. Nin is drawn to Miller and his wife June, as well as their bohemian lifestyle. Nin becomes involved in the couple's tormented relationship, having an affair with Miller and also pursuing June. Ultimately, Nin helps Miller to publish his novel, Tropic of Cancer, but catalyzes the Millers' separation, while she returns to Hugo.

NC-17 was intended to signify serious, non-pornographic films with more violence or (especially) sexual content than would qualify for an R rating. The inclusion of the postcard Nin views at the start of the film (which is of Hokusai's The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife), and some scenes of le Bal des Beaux Arts contributed to the NC-17 rating. The film was given a more lenient M rating in Australia and an uncut 18 in the United Kingdom. Conversely, it was banned in South Africa. The ban has since been lifted. The film was given an R18 rating in New Zealand. Reception =Box office= Henry & June grossed $11,567,449 in the domestic market and $11,905,000 internationally for a worldwide total of $23,472,449. =Critical reception= The film received mixed reviews from critics. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-, but felt that, \\"Kaufman, trying to deepen the erotic explorations of Unbearable Lightness, ends up with a triangle movie that’s watchable but also arty and rather stilted. The biggest disappointment of the film is that, after all the ratings brouhaha, it’s not very sexy.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times noted the film's efforts to present sex in a more artistic, highbrow manner, remarking, \\"The film's sex scenes, photographed delicately by Philippe Rousselot and directed with great intensity by Mr. Kaufman, are particularly lofty. These sequences, often tinged with symbolism (a hand playing a guitar juxtaposed with a hand on a woman's breast), tend to be self- consciously bold,\\" but felt the film lacked daring. The film has a 62% approval rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 6.09/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Henry & June celebrates sensuality and passion, though the portentous filmmaking drags it down by a large degree\\".

It is located on the site of the mostly-demolished business district of the city during the 1880s and 1890s. Location The Civic Center is located in the northern part of Downtown Los Angeles, bordering Bunker Hill, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and the Historic Core of the old Downtown. Depending on various district definitions, either the Civic Center or Bunker Hill also contains the Music Center and adjacent Walt Disney Concert Hall; some maps, for example, place the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the Civic Center but the Disney Concert Hall in Bunker Hill. The Civic Center has the distinction of containing the largest concentration of government employees in the United States outside of Washington, D.C. The reason for the high concentration is simple: Los Angeles is the most populous county in the United States and its second largest city, and houses several state and federal functions for the region. =Other locations= Los Angeles' 1949 master plan called for branch administrative centers throughout the city, as it was rapidly expanding. In addition to the main civic center downtown, there is the West Los Angeles Civic Center in the Westside (built between 1957 and 1965) and the Van Nuys Civic Center in the San Fernando Valley, as well as a neighborhood city hall in San Pedro. Transportation The Civic Center is served by numerous Metro buses, most of which run to adjacent Union Station, the 101 and 110 freeways, and the Metro B Line and D Line's Civic Center/Grand Park Station are also in the vicinity. OCTA, Foothill Transit, DASH shuttles, Commuter Express and other municipal bus lines also serve the area. The Regional Connector, currently under construction, will serve this area with two stations at Second/Flower and Second/Broadway station. History and planning Part of what is now the Civic Center occupies what was the central business district (CBD) in the 1880s and 1890s, which was first centered at the southern end of the Los Angeles Plaza and grew to the south and west along Main Street, Spring Street and Broadway, with Third & Broadway forming its southwestern anchor by the mid-1890s. The Civic Center area is part of the ongoing Grand Avenue Project, which aims to develop existing parking lots in the area for residential and commercial use as well as create a Grand Park between the Los Angeles Music Center and City Hall. In March 2017, the Los Angeles City Council approved a new Civic Center Master Plan (CCMP). It details a full build out around city hall by the year 2032, specifically the east facing front. The CCMP schedules for a full tear down of Parker Center (torn down in 2019), L.A. City Hall's \\"south\\" building, and the Los Angeles Mall. The CCMP is to connect City Hall with its surrounding neighborhood and Little Tokyo.https://civiccenterprojects.lacity.org/sites/default/files/CCD%20190208%20DRAFT%20Community%20Meeting%203.pdf The CCMP calls for active ground-floor uses, to stimulate the pedestrian traffic that the Civic Center currently lacks. Four new government and office towers are described in the plan as well as the planned Park 101 recreational area. A design approach idea to cover U.S. Highway 101 as a trench with green space above.

Portrait of David Garrick as Kitely by Joshua Reynolds. Every Man in His Humour is a 1598 play by the English playwright Ben Jonson. The play belongs to the subgenre of the \\"humours comedy,\\" in which each major character is dominated by an over-riding humour or obsession. Performance and publication All the available evidence indicates that the play was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men in 1598 at the Curtain Theatre. That date is given in the play's reprint in Jonson's 1616 folio collection of his works; the text of the play (IV,iv,15) contains an allusion to John Barrose, a Burgundian fencer who challenged all comers that year and was hanged for murder on 10 July 1598. The play was also acted at Court on 2 February 1605.Chambers, Elizabethan Stage, Vol. 3, p. 359-60. A theatre legend first recorded in 1709 by Nicholas Rowe has it that Shakespeare advocated production of the play at a point when the company was about to reject it. While this legend is unverifiable, it is almost certain, based on the playlist published in the folio, that Shakespeare played the part of Kno'well, the aged father. This is consistent with Shakespeare's habit of playing older characters, such as Adam in As You Like It. The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company on 4 August 1600, along with the Shakespearean plays As You Like It, Much Ado About Nothing, and Henry V, in an entry marked \\"to be stayed.\\" It is thought that this entry was an attempt to block publication of the four plays; if so, the attempt failed, since the latter three plays appeared in print soon after. Every Man In was re- registered ten days later, on 14 August 1600, by the booksellers Cuthbert Burby and Walter Burre; the first quarto was published in 1601, with Burre's name on the title page. In the 1601 Quarto version, the play was set in Florence. The play was next printed in Jonson's 1616 folio, with the setting being moved to LondonChambers, Vol. 3, p. 259. The play's contemporary popularity is attested by such quick publication; although there are few records of performance, it presumably stayed in the King's Men's repertory until the theatres closed in 1642. Gerard Langbaine reports that the play was revived by the King's Company in 1675. The play remained vivid enough in memory for John Rich to revive it at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1725. However, it was not until David Garrick revived the play with substantial alterations in 1751 that the play regained currency on the English stage. Garrick's revisions served to focus attention on Kitely's jealousy; he both trimmed lines from the other plots and added a scene in which he attempts to elicit information from Cob while hiding his jealousy. The scene was a favourite, praised by Arthur Murphy and others; Kitely became one of Garrick's signature roles, and the play was never long out of his repertory. The play declined in popularity in the last quarter of the century, in large part because it was seen as a Garrick vehicle. George Frederick Cooke revived the play at Covent Garden. Elizabeth Inchbald lauded the performance, calling Cooke's Kitely the equal of Garrick's. Cooke had mixed success with the play, though; it failed in Edinburgh in 1808. After 1803, Cooke may have alternated with Kemble in the title role for productions at Covent Garden. Thereafter, the play has been subject to tentative revivals, none of which have established it as viable for modern repertory. Edmund Kean played Kitely in an unsuccessful 1816 production; his performance was praised by William Hazlitt. William Charles Macready essayed the role at the Haymarket Theatre in 1838; Robert Browning attended and approved the performance, but the play did not figure prominently in Macready's repertory. Perhaps the most unusual revival occurred in 1845, when Charles Dickens and his friends mounted a benefit production. Aided by Macready, Dickens took the faintly Dickensian role of Bobadill; George Cruikshank was Cob; John Forster played Kitely. The production went off well enough to be repeated three or four times over the next two years. Bulwer- Lytton wrote a poem as prologue for an 1847 production; in addition to Browning, Tennyson and John Payne Collier attended. Ben Iden Payne produced the play in Manchester in 1909, and again in Stratford for the Jonson tercentenary in 1937. The later production received much more favourable reviews. John Caird directed the play during the inaugural season of the Swan Theatre in 1986. Plot and style In general outline, this play follows Latin models quite closely. In the main plot, a gentleman named Kno'well, concerned for his son's moral development, attempts to spy on his son, a typical city gallant; however, his espionage is continually subverted by the servant, Brainworm, whom he employs for this purpose. These types are clearly slightly Anglicized versions of ancient types of Greek New Comedy, namely the senex, the son, and the slave. In the subplot, a merchant named Kitely suffers intense jealousy, fearing that his wife is cuckolding him with some of the wastrels brought to his home by his brother-in-law, Wellbred. The characters of these two plots are surrounded by various \\"humorous\\" characters, all in familiar English types: the irascible soldier, country gull, pretentious pot- poets, surly water-bearer, and avuncular judge all make an appearance. The play works through a series of complications which culminate when the justice, Clement, hears and decides all of the characters' various grievances, exposing each of them as based in humour, misperception, or deceit. Jonson's purpose is delineated in the prologue he wrote for the folio version. These lines, which have justly been taken as applying to Jonson's comic theory in general, are especially appropriate to this play. He promises to present \\"deeds, and language, such as men do use:/ And persons, such as comedy would choose,/ When she would show an Image of the times,/ And sport with human follies, not with crimes.\\" The play follows out this implicit rejection of the romantic comedy of his peers. It sticks quite carefully to the Aristotelian unities; the plot is a tightly woven mesh of act and reaction; the scenes a genial collection of depictions of everyday life in a large Renaissance city. History Critics of the nineteenth century tended to credit Jonson with the introduction of \\"humour\\" comedy into English literature. It is now well known, not only that George Chapman's An Humorous Day's Mirth preceded Jonson's play by a year or more, but that Jonson himself was not especially intrigued by the trope of \\"humours.\\" Since only Kitely is dominated by a \\"humour\\" as Jonson defined it in Every Man Out of His Humour, it seems more likely that Jonson was using a contemporary taste aroused by Chapman to draw interest to his play, which became his first indisputable hit. Jonson revised the play for the 1616 folio, where it was the first play presented. The most significant change was in the location. The 1598 edition was set in a vaguely identified Florence. Even in the original version, the background details were English; the revision formalises this fact by giving the characters English names and replacing the vaguely English details with specific references to London places. The folio also gives a cast list for the original 1598 production. After Shakespeare, the main players are given in the following order: Richard Burbage, Augustine Phillips, John Heminges, Henry Condell, Thomas Pope, William Sly, Christopher Beeston, William Kempe, and John Duke. (Kempe would leave the company the next year, for his famous morris dance from London to Norwich.) In 1599, Jonson wrote what would prove to be a much less popular sequel, Every Man out of His Humour. The play was revived around 1670; Sackville provided a verse epilogue in which Jonson himself appeared as a ghost. David Garrick brought a revised version to the stage in 1751; the changes he made served chiefly to focus attention on the part of Kitely, which he played. The largest change was an entirely new scene featuring only Kitely and his wife, in which Kitely attempts to hide his jealousy. The production featured a prologue by William Whitehead and proved popular enough for many revivals. However, as critics near the end of the eighteenth century noted, the play's popularity arose more from Garrick than from Jonson; the play fell from regular use, with the rest of Jonson's comedies, by the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Every Man out of His Humour is a satirical comedy written by English playwright Ben Jonson, acted in 1599 by the Lord Chamberlain's Men. It is a conceptual sequel to his 1598 comedy Every Man in His Humour. It was much less successful on stage than its predecessor, though it was published in quarto three times in 1600 alone; it was also performed at Court on 8 January 1605. The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company on 8 April 1600 by the bookseller William Holme, who published the first quarto of the play soon after. Holmes issued a second quarto later that year, with the printing done by Peter Short. Yet a third quarto appeared in 1600, published by Nicholas Ling, the stationer who would issue the \\"bad quarto\\" of Hamlet three years later. W. W. Greg characterized Ling's Q3 as \\"A careless and ignorant reprint\\" of Q1.Chambers, Elizabethan Stage, Vol. 3, p. 361. Every Man Out contains an allusion to John Marston's Histriomastix in Act III, scene i, a play that was acted in the autumn of 1599; the clown character Clove speaks \\"fustian\\" in mimicry of Marston's style. This is one instance of Jonson's involvement in the War of the Theatres. Scholars have found references to Sir Walter Raleigh and Gabriel Harvey. The characters Fastidious Brisk and Carlo Buffone in Every Man Out-- like Hedon and Anaides in Cynthia's Revels and Crispinus and Demeter in The Poetaster--are representations of Marston and Thomas Dekker.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 363. The character Sogliardo, who Jonson includes in his general mockery of socially ambitious fools, is a country bumpkin, new to the city, who boasts of the coat of arms he has recently purchased, which, when he describes its colors, resembles a fool’s motley. Another character suggests Sogliardo should use the motto, \\"Not Without Mustard\\". This has been construed by some critics as a reference to William Shakespeare’s recently acquired coat of arms with its gold color, and its motto, Non Sans Droit, which translates as \\"Not Without Right\\".Tiffany, Grace. “Shakespeare’s Playwrights”. Desai, R. W. Shakespeare the Man: New Decipherings. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. (2014) When the play was reprinted in Jonson's folio collection of 1616, a cast list of the original 1599 production was included. From this, it is known that the leading players were Richard Burbage, John Heminges, Henry Condell, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, and William Sly. Shakespeare was not part of the production, though he had played in Every Man in His Humour the year before. Every Man Out of His Humour includes several references to Shakespeare and his contemporaneous works: a mention of Justice Silence from Henry IV, Part 2--\\"this is a kinsman to Justice Silence\\" (V,ii) and two allusions to Julius Caesar, which help to date that play to 1599. \\"Et tu, Brute\\" occurs in V,iv of Every Man Out; in III,i appears \\"reason long since is fled to animals,\\" a paraphrase of Shakespeare's line \\"O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts\\" in Julius Caesar, III,ii,104.

The reason for the name is not known, but likely originates in the fact that perseverance is necessary to succeed. Rules First, the four aces are taken out of the deck. These form the four foundations. Then the rest are shuffled and dealt into twelve piles of four cards each. One can distribute one card at a time for each pile or deal four cards at a time to form a pile. The top cards of each pile are available for play to the foundations or on the tableau piles. The foundations are built up by suit, with the cards on the tableau are built down, also by suit. One card can be moved at a time. However, the player is allowed to move a sequence of cards as a unit to another pile with an appropriate card (e.g. 6-5-4-3♠ can be placed on the 7♠). When all possible moves are made (or the player has done all the possible moves one can make), the piles are picked up in reverse order. For example, the twelfth pile is placed over the eleventh pile, and this new pile is placed on the tenth pile, and so on. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt to as many piles of four as the remaining cards will allow. To ensure that the order of the cards is not disturbed for the most part, it is suggested that the cards are dealt four at time. This can be done only twice.

The direct sequel to The House of the Dead, it was developed by Sega for arcades on the Sega NAOMI board in November 1998 then later ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and Microsoft Windows in 2001, and is also found on the Xbox as an unlockable bonus in The House of the Dead III. The game appears in the compilation The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return for Wii. The Dreamcast version became a Sega All Stars title. Gameplay The House of the Dead 2 is a rail shooter light gun game. It includes an auto-reload feature that allows players to point their guns off-screen to reload their weapons without pulling the trigger. It also incorporates a branching path system that allows players to take a variety of different routes leading to the same point in the game's story. The game served as the springboard for the arcade, Sega Dreamcast, and PC release The Typing of the Dead, the Nintendo DS release English of the Dead, as well as the inspiration for the Game Boy Advance game, The Pinball of the Dead. The flashbacks to the first The House of the Dead in the game's introductory sequence were recorded using the game's engine. Plot AMS Agent G's further investigation on the 1998 Curien Mansion incident leads to his mysterious disappearance upon his discovery of the remnants of Dr. Roy Curien's operations in Venice, Italy, where a zombie outbreak takes place. On February 26, 2000, American AMS agents James Taylor and Gary Stewart are dispatched, along with Amy Crystal and Harry Harris, to investigate and evacuate the populace of Venice. They suddenly encounter the impish Zeal, who had recently dealt with G. Upon finding a wounded G alive in a local library, James and Gary converse with him and G gives them a field journal showing the bosses and weak points. The pair are then met with a massive undead horde, similar to the kind from the Curien Mansion incident. They continue on, trying to save the town's civilians from the zombies. During the chaos, James and Gary face Judgment; consisting of Zeal and his giant, headless, axe-wielding armored puppet Kuarl. After killing it, they meet up with Amy and Harry, who split up and try to meet at Sunset Bridge (or the wharf, depending on the player's actions). Upon getting there the group faces off with The Hierophant, an aquatic fishlike humanoid which heads an assault on Venice's waterways and Central Plaza. Upon defeating it, James, Gary, Amy and Harry get on a boat and continue through the rivers. It is revealed that the zombies were created by Caleb Goldman, the man who funded Doctor Curien in making his creations during the Curien Mansion incident. It is also revealed that Goldman created the new zombies and released them into the city. Goldman leaves a message on Amy's phone, inviting them to meet him at the Colosseum, which Harry fears to be a trap. James and Gary split up again, and face off with a group of serpents known as The Tower. After killing the mother serpent, they receive a phone call for help from Amy, before getting cut off. The two quickly race to the Colosseum only to discover Amy and a wounded Harry, injured by Strength, a giant, chainsaw-wielding zombie which wounds Harry and chases James and Gary throughout the arena. After they kill it, James and Gary push on, while Amy tends to Harry's wounds. They drive over to Goldman's tower, fighting a revived Judgment, the Hierophant, and Tower. They are confronted by Curien's masterpiece, The Magician, who was also revived by Goldman to oversee the birth of The Emperor, a shapeshifting crystalline entity with mastery over magnetism designed to protect nature from humanity. After they defeat the Magician, they head to the top of the tower to confront the Emperor. In its prototype stage, the Emperor is not as strong as Goldman had hoped, and falls to the AMS agents. In order to evade being arrested, Goldman commits suicide by throwing himself off the roof of his building. Players are given different endings based on the following conditions: * If a solo game was finished as either player 1 or 2 * If both players defeated the last boss * Number of continues * Points earned In the good ending, James and Gary run into Thomas Rogan, the main character from the first game, who tells them that G and Harry are all right, and that they should head off to their next battle \\"as long as they have the will to live\\" (in the case of James) or \\"as long as there is an answer\\" (in the case of Gary). In the normal ending, as James and Gary leave the building, they are greeted by G, Amy and Harry, as well as a large group of civilians, who thank them for their help. In the bad ending, James and Gary run into a zombified Goldman outside the building. As the screen goes white, a gunshot is heard. Development =Ports= The House of the Dead 2 was later ported to the Dreamcast, as a launch title for the system, Xbox, as an unlockable on the Xbox port of The House of the Dead 3, PC, and Wii, in a double release with The House of the Dead 3. It was also the second, and final game in The House of the Dead series to appear on a Sega console, with the original The House of the Dead for the Sega Saturn being the first. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed The House of the Dead 2 on their January 1, 1999 issue as being the third most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. The Dreamcast version received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PC version received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. AllGame gave the arcade version a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five. In Japan, Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version 33 out of 40. IGN praised the same console version's detailed level design and varied enemy designs but criticized poor voice acting. GameSpot said of the same console version, \\"Just a gun that lines up with the sights doesn't seem too much to ask for.\\" Game Informer ranked it at number 99 in its best games of all-time list in 2001. The staff praised it for its expansion of its predecessor's gore and intensity, but noted that the lack of a light gun accessory for the Dreamcast version was disappointing. Blake Fischer reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Without the light gun, this game is a complete loss. With a gun, it's better, but not for very long.\\" A consensus among reviewers was that the quality of the English voice acting was very poor, with one calling it \\"easily some of the worst in the genre\\". Others found it to be so bad that it became amusing.This Game Has Such Bad Voice Acting It Used To Make Me Cry, EbaumsworldA new House of the Dead is heading to arcades, Eurogamer References External links * * Category:1998 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Light gun games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Rail shooters Category:Sega arcade games Category:Sega video games Category:SIMS games Category:The House of the Dead Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in 2000 Category:Video games set in Venice Category:Wii games Category:Windows games Category:WOW Entertainment games es:The House of the Dead ","title":"The House of the Dead 2"},{"id":"2198176","text":"Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union, originally conceived in 1926, initiated in 1930, and carried through in 1937, was the first mass transfer of an entire nationality in the Soviet Union.Otto Pohl, Ethnic cleansing in the USSR, 1937–1949, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 9–20; partially viewable on Google Books Almost the entire Soviet population of ethnic Koreans (171,781 persons) were forcefully moved from the Russian Far East to unpopulated areas of the Kazakh SSR and the Uzbek SSR in October 1937.First deportation and the \\"Effective manager\\" , Novaya gazeta, by Pavel Polyan and Nikolai Pobol The official reason for the deportation was to stem \\"the penetration of Japanese espionage into the Far Eastern Krai\\", as Koreans were at the time subjects of the Empire of Japan, which was hostile to the Soviet Union. Estimates based on population statistics suggest that 40,000 deported Koreans died in 1937 and 1938 from starvation, exposure and difficulties adapting to their new environment.Koryo Saram. Dir. Y David Chung and Matt Dibble. Prod. Meredith Jung-En Woo. 2006Pohl, J. Otto (1999), Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937-1949, Greenwood, page 13-14 Background Korean immigrants first appeared in the Russian Far East in the 1850s and early 1860s. By the 1890s, they had received the right to register as citizens of the Russian Empire, under the terms of a Russo-Korean treaty that determined their citizenship status at that time.[Kim, German. \\"Koreans in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia.\\" Accessed May 4, 2011. .] Korean migrants who had moved to Russia referred to themselves as the Koryo Saram. As more Korean immigrants arrived in the Russian Far East, the Korean minority became one of the largest border minorities in the Soviet Union, facing in the 1920s and the 1930s Japanese-occupied Korea on the other side. This minority had been gradually building up since the second half of the 19th century, as poor Korean peasants migrated across the border in search of land and livelihoods.A.N. Li, Korean diaspora in Kazakhstan: Koryo saram , retrieved November 5, 2008 The Korean immigration increased dramatically during the early 1920s, after the Russo- Japanese war of 1904–1905 and Japan's subsequent establishment of a protectorate over Korea.[Kim, German. \\"Deportation of 1937 as Product of Russian and Soviet National Policy.\\" Accessed May 4, 2011. .] By the October Revolution in 1917, there were about 100,000 Koreans in Russia. During the Russian Civil War, Korean allegiance lay primarily with the Bolsheviks, due at least in part to the fact that “Japanese oppression in Korea and occupied Siberia made most Koreans, if not Bolsheviks, then enemies of the Bolsheviks’ enemies.”[Diener, Alexander C. Homeland Conceptions and Ethnic Integration among Kazakhstan's Germans and Koreans. Lewiston, N.Y.: E. Mellen, 2004.] Korean immigrants began to submit applications for citizenship in the emerging RSFSR. Suspicions of the “political unreliability” of Koreans, however, meant that in practice relatively few would ever receive citizenship; in 1923, 1300 out of 6000 applicants were accepted for citizenship, and in the following year, 1247 out of 4761. In 1917–1926, the Soviet Korean population tripled to nearly 170,000 people, and by 1926, Koreans represented more than a quarter of the rural population of the Vladivostok region. Under the circumstances, the official Soviet policy of national minorities prescribed the formation of a Korean autonomous territory (the proposed Korean ASSR) for the large Korean community in the Russian Far East. After the Soviet government approved the formation of a Jewish Autonomous District in Birobidzhan, members of the Koryo Saram petitioned for the establishment of a Far Eastern Korean National District. This was denied in 1929,[Lee, Jean Young. \\"Korean-Chinese Migration into the Russian Far East: A Human Security Perspective.\\" .] due to opposition from the local Russian population fearing competition for land, as well as the political goal of maintaining a peaceful stance toward Imperial Japan. As a result, a contradictory policy emerged. On the one hand, the State authorized smaller Korean national territories and established Korean-language schools and newspapers, representing Koreans as a model Soviet national minority. This was presented with a stark contrast to the Korean population suffering under the yoke of Japanese occupation across the border. On the other hand, however, the central government confirmed a secret plan (adopted on December 6, 1926) to resettle half of the Soviet Koreans (88,000 people) north of Khabarovsk on suspicions of disloyalty to the Soviet Union. This resettlement plan was not implemented before 1930 for a variety of political and budgetary reasons, however. The first forced transfer of Korean immigrants to the north, excepting those who were explicitly proven loyal, began in 1930, initially in small amounts (by 1931, when the plan was officially abandoned, only 500 Korean families (2,500 individuals) had been resettled in the north.).Martin, Terry (1998). The Origins of Soviet Ethnic Cleansing. The Journal of Modern History 70 (4), 813–861. Though this was the first case of ethnic cleansing by the Soviet Union, large-scale resettlement was delayed until 1937 out of fear that Japan might consider it a casus belli. Resolution No. 1428-326cc: Planning the forced relocation The resettlement plans were revived with new vigor in August 1937, ostensibly with the purpose of suppressing \\"the penetration of Japanese espionage into the Far Eastern Krai\\". From September to October 1937, the Soviet authorities deported tens of thousands of persons of Korean origin from the Russian Far East to Soviet Central Asia. More than 172,000 Koreans were deported from the border regions of the Russian Far East as part of Joseph Stalin's policy of systematic population transfer. Its legal basis was the joint decree #1428-326сс of the USSR Sovnarkom and VCP (b) Central Committee of August 21, 1937, \\"About Deportation of the Korean Population from the Border Regions of the Far Eastern Krai\\" (\\"\\"), signed by Stalin and Molotov.A.N. Li, Korean diaspora in Kazakhstan: Koryo saram , accessed November 5, 2008 An additional resolution, No. 1647-377cc, on the total deportation of Koreans from all territories (without any exception) of the FEK including non-bordering, remote regions and neighboring oblasts, was passed on September 28 of that year. The initial decree #1428-326cc of the USSR Council of People's Commissars and the CC of the VCP (b) August 21, 1937 stated: > The Council of People’s Commissars and CC of the VCP (b) hereby order: To > prevent the penetration of Japanese espionage to the Far East region > undertake the following acts: #deport all Korean population from the border > regions of the far east . . . and relocate it to the south—Kazakhstan > region, areas near Aral Sea, Uzbek SSR #deportation will begin immediately > and will finish by Jan 1, 1938 #allow Koreans subject to relocation to take > movable property, livestock #compensate the cost of abandoned movable and > real property and crops #increase the frontier troops by three thousand > soldiers to secure the border in the Korean relocation region[Bugai, Nikolai > Fedorovi. The Deportation of Peoples in the Soviet Union. New York: Nova > Science, 1996. 26-29.] The justification for resolution 1428-326cc was that it had been planned with the aim to “prevent the infiltration of Japanese spies into the Far East.\\" However, no conclusive documents or other information on the matter have ever been found. Central Asian historian German Kim provides further consideration on the causes of the deportation of Koreans to Central Asia from the Far East: namely, that #By 1937 the Korean population was largely integrated into the social-political, economic and cultural life of the Far Eastern Krai, and such an accumulation of population and influence could be perceived as a threat, and #The establishment of a Jewish autonomous oblast led to demands from Soviet Koreans for increased regional and nationalist autonomy, indicating another potential threat for the State. For the implementation of the decision, Genrikh Lyushkov was transferred from Rostov and assigned chief of the Far Eastern Krai NKVD. Soviet Koreans were resettled to Kazakh SSR and Uzbek SSR (in the latter case including Karakalpak ASSR).German Kim, \\"Korean diaspora in Kazakhstan\\", Slavic Research Center, Hokkaido University, 1989\\"History of deportation of Far Eastern Koreans to Karakalpakstan (1937–1938)\\" Deportation The deportation was preceded by a typical Soviet scenario of political repression: falsified trials of local party leaders accused of insurrection, accusations of plans of the secession of the Far Eastern Krai, local party purges, and articles in Pravda about Japanese espionage in the Far East.Pavel Polyan, \\"The Great Terror and deportation policy\\", Demoscope Weekly, No. 313-314, December 10–31, 2007 The deportation was executed by NKVD troikas of several levels — oblast troikas, raion troikas, and \\"group\\" troikas () — under strict monitoring of deadlines. Hundreds of party functionaries were purged and repressed for failures in this operation. The deportation was performed in three batches, graded by the remoteness to the border; the first was the Posyet raion and \\"raions adjacent to Grodekovo\\". The deportees were transported by railway trains of about 50 carriages each, with 25–30 people per carriage. Travel to the destination took between 30 and 40 days. Nikolai Yezhov reported the completion of the deportation of Koreans from Far Eastern Krai on October 25, 1937. In total, 36,442 families counting 171,781 persons were reported to be resettled. The Koreans remaining in Kamchatka, fishermen in the sea and those on business trips were to be deported in an additional train by November 1.German Kim, \\"Preparation and carrying out of the deportation of Koreans\\" were somehow unapropriate prior to their unsesebility. (Подготовка и осуществление депортации корейцев) Mikhail N. Pak has suggested that the resolution may have been part of a larger concessionary agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan, due to Japanese perception that the Soviet-Korean community in the Russian Far East presented a threat. Experience in exile Approximately 100,000 Koreans were deported to the Kazakh SSR and 74,000 were sent to the Uzbek SSR. Those willing to leave were paid a bounty of 370 rubles and their train fare; the rest were bundled into trains by the NKVD. 700 Koreans were identified in the Soviet labor camps and were sent to join their compatriots in Kazakhstan. Deportees were also allowed to take livestock with them and received some compensation (on average 6,000 rubles per family) for property left behind. Many Koreans were placed far from each other in isolation to prevent contact with each other. 34,000 Koreans were placed on the desolate outpost of Ushtobe, Kazakhstan with no food and no shelter and were forced to survive on their own for almost three years. Monetary assistance promised by the government never materialised, and furthermore, most of the deported were rice farmers and fishers, who had difficulty adapting to the arid climate of their new home. Thousands died of starvation, sickness and exposure during the first few years in Central Asia. Estimates based on population statistics suggest that 40,000 deported Koreans died in 1937 and 1938 for these reasons. The ethnic Kazakhs were essential during these first few years for the Koreans. They provided shelter and food to help the Koreans suffering from starvation and cold. It was in Kazakhstan that the Korean theatre, the Korean newspaper Senbong, a Korean pedagogical institute and college, and deposits of Korean language books were relocated, making Kazakhstan the center of Korean intellectual life in the Soviet Union. The Koreans contributed to the development of agriculture in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. More than one hundred Koreans were designated Heroes of Socialist Labor, one of the highest honors of the Soviet Union.German Kim, Koryo Saram, or Koreans of the Former Soviet Union: In the Past and Present, Amerasia Journal, 2003 After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, many Koreans volunteered to go to the front, but only a few were allowed. One of them, Captain Aleksandr Pavlovich Min, was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the country's highest honor.German Kim, [Koreans in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia Koreans in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia], Lib.ru, 2004 Koreans had little rights and freedom during their first few years in Central Asia, and although they starred in propaganda films to demonstrate the success of collective farming they were not trusted by the USSR. They were not permitted to travel outside their respective farming towns and villages and could still not practice their native tongue. Some Soviet Koreans were sent to North Korea to act as agricultural advisers, but they forced back as Kim Il-Sung did not trust them. It was not until Stalin's death in 1953 that many Koreans began to push for more rights and opportunities within the Soviet Union. Life after deportation In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev decided to give the Soviet Koreans freedom and for the first time, they were given the right to decide where to live and what to do. Many Koreans moved to the cities to start professions in medicine and education. Others, however, stayed and worked on their highly productive farms. When Khrushchev introduced his Virgin Lands Campaign, Korean farms were consolidated into larger collective farms as part of the prefect.Kim, G. N., \\"The Koryo Saram: Koreans in the former USSR,\\" Korean and Korean American Studies Bulletin, Vol 12 No's 2/3 2001 Due to their organizational skill and work ethic, many Koreans were soon leaders of the industry, government, and educational institutions within the Soviet Union. Koreans were elected to the Parliaments of the Soviet Union and Central Asian Republics and by the 1970s the number of Koreans with a college degree was twice that of the general population. Today hundreds of Koreans in Central Asia and Russia have received Ph.D.'s and work as professors and researchers in universities, institutes and scientific centers. In addition, Koreans are the most urbanized ethnic group in both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, as more than 80% of the Korean population lives in cities.Kim, German. \\"Korean Diaspora in Kazakhstan: Question of Topical Problems for Minorities in Post- Soviet Space.\\" 63-74. Print. According to the 1989 census, the number of Koreans living in the Soviet Union was 439,000, the bulk of whom lived in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia, with more than 80% of that in Kazakhstan,Kim, German. \\"Korea Diaspora in Kazakhstan: Question of Topical Problems for Minorities in Post-Soviet Space.\\" and based on an analysis of Kazakh ‘areas of compact living’, the majority of Kazakh-Koreans today live in urban areas in the central and southern regions of Kazakhstan, most notably Kyzylorda, Karaghandy, Dzhambul, and Almaty. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Federation adopted a decree on the restoration of ethnic Korean rights. Under the new decree, the State permitted ‘individual and voluntary return to the former place of residence’ for deportees, and Russian citizenship could be obtained by any migrants from outside Russia. The decree also provided Korean returnees with ‘residential houses and lands for farming and other activities,’ if they desired.Lee, Jean Young. \\"Korean- Chinese Migration into the Russian Far East: A Human Security Perspective.\\" Korean culture in Kazakhstan As time has passed the Koryo Saram raised in Central Asia and Russia have lost much of their ethnic identity and have blended and assimilated into Russia and Central Asia. Kazakhstan has over 140 different ethnic groups, many of which share the experience of the Korean diaspora. As a result, the Koryo Saram are not discriminated against and are a largely accepted group within Central Asia.Kim, German. \\"Koreans in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia. Many Koreans living in Kazakhstan and the former Soviet Union have married Russians and Kazakhs. As a result, most current Koreans in Central Asia are of mixed background and heritage. Younger Koryo Saram embrace their Korean past but still consider Kazakhstan to be their homeland. The older generations are concerned about the preservation of their culture and identity within Central Asia as Koreans become increasingly Russified. As a result, there has been increased interaction between South Koreans and the ex-Soviet Koreans.Kim, G. N., King, R. \\"The Koryo Saram: Koreans in the former USSR,\\" Korean and Korean American studies Bulletin, Vol. 23, No. 2/3, 2001 The Koryo Saram conduct trips to South Korea and are pushing for a revival of Korean language and culture within Kazakhstan. Some ancient Korean traditions have managed to survive the passage of time and are still practiced today, such as debating the quality of a drink before a wedding, and having a toddler choose from a set of objects to determine the child's future. The few remaining Koryo Saram who do speak Korean are extensively studied by linguists, as they have retained and maintained an archaic Korean dialect long thought extinct. Relationship with the Koreas today After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Central Asian republics established diplomatic relations with both North and South Korea. However, supposedly due to the economic crises in North Korea, these ethnic Koreans prevented it from competing with the South in developing its ties to Central Asia and the Koreans now living there. Travel between Kazakhstan and South Korea has grown significantly since the establishment of their diplomatic ties in 1992, and Korean companies such as LG, Samsung, and Daewoo have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the economies of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia. Teachers from South Korea have traveled to Central Asia and Russia to teach at schools and universities there, and the Republic of Korea has established educational centers in Almaty, Tashkent, and Bishkek, providing Korean language courses. Diplomatic relations were established between the Republic of Korea and Kazakhstan on January 28, 1992. Bilateral trade between the nations amounted to $698 million in 2008, the main items of which are automobiles, TV and electronics goods, machinery, engineering products, uranium, ferroalloys, rolled non-alloy steel and iron, gold, and copper. Roughly 100,000 Koreans currently live in Kazakhstan. References Further reading *KOKAISL, Petr. Koreans in Central Asia–a different Korean nation. Asian Ethnicity, 2018, 19.4: 428–452.

The highway stretches from State Route 318 at Crystal Springs northwest to U.S. Route 6 (US 6) at Warm Springs. The route travels through mostly unoccupied desert terrain, with much of its alignment paralleling the northern edges of the Nellis Air Force Range. The road originally traversed through what is now the northern reaches of the air force range in the 1930s, when it was previously designated State Route 25A and later part of State Route 25. The top-secret Area 51 government base is near SR 375, and many travelers have reported UFO observations and other strange alien activity along this road. Such stories prompted the state to officially designate the route as the Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996. The small town of Rachel, located near the midpoint of the highway, caters to tourists, geocachers, and UFO seekers with alien-themed businesses. Although the area receives some tourism due to alleged extraterrestrial activity, SR 375 remains a lightly traveled route. Route description View from the north end of SR 375 looking southbound, July 2014 The \\"black mailbox\\", October 2005 State Route 375 begins at a \\"Y\\" junction with State Route 318 at Crystal Springs, a ghost town in the northern end of the Pahranagat Valley in the center of Lincoln County. The site, which is little more than the junction and a few trees, functions as a rest area. From Crystal Springs, the highway curves southwest to pass between the Pahrangat and Mount Irish ranges to ascend Hancock Summit. Descending the summit, SR 375 nears the border of the Nellis Air Force Range. As the highway heads northwest through Tikaboo Valley, it meets Mail Box Road. It used to be marked by a single postal drop known as the \\"black mailbox\\": the dirt access road leads to the restricted lands surrounding Area 51. The original mailbox was a normal black mailbox, however due to people constantly sifting through it, it was replaced with a white one that was much more secure. The name \\"Black Mailbox\\" still stuck. It was commonly used as a gathering place for UFO seekers, and two to three UFO sightings per week allegedly occur in the area. The mailbox was removed by its owner, Steve Medlin, due to continued vandalism. SR 375 continues heading northwest from the mailbox, climbing in elevation again to reach the top of Coyote Summit at . West of the summit, the Extraterrestrial Highway descends into the Sand Spring Valley and the community of Rachel becomes visible. The small town of about 50 residents is little more than homes and a few businesses. The Little A'Le'Inn (pronounced \\"alien\\") is the focal point of the town, providing a small motel, an alien-themed restaurant/bar, and extraterrestrial souvenirs. The civilian-run Area 51 Research Center, based out of a yellow house trailer and documenting paranormal activity in the area, closed in 2001. Leaving Rachel, SR 375 continues northwest to enter Nye County. The route climbs out of Sand Spring Valley and heads over the Queen City Summit, the highest point on the highway. After passing the summit, the route descends into the southern end of Railroad Valley, curving nearly due north for several miles as it follows the base of Reveille Range. As the mountains subside, the road turns westward again to head to its northern terminus at the junction of US 6 at Warm Springs. History =Route development= SR 375 passing through Sand Spring Valley, October 1997 Map showing the location of Rachel, and State Route 375 as it passes north of Area 51 An unimproved road approximating the present alignment of State Route 375 came into existence by 1932. This route, christened State Route 25A, connected Crystal Springs to State Route 4 (now US 6) just east of Tonopah. By 1933, SR 25A had been renumbered to become a new western segment of State Route 25. The route underwent periodic realignments over the next few years, but the highway's terminal junctions remained mostly unchanged. In 1942, SR 25 appeared to have a significant gap in its route. State maps from the time show a large area within Nye and Lincoln Counties where all roads had been removed. The route existed in one piece again by 1946, although it had been realigned northward and shortened to . A sizable portion of SR 25 passing through the Tonopah U.S. Army Air Force Bombing Range (now the Nellis Air Force Range and Nevada Test Site) was restricted from public travel by 1950, the restricted section being approximately the same area that was removed in 1942. To avoid the restricted area of the testing range, the west end of SR 25 was realigned by 1957. The highway connected to US 6 at Warm Springs about east of the previous terminus, heading north around the Reveille Range instead of climbing the Kawich Range within the bombing area. With the 1957 realignment, the routing of SR 25 attained its final form. The entire highway was paved by the following year. SR 25 remained unchanged until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highways, through which the western section of SR 25 became the new State Route 375. The new route number was first seen on the 1978 edition of the official state highway map. =Naming the highway= Extraterrestrial Highway (State Route 375) sign, September 2012 In 1989, an engineer named Bob Lazar claimed to have worked on alien spaceships and to have viewed saucer test flights in Tikaboo Valley, telling his story to a Las Vegas television station which was subsequently broadcast as an exclusive report. By the 1990s, stories of the top-secret U.S. government base at Area 51 had become mainstream, and many books and personal accounts had been published regarding extraterrestrial spacecraft and alien activity in the region surrounding Groom Lake. Rachel, being the closest settlement to the restricted facility, attracted people in search of UFOs and alien life. To capitalize on the purported paranormal activity along the route, the Nevada Commission on Tourism sought to rename the highway. State officials drew inspiration from the alien legends and dubbed SR 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway in February 1996. The tourism commission hoped that the renaming would \\"draw travelers to the austere and remote reaches of south-central Nevada, where old atomic bomb test sites, secret Defense Department airstrips and huge, sequestered tracts of military land create a marketable mystique\\". The Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel benefits from tourism brought by the renamed highway, October 1997 News of the highway's renaming reached Twentieth Century Fox. The studio used the opportunity to promote the release of the film Independence Day, whose plot involves an alien invasion of Earth and the secret facility at Area 51. A public dedication ceremony for the Extraterrestrial Highway was held in Rachel in April 1996. State dignitaries at the ceremony were joined by studio executives and Independence Day stars Jeff Goldblum, Robert Loggia, Bill Pullman, and Brent Spiner. Nevada Governor Bob Miller presided over the ceremony, speaking with humorous space references and unveiling special \\"Extraterrestrial Highway 375\\" and \\"Speed Limit Warp 7\\" signs for the highway. The event concluded with several guests placing items related to Nevada and the film into a time capsule commemorating the occasion. Looking northwest near Rachel, visitors have left their marks on the Extraterrestrial Highway, March 2004 To promote the Extraterrestrial Highway after its renaming, the tourism commission launched \\"The ET Experience\\" in July 1996. Tourists could contact the Nevada Commission on Tourism to receive a traveler's kit containing information about the highway, nearby cultural attractions, and area services. Visitors that patronized businesses in Rachel and central Nevada and submitted an account of their journey received Extraterrestrial Highway memorabilia. Stories from travelers were also published in a newsletter available to those that had completed the experience. Despite tourism generated by people searching for signs of alien life, only \\"an average of about 200 cars drive some portion of the Extraterrestrial Highway every day, making it one of the state’s least traveled routes.\\" In keeping with the supposed alien links of the area, in 2006, KFC established what was said to be the first corporate logo visible from space, made from of tiles and sited just off the Extraterrestrial Highway in Rachel. The logo has since been removed. Major intersections :Note: Mileposts in Nevada reset at county lines. The start and end mileposts for each county are given in the county column.

Though full of grandiose boasts about his prowess, he is essentially a coward. The character is introduced in Henry IV, Part 2 and reappears in The Merry Wives of Windsor and Henry V. The character's first name is never given. He is referred to as Falstaff's \\"ancient\\", meaning \\"ensign\\", or standard bearer. Henry IV, Part 2 Theophilus Cibber in the role of Pistol Pistol is introduced as a \\"swaggerer\\" who suddenly turns up at the Boar's Head Tavern, contrary to the wishes of the hostess, Mistress Quickly. Falstaff tells her that Pistol is his \\"ancient\\" (ensign). He gets into a fight with Falstaff after an exchange of insults with the prostitute Doll Tearsheet, who calls him \\"the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England\\". Later, when Falstaff stops off at Justice Shallow's house after the defeat of Scrope, Pistol appears bringing news of the death of Henry IV, asserting that Falstaff is \\"now one of the greatest men in this realm\\". In another scene it is revealed that the police are after him because a man he assaulted in tandem with Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly has died. He shares Falstaff's punishment of banishment from the king at the end of the play. The Merry Wives of Windsor Pistol reappears as Falstaff's crony in The Merry Wives of Windsor and is roped into Falstaff's scheme to seduce the wives. He and his colleague Corporal Nym believe such a scheme beneath their dignity as soldiers, and refuse to participate. Falstaff dismisses them from his service and in revenge they inform the wives' husbands of Falstaff's plan, leading to Falstaff's humiliations at their hands. He also decides to pursue Mistress Quickly. Dressed as a fairy, he participates in the final scene at Herne's Oak. The phrase \\"the world's my oyster\\" derives from one of Pistol's lines in the play, \\"Why then the world's mine oyster, which I with sword will open.\\" Henry V Pistol plays a major role in Henry V. He marries Mistress Quickly after the death of Falstaff, though it's also implied that he is still involved with Doll Tearsheet. In the war in France, he gets into a feud with the Welsh officer Fluellen, when Fluellen refuses to pardon Pistol's friend Bardolph who has been caught looting. In the end Fluellen beats him and forces him to eat a raw leek. At Agincourt he becomes involved in comic antics with a French soldier. After the battle he gets a letter from which he learns that \\"my Doll is dead\\" from \\"malady of France\\", i.e. from syphilis. (It is unclear whether this refers to Doll Tearsheet, or to Mistress Quickly.)Dr. Andrew Griffin, Locating the Queen's Men, 1583–1603, Ashgate, 2013, p.142 He says he intends to desert, return to England and become a pimp and a thief. Character role The title page of Henry IV, part 2, advertising that it contains the \\"humours of Sir John Falstaff and swaggering Pistol\\", suggesting that Pistol was a popular character. Pistol's character may have been derived from the boastful soldier figure Il Capitano, a stock figure in commedia del arte, which also has precedents in Roman comedies, in the Miles Gloriosus figure, such as Thraso in Terence's Eunuchus. Pistol is the \\"Elizabethan version of the miles gloriosus, the braggart soldier from Roman-comedy\\".Victor L. Cahn, Shakespeare the Playwright: A Companion to the Complete Tragedies, Histories, Comedies, and Romances, Praeger, Westport, 1996. p.468 Another possible source is the character Piston in Thomas Kyd's play Soliman and Perseda. There are numerous puns on his name in the plays, with comic reference to his explosive temperament, tendency to misfire, and his unrestrained phallic sexuality (\\"discharge upon mine hostess\\").Stanley Wells, Eric Partridge, Shakespeare's Bawdy, Routledge, London, 2001. p.208-9. His bombastic speeches may also be parodies of the self-dramatising heroes of Christopher Marlowe's plays.Oscar James Campbell, Shakespeare's Satire: Oxford University Press, London, 1943, p.72 In his first scene, he misquotes one of Tamburlaine's lines from Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great. He has an \\"irresistible impulse to form horrendous speeches out of half-remembered tags from old plays written in 'Cambyses vein.'\\"J. Madison Davis, The Shakespeare Name and Place Dictionary, Routledge, 2012, p.387. Pistol's florid bombast is often contrasted with the gnomic pronouncements of his colleague Corporal Nym. In Henry V he essentially replicates Falstaff's role in the Henry IV plays, being the butt of jokes for his empty bluster, while also parodying the rhetoric of the \\"noble\\" characters; however he totally lacked his superior officer's wit and charm. His role may have been expanded because Falstaff had been killed off. His antics with the French soldier are derived from those of the equivalent character (Derick) in Shakespeare's source, The Famous Victories of Henry V.Greer, Clayton A. \\"Shakespeare's Use of The Famous Victories of Henry V,\\" Notes & Queries. n. s. 1 (June 1954): 238–41 References in other works Pistol appears in William Kenrick's play Falstaff's Wedding (1766 version), in which he escapes arrest by disguising himself as a Spanish swordsman called Antico del Pistolo, and impresses Justice Shallow. He competes with Falstaff for the hand of Mistress Ursula, but gets tricked by Shallow into marrying Mistress Quickly.Kendrick, W., Falstaff's Wedding, A Comedy: as it is acted at the theatre Royal in Drury- Lane.

James White's book Falstaff's Letters (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his cronies, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. Several letters purport to have been written by Pistol in his characteristic florid style.White, James, Falsteff's Letters, London, Robson, 1877, p.39.

She was the ninth chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Biography =Early years = Denton was born in El Campo, Texas in Wharton County. She was the oldest child of Bob Glenn Denton and Carolyn Irene Drab.Texas Birth Index 1903-1997 showing \\"Denice Dee Denton, born August 27, 1959. Wharton County. Father Bob Glenn Denton, Mother Carolyn Irene Drab.\\" Denton earned her bachelor's and master's degrees (1982), EE (1983) and PhD (1987) in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Denton spent two summers and an academic year in the late 1970s and early 1980s at Fairchild Semiconductor, where her projects included 64K static RAM design. After graduation, she accepted a professorship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering, which was interested in her work in plasma deposition and polymerization. She was the first woman to win tenure in engineering, and she was quickly promoted to full professor. =Career= Denton held academic appointments at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. In 1996, Denton was hired as the Dean of the College of Engineering and professor of electrical engineering at the University of Washington. She was the first woman in the United States to lead an engineering college of a major research university. Denton received attention for her response to Harvard President Larry Summers' suggestion, in January 2005, that one of the reasons that women had achieved less in science could be innate differences between the sexes. \\"Of course he has the right to say anything and of course there are biological differences,\\" Denton said. \\"What some of us were concerned about is that his hypotheses were not grounded in the best and latest scholarly work, and could be refuted by anyone in the field.\\" University of California Denton was the first openly gay, and at 45, the youngest person to be appointed to be chancellor in the University of California system by UC President Robert Dynes. She succeeded Martin Chemers, who served as acting chancellor following the resignation of M. R. C. Greenwood who became the University of California Provost. Denton's recruitment package would eventually include a $275,000 salary, $68,750 as a moving allowance, improvements to the chancellor's on-campus residence which included a $30,000 dog pen initially budgeted at $7,000. Included in the deal was a tenured professorial appointment with a $192,000 salary, and a housing assistance allowance of up to $50,000 for her partner, Gretchen Kalonji. Although much of the residence was used for campus functions, the approximately $600,000 renovation cost, and overall cost of Denton's recruitment brought criticism. This contrasts sharply against increasing student fees, up 79 percent in four years, and low pay raises for clerical and service staff. After an April 2005 campus protest over these issues resulted in the arrest of 19 students, 200 faculty signed a petition condemning her \\"unwarranted\\" use of force. She also was allegedly a victim of personal harassment, in the form of verbal insults. A barricade was tossed through her guest-bedroom window on June 10, 2005. Protesters advocating higher wages for custodians blocked Denton in her car outside her office for about five minutes on June 6, 2006 while performing a skit about racism. On April 5, 2005 anti- war protesters forced military recruiters at a campus career fair to leave campus. Denton received dozens of threatening phone calls and e-mails. When it was discovered that protest was listed as a \\"credible threat\\" on the TALON database managed by the Pentagon's Counterintelligence Field Agency, Denton helped persuade California Senators Boxer and Feinstein to request an investigation. Ultimately, campus protests were removed from the database. After Denton's death, astronomy and astrophysics professor George Blumenthal was named Acting Chancellor, and officially became the university's tenth Chancellor on September 19, 2007. Boards and memberships  Denton was a member of the UC President's Committee to select recipients of the Medal of Science, and the committee to select recipients of the Alan T. Waterman Award sponsored by the NSF. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association for Women in Science, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). She was a member of the NSF Engineering Directorate Advisory Committee and a member of the Visiting Committee for the California Institute of Technology Division of Engineering and Applied Science. Denton served as chair of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) Board on Engineering Education. Among many other appointments, she was a member of the NRC Committee on Advanced Materials and Fabrication Methods for Microelectromechanical Systems and of MIT's Advisory Board for Initiatives to Diversify the Professoriate. Chancellor Denton was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and the Board of Directors of Joint Venture Silicon Valley. = Personal life= Denton, who was openly lesbian, resided part-time in downtown San Francisco with her partner of more than ten years, Gretchen Kalonji, a professor of materials science. On June 24, 2006, one day following Denton's discharge from the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute where she had been treated for depression, she leapt 33 stories to her death from The Paramount, a high-rise in which she shared an apartment with Kalonji. In August 2007 Denton's partner Gretchen Kalonji filed a lawsuit against Denton's estate seeking $2.25 million. Kalonji claims Denton's failure to revise her will or name Kalonji as a beneficiary to her UC life insurance policy was inadvertent and a violation of their oral agreement. In July 2009, a probate judge awarded Kalonji only one half of a Canadian vacation home that the coupled had shared while giving the rest of Denton's estate to Denton's parents and siblings. Honors and awards  Among other numerous awards she won the Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award (2006), a national recognition of exceptional work that advances opportunities in the sciences for women and girls; the NOGLSTP LGBTQ+ Educator of the Year Award (2006); the IEEE/HP Harriett B. Rigas Award (1995); the ASEE George Westinghouse Award (1995); the W. M.

It is administratively part of the Central and Western District. Etymology In Cantonese, Sai () means \\"west\\" and Ying Pun () means \\"camp\\", especially a military camp. It was where the early British military stayed. Location Sai Ying Pun is built on the steeply sloping lower slopes of Victoria Peak and also on the western reclamation. The areas of Shek Tong Tsui and Kennedy Town are located to the west, Sheung Wan and Tai Ping Shan are to the east, and the Mid-Levels is higher up the hill to the south. Victoria Harbour is to the north. While the boundaries are not de jure drawn, they are nevertheless de facto defined by Whitty Street in the west and Tung Wah Hospital in the east. The University of Hong Kong MTR Station exit B1 straddles the boundary between Shek Tong Tsui and Sai Ying Pun. Good Luck Mansion and The Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building are in Shek Tong Tsui, while Saint Anthony's Church, Pao Siu Loong Building, and the Main Building are in Sai Ying Pun. The eastern boundary is blurry. Lok Sin Tong Leung Kau Kui College is in Sai Ying Pun while Tung Wah Hospital is in Sheung Wan. The section of Queens Road West from Medal Court to Hollywood Road marks part of the boundary. Elsewhere, the location of the border is unknown. On a map, Sai Ying Pun can be distinguished from Sheung Wan because it is left of the street grid of the Tai Ping Shan neighborhood. =Geology= Sai Ying Pun is built on top of Hong Kong granite. The granite was formed in the Upper Jurassic Period and is from the last phase of intrusions in the Hong Kong area. The granite is found over most of the north and centre of Hong Kong Island, and also Kowloon. The flat parts of Sai Ying Pun near the harbour are reclaimed land, built from landfill. History 1890 Eastern Street Queen's Road was the first road built in the area. It meandered around the camp structures and extended along the north coast of Hong Kong Island. Sai Ying Pun was settled as Chinese immigrants moved into Hong Kong and built to the west of Tai Ping Shan. Europeans were assigned areas above High Street where Chinese were excluded from living. In the early 1880s sewerage was installed into the area, with the main flow coming down Centre Street. Streets were also macadamised or concreted at this time. Around 1882 Battery Road was renamed Bonham Road. From 1884 to 1887 many brothels were declared by the Government to be unlicensed and closed down. These were mainly in First, Second and Third Street, but also in Sheung Fung Lane, Ui On Lane and Centre Street. Early street planning of Sai Ying Pun In 1894 an epidemic of bubonic plague struck and afflicted Sai Ying Pun residents. It was not initially as bad as in neighbouring Tai Ping Shan, which was abandoned and demolished to improve hygiene. However Sheung Fung Lane residents were almost wiped out. Government reports called this area the number IX health district and went into great detail about the buildings where the disease occurred. In 1896 there were 115 cases, in 1898, 153 cases, in 1899, 263 cases, in 1900 98 cases, in 1904 there were 149 cases with 144 dying, and 55 cases in 1905. The great majority of infections in this district resulted in death. King's College, Hong Kong, built in 1926 In 1902, number 10 and 12 Second Street partially collapsed killing four people and injuring six. An additional storey had been added to number 10 at the beginning of 1901. It fell on number 12 and caused it to collapse as well. The extension had been designed by architects Denison and Ram. Also in 1902 a cookhouse at 56 First Street collapsed, one person was killed. In 1899, there were 1017 houses and a population estimate of 24800. Most houses in Des Voeux Road and First Street were three stories, and in Second and Third Street they were two stories. In 1904 population was 24900 and average occupancy per floor of each house was 8.9. In 1905 the population was 25083. In 1903, most houses were made from soft blue bricks, they had basements, and retaining walls at the front and back due to the steep slope. In the early 1900s there was a Berlin Foundling House in High Street, a Sailors Home, and a Lunatic Asylum.

The urban legend is based outside of Resurrection Cemetery in Justice, Illinois, a few miles southwest of Chicago. Resurrection Mary is considered to be Chicago's most famous ghost. Since the 1930s, several men driving northeast along Archer Avenue between the Willowbrook Ballroom and Resurrection Cemetery have reported picking up a young female hitchhiker. This young woman is dressed somewhat formally in a white party dress and is said to have light blond hair and blue eyes. There are other reports that she wears a thin shawl, dancing shoes, carries a small clutch purse, and possibly that she is very quiet. When the driver nears the Resurrection Cemetery, the young woman asks to be let out, whereupon she disappears into the cemetery. According to the Chicago Tribune, \\"full-time ghost hunter\\" Richard Crowe has collected \\"three dozen ... substantiated\\" reports of Mary from the 1930s to the present. The legend The Willowbrook Ballroom, formerly the Oh Henry Ballroom, in Willow Springs, Illinois The story goes that Mary had spent the evening dancing with a boyfriend at the Oh Henry Ballroom. At some point, they got into an argument and Mary stormed out. She left the ballroom and started walking up Archer Avenue. She had not gotten very far when she was struck and killed by a hit- and-run driver, who fled the scene leaving Mary to die. Her parents found her and were grief-stricken at the sight of her dead body. They buried her in Resurrection Cemetery, wearing a beautiful white dancing dress and matching dancing shoes. The hit-and-run driver was never found.Bielski, p. 22. Reported sightings Jerry Palus, a Chicago southsider, reported that in 1939 he met a person whom he came to believe was Resurrection Mary at the Liberty Grove and Hall at 47th and Mozart (and not the Oh Henry/Willowbrook Ballroom). They danced and even kissed and she asked him to drive her home along Archer Avenue, exiting the car and disappearing in front of Resurrection Cemetery.Taylor and Sceurman, p. 188. Burned section of the front gate bars. In 1973, Resurrection Mary was said to have shown up at Harlow's nightclub, on Cicero Avenue on Chicago's southwest side. That same year, a cab driver came into Chet's Melody Lounge, across the street from Resurrection Cemetery, to inquire about a young lady who had left without paying her fare. There were said to be sightings in 1976, 1978, 1980, and 1989, which involved cars striking, or nearly striking, Mary outside Resurrection Cemetery. Mary disappears, however, by the time the motorist exits the car. She also reportedly burned her handprints into the wrought iron fence around the cemetery, in August 1976,Taylor and Sceurman, p. 189. although officials at the cemetery have stated that a truck had damaged the fence and that there is no evidence of a ghost. In a January 31, 1979 article in the Suburban Trib, columnist Bill Geist detailed the story of a cab driver, Ralph, who picked up a young woman – \\"a looker. A blond. ... she was young enough to be my daughter — 21 tops\\" – near a small shopping center on Archer Avenue. Geist described Ralph as \\"not an idiot or a maniac\\" but rather, in Ralph's own words, \\"a typical 52-year-old working guy, a veteran, father, Little League baseball coach, churchgoer, the whole shot\\". Geist goes on to say: \\"The simple explanation, Ralph, is that you picked up the Chicago area's preeminent ghost: Resurrection Mary.\\" Identity of Mary Some researchers have attempted to link Resurrection Mary to one of the many thousands of burials in Resurrection Cemetery. A particular focus of these efforts has been Mary Bregovy, who died in 1934, although her death came in an automobile accident in the downtown Chicago LoopBielski, pp. 15-19. Chicago author Ursula Bielski in 1999 documented a possible connection to Anna \\"Marija\\" Norkus, who died in a 1927 auto accident while on her way home from the Oh Henry Ballroom, a theory which has gained popularity in recent years. In popular culture The bluegrass band The Country Gentlemen included a song entitled \\"Bringing Mary Home\\" on their 1966 album of the same name. In it, the singer picks up a \\"little girl\\" named Mary who directs him to a house rather than the cemetery, though she vanishes from his car in the same manner as Resurrection Mary. The driver explains the situation to the home's owner, who tells him that Mary died in a car accident thirteen years before and that he is not the first person to give her a ride home. This version has been covered many times, including versions by Red Sovine and Mac Wiseman. On his 1996 album The Artful Dodger, singer/songwriter Ian Hunter included the song \\"Resurrection Mary\\", in which a driver in or near Chicago picks up a beautiful young woman with an \\"incandescent glow\\" who says to him \\"I'm tryin' to get to Heaven/Can you tell me where that is?\\" Three films titled Resurrection Mary and based on the legend have been released: one in 2002 starring Wilford Brimley, one in 2005 featuring Joe Estevez and one in 2007. All three films portray Mary as a sinister or vengeful spirit. The legend of Resurrection Mary was featured twice on Unsolved Mysteries: once in Episode 2 of Season 3, in a segment titled \\"Resurrection Mary,\\" in 1990, and once on Episode 15 of Season 6, in a segment titled \\"One for the Road,\\" in 1994.

It has been called white supremacist by the Associated Press and Anti-Defamation League, among others.Richard Barrett Supremacist Rally Gets Green Light, Scheduled In York, Pa., On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day - CBS News Richard Barrett was succeeded by unanimous vote as leader by Thomas Reiter after Barrett's murder. Its Secretary originally was Barry Hackney, and the position of Secretary was discontinued by Thomas Reiter. Thomas Reiter saved most Nationalist Movement assets and intellectual property after Barrett's murder. The symbol of the movement is the Crosstar. In 2012 with the endorsement of Thomas Reiter, Travis Golie was sworn in as the Leader of The Nationalist Movement. Like Reiter, Golie was an original Barrett-era Nationalist Movement member. Golie returned The Nationalist Movement headquarters to the South where it originated. Lawsuits In 1987 the movement applied for 501(c)(3) non-profit status. This status was denied due to the organization's use of resources for non-charitable purposes. The movement filed a lawsuit challenging the decision on constitutional grounds, but was defeated.The Nationalist Movement v. Commissioner (1994) The movement was active in protests against Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in Atlanta, Georgia in 1989. Its Neighborhood, Home, Family and Country parade and rally in South Boston drew crowds and police. It held a demonstration in Simi Valley, California in 1992, in defense of the police officers accused of beating Rodney King. In 1993, it held a \\"Majority-Rights Freedom Rally\\" at the Colorado State Capitol, in opposition to gay rights. In 1992, it won in the United States Supreme Court, in Forsyth County, Georgia v. The Nationalist Movement, establishing new First Amendment jurisprudence, which lifted bans on its use of public property and mandated police protection for its parades and rallies. It was sued in 1993 by the Texas Human Rights Commission, alleging that it violated the federal housing bill, but it won the case and had prohibitions against free speech stricken from federal housing regulations. It is financed by donations of members and occasional court-awarded damages from opponents. It sees itself as policing the ranks of nationalists, often supporting the prosecution of white supremacists, such as Matthew Hale and David Duke.

He is easily recognisable by his black-framed \\"Buddy Holly\\" style glasses, and, during live performances, often acts as the group's compère. Early life Athol George Guy was born in Colac, Victoria, the son of George Francis Guy (RAN) and Doris Thelma (née Cole) Guy. Guy was educated at Gardenvale Central School, where he was school captain. He entered Melbourne High School, where he was twice under age athletic champion and an officer in the cadet corps. During this time he was Victorian Sub Junior High Jump Champion and then silver medallist to Olympian Colin Ridgway the next year. Music career Guy formed his first musical group in 1958, The Ramblers, resulting in his move into performance, marketing and production at GTV9. Progressing via HSV7, media manager with the Clemenger Group and account exec with JWT, he then set sail with The Seekers for 10 weeks' holiday abroad. On his return he established his own consulting company and compèred two national TV shows. When The Seekers disbanded in 1968, Guy hosted his own variety series — A Guy Called Athol — on Australia's Seven Network, and later the quiz show Big Nine on the Nine Network. In 1971, he was elected as the Liberal member for Gisborne in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. One of its youngest members, he won three terms with an increasing majority before he returned to the commercial world as a corporate consultant. Guy has taken part in subsequent reunions of The Seekers since 1993, when the award-winning group celebrated the silver jubilee of its 1968 break up. Politics Guy was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in a by- election on 11 December 1971 for Gisborne as a member of the Liberal Party. He served as a member of the assembly until resigning due to ill health on 5 March 1979. His achievements included the government's purchase and development of Werribee Park. Business career Guy opted to return to the business world and rejoined the Clemenger group as General Manager of Clemenger Harvie from 1979 to 1989. During the 1990s Guy joined St George Bank's marketing team as Business Development Consultant, and then AMP's blue ribbon financial planning group, Hillross. With the assistance of the St George foundation Guy was instrumental in the Murdoch Institute introducing a genetic educational course into Victorian schools. Alongside these roles, he happily accommodated the many hundreds of reunion concerts with The Seekers from 1993 to about 2015, effectively curtailing any further political ambitions. In recent years, Guy has been involved in a joint venture with Hanging Rock Winery, launching \\"Athol's Paddock\\" in the Macedon Ranges.

However, his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright, but was maintaining a role at Family Radio while working from home. Camping admitted in a private interview that he no longer believed that anybody could know the time of the Rapture or the end of the world, in stark contrast to his previously staunch position on the subject. In March 2012, he stated that his attempt to predict a date was \\"sinful\\", and that his critics had been right in emphasizing the words of Matthew 24:36: \\"of that day and hour knoweth no man\\". He added that he was now searching the Bible \\"even more fervently...not to find dates, but to be more faithful in [his] understanding.\\"\\"Letter from Harold Camping to the 'Family Radio Family'\\". Charisma News. March 7, 2012. After the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio suffered a significant loss of assets, staff and revenue. Camping died on December 15, 2013 after complications sustained from a fall in his home two weeks earlier. Biography Harold Egbert Camping was born on July 19, 1921, in Boulder, Colorado and moved at an early age to California. Both his parents came from the Netherlands – his mother from Friesland, his father from Groningen – but they first met each other in the United States. In 1942, Camping earned a B.S. degree in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. In 1943, he married his wife, Shirley. He and his family were members of the Christian Reformed Church until 1988. =Family Radio= A Family Radio sign in Denver predicting the end of the world on May 21, 2011. In 1958, Camping joined with other individuals of Christian Reformed, Bible Baptist, and conservative Presbyterian backgrounds to purchase an FM radio station in San Francisco, California. The radio station – KEAR, then at 97.3 MHz – was used to broadcast traditional Christian Gospel to the conservative Protestant community and minister to the general public. Through the 1960s, Family Radio acquired six additional FM stations and seven AM stations under guidelines established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In 1961, Family Radio began running the Open Forum, a live, weeknight call-in program that Camping hosted until 2011. Listeners were invited to call in, primarily with questions about the meaning of certain passages from the Bible, and Camping answered them by means of interpretations, often with reference to other Biblical passages. Occasionally, questions were posed relating to general Christian doctrine, ranging from the nature of sin and salvation to matters involving everyday life, such as marriage, sexual morality and education. The Open Forum continued running until Camping's partial retirement in July 2011, and was broadcast on the more than 150 stations owned by Family Radio in the United States. The Open Forum was also translated into many foreign languages and (together with other Family Radio programming) was broadcast worldwide via shortwave station WYFR, a network of AM and FM radio stations, a cable television station and the Internet. In October 2012, over a year after the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio began airing repeats of his broadcasts. Family Radio runs various programs on its radio stations. Before Camping started teaching that the \\"Church Age\\" had ended, programs produced outside of Family Radio were welcome provided they did not accept any \\"extra- Biblical revelation\\", and were associated with teachings accepted by the historic Christian faith. Family Radio also utilized at least three television stations: WFME-TV in the New York City area; KFTL-CD in San Francisco, California; and KHFR-LD in Boise, Idaho. Following the digital transition of 2009, Family Radio used its subchannels of WFME and KFTL for various purposes – in WFME's case, the digital signal of that station broadcasts ten separate subchannels, the first being the main channel, and the others carrying audio feeds of other Family Radio services, as well as one broadcasting NOAA Weather Radio. Family Radio spent over US$100 million on the information campaign for Camping's 2011 end times prediction, financed by sales and swaps of broadcast outlets. =The Biblical Calendar of History= In 1970, Camping published The Biblical Calendar of History (later greatly expanded in his 1974 book Adam When?), in which he dated the Creation of the world to the year 11,013 BC and the Flood to 4990 BC. This was in contradiction to Bishop James Ussher's famous 17th-century chronology, which placed the Creation at 4004 BC and the Flood at 2349 BC.Stephen Jay Gould. Fall in the House of Ussher. Natural History. November 1991. Retrieved January 29, 2013. Camping argued that Ussher's dates \\"agree neither with the Biblical nor the secular evidence\\", asserting that Ussher's methodology was flawed. Camping surmised that the word begat in the Old Testament scriptures did not necessarily imply an immediate father-son relationship, as had been assumed by Ussher and others who (Camping felt) had not correctly interpreted the biblical timeline. Camping noted the use of the phrase \\"called his name\\" (\\"qara shem\\" in Hebrew, found three times in Genesis 4–5), which he characterized as a \\"clue phrase\\" to indicate an immediate father-son relationship. Despite the fact that this \\"clue phrase\\" does not occur regarding Noah naming Shem, Camping maintained that there is enough evidence to otherwise conclude that they did, in fact, have an immediate father-son relationship. He also points out the use of qara shem in Isaiah 7:14, which he interpreted as meaning, \\"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\\" Camping assumed that, since qara shem implies an immediate father-son relationship (e.g., Adam–Seth, Seth–Enos, and Lamech–Noah), all other relationships between the Antediluvian patriarchs (except Noah–Shem) are of ancestors and their distant descendants. That is, when one patriarch died, the next one who is mentioned was not his son but was actually a distant multi-generational grandson who was born in that same year. Camping thus formulated the concept of the \\"reference patriarch,\\" i.e., various events are referenced to a specific year of a particular patriarch's life as a means of keeping an accurate chronological record. Although there is no evidence that any ancient civilization kept track of time in this way, Camping used this concept as the basis for his view of Biblical chronology. Teachings Camping taught that a Biblical calendar had been hidden according to Daniel 12:9 and Revelation 22:10, detailing the imminent end of the world (with alleged Biblical evidence pointing to the date for the Rapture as May 21, 2011); of the \\"end of the church age\\" (which asserts that churches are no longer the vehicle used by God for salvation, 1 Peter 4:17); and of predestination (Ephesians 1:4–5), according to which God determined before the beginning of the world which individuals are to be saved. In Camping's later publications, he stated that May 21, 2011 would be \\"the first day of the Day of Judgment\\" and October 21, 2011 would be the end of the world. Camping did not consider Family Radio a church and did not claim ordained or hierarchical authority within a church or institution. Camping claimed that the church institutions do not employ the Bible alone as the sole authority. According to Camping, each church or denomination has its own unique set of doctrines and hermeneutics, which dictate how they understand the Bible. Family Radio's sole focus on the Bible is what he believed distinguishes it from mainstream churches. In his book 1994?, he claimed there was a very high likelihood that the world would end in September 1994, although he did acknowledge in the book \\"the possibility does exist that I could be wrong\\";Harold Camping (1992). 1994?. New York: Vantage Press. p. xv. Family Radio remained popular despite this failed prediction. Both before and after the failure of his 2011 prophecies, Camping received criticism from a number of leaders, scholars, and laymen within the Christian community, who argued that Jesus Christ taught that no man knows the day or the hour of the Lord's return. Camping responded to those who labelled him a \\"date-setter\\", following his own method of Biblical interpretation, by asserting that he followed the Bible's method of interpretation. Central to Camping's teaching was his belief that the Bible alone is the word of God in its entirety, and thus is absolutely trustworthy. However, he emphasized, this does not mean that each sentence in the Bible is to be understood only literally. Rather, the meaning of individual Biblical passages also needs to be interpreted in the light of two factors. The first is the context of the Bible as a whole. The second is its spiritual meaning. In Camping's words, \\"the Bible is an earthly story with a Heavenly meaning.\\" This stems from Mark 4:34, which states that Jesus did not speak to the disciples without using parables. Because Christ is said to be the living Word of God, therefore, the historical accounts of the Old Testament can also be seen as parables. For example, in Camping's view, Joshua in the Book of Joshua (whose name in Hebrew is identical to the name \\"Jesus\\" in Greek) is a picture of Christ, who safely led the Israelites (who supposedly represented those who became saved) across the Jordan River (a representation of the wrath of God) into the land of Canaan (which represents the kingdom of God).Harold Camping (2005). Time Has an End. New York: Vantage Press. pp. 224–226. A vehicle in San Francisco proclaiming Harold Camping's 2011 prediction. =Theology= After leaving the Christian Reformed Church in 1988, Camping taught doctrines that explicitly conflicted with the doctrines and confessions of the Christian Reformed Church and churches of the Reformed and Presbyterian traditions. Examples of Camping's teachings which varied from conventional Reformed doctrines include: * Departing from Calvinist doctrine, Camping taught a relative free will for humanity and that humans are not totally depraved. However, he subscribed to the idea that salvation is unmerited, cannot be achieved by good works or prayer, and is a pure act of God's grace. * Departing from the doctrine of eternal torment for the unsaved in a place called Hell, Camping taught annihilationism: that life will end and existence will cease for the unsaved soul. * Departing from scriptural doctrines stating that no one can know the time of Christ's second coming, Camping taught (until 2011) that the exact time of the Rapture would be revealed sometime near the end of the world (as per the Daniel 12:9–13 prophecy). * Camping taught that all churches have become apostate and thus must be abandoned. He encouraged personal Bible study and listening to his Family Radio broadcasts. =End times calculations= Camping's teachings regarding the timing of Christ's second coming were based on the cycles of: * Jewish feast days in the Hebrew calendar, as described in the Old Testament, * the lunar month calendar (1 synodic month = 29.53059 days), and * a close approximation of the Gregorian calendar tropical year (365.24219 days, rounded to 365.2422). He projected these cycles into modern times and combined the results with other information in the Bible. Camping's date for the crucifixion of Christ – Friday, April 1, AD 33 (Gregorian) – is nominally the same day as one of those supported by other 20th-century commentators: Friday, April 3, AD 33 (Julian).E.g.Harold Hoehner (1977). Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ Zondervon Publishing House. p. 65–114. However, the dates differ because Camping used the Gregorian calendar, while most commentators use the older Julian calendar, which had a two-day difference during the 1st century AD (they now differ by thirteen days). In 1992, Camping published a book titled 1994?, in which he proclaimed that Christ's return might be on September 6, 1994. In that publication, he also mentioned that 2011 could be the end of the world. Camping's predictions use 1988 as a significant year in the events preceding the apocalypse; this was also the year he left Alameda Bible Fellowship. As a result, some individuals criticized him for \\"date-setting.\\" Camping's later publications, We are Almost There! and To God be The Glory, referred to additional Bible passages which, in his opinion, pointed to May 21, 2011, as the date for the Rapture and October 21, 2011, as the date for the end of the world. 2011 end times prediction Members of the skeptic group IIG counter-protesting Harold Camping's end-of-the-world prediction on Hollywood Boulevard on May 21, 2011. Camping gained notoriety owing to his incorrect prediction that the Rapture would take place on May 21, 2011, and that the end of the world would subsequently take place five months later on October 21, 2011. Followers of Camping claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 2.8% of the world's 2011 population) would be raptured, and publicized the prediction in numerous countries. It has also been reported that a 14-year old Russian girl named Nastya Zachinova committed suicide over his prediction. Reuters reported on May 21 that the curtains were drawn in Camping's house in Alameda, California,, and that no one was answering the door. Camping emerged from his home on May 22, saying he was \\"flabbergasted\\" that the Rapture had not occurred. He stated that he was \\"looking for answers,\\" and would say more when he returned to work on May 23. On May 23, 2011, in an appearance before the press, Camping stated he had reinterpreted his prophecy. In his revised claim, May 21 was a \\"spiritual\\" judgment day, and the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the world.Garance Burke. \\"Radio host says Rapture actually coming in October\\" . Associated Press. May 23, 2011. Camping said his company would not return money donated by followers to publicize the failed May 21 prediction, stating: \\"We're not at the end. Why would we return it?\\"\\"An Autumn Date for the Apocalypse\\". New York Times. May 23, 2011. Atheist and skeptic groups such as American Atheists and IIG gathered across the country with signs attracting attention away from Camping's followers who were in seclusion. Meanwhile, mainstream Christian groups distanced themselves from Camping's predictions. In September 2011, Camping and several other prognosticators who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for \\"teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations\\". In October 2011, News24 reported that the size of Camping's congregation had dwindled to \\"about 25 adults on a typical Sunday\\".\\"Judgement Day doesn't dawn\\". News24.com. 21 October 2011. Camping and his followers largely avoided the media in the months following May 2011, and he remained in seclusion after October 21, 2011 had passed without his predictions coming true. On October 21, Time magazine's website listed Camping's end times prediction as one of Time's \\"Top 10 Failed Predictions\\". =Aftermath= In March 2012, Camping admitted that his predictions were in error, stating: \\"We humbly acknowledge we were wrong about the timing.\\"Last year's Apocalyptic predictions were wrong, preacher admits.

Religion Dispatches. May 18, 2012. Retrieved May 21, 2012. In October 2012, the Christian Post reported that Family Radio was re-broadcasting recordings of Camping's teachings. In March 2013, it was calculated that Family Stations Inc. spent more than $5 million on billboard advertising in 2011, the year the apocalypse was predicted to occur, and the network was reported to be suffering from a major loss of revenue, forcing it to sell its main radio stations and lay off staff. In January 2014, a month after Camping's death, Family Radio stated that it would maintain his mission and theology, including the belief that all established Christian churches are apostate. For the next few years, Family Radio continued to air Camping's past broadcasts and distribute his literature. But in October 2018, Family Radio discontinued using any of his commentary and content because \\"so much of it still contains elements that are very difficult.\\" Tom Evans, who succeeded Camping as president and general manager of Family Radio, said \\"Family Radio has come out of self-imposed isolation and we've repented from many of our former positions, date-setting the end of the world and all that, as well as the condemnation of the church.\\" They are now using content from multiple evangelical sources, such as the young-earth creationist organization Answers in Genesis and Alistair Begg's Truth for Life program.

After leaving the hospital, he moved to a nursing home for rehabilitation, before returning home to continue his recovery. Previously, on June 23, Family Radio had announced that it would replace Camping's Open Forum program with new programming. Camping died on December 15, 2013, as a result of complications from a fall at his home two weeks earlier. His death was confirmed by an employee of the Family Radio Network.

She is known for her films on gender issues in the North African (both Berbers and Arabs) immigrant community in France. Through her films, Benguigui gave a voice to many from the Maghrebi population in France.  Life  Benguigui's parents were Algerian and immigrated to France from Algeria in the early 1950s. She never discovered why her parents decided to leave Algeria, saying the subject was considered taboo. Born in Lille, Benguigui was the eldest daughter of six children and spent her childhood in northern France. Describing herself as a quiet child who grew up in the Islamic tradition, Benguigui was only 13 years old when she first decided to become a filmmaker. Her father was a political leader in the Algerian National Movement, and was jailed in France for three years as a political prisoner (she has also stated that he was jailed on two separate occasions, and that her whole family was once under house arrest). Because he did not support her in her chosen profession, Benguigui broke off contact with him early on, only to reconnect with him in late 2001. After she left the family her mother divorced her father as well. Yamina Benguigui married a Jewish pied-noir and has two daughters. Career Earning her baccalaureate and going on to study at film school, Benguigui then collaborated with French director Jean-Daniel Pollet. Later Benguigui founded \\"Bandit Productions\\" with director Rachid Bouchareb. While her work consisted of a feature film and short films, Benguigui's widely known for her documentaries which were mainly released in the 90's. She uses her films as a tool to build bridges between France's majority and minoritized groups, by bringing to light social issues such as challenges immigrants face. However, it is important to note, Benguigui did not represent all voices and through the film edits and framing of interviews, she ignored certain voices that did not benefit the message her films were sending. Benguigui released In 1994 her documentary Femmes d'Islam was broadcast on France 2,Sylvie Durmelat, \\"Transmission and Mourning in Mémoires d'immigrés: l'héritage maghrébin: Yamina Benguigui as 'Memory Entrepreneuse,'\\" in Women, Immigration and Identities in France, ed. Jane Freedman and Carrie Tarr (Berg Publishers, 2000). p. 171–172. but subsequently she decided that she would prefer to examine the immigrant experience in France rather than life in Algeria. Her next documentary, Mémoires d'immigrés, l'héritage maghrébin, cost 50 million francs and was the result of 350 interviews conducted with immigrants across France. After a two-year period of preparation and another nine months of editing it was first shown in May 1997 on Canal+. Receiving positive reviews from critics, it was rebroadcast the following month and brought to theaters the following January. In 2001, Benguigui produced Inch’Allah dimanche, which takes a closer look at the role gender takes within the space of a home, specifically a young women, Zouina and her family. Previous films, made by men, depict Algerian women as secondary characters, and Benguigui uses her film as a platform where these women can be depicted as multifaceted and Zouina is able to negotiate her identity outside of the strict rules set by her husband. As of February 2008 Benguigui was working on a film entitled Le paradis, c'est complet!, starring Isabelle Adjani. In the French municipal elections of March 2008 Benguigui was elected to represent the 20th arrondissement of Paris on the Paris city council, where she concerned herself in particular with human rights and the fight against discrimination. She is associated with the Socialist Party. On 16 May 2012 President François Hollande of France appointed her to the post of Junior Minister for French Nationals Abroad and Relations with La Francophonie (French-speaking countries worldwide) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 21 June 2012 Yamina Benguigui was confirmed as Minister for la Francophonie in the French Government.

Armed with their fists, feet, and whatever weapons they should find along the way, players are tasked with ridding an unnamed city of zombies. Originally titled Blood Bullet: The House of the Dead Side Story, the game was later renamed Zombies Nightmare before Sega decided on the name Zombie Revenge. This game also serves as a spinoff to Sega's popular House of the Dead series of light gun games and contains numerous references to its parent series. A port of the game for the PlayStation 2 was to be released by Acclaim Entertainment and ported by Acclaim Studios Teesside, but was eventually canceled. Plot and gameplay A top-secret government plan to utilize the dead for military purposes called U.D.S., Undead Soldier is thrown into darkness by some unknown entity. A year later, the city becomes ravaged by zombies. Three of the best AMS agents are sent in: Stick Breitling, Linda Rotta and Rikiya Busujima. They are sent out to eliminate the enemy and track down the mysterious leader of this attack, known only as \\"Zed\\". After battling through the city, they eventually confront Zed, who reveals that Stick's father was involved in project U.D.S. Zed wants revenge for his parents, who were murdered as part of the project. He despises all humans and wishes to turn them all into zombies by spreading the virus. Zed unleashes a powerful U.D.S. inside of him that he calls the God of Destruction, that he plans to use to destroy the rest of the humans, before the three agents defeat him and save humanity. Players battle zombies and bosses in each level through hand- to-hand combat, guns, or other weapons. Each player chooses one of the three characters with different attributes and various levels of proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and guns. The Dreamcast version of the game adds a Battle Mode in which two players can fight each other in one-on-one combat. As a spin-off, the game contains various references to the original The House of the Dead game. Zombies sound and look the same as they did in the first game, and the main protagonists from both the original series and Revenge are AMS agents. At the start of the game, computer icons of Thomas Rogan and \\"G\\" can be seen on Linda's desktop. The Curien Mansion seen in the first House of the Dead appears as its own stage, called \\"The House of the Dead\\" and the music from the first stage is used. The final boss of Revenge is called Black Magician Type 01. The game's credits sequence are also similar, going back through the game's stages to the beginning of the game. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Zombie Revenge on their April 1, 1999 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the year. Chris Charla reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"It looks great, it plays OK, but you'll be done with it forever in four hours. Find a video store and rent it.\\" Upon release, the Dreamcast version received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 32 out of 40.

An early design of the tetrahedron kite from Alexander Graham Bell This kite was invented by Alexander Graham Bell. It came about from his experiments with Hargrave's box kites and his attempts to build a kite that was scalable and big enough to carry both a man and a motor. As such, it was an early experiment on the road to manned flight. He worked on the kites between 1895 and 1910.\\"History of Aviation\\", GlobalAircraft.org 2008 Bell wrote about his discovery of this concept in the June 1903 issue of National Geographic magazine; the article was titled \\"Tetrahedral Principle in Kite Structure\\".Alexander Graham Bell (June 1903) \\"Tetrahedral principle in kite structures,\\" National Geographic Magazine, 14 (6) : 219–251.

Early life and education  A grandson of Clarence Talmadge Brown, the first Protestant minister to gather a congregation in Salt Lake City, Gilkey grew up in Hyde Park Chicago. His father Charles Whitney Gilkey was a liberal theologian and the first Dean of the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel; his mother was Geraldine Gunsaulus Brown who was a well known feminist and leader of the YWCA. Gilkey attended elementary school at the University of Chicago Laboratory School, and in 1936 graduated from the Asheville School for Boys in North Carolina. In 1940, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, magna cum laude, from Harvard University, where he lived in Grays Hall during his freshman year. The following year, he went to China to teach English at Yenching University and was subsequently (1943) imprisoned by the Japanese, first under house arrest at the University and later in an internment camp near the city of Weihsien in Shantung Province (where Eric Liddell was a fellow internee).  Career  After the war, Gilkey obtained his doctorate in religion from Columbia University in New York, being both mentored by and a teaching assistant to Reinhold Niebuhr. He was a Fulbright scholar at Cambridge University (1950–51), and went on to become a professor at Vassar College from 1951 to 1954, and then at Vanderbilt Divinity School from 1954 to 1963. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1960 to study in Munich; another Guggenheim in the mid-1970s took him to Rome. In late 1963 he became a professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School, eventually being named Shailer Mathews Professor of Theology, until his retirement in March 1989. While on sabbatical in 1970, he taught at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands; in 1975 he taught at Kyoto University in Japan, his lecture series there focusing on the environmental perils of industrialization. After his retirement he continued to lecture until 2001 at both the University of Virginia and Georgetown University. During this last period of his teaching career, he was also for one year a visiting professor at the Theology Division (now Divinity School) of Chung Chi College, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Death  He died of meningitis on November 19, 2004 at the University of Virginia hospital in Charlottesville. He was 85.  Theological work  Gilkey was a prolific author, with 15 books and over 100 articles to his credit. Perhaps his most widely read book was the story of his own religious-theological journey. In Shantung Compound: The Story of Men and Women Under Pressure (1966), Gilkey narrates his departure from the liberal Protestant belief system during World War II when he was made a prisoner of war in the \\"Civilian Internment Center\\" near Weihsien for two-and-a-half years (1943–1945). This experience was the basis for his modern interpretation of classical Reformation insights about individual and societal estrangement and self-delusion. Gilkey's new theology of history rethought Christianity and traditional views on sin, free will, providence, grace, eschatology and secular history. Gilkey once responded to fellow theologian Edgar Brightman, who believed in God because man's history (to him) represented steady moral progress, saying \\"I believe in God, because to me, history precisely does not represent such a progress.\\" Gilkey was respected academically for his work on Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich, but was popularly known for his writings on science and religion. He argued against both Christian fundamentalist attacks on science and secularist attacks on religion. He was an expert witness for the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1981 McLean v. Arkansas lawsuit against an Arkansas State law mandating the teaching of creation sciences in high schools. His early books and articles demonstrated the existential power of his experiences, from his early pacifist professions as a student at Harvard University, where his classmates included, among others, future President John F. Kennedy, Pete Seeger, and Cardinal Avery Dulles, to his teaching in China and his experiences as a POW. His teachers, especially Niebuhr and Tillich, at Union Theological Seminary, helped him with methods and categories to formulate a powerful and creative theological vision of his own. In the 1970s and 1980s, Gilkey's theological vision was colored by the growth of Buddhism, and Sikhism as both religions began to influence religious life in America. He held the view most world religions enjoyed \\"rough parity\\". \\"The question for our age,\\" he once wrote, \\"may well become, not will religion survive, as much as will we survive and with what sort of religion, a creative or demonic one?\\"  Books  * Maker of Heaven and Earth: The Christian Doctrine of Creation in the Light of Modern Knowledge 1959. , * Shantung Compound 1966. * Naming the Whirlwind A Renewal of God Language 1970. * Catholicism Confronts Modernity: A Protestant View 1975. , * Reaping the Whirlwind: A Christian Interpretation of History 1976. , * Message and Existence: An Introduction to Christian Theology 1979. , * Through the Tempest: Theological Voyages in a Pluralistic Culture , * Nature, Reality, and the Sacred: The Nexus of Science and Religion Minneapolis, Minn. : Fortress Press, 1993. , * Creationism on Trial: Evolution and God at Little Rock 1985. , * Religion and the Scientific Future: Reflections on Myth, Science, and Theology , * Contemporary Explosion of Theology: Ecumenical Studies in Theology , * Society and the Sacred: Toward a Theology of Culture in Decline , * Gilkey on Tillich 1990. , * Blue Twilight: Nature, Creationism, and American Religion * On Niebuhr: A Theological Study 2001. , Notes Further reading  The Theology of Langdon Gilkey: Systematic and Critical Studies, Kyle Pasewark and Jeff Pool, editors, Merer University * Whirlwind in Culture: Frontiers in Theology--in Honor of Langdon Gilkey, D.
