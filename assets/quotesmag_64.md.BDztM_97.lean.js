Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the ALD subfamily, which is involved in peroxisomal import of fatty acids and/or fatty acyl-CoAs in the organelle. All known peroxisomal ABC transporters are half transporters which require a partner half transporter molecule to form a functional homodimeric or heterodimeric transporter. The function of this peroxisomal membrane protein is unknown; however this protein is speculated to function as a dimerization partner of ABCD1 and/or other peroxisomal ABC transporters.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been observed in patients with adrenoleukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disease. This gene has been identified as a candidate for a modifier gene, accounting for the extreme variation among adrenoleukodystrophy phenotypes. This gene is also a candidate for a complement group of Zellweger syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous disorder of peroxisomal biogenesis.

As of 2014, Caracola was relaunched with members Vendela Hollstr√∂m, Ebba Knutsson and Sannah Johansson. They sing in harmonies as well as in chorus, and the style of their music varies between schlager pop and Ibiza-style trance, but a dance element is usually present. The name was changed from Caracola to Sheelah in 2009, after a disagreement with their earlier record label, who had the rights to the name Caracola. Singer Sara Li left the group in 2010 to focus on her solo career. Sheelah disbanded in 2011. In January 2014, Caracola was relaunched with Vendela Hollstr√∂m, Ebba Knutsson and Sannah Johansson. Caracola attained a number of Top 10 singles in Sweden, with \\"√ñverallt\\" (2006), \\"Sommarnatt\\" (2006), \\"Gl√∂mmer bort mig\\" (2006), \\"Mango Nights\\" (2007) and \\"Smiling in Love\\" (2008). On February 23, 2008, they participated in the third semi-final of Melodifestivalen 2008 with the song \\"Smiling in Love\\". After finishing within the top half of their semi-final but not within the top-quarter, they got through to the round called 'Andra Chansen' ('Second Chance') on March 8, but lost in a head-to-head vote against Ola's \\"Love in Stereo\\". Nonetheless, \\"Smiling in Love\\" went on to become one of their greatest hits in the Swedish singles chart, spending significantly more weeks on the Swedish singles chart than any other hit of theirs to date, outlasting nearly all of the Melodifestivalen entries that reached the final of the competition, and notably spending twice as many weeks in the Swedish Top 25 as Ola's song, which managed only seven, of which one in the Top 10. Caracola have released albums in both Swedish and English, but these have been less successful than their singles so far, their first \\"Caracola\\" (2006) peaking at No. 34 and spending just two weeks on the Swedish album chart, their second \\"Love Alive\\" (2007) peaking at No. 43 in its sole week on the chart, and their third \\"This is Caracola\\" (2008) peaking at No. 24 though enjoying a total of nine weeks in the Top 50 albums chart. At the beginning of 2009, Frida left Caracola for unknown reasons and was replaced by Sara Li. Later in 2009, after issues with their record label, they stopped as Caracola and left the label, leaving them unable to use their old Caracola name anymore. They changed their name to Sheelah and began working on their new album with an edgier pop/dance sound. They continued to tour around Sweden as Sheelah, performing a mixture of Caracola songs and covers. Sometime during 2010, Sara Li left Sheelah to focus on her solo career and Sheelah continued as a duo with Emma and Emelie. Later in 2010, Sheelah released their new song called \\"Psycho\\". In 2011, they returned with a new single called \\"The Last Time\\", with a promotional music video being shot and uploaded on YouTube. Sadly, in fall 2011, Emma decided to leave Sheelah to pursue a solo career. She has not been replaced yet and nothing has been heard from Sheelah since Emma's departure, leaving fans to believe Sheelah is either on break or disbanded. As of 2012, Emma Lewin is now a solo artist under her own name. She released her first song online with a music video called \\"No Excuses\\", which has a dance/pop sound close to their Sheelah material. She is currently in the recording process of her debut album. In January 2014, it was revealed that Caracola would be relaunched with three new members, Vendela Hollstr√∂m, Ebba Knutsson and Sannah Johansson. The group began touring around Sweden, performing Caracola hits like \\"Smiling In Love\\", \\"Mango Nights\\" and \\"Sommernatt\\" and also a mixture of cover songs. Caracola also started recording a new single, due for a release in 2014, however, activities with the new line-up stopped in April 2014 and updates on their official pages stopped as well. Recently, their Twitter account @caracolaofficial was taken offline. Their Facebook banner also removed the photo of the new line-up and replaced it with a photo of the Caracola logo. In 2015, it has been confirmed with members of the recent line-up that they are no longer in Caracola, however, a member hinted that Caracola itself hasn't ended. It is unknown if the label has any further plans for Caracola, as no official word from the label about their activities have been announced.

Crystallins are separated into two classes: taxon-specific, or enzyme, and ubiquitous. The latter class constitutes the major proteins of vertebrate eye lens and maintains the transparency and refractive index of the lens. Since lens central fiber cells lose their nuclei during development, these crystallins are made and then retained throughout life, making them extremely stable proteins. Mammalian lens crystallins are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma families; beta and gamma crystallins are also considered as a superfamily. Alpha and beta families are further divided into acidic and basic groups. Seven protein regions exist in crystallins: four homologous motifs, a connecting peptide, and N- and C-terminal extensions. Beta-crystallins, the most heterogeneous, differ by the presence of the C-terminal extension (present in the basic group, none in the acidic group). Beta-crystallins form aggregates of different sizes and are able to self-associate to form dimers or to form heterodimers with other beta-crystallins.

Early life and education McKeown was born in New York City and raised in Metuchen, New Jersey. As a child he taught himself the art of horror makeup, gaining notoriety by terrorizing local neighborhoods. He graduated from Emerson College in 1968 with high honors, having studied cinematography and theater in addition to English literature. Career Choices After a brief stint as an Editorial Coordinator at ABC-TV in New York City, he spent six years as a high school teacher, numbering among his students the future writer and movie director Richard Wenk, stage director Lonnie Price, magician-illusionist David Copperfield, and animation producer Tom Ruegger. During this period he directed a series of musicals and straight plays for school, community theatre, and summer stock. In 1976, McKeown left teaching to join the Jean Cocteau Repertory in New York as an actor. He quickly moved on to other challenges, creating designs for many plays there, including sets and costumes for the Cocteau‚Äôs world premiere of Tennessee Williams‚Äô Something Cloudy, Something Clear, and staging a number of productions, notably poet Robert Lowell‚Äôs adaptation of The Oresteia of Aeschylus. Following the release of ‚ÄúThe Deadly Spawn‚Äù in 1983, McKeown shot a number of short video documentaries in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and New York. One of these, a promotional video for New York‚Äôs LGBT Center, ultimately led him to his ongoing role as facilitator of the storytelling workshop, Queer Stories. He compiled and edited Queer Stories for Boys (Thunder's Mouth Press, 2004), an anthology of writings by members of the workshop. Beginning in 2004, he returned to the stage as an actor after a hiatus of twenty-four years, joining the Phoenix Theatre Ensemble for their productions of Kafka‚Äôs The Trial and Anouilh‚Äôs Antigone.

The various movements were also inspired by modernizing attitudes deriving from both nationalist and socialist ideologies, as well as feeding on older anti-Christian sentiment that was in large part due to repeated invasions of China by Western countries.Hodous, Lewis The Anti- Christian Movement in ChinaCohen, Paul A. The Anti-Christian Tradition in China The Chinese Nationalists had also sought unity in their country as well as a transformation in the way that their society operated which seemed to heavily rely upon Western thought and/or ideals. They brought forth age-old criticisms about the Western religion and accused the Christian missionaries of actively participating in it as a way of eliminating the native culture like other foreign imperialists.  Origins  The most influential publication behind the movement was an article by Zhu Zhixin, a colleague of Sun Yat-sen, entitled What Is Jesus?, first published in 1919 and much republished thereafter. Zhu argued that Jesus was an ordinary illegitimate peasant child who became the leader of a band of mystical enthusiasts (with bandit elements) such as were often found in Chinese history. One precipitating factor was the publication in 1922 of The Christian Occupation of China, a large-scale study of China's Protestant Christian churches and China's resources. Although the publication had been intended to prepare the way for turning Chinese churches over to Chinese Christians, the title seemed to show a different intent. A student movement was founded, garnering support at a number of universities, initially to oppose the planned meeting of the conference of the World Student Christian Federation in China, and more generally to counter-act the baleful influence of Christianity on China's attempts to modernize.Tatsuro and Sumiko Yamamoto, \\"The Anti-Christian Movement in China, 1922-1927\\", The Far Eastern Quarterly 12:2 (1953), pp. 133-147. Available on jstor Accessed 16 January 2008. Some other motives that were noted was to reclaim the lost infrastructure and temples that were given to the Christian missionaries and were transformed to become schools.  Course  Pamphlets, rallies and petitions were numerous from 1922 through 1927. The killing of six Christian missionaries during the Nanking Incident of 1927 has been attributed to the influence of the movement, but can also be attributed to more generalized xenophobia. In response to the attacks on Christian missionaries from various Chinese rebellions, the Churches sent out more missionaries to China in a ‚ÄúFaith Movement‚Äù to invigorate a call to faith for the Chinese. Despite the rejection and danger, many missionaries were also convinced that by the twentieth century, the ‚ÄúSecond Coming of Christ‚Äù would occur and thus, they seemed desperate to save as many people as they could before it was too late. Those that participated in persecuting the American Christian used fear tactics such as destroying the homes of the missionaries or kidnapping them and leaving them stranded somewhere in the wilderness, and caused multiple emotional breakdowns for many. American Christians began to become furloughed from all the chaos and panic as well as some of the Church's loss of funds. Chinese Christians were left in charge of the institutions that were left behind but many were persecuted still because of the contradicting ideals of the natives and Christianity. The movement effectively came to an end with Chiang Kai-shek's baptism in 1929 and the appointment of T. V. Soong, a Christian, as premier in 1930. The issue was also put to a close when all the missionaries were driven from China as WWII approached.

The declaration of independence of Montenegro in 2006 ended the ex-Yugoslav state. After the collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), the remaining republics of Montenegro and Serbia agreed to the formation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) which officially abandoned communism and nominally endorsed democratic institutions. Montenegro was a constituent republic of the FRY and its successor state until 2006 when Montenegro declared independence from Serbia and Montenegro following the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum. History=Federal Republic of Yugoslavia= Upon entry into the FRY, Montenegro was led by President Momir Bulatoviƒá, a former member of the Communist Party in Yugoslavia and an ally of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, whom Bulatoviƒá helped gain power during the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution, in which he and Milo≈°eviƒá gained power in their respective republics. In the final years of the SFRY's existence, Bulatoviƒá had supported Milo≈°eviƒá's demands for a \\"one-member, one-vote\\" system in the Communist party congress which would have given numerical superiority to their cohort in the congress. This fostered the collapse of the Communist Party and later the SFRY. Bulatoviƒá began to show reluctance to remain in a union with Serbia when countries like Italy offered Montenegro the possibility of quick access into the European Community if Montenegro separated from Yugoslavia. However, Bulatovic's brief endorsement of Montenegrin independence ended due to pressure from Serbia. In 1992, Montenegro joined the FRY after a referendum took place on 1 March of that year. In the same year, the capital Titograd (named after former Yugoslav leader Joseph Broz Tito) was renamed to its pre- communist name of Podgorica. In 1993, Montenegro abandoned its former Communist-era flag and adopted a plain tricolour, similar to Serbia's but longer, and with a lighter blue for its centre stripe, marking a distinction between the two republics which had exactly the same flag during the Communist era. This flag would be in place until 2004. Montenegro's continued union with Serbia provided legitimacy to the continuation of a Yugoslav state, important to Serbia as the continuation of a Yugoslav state would allow the federation to lay claim to former Yugoslav territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia populated by Serbs. Also Montenegro had access to the sea which kept Serbia's sovereign body from being landlocked and allowed for a navy (merchant and military) to exist. Over time, the domineering nature of President Milo≈°eviƒá and his allies within the federation provoked ordinary Montenegrins to shift towards independence, while creating a growing desire for regime change and support for opposition within Serbia. Strain with Serbia over economic policy caused Montenegro to adopt the Deutsche Mark in 1996 while waiting for the European Community to formalise a European currency. After Bulatoviƒá stepped down as Montenegrin president in 1998, the new president Milo ƒêukanoviƒá opposed Milo≈°eviƒá (now Yugoslav President) and set Montenegro on a course to independence.Montenegro: Country Profile, balkaninsight.com =Confederacy and independence= In 2003, the FR Yugoslavia became a confederacy and granted more autonomy to Montenegro with only defence and foreign policy remaining responsibility for Yugoslavia. This was a step closer to Montenegro's independence. In 2006, Montenegro held an independence referendum. 55% voted in favour of independence, but this was only a narrow victory for independence. Montenegro officially declared independence in June 2006, causing Serbia to become independent, ending the federal union of Yugoslavia.Montenegro declares independence BBC News, 4 June 2006 Former flag and coat of arms file:Flag of Serbia (1992‚Äì2004).svgFormer flag of the Republic of Montenegro from 1992 to 1994 (the same flag as the Republic of Serbia) file:Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Socialist_Republic_of_Montenegro.svgFormer emblem of the Republic of Montenegro (1992‚Äì1994), SR Montenegro Coat of arms since 1945.

The western area of the bank has a minimum depth of , with clear waters allowing observation of the ocean floor from the surface. With an abundance of biodiversity, the bank is a fishing area, in addition to being an important diving spot of the Atlantic Ocean. History The bank was named after the oceanographic campaign of Prince Albert I of Monaco, whose research vessel Princess Alice was involved in its discovery on 9 July 1896. On that day, at 6:00 a.m., at the beginning of a deep water exploration, rocky ledges were discovered deep. After scouring the area, the group discovered an extensive \\"platform\\", with a perimeter of about , and two extensions of in length. The platform was below the surface, although the peak is only from the surface. The bathymetric survey was entrusted to captain Charlwood Henry Carr (1848-1918), who was also the prince's field assistant and navigator of the Princesse Alice. Carr was responsible for the original depth measurements at Princess Alice Bank. On 13 July 1896, from Faial, Prince Albert telegrammed King Carlos I of Portugal announcing the discovery and informing him of the usefulness of the bank for fishing. Returning to Monaco, on 21 August, the prince circulated a press statement reporting the discovery and stressing its importance to Azorean fisheries. In gratitude for the discovery, King Carlos awarded the prince with the \\"grand collar\\" of the Order of Santiago, having already granted Captain Carr the honorific degree of master of the Order of St. Benedict in 1894. Increasingly Princess Alice Bank has become one of the main areas for fishing exploration within the Central Group of the Azorean islands. Geography An area of around the bank, measured from the coasts of the closest islands, was established by the European Union as a reserve for Azorean fishermen. Princess Alice Bank is one of the main points of friction, or disagreement, in the current dispute between the Regional Government of the Azores and the European Union regarding the reform of the common fisheries policy.

The highway is nominally labeled \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" throughout North Carolina, though it really follows a general northwest-southeast path. The segments from Buies Creek to Sanford and from Greensboro to Boone take on more of an east- west route direction, with compass west corresponding to the signed north direction. A majority of the highway is part of the North Carolina Strategic Highway Corridors system. Because of this designation, the state has made numerous changes converting a rural two-lane highway into a major freeway/expressway with 4 or more lanes. Numerous former segments of the highway named \\"Old U.S. Route 421\\" are found along the entire route. Route description I-40 BUS/US 421/NC 150 near Kernersville Wilkes County King Street (US 421), going through downtown Boone US 421 starts at a parking/dock area on the Cape Fear side of Pleasure Island. Within , US 421 passes through its unsigned junction with NC 211 and the approach to the Fort Fisher Ferry Terminal, where travelers can board to cross the Cape Fear River toward Southport. Immediately after the ferry terminal is the Fort Fisher State Recreation Area, where the first and second battles of Fort Fisher took place. The highway continues north, going through popular tourist destinations in New Hanover county: Kure Beach, and Carolina Beach. US 421 eventually enters Wilmington along the river side of the city. At Wooster Street, it goes west, overlapping with several other highways and funnels through Brunswick County before returning in northwestern New Hanover County; there it links with Interstate 140 (I-140) before continuing north towards Clinton. From about north of the I-140 interchange, the road remains a four-lane divided highway for another . After its intersection with NC 210, it becomes a rural two-lane highway for much of its remainder until Dunn. The exception is in Clinton, where it follows Faircloth Freeway to bypass the city, running concurrent to US 701 for about . There is one rest area located just north of Delway. US 421 meets I-95 in Dunn. From Wilmington to Dunn, the route parallels I-40 approximately to US 421's east. After crossing downtown Dunn and Erwin immediately to the east, US 421 becomes a four-lane divided highway again until reaching Lillington, with a short segment in Buies Creek containing a center lane and reduced speed limit as it crosses Campbell University. Upon reaching the junction with US 401, NC 27, and NC 210, all four routes collect onto a thoroughfare heading south over the Cape Fear River into downtown Lillington. US 421 then splits off to the west, following two-lane Front Street until Sanford (though speed limit never actually increases). Upon reaching Sanford, US 421 formerly followed Horner Boulevard with NC 87 to cross downtown, but it is now rerouted onto the recently completed Sanford Bypass, the entirety of which is freeway. It runs concurrent with NC 87 Bypass until the US 1/US 15/US 501/NC 87 interchange, from which it continues until the end of the bypass near Cumnock. For the rest of its route until Greensboro, US 421 remains almost entirely free-flowing. It is an expressway from Sanford to just south of Siler City, bypassing Goldston, Bear Creek, and Siler City. From here to the Greensboro Urban Loop, US 421 becomes a freeway, bypassing Staley, Liberty, and Julian. All of these cities/places were connected by US 421's old alignment, now called some variant of Old US 421 for the majority of its route. Near Pleasant Garden, US 421 joins I-85 on the Greensboro Urban Loop, staying with the loop as I-85 leaves and I-73 joins it. Another later, US 421 leaves the Greensboro Urban Loop to join I-40 and continue westward towards Winston-Salem. Near Kernersville, US 421 remains with I-40 Business, a former alignment of I-40, going through downtown Winston-Salem. West of Winston-Salem, I-40 Business ends at an interchange with mainline I-40 and US 421 continues west as a freeway towards Yadkinville and Wilkesboro. When the highway nears North Wilkesboro, the highway passes North Wilkesboro Speedway (access via exit 282); there is also a visitor center built in 2009 as the state's first environmentally friendly rest area, located at mile marker 283. As US 421 enters Wilkesboro city limits, it downgrades to an expressway with various stores and restaurants along it. As it leaves Wilkesboro, US 421 begins a gradual climb in elevation, until approximately from Deep Gap, where it climbs up the steep escarpment along the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Access to the Blue Ridge Parkway is located at Deep Gap, as US 421 continues on towards Boone. As US 421 approaches Boone, the expressway comes to an end just before an intersection with Old US 421\\\\. The road continues into Boone as four lane boulevard, becoming two lanes at the intersection with US 321\\\\. US 321 north, US 421 north, and NC 194 south all run concurrent through the downtown area via King Street. After leaving Boone, US 421 continues on as a two-lane road to the Tennessee state line, heading on to Mountain City.  Designations  US 421 overlaps with two state scenic byways: the Cape Fear Historic Byway, in downtown Wilmington, and the U.S. 421 Scenic Byway, between Deep Gap and Boone. Two of North Carolina's Bicycle Routes run concurrent for portions of US 421\\\\. North Carolina Bicycle Route 5 is concurrent from US 421's southern terminus at Fort Fisher to north of Snows Cut, through downtown Wilmington to Blueberry Road near Montague, North Carolina, and a short portion near Coats. A small part of North Carolina Bicycle Route 3 is concurrent with US 421 in downtown Wilmington. History US 221, US 321, and US 421\\\\. Truck routes along NC 105 in Boone *1931 - US 421 officially appears on highway maps starting from Winston-Salem (junction with US 70/170) to Boone at King/Hardin Street intersection (junction with US 221/321). It was solely within the state of North Carolina and was completely overlapped with NC 60. *1932 - US 421 was extended both north and south. North from Boone, it extended to Sugar Grove where it then replaced US 321 heading towards Mountain City, Tennessee; US 321 redirects towards Elizabethton, Tennessee. From Winston-Salem, the highway is routed to Wilmington following NC 60. *1933 - Highway was realigned around Boone (using a straighter alignment) and in Greensboro (Market Street). *1934 - NC 60 is completely removed from its original route, leaving US 421. NC 60 gets renumbered on a short highway in Cherokee County, where it continues to this day. *1936 - US 421 is extended south from Wilmington to Carolina Beach, Kure Beach, and Fort Fisher, replacing NC 40. *1951‚Äì1952 - US 421 bypasses Clinton (on what would be today's Faircloth Freeway). The Wilkesboro area is realigned through town to North Wilkesboro. *1954‚Äì1955 - US 421 is rerouted going west out of Wilmington via US 17/74/76, then north following NC 133. *1957‚Äì1958 - US 421 is realigned onto a straighter routing between Deep Gap and Wilkesboro. US 421 is redirected out of North Wilkesboro, old routing is renumbered as US 421-A (Now US 421 Business). US 421 is placed onto one-way streets within Winston-Salem (using 4th and 5th streets), it is also rerouted in Greensboro going from Market Street to the freeway O. Henry Blvd. Between Erwin and Dunn, US 421 is realigned onto a new four-lane expressway. *1962‚Äì1963 - US 421 is realigned onto a new road near Sugar Grove and Zionville, leaving the communities of Amantha and Mabel. Between Yadkinville and Winston-Salem, US 421 is given its current alignment, expanding to a freeway after the Yadkin River to I-40; it then overlaps with I-40 (later called Business 40) through downtown Winston-Salem. In Harnett County, US 421 is moved north, avoiding the community of Mamers, and enters Lillington via Front Street. US 421 is straighten out through Harrells. *1964‚Äì1968 - US 421 becomes one-way streets through downtown Greensboro (Market Street and Madison/Gaston Avenues). US 421 is rerouted onto the new Faircloth Freeway in Clinton. *1969‚Äì1970 - US 421 is rerouted onto the new Cape Fear Bridge in Wilmington. US 421 is realigned around Bonlee and Bear Creek. *1971‚Äì1984 - US 421 completes its bypass around Wilkesboro. Between Greensboro and Staley is upgraded to expressway standards (Joseph M. Hunt Jr Expressway) and bypasses the communities of Pleasant Garden, Climax, Julian, and Liberty. US 421 is rerouted in Sanford, avoiding the community of Broadway. *1987‚Äì1990 - The Siler City bypass is completed. US 421 is rerouted going north around Greensboro then going south on Henry Boulevard (US 29). *1994‚Äì1999 - US 421 is removed from all surface roads from Kernersville to Greensboro, follows I-40 to Joseph M. Hunt Jr Expressway. *2000‚Äì2003 - US 421 is realigned and widen to 4-lane freeway between Yadkinville to Wilkesboro and a 4-lane expressway between Wilkesboro to Boone (though some parts already pre-existed for before 2000). This completes US 421 as a 4-lane (or more) highway from Sanford to Boone. *2008 - US 421 is realigned in Greensboro to follow the new southern loop, overlapping with I-73 and I-85 to Joseph M. Hunt Jr Expressway. This was done to give drivers a route direction to Winston-Salem after I-40 returned to its original routing after one year on the southern loop. *2012 - In Boone, a section, known as King Street, was widened from four to six lanes with a raised concrete median from US 321 (Hardin Street) to east of NC 194 (Jefferson Road). The project cost $16.2 million.http://www2.wataugademocrat.com/News/story/421-widening-project- nearly-done-id-007879 =Project reconstruction of highway in Winston-Salem= In Winston-Salem, a section from west of Fourth Street to east of Church Street was reconstructed between 2018 and 2020 to completely upgrade and streamline. The project included removing the existing pavement and replacing it with new concrete pavement, upgrade and modernize entrance and exit ramps, and replace most of the bridges on and over the freeway. Work began on this rehab in 2018 with the closure of several miles of U.S. 421. The closed section was reopened earlier than expected in early February 2020. Concurrent with the rehabilitation of the route, the Interstate 40 Business designation was dropped from the entire route, with the route remaining U.S. 421, exits renumbered to US 421 mileage, and the highway taking on a new name, The Salem Parkway. Future In September 2019, the Greensboro Urban Area Transportation Advisory Committee (GUATAC) passed a resolution in support of giving US 421 interstate designation between I-40 in Greensboro and I-95 near Fayetteville and bringing it up to interstate standards. The resolution noted that an interstate along US 421 would provide a ‚Äúvaluable alternate route for military and freight traffic‚Äù as well as ‚Äúadditional evacuation routes and relief and recovery routes to the region.‚Äù The resolution also stated that US 421 becoming an interstate would ‚Äúsupport economic development, including the four designated megasites in the Carolina Core.‚Äù The resolution states that the North Carolina Board of Transportation has already passed a resolution in support of the future interstate designation for US 421. Other MPOs along the proposed route would have to pass similar resolutions for NCDOT to start seriously considering the proposal. No interstate route numbers have been chosen for the corridor. In New Hanover and Brunswick counties, the Cape Fear Skyway has begun its project development studies (since 2007) to build a toll road and bridge that will bypass Wilmington. Early estimates range from $950 million to $1.1 billion. The environmental impact study is expected to be completed in 2014, a record of decision and a complete financial feasibility will be done in 2015. Junction list Through Winston-Salem, the exit numbers concurrent with Business 40 were renumbered to reflect U.S. 421's mileage. Note ‚Äì Exit numbers west of Winston-Salem are aligned when US 421 went north around Greensboro in late-1980s/early-1990s. As a result, from realignments in Greensboro, the actual mileage vs. exit number mileage is off by an average of .

Lurlines sister ships were , and . Lurline served as a troopship in World War II operated by War Shipping Administration agents serving Army troop transport requirements. Rechristened in 1963 by Chandris Lines as the (Royal Hellenic Mail Ship) RHMS Ellinis, the ship became one of the most important luxury cruise ships on the Australian and New Zealand services. She operated in Australasia and Oceania until 1980. Ships named Lurline of the Matson Line =Lurline (1887)= William Matson had first come to appreciate the name in the 1870s while serving as skipper aboard the Claus Spreckels family yacht Lurline (a poetic variation of Lorelei, the Rhine river siren)Kendall, Henry. The Poems of Henry Kendall: Lurline out of San Francisco Bay. Matson met his future wife, Lillie Low, on a yacht voyage he captained to Hawaii; the couple named their daughter Lurline Berenice Matson. Spreckels sold a 150-foot brigantine named Lurline to Matson so that Matson could replace his smaller schooner Emma Claudina and double the shipping operation which involved hauling supplies and a few passengers to Hawaii and returning with cargos of Spreckels sugar. Matson added other vessels to his nascent fleet and the brigantine was sold to another company in 1896. =Lurline (1908)= Matson built a steamship named Lurline in 1908;Matson.com fleet history. Birth of a Ship: From Sail to Steam. one which carried mainly freight yet could hold 51 passengers along with 65 crew. This steamer served Matson for twenty years, including a stint with United States Shipping Board during World War I. Matson died in 1917; his company continued under a board of directors. Lurline Matson married William P. Roth in 1914; in 1927 Roth became president of Matson Lines. That same year saw (Hawaiian for \\"flying fish\\") enter service inaugurating a higher class of tourist travel to Hawaii. In 1928, Roth sold the old steamship Lurline to the Alaska Packers' Association. That ship served various duties including immigration and freight under the Yugoslavian flag (renamed Radnik) and was finally broken up in 1953. =Lurline (1932)= In 1932, the last of four smart liners designed by William Francis Gibbs and built for the Matson Lines' Pacific services was launched: SS Lurline christened on 12 July 1932 in Quincy, Massachusetts, by Lurline Matson Roth (who had also christened her father's 1908 steamship Lurline as a young woman of 18). On 12 January 1933, SS Lurline left New York City bound for San Francisco via the Panama Canal on her maiden voyage, thence to Sydney and the South Seas, returning to San Francisco on 24 April 1933. She then served on the express San Francisco to Honolulu service with Malolo, with whom she shared appearance. Earhart and Duke Kahanamoku (ca. 1934‚Äì35) Famous aviator Amelia Earhart rode Lurline from Los Angeles to Honolulu with her Lockheed Vega airplane secured on deck during December 22‚Äì27, 1934. The voyage prepared her for the record-breaking Honolulu-to-Oakland solo flight she made in January 1935. Lurline was half-way from Honolulu to San Francisco on 7 December 1941, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. The ship's alleged reception of radio signals from the Japanese fleet became part of the Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory. She made her destination safely, travelling at maximum speed, and soon returned to Hawaii with her Matson sisters and in a convoy laden with troops and supplies. She spent the war providing similar services, often voyaging to Australia, and once transported Australian Prime Minister John Curtin to America to confer with President Roosevelt. Wartime events put Lurline at risk. Royal Australian Air Force trainee pilot Arthur Harrison had been put on watch without adequate training. \\"A straight line of bubbles extending from away out on the starboard side of the ship to across the bow. I had never seen anything quite like it, but it reminded me of bubbles behind a motorboat. I called to the lad on watch on the next gun forward. A few seconds later the ship went into a hard 90 degree turn to port. We RAAF trainees received a severe reprimand from the captain for not reporting the torpedo. Anyway, it was a bad miss.\\" Lurline was returned to Matson Lines in mid-1946 and extensively refitted at Bethlehem-Alameda Shipyard in Alameda, California, in 1947 at the then huge cost of US$20 million. She resumed her San Francisco-to-Honolulu service from 15 April 1948 and regained her pre-war status as the Pacific Ocean's top liner. Lurline outbound through the Golden Gate (1955) Her high occupancy rates during the early 1950s caused Matson to also refit her sister ship Monterey (renaming her SS Matsonia) and the two liners provided a first class-only service between Hawaii and the American mainland from June 1957 to September 1962, mixed with the occasional Pacific cruise. Serious competition from jet airliners caused passenger loads to fall in the early 1960s and Matsonia was laid up in late 1962. =Lurline (1963, ex-Matsonia, ex-Monterey)= Only a few months later, Lurline arrived in Los Angeles with serious engine trouble in her port turbine and was laid up, with the required repairs considered too expensive. Matson instead brought the Matsonia out of retirement and, characteristically, changed her name to Lurline. The original Lurline was sold to Chandris Lines in 1963.  Ellinis of the Chandris Line  Lurline was bought by Chandris Lines in September 1963 to replace SS Brittany, wrecked by fire earlier in the year. Ellinis sailed under her new name from California to North East England for repairs in North Shields and was refitted with increased accommodation for 1,668 passengers in one class. She was given new Chandris livery and a modernised superstructure with new funnels and embarked on her maiden voyage from Piraeus to Sydney on 30 December 1963. Her homeward voyages were alternately routed east via the Panama Canal to Southampton. The ship took occasional cruises. In 1973 singer David Bowie wrote his song Aladdin Sane from his album Aladdin Sane whilst on board. This can be seen by the annotation in the vinyl pressings of this album. In April 1974, cruising to Japan, Ellinis developed major problems in one engine. Fortunately, Chandris were able to buy a surplus engine from her sister ship Homeric (ex-Mariposa) which was being broken up in Taiwan at the time. The replacement was carried out in Rotterdam, finishing in March 1975. Ellinis provided mainly cruise services from 1975 and, in October 1981, she was finally laid up in Greece after providing passenger services for nearly fifty years. Despite various plans to utilize the ship whole, she was sold in 1986 and scrapped in Taiwan in 1987. Some of her fittings were installed in other Chandris ships; her engine parts were stored against future need by her aging sister Britanis (ex- Monterey). Elliniss radio callsign was SWXX and two of her known QSS (\\"working frequencies\\") were 8343 and 12508 kHz.

Travelling to Paris in 1814, Redding edited Galignani's Messenger from 1815 to 1818, as well as providing Paris correspondence for the Examiner. Between 1821 and 1830 Redding effectively edited The New Monthly Magazine (owned by Henry Colburn, and nominally edited by Thomas Campbell). From 1831 to 1833 Redding and Campbell edited The Metropolitan Magazine. He edited the Bath Guardian (1834‚Äì5) and the Staffordshire Examiner (1836‚Äì40). In 1841 he made two unsuccessful attempts to found journals, the English Journal and London Journal. After that time he abandoned journalism for the writing of books. To his earlier novel, Gabrielle (1829), a children's book on shipwrecks (1833) and his history of wine (1833), he now began a series of county histories, memoirs of William Beckford and Thomas Campbell, and volumes of autobiography and reminiscences.

He finished his primary and secondary education in Gaza in 1948. He started publishing his work in the Jaffa-based magazine Al-Hurriya () (translated: Liberty), where he published his first poems in 1946. Two years later, in 1948, he enrolled in the American University in Cairo and subsequently graduated in 1952. His dissertation was titled \\"The Spoken or Head Word in Lower Eastern Broadcast Media\\", discussing the borders between radio and TV on one hand and the printed newspaper media on the other. He became involved with democratic and national work early on in his life, and later dedicated himself to poetry and teaching. On January 27, 1952 he published his first work titled Al-Ma'raka () (translated: The Battle). He published several other volumes of poetry: Palestine in the Heart, (1964), Trees Die Standing (1966). He was imprisoned in Egyptian jails in Gaza twice: 1955 to 1957 and 1959 to 1963. In one of them he met his future wife, Sahbaa al-Barbari, one of the first women communists in Gaza. He lived in exile after the Israeli conquest of the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Six-Day War.Ramzy Baroud,'Gaza: Resistance Through Poetry,' CounterPunch 17 June 2016.

Since its discovery in 1995, TRIM32 has been shown to be implicated in a number of diverse biological pathways.  Structure  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region.  Subcellular distribution  The protein localizes to cytoplasmic bodies. The protein has also been localized to the nucleus, where it interacts with the activation domain of the HIV-1 Tat protein. The Tat protein activates transcription of HIV-1 genes.  Interactions  TRIM32 has been shown to interact with: * actin, * ABI2 * c-Myc, * dysbindin, and * piasy,  Function = Mechanism = Currently, TRIM32 is believed to employ two different mechanisms to affect molecular targets. First, it can act through its N-terminal RING finger as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, responsible for attaching ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues of target proteins, in order to mark them for proteosome degradation. Currently evidence suggests TRIM32 ubiquitinates multiple proteins including c-Myc, dysbindin, actin, piasy, and Abl-interactor2 (ABI2). The second mechanism by which TRIM32 is believed to operate involves binding of proteins to the C-terminal NHL repeat, which has been shown to activate miRNAs. = Development = Research has recently shown the importance of TRIM32 in the development of the mouse neocortex. In the mouse neocortex, neural progenitor cells generate daughter cells which either differentiate into specific neurons or maintain the progenitor state of the mother cell. TRIM32 helps control the balance between differentiating and progenitor cells by localizing to a pole during progenitor cell division, and thus becoming concentrated in one of the two daughter cells. This asymmetric division of TRIM32 induces neuronal differentiation in daughter cells which contain high TRIM32 concentrations, while cells with low TRIM32 concentrations retain progenitor cell fate. Proposed theories on how TRIM32 induces differentiation involve the ubiquitination of the transcription factor c-Myc and the binding of Argonaute-1 (Ago-1). The binding of Ago-1 induces activity of miRNAs, particularly Let-7a, which has been shown to play a role in regulating proliferation and neuronal differentiation. = Skeletal muscle = TRIM32 is expressed in skeletal muscle, where it interacts with myosin and may ubiquitinate actin (it has been shown to do so in vitro). No difference has been observed between wild-type and LHMD2H-mutated TRIM32 in terms of actin or myosin binding, however, and thus the mechanism which causes the muscular dystrophy, LGMD2H, is still unknown. Additionally, TRIM32 is known to ubiquitinate dysbindin, a protein associated with both skeletal muscles and neural tissue. The purpose and effects of the ubiquitination of dysbindin are as yet unclear.  Clinical significance = Mutation-associated diseases = Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome (BBS): TRIM32 is one of 14 genes known to be linked with BBS. Specifically a mutation (P130S) in the B-box of TRIM32 gives rise to BBS. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type2H (LGMD2H): LGMD2H is caused by 4 mutations of TRIM32 in the C-terminal NHL domain: D487N (third NHL repeat), R394H (first NHL repeat), T520TfsX13 (fourth NHL repeat), and D588del (fifth NHL repeat). = Cancer = TRIM32 is overexpressed in skin cancer cells. It is thought that TRIM32 regulates NF-Œ∫B activity through ubiquitination of Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT Y (Piasy). Piasy acts as an inhibitor of NF-Œ∫B, and NF-Œ∫B acts as an anti-apoptotic factor. Thus, when Piasy is present, NF-Œ∫B is inhibited, and keratinocytes undergo apoptosis when exposed to ultraviolet-B radiation or TNFŒ±, preventing cancer formation. When TRIM32 is overexpressed, Piasy is degraded, allowing NF-Œ∫B to function, and thus when cells are exposed to ultraviolet-B radiation or TNFŒ±, apoptosis does not occur, potentially allowing cancer formation. TRIM32 additionally promotes cancer formation by ubiquitinating Abl-interactor 2 (Abi2), which is a tumor suppressor and inhibitor of cell migration.

Kever Shimon haTzadik) is an ancient tomb in Jerusalem. According to scholarly consensus, based on an in situ inscription, it is the 2nd-century CE burial site of a Roman matron named Julia Sabina. However, according to a medieval Jewish tradition, is believed to be the burial place of Simeon the Just and his students. It is located adjacent to the Cave of the Minor Sanhedrin in the Shimon HaTzadik city quarter adjoining Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Identification=Galilee location= In the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela wrote that the tomb of Simeon was at \\"Tymin or Timnathah\\", between Tiberias and Meiron. =Jerusalem location= Rabbi Jacob, the messenger of Jehiel of Paris, wrote in 1238‚Äì1244 that \\"the cave of Simeon the Just and his disciples is near Jerusalem\\". Obadiah da Bertinoro wrote around 1490 that \\"The sepulchre of the seventy Elders, which lies about 2,000 cubits from Jerusalem, is splendid, especially that of Simon the Just.\\" History The tomb, c1900 For centuries the cave tomb was only accessible by paying an admission fee to the Arab caretakers of the site; this was a common arrangement at Jewish, Christian, and even Roman sites in Jerusalem. During the Ottoman period, Wasif Jawhariyyeh mentions the site as the location of communal festivities known as the Yehudia, attended by Jewish, Christian, and Muslims in honour of Shimon the Just. While Jewish people flock to the tomb of Shimon bar Yochai on Lag Ba'omer to perform the Upsherin ceremony, the Tomb of Simeon the Just is used by many as an alternative location. A 19th century traveller, John Wilson, describes this practice in his book The Lands of the Bible Visited and Described, published in 1847. In 1876, the Jewish community purchased the site and surrounding land for 15,000 francs. Under the guidance of Jerusalem's chief rabbi, Shmuel Salant, housing construction in the area around the tomb commenced in 1891. By 1948, twenty Jewish families were living in the neighborhood. After the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the property fell on the Jordanian side of the Green Line, and Palestinian families moved into the homes. Authenticity left In 1871, Clermont-Ganneau discovered :\\"a Roman inscription whose existence had escaped the notice of the archaeologists who had preceded me, even as it has that of those who have followed me, for up to the present day no one, as far as I know, has noticed it or mentioned it. It is not graffito, but a large inscription carved in lapidary style in a cartouche with triangular tabs at the ends, engraved on the back wall of the ante-chamber, above the low door, about two metres above the floor of the chamber.\\" The inscription had been badly damaged by hammering, but the first line clearly read Juliae Sabinae, indicating to Clermont-Ganneau that the tomb was that of a Roman matron named Julia Sabina. Clermont-Ganneau surmised that she was the wife or daughter of Julius Sabina, first centurion of the Tenth Legion \\"Fretensis\\", whose inscription elsewhere showed very similar lettering. Because of this inscription, and other reasons, historians and archaeologists have reached the consensus that the tomb cannot be that of Simon the Just. Kloner and Zissu date the tomb to the late Second Temple period. However, because of the absence of the narrow burial shafts called kokhim, they suggest it may have been used to store the bones of people originally buried elsewhere, rather than fresh corpses. Such a need arose when the \\"third wall\\" of Jerusalem surrounded many tombs during the first century CE, since Jewish law forbids burials within the city limits. Kloner and Zissu conjecture that the association with Simeon dated from the discovery during the Middle Ages of an ossuary bearing the common name \\"Simeon\\".

It is likely a Neptune-like planet orbiting at a distance of nearly 22 AU from its star. Characteristics=Mass, radius and temperature= TW Hydrae b is an ice giant, an exoplanet with a radius and mass close to that of the ice giants Neptune and Uranus. It may have an equilibrium temperature of around . It has an estimated mass of around 22.72 (or 1.5 MNeptune) and a possible radius of 4.25 . =Host star= The planet orbits a (K-type) T Tauri star named TW Hydrae. The star has a mass of 0.8 and a radius of 1.1 . It has a temperature of 4000 K and is about 9 million years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. Its luminosity () is 28% of that of the Sun.From \\\\begin{smallmatrix}L=4 \\\\pi R^2 \\\\sigma T_{\\\\rm eff}^4 \\\\end{smallmatrix}, where \\\\begin{smallmatrix}L \\\\end{smallmatrix} is the luminosity, \\\\begin{smallmatrix}R \\\\end{smallmatrix} is the radius, \\\\begin{smallmatrix}T_{\\\\rm eff}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the effective surface temperature and \\\\begin{smallmatrix}\\\\sigma \\\\end{smallmatrix} is the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann constant. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 11.27. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Orbit= TW Hydrae b orbits its host star at a distance of 22 AU (somewhat less than the orbital distance of Neptune from the Sun, which is 30.1 AU). The orbital period is not known, although taken its similar orbital distance as Neptune, the orbital period may be around the same value.  Discovery =First claims= In December 2007, a team led by Johny Setiawan of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany announced discovery of a planet orbiting TW Hydrae, dubbed \\"TW Hydrae b\\" with a minimum mass around 1.2 Jupiter masses, a period of 3.56 days, and an orbital radius of 0.04 astronomical units (inside the inner rim of the protoplanetary disk). Assuming it orbited in the same plane as the outer part of the dust disk (inclination 7¬±1¬∞), it would have a true mass of 9.8¬±3.3 Jupiter masses. However, if the inclination was similar to the inner part of the dust disk (4.3¬±1.0¬∞), the mass would be 16 Jupiter masses, making it a brown dwarf. Since the star itself is so young, it was presumed this was the youngest extrasolar planet yet discovered, and essentially still in formation. (only surpassed by K2-33b and V830 Tau b, both discovered nearly 9 years later). =Disproven status= In 2008 a team of Spanish researchers concluded that the planet did not exist: the radial velocity variations were not consistent when observed at different wavelengths, which would not occur if the origin of the radial velocity variations was caused by an orbiting planet. Instead, the data was better modelled by starspots on TW Hydrae's surface passing in and out of view as the star rotates. \\"Results support the spot scenario rather than the presence of a hot Jupiter around TW Hya\\". Similar wavelength-dependent radial velocity variations, also caused by starspots, have been detected on other T Tauri stars. =New proposal= In 2016, astronomers studying the protoplanetary disk of the star began to speculate why there was small dust grains in the gaps, including the one at 22 AU, but not large dust grains. Further investigations began to suggest that there may be a 1.5 MNeptune ice giant orbiting within the gap at 22 AU, which would be responsible for the observed gaps. The study was then published in the online journal archive arXiv on September 1, 2016, gaining wide interest from media outlets.

Baltimore's Marching Ravens in November 2009. Baltimore's Marching Ravens are the official marching band of the Baltimore Ravens American football team. They were founded as the Baltimore Colts' Marching Band on September 7, 1947, and have continuously operated ever since, supporting three separate football franchises. The band first supported the original Baltimore Colts from 1947 to 1950, but continued to operate even after the franchise disbanded in 1950. After a new Baltimore Colts franchise was installed in 1953, the band became associated with the newly founded team. The band endured a second relocation when the Colts moved to Indianapolis in the middle of the night in 1984, leaving Baltimore without a team for eleven years. The band became attached to a third franchise when the Cleveland Browns relocated to Baltimore in 1996 and became the Ravens. They are one of two official marching bands in the NFL, the other being the Washington Football Team's Marching Band. Background According to an ESPN documentary directed by Baltimore native Barry Levinson called The Band That Wouldn't Die, band leaders got advance warning that the team was being moved from Baltimore to Indianapolis overnight and were able to remove their equipment from team headquarters before the moving vans arrived. At the time of the move, the band's uniforms were being dry-cleaned. Band President John Ziemann contacted the owner of the dry cleaners, who told Ziemann that legally they could not release the uniforms to Ziemann, but told him that that evening, he should take the company van \\"for a walk\\".The Band That Wouldn't Die. Directed by Barry Levinson, Severn River Productions Ziemann and some associates then hid the uniforms in a nearby cemetery, in a mausoleum belonging to the family of one of the band members, until the wife of then-Colts owner, Robert Irsay, said they could keep them. From 1984 until the Cleveland Browns relocated to Baltimore in 1996, the band stayed together, playing at football halftime shows and marching in parades, eventually becoming well known as \\"Baltimore's Pro-Football Musical Ambassadors\\".During the 1994 and 1995 seasons, they performed at the games of the Baltimore franchise of the Canadian Football League. John Ziemann biography http://www.ravensband.org/direction.html The band supported itself and remained an all-volunteer organization until the 2013 season when the Ravens organization was required to pay them. At one point, John Ziemann pawned his wife's wedding ring for the money to buy new equipment. After the 2012 season, the Flagline and Honor guard sections were dropped from the band. One of the band's first gigs after the Colts left was an invitation from then-Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell to play during the halftime show of a Browns game. \\"They were cheap,\\" Modell said, somewhat jokingly. When Baltimore was in the running for a National Football League franchise in the 1990s, Ziemann enlisted the band's help in convincing the Maryland General Assembly, the state legislature, to approve funding for a new football stadium. The band played on the steps of the Maryland State House while the legislature was in session one evening, causing a crowd to gather, including then-Governor William Donald Schaefer, who had been pushing hard for a team and a football stadium. Eventually, the legislature approved the funding. When the Cleveland Browns announced their planned move to Baltimore, the band wondered if the team had any plans for them. On an episode of a local talk show hosted by Kwesi Mfume that featured David Modell and Johnny Unitas, the host introduced Ziemann to a huge round of applause. Ziemann then asked Modell if the band could become the Ravens' official band, to which Modell smiled and said, \\"I thought you already were,\\" as the crowd roared its approval again. (In The Band That Wouldn't Die, Modell said that there was \\"no question\\" about - having always wanted a team band, the fact such a well-regarded band desperately wanted to fill that role was a \\"dream come true\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trg7HGoGE) For the Ravens' first two seasons, the band retained its name as The Baltimore Colts Marching Band. At the start of the 1998 season, it assumed its current name, The Marching Ravens, coinciding with the opening of what is now M&T; Bank Stadium in 1998, as well as the Indianapolis Colts making their first visit to Baltimore since their relocation. For Ravens' home games the band performs a short concert on Eutaw Street and then marches from Oriole Park at Camden Yards down Ravens Walk into M&T; Bank Stadium playing the Baltimore Ravens' fight song and other tunes. Before the game the band performs a pre-game field show and stays on the field for the playing of the national anthem. The band also marches a halftime show during most home games. The band also had a new fight song for the Ravens, which was drastically different from the old Colts fight song. In 2010, Ziemann announced that the band was considering using the Colts fight song with new lyrics for the Ravens. Fans were allowed to vote online.

Function  GRAF1 is a multidomain protein that is necessary for the CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway. By virtue of an N-terminal BAR domain, GRAF1 sculpts the endocytic membranes of this pathway into 40 nm diameter tubules and vesicles that allow uptake of extracellular fluid, GPI-linked proteins and certain bacterial exotoxins into cells. The role of dynamin in the CLIC/GEEC pathway is controversial, but GRAF1 interacts strongly with this protein and acute inhibition of dynamin action abrogates CLIC/GEEC endocytosis. There are several members of the GRAF family of proteins, including GRAF2, GRAF3, and oligophrenin, all of which likely playing similar roles during clathrin-independent endocytic events. Mutations of both GRAF1 and oligophrenin are strongly implicated in causing human disease (leukaemia and mental retardation, respectively). Recently, autoantibodies to ARHGAP26 have been implicated in autoimmune cerebellar ataxia.  Interactions  ARHGAP26 has been shown to interact with PKN3.

GiveWell focuses primarily on the cost-effectiveness of the organizations that it evaluates, rather than traditional metrics such as the percentage of the organization's budget that is spent on overhead.  History  In 2006 Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld, who worked at a hedge fund in Connecticut, formed an informal group with colleagues to evaluate charities based on data and performance metrics similar to those they used at the fund, and were surprised to find the data often didn't exist. The next year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld formed GiveWell as a nonprofit to provide financial analyst services to donors. They eventually decided to rate charities based on the metric of how much money it cost to save a life.Patricia Illingworth, Thomas Pogge, Leif Wenar. Giving Well: The Ethics of Philanthropy, Oxford University Press US, 2011. p. 124Peter Singer. The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty, Random House, 2009. Ch. 6, pp. 81‚Äì104 In the first year, funding to run the nonprofit was provided by a fund called the Clear Fund into which the former members of informal club, now directors of GiveWell, had put around $300,000, with about half of that going to fund the organization. In the first year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld advocated that charities should generally spend more money on overhead, so that they could pay for staff and record keeping to track how effective their efforts were; this ran counter to standard ways of evaluating charities based on the ratio of overhead to funds deployed for the charity work itself. In late 2007, GiveWell's founders promoted the organization on several internet blogs and forums using sockpuppets to ask questions about where to find good information about how to donate and then answering them, recommending GiveWell. GiveWell's board of directors investigated and found that the founders Karnofsky and Hassenfeld had acted inappropriately and as a result, it fined each of them $5000 and Karnofsky was demoted from executive director to a program director. In 2008, GiveWell received funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative. The Hewlett Foundation continued to be a major funder of GiveWell until March 2014, when the Hewlett Foundation announced that it was ending the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative based on a 2010 study it commissioned that found that only 3% of donors selected charities based on performance metrics (rather than e.g. loyalty, personal connections, or faith), and a subsequent 2012 study showing that efforts to provide better data were not changing that pattern. In 2013, GiveWell moved its offices to San Francisco where people in Silicon Valley had become strong supporters of the effective altruism philosophy. Givewell's approach is data-driven, and they recommend charities which work in the developing world.  Open Philanthropy Project  In 2011, Good Ventures, founded with $8.3 billion by husband and wife Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna, partnered with GiveWell to set up a partner organization called the Open Philanthropy Project, as a vehicle to direct the funding done by Good Ventures. In 2015, Mike Krieger and his fiancee Kaitlyn Trigger pledged $750,000 to the Open Philanthropy Project over two years, with 10% going to fund the operations of the project. Open Philanthropy project has investigated giving money to criminal justice reform and a range of other policy areas, and has funded work into mitigating risks of artificial intelligence, biosecurity, and global health. In 2017, the Open Philanthropy Project separated from GiveWell, and upon Karnofsky stepping down as Co-Executive Director of GiveWell, Elie Hassenfeld became GiveWell's sole Executive Director. https://blog.givewell.org/2017/06/12/separating-givewell-open-philanthropy- project/  See also  * American Institute of Philanthropy * Earning to give * Ethics of philanthropy * Founders Pledge * Giving What We Can * Raising for Effective Giving * Venture philanthropy  References  Further reading  *  External links  * Category:2011 establishments in the United States Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:American review websites Category:Charity review websites Category:Non-profit organizations based in California Category:Organizations established in 2011 ","title":"GiveWell"},{"id":"15031077","text":"Gmina Turawa, German Gemeinde Turawa is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Opole County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

Life  Inwood was born in about 1771. His father, Daniel Inwood, was bailiff to Lord Mansfield, at Kenwood, Highgate, then just north of London. He was steward to Charles Abbot, (speaker of the House of Commons until 1817, then created Lord Colchester) and clerk of the works to the scheme of improvements around the Palace of Westminster. He was also the architect of the new buildings, completed in 1814, for the Westminster National Free School, of which Abbot was the vice-president. Inwood waived his fee for the commission. His most notable works are the four churches built in the parish of St Pancras, all designed in collaboration with his eldest son, Henry William Inwood (1794‚Äì1843). Three were Neoclassical: St Pancras New Church (1819‚Äì22), All Saints, Camden Town (1822‚Äì24), and St Peter's, Regent Square (1822‚Äì5, demolished). The other, St Mary's Chapel, Somers Town (1824‚Äì27) is in a simplistic Gothic style. Summerson calls St Mary's \\"one of the most pitiful performances in the way of Gothic Revivalism ever perpetrated.\\" The commission to design the parish church was won in a competition, held in 1818. It was a prestigious project, often said to have been the most expensive church constructed in London since the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral. The design draws heavily on the Erechtheum and the Tower of the Winds, both in Athens, for inspiration. The extent of Inwood's contribution to it has been questioned, John Summerson believing it to be substantially by Henry William Inwood, who visited Athens in 1819 (after the initial plans for the New Church had been drawn up) and later published a book on the Erechtheum. In 1823 Inwood repaired the roof at St Anne's, Soho, and in 1825 carried out substantial alterations to Thomas Archer's church of St John in Smith Square, Westminster, intended to increase its capacity and improve lighting, in the course of which he rebuilt the galleries, created new doorways and altered the fenestration. In 1832 Inwood's designs for the new Westminster Hospital in Broad Sanctuary, made in collaboration with another son, Charles Frederick Inwood (1799‚Äì1840), were chosen from a number of invited submissions . The specifications had stipulated a Tudor-Gothic style, in sympathy with the nearby Westminster Abbey. The Lancet described the design for the 200-bed hospital as being in the \\"collegiate style\\", and praised the practicality of its arrangement, and its provision of light and ventilation. Inwood exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1813 and 1817, showing two works entitled \\"Design for a Public Building\\" one for \\"a National building\\", and in 1817, a picture of East Grinstead church. Between 1819 and 1824 he showed, jointly with Henry William Inwood, drawings for St Pancras New Church and the chapels at Regent Square and Camden Town, and in 1838 a design for an Ionic garden temple at Clandon Park, then under construction. In 1832-3 he showed drawings for Westminster Hospital jointly with Charles Inwood. His address is given with various street numbers as Southampton Place or Euston Square. He was the author of the Tables for the Purchasing of Estates, Freehold, Copyhold, or Leasehold, Annuities, &c;, a work based on the tables of Baily and Smart, first published in 1811 and frequently revised and reprinted.

Background  It is not known when Li Daoguang was born. HIs family was originally from what would become Hua Prefecture (ÊªëÂ∑û, roughly modern Anyang, Henan), but by Li Daoguang's time had moved to the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an. The family claimed to be descended from the Han Dynasty general Li Ling, who had surrendered to Xiongnu after being surrounded. According to their claims, an ancestor of theirs and descendant of Li Ling eventually became a subject of Northern Wei and, as he met the Northern Wei emperor at Bing Hall (‰∏ôÊÆø), was given the family name of Bing. Li Daoguang's great-grandfather Bing Ming (‰∏ôÊòé) served as a commandant during Sui Dynasty and was created the Duke of Longju. Li Daoguang's grandfather Bing Can (‰∏ôÁ≤≤) later became a subject of Tang Dynasty, as he was an acquaintance of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu; Emperor Gaozu created him the Duke of Ying. In order to observe naming taboo for Emperor Gaozu's father Li Bing (ÊùéÊò∫), Emperor Gaozu had the Bing family's name changed to Li. Li Daoguang's father Li Kuan (ÊùéÂØ¨) served as the minister of worship during the reign of Emperor Gaozu's grandson Emperor Gaozong, and carried the title of Duke of Longxi.  During Wu Zetian's reign  During the reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian (r. 690-705), Li Daoguang served as the prefect of Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). During successive Khitan and Eastern Tujue incursions in 696, all of the prefectures south and north of the Yellow River were panicking, but under Li's governance, Bian Prefecture was not disturbed. Later that year, he was recalled to serve as director of palace affairs (ÊÆø‰∏≠Áõ£, Dianzhong Jian), and Wu Zetian gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. He was also created the Marquess of Jincheng. In 697, he was also made the acting secretary general of the capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (Ê¥õÂ∑û, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan). In 698, he was removed from his chancellor position and again made prefect of Bian Prefecture. That was the last reference to Li Daoguang in history, and it is not known when he died,Even more unusual than his omission in the biography section of the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, the only reference to him in the Zizhi Tongjian was his commission as chancellor in 696; his movements in 697 and 698 were from the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang. See New Book of Tang, vol. 61 . although it is known that he was given posthumous honors. His son Li Yuanhong later served as a chancellor during the reign of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong.

Yeast sirtuin proteins are known to regulate epigenetic gene silencing and suppress recombination of rDNA. In addition to protein deacetylation, studies have shown that the human sirtuins may also function as intracellular regulatory proteins with mono ADP ribosyltransferase activity.  Structure  SIRT3 is a soluble protein located in the mitochondrial matrix, and contains a mitochondrial processing peptide at the N-terminus. A set of crystal structures of human SIRT3 have been solved, including an apo- structure with no substrate, a structure with a peptide containing acetyl lysine of its natural substrate acetyl-CoA synthetase 2, a reaction intermediate structure trapped by a thioacetyl peptide and a structure with the dethioacetylated peptide bond., , , ; These structures show the conformational changes induced by the two substrates required for the reaction, the acetylated substrate peptide and NAD+. In addition, a binding study by isothermal titration calorimetry suggests that the acetylated peptide is the first substrate to bind to SIRT3, prior to NAD+.  Function = Mitochondrial = Three sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5, are located in mitochondria and have been implicated in regulating metabolic processes. Endogenous SIRT3 is a soluble protein located in the mitochondrial matrix. Overexpression of SIRT3 in cultured cells increases respiration and decreases the production of reactive oxygen species. Fasting increases SIRT3 expression in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT, respectively) and overexpression of SIRT3 in HIB1B brown adipocytes increases the expression of PGC-1Œ± and UCP1, suggesting a role for SIRT3 in adaptive thermogenesis BAT. BAT is different from WAT because it harbors large numbers of mitochondria and is important for thermogenesis in rodents. Thermogenesis in BAT is mediated by the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which induces proton leakage and thereby generates heat instead of ATP. Mechanistic insights into how SIRT3 affects thermogenesis in BAT is lacking and whether SIRT3 affects UCP1 activity directly is not known. In addition to controlling metabolism at the transcriptional level, sirtuins also directly control the activity of metabolic enzymes. In Salmonella enterica, the bacterial sirtuin CobB regulates the activity of the enzyme acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthetase. As mentioned above, orthologs of acetyl-CoA synthetase exist in the cytoplasm (AceCS1) and in mitochondria (AceCS2) in mammals. The presence of the sirtuin deacetylase SIRT3 in the mitochondrial matrix suggests the existence of lysine acetylated mitochondrial proteins. Indeed, SIRT3 deacetylates and activates the mammalian mitochondrial acetyl-coA synthetase (AceCS2). Furthermore, SIRT3 and AceCS2 are found complexed with one another, suggesting a critical role for control of AceCS2 activity by SIRT3. = Nuclear = In addition to its reported mitochondrial function, some researchers have proposed a very small pool of active nuclear SIRT3 exists. This pool is reported to consist of the long form of SIRT3 and has been suggested to have histone deacetylase activity. The observation that SIRT3 has nuclear activity came from a report that SIRT3 protected cardiomyocytes from stress mediated cell death and that this effect was due to deacetylation of a nuclear factor, Ku-70.  Clinical significance  There is a strong association between SIRT3 alleles and longevity in males. = Aging and carcinogenesis = There is also a significant body of published literature suggesting a strong mechanistic link between mitochondrial function, aging, and carcinogenesis. Sirt3 functions as a mitochondrial tumor suppressor protein. Although some evidence attributes SIRT3 activity in bypassing growth arrest in bladder carcinoma cells via regulation of p53 in the mitochondria. Damaged and aberrant mitochondrial function, similar to gene mutations, may be an early event that ultimately leads to the development of cancers. Mice genetically altered to delete Sirt3 develop estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive breast mammary tumors. In tumor samples from women with breast cancer, SIRT3 expression was decreased, as compared to normal breast tissues. Thus, the Sirt3 knockout model may be used to investigate ER/PR positive breast tumor development.

Biography Juan Soldevilla y Romero was born in Fuentelape√±a, and studied at the seminaries in Valladolid and Toledo before being ordained to the priesthood on December 28, 1867. He obtained his doctorate in theology from the Central Seminary of Santiago de Compostela in 1868, and then studied canon law at the seminary in Tuy. Soldevilla served as a curate in three parishes in the Archdiocese of Valladolid, and became secretary to the Archbishop, Ces√°reo Rodrigo y Rodr√≠guez, (1875), a cathedral canon (1883), and an archpriest (1887). Along with sitting on the Provincial Junta of Beneficence and on the Diocesan Junta for the Reconstruction of Churches, he was the Royal Preacher and a Knight of the Royal American Order of Isabel la Cat√≥lica, a secretary capitular, and synodal examiner. In 1885, he was a member of the Junta for the assistance of victims of a cholera epidemic. On February 14, 1889, Soldevilla was appointed Bishop of Tarazona by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 28 from Archbishop Benito Sanz y For√©s, with Bishops Mariano Alguacil y Fern√°ndez and Ces√°reo Rodrigo y Rodr√≠guez. Soldevilla was Apostolic Administrator of Tudela from 1889 to 1901, and was promoted to Archbishop of Zaragoza on December 16, 1901. Pope Benedict XV created him Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria del Popolo in the consistory of December 15, 1919. He received his cardinal's biretta from King Alphonse XIII on Christmas Day of that same year. Soldevilla was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1922 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XI. At age 79, Cardinal Soldevilla was assassinated by the anarchist group Los Solidarios in Zaragoza. The apparent motive for the killing was the fact that the Cardinal had been implicated by the anarchists in the hiring and protection of pistoleros who had carried out a campaign of white terror against Spanish union members. He is buried at the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar.

It was used as a burial ground for members of the Seventh Day Baptist Church. The cemetery has mistakenly been referred to as \\"Burlington Center Cemetery\\" but is known to locals as Green Lady Cemetery, due to a ghost that is purported to haunt the grounds. History The Seventh Day Baptists (or Sabbatarians) were a religious group that originated in Rhode Island. Many of them were descendants of the Roger Williams colony. In the late 18th century, approximately 20 families migrated from Rhode Island to West Britain, Connecticut (present-day Burlington) and established the Seventh Day Baptist Church on September 18, 1780. At the meeting of the Seventh Day Baptist Society on October 12, 1796, a deed was presented by Jared Covey (the benefactor of the church) to the other members detailing a \\"parcel of land laying at the south east corner of the ninth lot in the fourth division in Bristol containing about half an acre for the purpose of a public burying ground\\". The site had already been used as a burial ground, beginning in 1780 with the burial of John Davis, but it was in 1796 when it was officially declared as Seventh Day Baptist Cemetery. During the years between 1810 and 1820, a number of accidental deaths plagued the Seventh Day Baptists. One member fell off a ladder and died while repairing his house, while another died when a recently dug well collapsed on him. Another was hanged while repairing a lamp in her home, and yet another was killed when a tree fell on him in the woods. While these bizarre deaths may have been legitimate accidents, some people believe it is possible the early Burlington residents may have had a secret agenda toward forcing the Sabbatarians from the area, eventually managing to confiscate their lands and properties. By 1820, the last of the Seventh Day Baptists departed Burlington, and migrated to Brookfield, New York in Madison County, never to return to the area. The last person to be interred in the cemetery was Charlotte Spencer on October 14, 1881. Legend of The Green Lady  The cemetery is known by locals by the name of Green Lady Cemetery, due to purported sightings of a green spectral figure known as the Green Lady. Many believe the lady in the mist to be the ghost of a Seventh Day Baptist named Elisabeth Palmiter. According to local legend, in April 1800, Elisabeth's husband Benjamin went into town to get some supplies. He suddenly found himself engulfed in a bad snow storm. Benjamin decided to stay in town, and wait for the weather to subside. According to the story, when he didn't return right away, Elisabeth went out to search for him. After getting lost in the fury of the storm, she drowned in one of the nearby swamps. What happened next has some variation. In one version of the story, Benjamin returned home to find his wife missing. Frantic, he looked for her, and after an exhaustive search, he found her frozen body in a swamp, and she was wearing a pretty green dress. In other versions of the story, Benjamin was either unwilling to save Elisabeth, or murdered her himself, and threw her body into the swamp. Since this is a local legend, no one is absolutely certain what actually occurred. Regardless, many people walking near the cemetery at night have claimed to have seen a female apparition surrounded in a green mist. According to most accounts, she merely appears without provocation or pattern, smiles and then dissipates. Some people have also claimed to see mysterious lights, looking like a flashlight or lantern carried by an unseen person. Some believe it could be the ghost of Benjamin Palmiter, perpetually searching for Elisabeth in the swamp. During the early 1990s there were reports of satanic rituals being performed in the woods directly across the street from the cemetery. In 1996, two CCSU students stumbled across a giant stone altar in the woods, that was approximately 4' tall and solid stone and approximately 2 1/2' X 4' across the top. In front of the altar were four rows of round decaying wooden benches, that were rounded and built into the hill, facing the altar. One of the students was injured tripping over the top bench as they went down the hill. After visiting the stone altar, the students reported hearing a cacophony of voices telling them to \\"GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!\\" They ran out of the woods and fled from the cemetery, vowing never to return. A paranormal researcher reported being tapped on the shoulder in December 2015 while searching for the altar in the woods, and also reported hearing shrieking noises. In 2016, tourists reported that they heard a loud hum coming from the woods. Present Green Lady Cemetery 2016 Today, there are no full standing headstones, due to vandalism that took place in the 1970s and again in 2010, and also as a result of weathering. The only standing headstone was that of Elisabeth Palmiter, and that stone remained in the cemetery until 2010. Sometime between 7:30am on July 20 and 11am on July 21, some individuals stole the 200-pound headstone of Elisabeth Palmiter. This was a roughly 200 pound grave marker that was re-dedicated to the site in the 1970s, following the removal of all vandalized pieces of the original stones. The cemetery is now private property (owned by the New Britain Public Works) and the Burlington police and local residents usually patrol the area at night to guard against further vandalism. Visiting the site during the day for the purpose of historical research is permitted. References * Joseph A. Citro. Weird New England. Sterling Publishing Co., 2005 * Cheri Revai.

Structure  The human ETHE1 gene consists of 7 exons and encodes for a protein that is approximately 27 kDa in size.  Function  This gene encodes a protein that is expressed in the thyroid. The ETHE1 protein is thought to localize primarily to the mitochondrial matrix and functions as a sulfur dioxygenase. Sulfur deoxygenates are proteins that function in sulfur metabolism. The ETHE1 protein is thought to catalyze the following reaction: : sulfur + O2 \\\\+ H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons sulfite + 2 H+ (overall reaction) : (1a) glutathione + sulfur \\\\rightleftharpoons S-sulfanylglutathione (glutathione persulfide, spontaneous reaction) : (1b) S-sulfanylglutathione + O2 \\\\+ H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons glutathione + sulfite + 2 H+ and requires iron and possibly glutathione as cofactors. The physiological substrate of ETHE1 is thought to be glutathione persulfide, an intermediate metabolite involved in hydrogen sulfide degradation.  Clinical significance  Mutations in ETHE1 gene are thought to cause ethylmalonic encephalopathy, a rare inborn error of metabolism. Patients carrying ETHE1 mutations have been found to exhibit lower activity of ETHE1 and affinity for the ETHE1 substrate. Mouse models of Ethe1 genetic ablation likewise exhibited reduced sulfide dioxygenase catabolism and cranial features of ethylmalonic encephalopathy. Decrease in sulfide dioxygenase activity results in abnormal catabolism of hydrogen sulfide, an gas-phase signaling molecule in the central nervous system, whose accumulation is thought to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase activity in the respiratory chain of the mitochondrion. However, other metabolic pathways may also be involved that could exert a modulatory effect on hydrogen sulfide toxicity.  Interactions  ETHE1 has been shown to interact with RELA.

The composition effort could have been coordinated by colonial officials in the last days of British colonialism in Tanganyika. It was changed to Tanzania, Tanzania after the formation of the Tanzanian union in 1964. In Tanzania it is frequently sung alongside the national anthem \\"Mungu Ibariki Afrika\\".

He was the joint architect, with his father William Inwood of St Pancras New Church. Biography All Saints' Camden Town, from the north-west He was the son of the architect William Inwood, with whom he collaborated on a number of churches, including St Pancras New Church (1819‚Äì22), the commission for which was won in an open competition. John Summerson believed that he was the main designer of St Pancras ‚Äì which he describes as a \\"skilful and mature work\\" ‚Äì his father not having previously designed any architecturally ambitious buildings. The design drew closely on Ancient Greek models, imitating elements from the Erechtheum and the Tower of the Winds in Athens. Inwood had not been to Greece at the time the initial design was submitted in May 1818, but travelled there soon afterward, making careful observations of the buildings on which St Pancras was based. He later published the results of his studies as The Erechtheion at Athens: Fragments of Athenian Architecture and a few remains in Attica, Megara, and Epirus (1827). The Inwoods collaborated on two other Greek Revival churches in the parish of St Pancras: All Saints, Camden Town (1822‚Äì4), and St Peter's, Regent Square (1822‚Äì5, now demolished). They were also joint architects of St Mary's Chapel, Somers Town in the same parish, built in 1824‚Äì7 in a naive \\"Carpenter's Gothic\\" style. Inwood collaborated with E.N. Clifton on two churches: the Gothic St. Stephen, Canonbury (1837-9), and the Neoclassical St James Islington (1837-8) In 1834 he published a pamphlet entitled Of the Resources of Design in the Architecture of Greece, Egypt, and other Countries, obtained by the Studies of the Architects of those Countries from Nature, which suggested that the flutings of Doric columns were taken from reeds, mineral formations or seashells; that Egyptian mummies were wrapped in imitation of the cocoons of moths, and that the image of the sphinx was inspired by a butterfly chrysalis. Inwood died in a shipwreck on a journey to Spain when the ship he was in sank with no survivors.

Design and development Originally conceived as the Curtiss-Robertson CR-2 Coupe shortly before the Curtiss-Wright merger and the dropping of the Curtiss-Robertson brand, it was an all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional configuration with fixed tailwheel undercarriage and side-by-side seating for two. A prominent feature on all versions other than the original CR-2 prototypes was the large \\"trouser\\"-style wheel spats. While the design was never perfected for the civil market it was originally intended for, a militarized version was soon developed that replaced the side-by-side cabin with tandem seating and added provision for guns and bombs. Operational history Curtiss-Wright hoped that in this form it could be sold on the export market as a ground-attack machine. But orders were disappointing, with only 20 purchased by the Chinese Air Force and three by the Cuban Air Force. An unarmed trainer version was also developed and offered to the USAAC but no orders were placed. In a final attempt to find a market for the design, engine power was increased from to , and a retractable undercarriage was fitted. In this form, designated CW-23, the aircraft was offered once again to the USAAC, this time as an advanced trainer, but once again the service was not interested. The CW-19 did, however, form the basis of the far more successful CW-21 and CW-22 designs.

The company specializes in the design and manufacture of fiberglass sailboats. The company was founded by in 1969 by Michael Polard, as the Essex Boat Company. In 2009 it became a brand of Lauren Marine of Southampton under the name British Hunter. History The first design produced by the new company was the Squib, an open keelboat designed by Oliver Lee in 1967. Lee also designed a cabin version of the Squib in 1972, the Hunter 19, later called the Europa. Lee was the principle naval architect for the company in this period, designing the Hunter 490 and the Hunter 701. In the early 1970s the company relocated to Rochford and a custom-built plant in that town. At that time it was renamed Hunter Boats Limited and by 1975 David Thomas became the main designer. He drew the Hunter Sonata and the Impala 28. In the mid-1970s the company produced many racing sailboats, including the designs of Steven Jones, including the Formula 28. His HB 31 was the first production boat to use kevlar laminates in its hull construction. By the 1980s the company started building boats with twin keels and moved away from racing boats to cruising boat designs. The Hunter Horizon 26 was the first of this new range of cruising sailboats and it won the Best Production Boat of the Year award when it was introduced in 1984. The Hunter Horizon 32 also won Best Production Cruiser of the Year in 1987 as the company continued to specialize in cruising sailboats. In 1995 the company introduced the Thomas-designed Hunter 707 and the following year it was named Yacht of the Year. Hunter Boats was bought out in 2003 by the Select Yachts Group and added to its portfolio of marine companies that included Cornish Crabbers, Red Fox Yachts, the Landau Launch Company and Cornish Diva. In 2009 Lauren Marine of Southampton purchased the rights, molds and tooling for the Hunter range of boats and built them under the brand of British Hunter, to distinguish it from the American boat building company, Hunter Marine. In 2018 the company was producing five designs, the Hunter 20 Sport, Hunter 20 Mini C, Hunter Channel 245, Hunter Channel 27 and the Hunter Channel 31.

The gene is located on chromosome 17 at position 13.1 where it forms a cluster with two other lipoxygenases, ALOXE3 and ALOX15B. Among the human lipoxygenases, ALOX12B is most closely (54% identity) related in amino acid sequence to ALOXE3 Activity ALOX12B oxygenates arachidonic acid by adding molecular oxygen (O2) in the form of a hydroperoxyl (HO2) residue to its 12th carbon thereby forming 12(R)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-icosatetraenoic acid (also termed 12(R)-HpETE or 12R-HpETE). When formed in cells, 12R-HpETE may be quickly reduced to its hydroxyl analog (OH), 12(R)-hydroxy-5'Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (also termed 12(R)-HETE or 12R-HETE), by ubiquitous peroxidase-type enzymes. These sequential metabolic reactions are: arachidonic acid + O2 \\\\rightleftharpoons 12R-HpETE ‚Üí 12R-HETE 12R-HETE stimulates animal and human neutrophil chemotaxis and other responses in vitro and is able to elicit inflammatory responses when injected into the skin of an animal model However, the production of 12R-HETE for this or other purposes may not be primary function of ALOX12B. ALOX12B is also capable of metabolizing free linoleic acid to 9(R)-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9R-HpODE) which is also rapidly converted to its hydroxyl derivative, 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9R-HODE). Linoleic acid + O2 \\\\rightleftharpoons 9R-HpODE ‚Üí 9R-HODE The S stereoisomer of 9R-HODE, 9S-HODE, has a range of biological activities related to oxidative stress and pain perception (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid. It is known or likely that 9R-HODE possesses at least some of these activities. For example, 9R-HODE, similar to 9S-HODE, mediates the perception of acute and chronic pain induced by heat, UV light, and inflammation in the skin of rodents (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid#9-HODEs as mediators of pain perception). However, production of these LA metabolites does not appear to be the primary function of ALOX12B; ALOX12B's primary function appears to be to metabolize linoleic acid that is not free but rather esterified to certain =Proposed principal activity of ALOX12B= ALOX12B targets Linoleic acid (LA). LA is the most abundant fatty acid in the skin epidermis, being present mainly esterified to the omega-hydroxyl residue of amide-linked omega- hydroxylated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in a unique class of ceramides termed esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine (EOS). EOS is an intermediate component in a proposed multi-step metabolic pathway which delivers VLCFAs to the cornified lipid envelop in the skin's Stratum corneum; the presence of these wax-like, hydrophobic VLCFAs is needed to maintain the skin's integrity and functionality as a water barrier (see Lung microbiome#Role of the epithelial barrier). ALOX12B metabolizes the LA in EOS to its 9-hydroperoxy derivative; ALOXE3 then converts this derivative to three products: a) 9R,10R-trans-epoxide,13R-hydroxy-10E-octadecenoic acid, b) 9-keto-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, and c) 9R,10R-trans- epoxy-13-keto-11E-octadecenoic acid. These ALOX12B-oxidized products signal for the hydrolysis (i.e. removal) of the oxidized products from EOS; this allows the multi-step metabolic pathway to proceed in delivering the VLCFAs to the cornified lipid envelop in the skin's Stratum corneum. Tissue distribution ALOX12B protein has been detected in humans that in the same tissues the express ALOXE3 and ALOX15B viz., upper layers of the human skin and tongue and in tonsils. mRNA for it has been detected in additional tissues such as the lung, testis, adrenal gland, ovary, prostate, and skin with lower abundance levels detected in salivary and thyroid glands, pancreas, brain, and plasma blood leukocytes. Clinical significance=Congenital ichthyosiform erythrodema= Deletions of Alox12b or AloxE2 genes in mice cause a congenital scaly skin disease which is characterized by a greatly reduced skin water barrier function and is similar in other ways to the autosomal recessive nonbullous Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (ARCI) disease of humans. Mutations in many of the genes that encode proteins, including ALOX12B and ALOXE3, which conduct the steps that bring and then bind VLCFA to the stratums corneum are associated with ARCI. ARCI refers to nonsyndromic (i.e. not associated with other signs or symptoms) congenital Ichthyosis including Harlequin-type ichthyosis, Lamellar ichthyosis, and Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. ARCI has an incidence of about 1/200,000 in European and North American populations; 40 different mutations in ALOX12B and 13 different mutations in ALOXE3 genes account for a total of about 10% of ARCI case; these mutations uniformly cause a total loss of ALOX12B or ALOXE3 function (see mutations). =Proliferative skin diseases= In psoriasis and other proliferative skin diseases such as the Erythrodermas underlying lung cancer, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and drug reactions, and in Discoid lupus, Seborrheic dermatitis, Subacute Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and Pemphigus foliaceus, cutaneous levels of ALOX12B mRNA and 12R-HETE are greatly increased. It is not clear if these increases contribute to the disease by, for example, 12R-HETE induction of inflammation, or are primarily a consequence of skin proliferation. =Embryogenesis= The expression of Alox12b and Aloxe3 mRNA in mice parallels, and is proposed to be instrumental for, skin development in mice embryogenesis; the human orthologs of these genes, i.e. ALOX12B and ALOXE3, may have a similar role in humans. =Essential fatty acid deficiency= Severe dietary deficiency of polyunsaturated omega 6 fatty acids leads to the essential fatty acid deficiency syndrome that is characterized by scaly skin and excessive water loss; in humans and animal models the syndrome is fully reversed by dietary omega 6 fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid. It is proposed that this deficiency disease resembles and has a similar basis to Congenital ichthyosiform erythrodema; that is, it is at least in part due to a deficiency of linoleic acid and thereby in the EOS-based delivery of VLCFA to the stratum corneum.

Notice that Œ±2 receptor type refers to the GABRA2, an anxiolyte. GABAA receptor animation demonstrates the various subunit types that make up the GABA receptor. All the variants of GABA (A) receptors have different functions within the mammalian brain. Gamma- aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2 is a protein in humans that is encoded by the GABRA2 gene. GABRA2 is an alpha subunit that is part of GABA-A receptors, which are ligand-gated chloride channels and are activated by the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, GABA. Chloride conductance of these channels can be modulated by agents, such as benzodiazepines (psychoactive drugs) that bind to the GABA-A receptor. GABA-A receptors are composed of two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunits. They have at least 16 distinct subunits identified, including GABRA2. This receptor is found mainly in specific regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus. Subunit isoforms are seen around in various locations in the brain throughout growth. The combination of subunits has a large effect on the pharmacological and biophysical characteristics. GABRA2 has been found to mediate anxiolytic activity, which plays a key role in emotional and behavioral control. Most of GABRA2 modifications have been found to be linked to alcoholism and adolescent behavior.  Structure  Shows the five subunits that comprise the GABA-A receptor. GABRA2 is only one alpha subunit in the structure demonstrated with the color red.GABRA2 is one of the 16 distinct alpha subunits found for the GABA receptor. GABA-A has a pentametric form, with two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit. The various subunit isoforms seen in the GABA-A receptor structure has an effect on its function. GABRA2 is most often seen as part of the most common expression Œ±2Œ≤3Œ≥2, which is seen in 13% of all GABA-A receptors. The subunit, GABRA2, is found primarily in hippocampus and/or the forebrain. It is more confined to areas of the brain in comparison to other alpha subunits seen in GABA-A receptors. It is present in 35% of all GABA-A receptors being the fourth most abundant subunit next to GABRA1 and various beta subunits. Like all subunits, it is made from structurally distinct proteins. The presence of this subunit causes an easier binding of benzodiazepine which is a category of psychoactive drugs.  Function  GABRA2 mediates neural activity necessary for information processing in inter- neurons. GABRA2 participates in transporting Cl‚àí ions into the membrane, since it forms part of the GABA-A receptor. The influx of Cl‚àí causes the hyper- polarization of the membrane, leading to inhibitory actions. GABRA2 increases the risk of anxiety making it a target for treating behavioral disorders. Some examples of behavioral disorders include anxiety, alcohol dependence, and drug use. GABRA2 is a binding site for benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are psychoactive drugs known to reduce anxiety. Benzodiazepines bind to GABRA2 causing chloride channels to open, leading to the hyper-polarization of the membrane. Other anxiolytic drugs like Diazepam target this alpha subunit in GABA-A to induce inhibitory effects. GABRA2 is associated with reward behavior when it activates the insula. The insula is part of the cerebral cortex responsible for emotions. GABRA2 role in reward behavior explains the higher risk of alcohol dependence and drug use behavior.  Clinical Significance  Since GABRA 2 mediates anxiolytic activity, it is a key receptor for emotional control. Several developmental stages of GABRA2 have shown effects on behavior such as adult alcohol dependence and adolescent behavior. = Alcoholism = 204x204px Since GABRA 2 subunit mediates anxiolytic activity, long term use or withdrawal of ethanol can cause dependence alterations in the GABA-A receptor. When alcohol is present in the brain, it affects two types of receptors: GABA-A, inhibitory receptors, and Glutamate, excitatory receptors. In GABA receptors, alcohol substrates binds allosterically, which allows the GABA receptors to increase their inhibitory activity. Besides giving GABA receptors an extra inhibitory punch, alcohol substrates bind to glutamate receptors, which blocks its excitatory activity. Alcohol effects on both of these metabolic pathways obstructs the brain from making memories, making well thought out decisions, and controlling impulses after a long term use. Collaborative Study on Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) identified alcohol dependence on chromosome 4p, where SNP genotyping, measurement of genetic variation, found GABRA2's association with alcoholism within European and African ancestries. Most of these findings were strongly associated with early alcohol use and along with drug dependence. Besides these findings, COGA investigators identified GABRA2 associated with impulsiveness and found other phenotypes affected by alcohol such as EEG-Œ≤. = Adolescent behavior = The International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society reviewed studies that found linkage between Œ≤1-subunits in GABA-A receptors and excitability in the reward sensitivity behavior brain region. Linkage between these two suggest that inadequate GABRA2 variants can cause the development of mental disorders, such as addiction. The addictive behaviors can be seen as aggressive and defiant, but most of these behaviors can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. GABRA2 genes have been linked to various behavioral traits, such as an absence of impulse control. At least 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, within the GARBRA2 gene have been correlated to impulsivity and four of which were also found in alcoholism. There was an elevated neuronal activation in the insula and the Nucleus accumbens. In animals, such as rats, a relationship was found between elevated alcohol consumption and increased impulsivity to those exposed to stress at an early stage in life. This impulsivity can be reversed with pharmacological handling of GABA-A receptors containing GABRA2 in certain neurological areas.

Its seat is the village of Jemielnica (Himmelwitz), which lies approximately north-east of Strzelce Opolskie and south-east of the regional capital Opole. The gmina covers an area of , and as of 2019 its total population is 7,219. Since 2006 the commune, like most of the area, has been officially bilingual in German and Polish, a substantial German population remaining in the area after it was transferred to Poland after World War II. A famous tourist sight in the area is Himmelwitz Abbey, where the German Baroque composer Johannes Nucius died in 1620. History Church of the Assumption The village was first mentioned as Gemelnici in a document dated 29 November 1225 from the Duchy of Opole that granted the settlement German town law. In 1280 Duke Bolko I of Opole founded the Cisterian Himmelwitz Abbey with the assistance of the monastic community of Rauden. In the year 1285 the All Saint's Church was built, which served as the parish church until 1810. After the death of Duke Bolko I, the town passed to his youngest son Albert, the duke of Strehlitz. Like his brothers this came under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1327, becoming part of the kingdom after the signing of the Treaty of Trentschin in 1335 by the Polish King. With the death of Duke Albert, before 1375 withouts sons, the direct line of the Duchy of Strehlitz came to an end, and Himmelwitz passed to duke Bolko III. After the childless death of Duke John II in 1532, the duchy passed to the Bohemian crown and was later absorbed by the Habsburg Empire. After the First Silesian War in 1742 Himmelwitz was ceded along with most of Silesia to Prussia. In 1750 a monastic grammar school was opened, providing local children with access to higher education. In 1810 the Prussian government secularized the monastery and dissolved its holdings. The All Saints Church, formerly the parish church, was made into the cemetery church and the former abbey's Church of the Assumption took its place as parish church. In 1818 Himmelwitz was incorporated as part of the newly formed Landkreis (county) of Gro√ü Strehlitz, where it remained until 1945. In 1826 the former abbey's holdings were sold to Count Andreas Maria Renard. After World War II Silesia was annexed by Poland as decided at the Yalta Conference. Already by January 1945 it was occupied by the Red Army, and by April 21 the new Polish administration had tentatively renamed the town Imielnica. Subsequently, the commune was incorporated into the new Silesian Voivodship and renamed Jemielnica on 30 March 1947. In 1950 it was transferred to Opole Voivodship. On 28 August 2006 German was declared an official language of the commune, and on November 14, 2008 the old German place-names were reintroduced, with bilingual signage set up. Villages The commune contains the villages and settlements of Jemielnica, Barut, Bokowe, Centawa, GƒÖsiorowice, ≈Åaziska, Piotr√≥wka and Wierchlesie. Demographics At the time of the census of 2002, the commune had 7,702 inhabitants. Of these, 4,091 (53.1%) declared the Polish nationality; 1,871 persons (24.3%) declared the German nationality; and 627 (8.1%) with the non-recognized Silesian nationality. 1,096 inhabitants (14.2%) declared no nationality.

Its developmental version was called LeanCP. Many important problems in material science, chemistry, solid- state physics, and biophysics require a modeling approach based on fundamental quantum mechanical principles. A particular approach that has proved to be relatively efficient and useful is Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics (CPAIMD). It is widely used to study systems consisting of hundreds to thousands of atoms. CPAIMD computations involve many interdependent phases with high communication overhead including multiple concurrent sparse 3D Fast Fourier Transforms (3D-FFTs), non-square matrix multiplies and few concurrent dense 3D-FFTs. Parallelization of this approach beyond a few hundred processors is challenging, due to the complex dependencies among various subcomputations, which lead to complex communication optimization and load balancing problems. Using Charm++ and its concept of processor virtualization, the phases are discretized into multiple virtual processors which are, in turn, mapped flexibly onto physical processors, thereby allowing significant interleaving of work. Interleaving is enhanced through both architecturally independent methods and network topology aware mapping techniques. OpenAtom has shown good scaling up to 262,144 cores of IBM Blue Gene/Q and 131,072 cores of Blue Waters, a Cray XE6/XK7 system at NCSA.

Galloway defeated Democratic incumbent Carl Parker and became the first Republican to hold the seat since Reconstruction. Biography Galloway is a fifth generation Texan who was born in 1965 and grew up on a small farm near Tomball. By age 16, he was working as a roustabout and a roughneck in the oil fields of Southeast Texas. While still in high school, he began work as an independent oil and gas contractor, and in 1989, at the age of 24, he founded Galloway Energy, an oil and gas production company based in Montgomery County, Texas. In 1992, at the age of 27, Galloway decided to run against the 30-year incumbent Democrat, Senator Carl Parker. Unsuccessful in his first race, he managed a victory against Parker in 1994. As State Senator, Galloway served as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Intergovernmental Relations and as a member of the Senate Committees on Health & Human Services, Education, and State Affairs, as well as the Special Committee on Auto Emissions and the Special Interim Committee on Annexation. In 1997, Galloway supported SB 1748, requiring voter identification at polling places. Galloway currently resides in Magnolia, Texas with his wife, Angela, and his two children. Election of 2014 Galloway ran for the District 4 seat, a seat he previously held in the 1990s, in the Texas Senate, vacated in the fall of 2013 by the resignation of Republican Tommy Williams of The Woodlands, who accepted a position with Texas A&M; University in College Station. Galloway faced an intraparty battle for the Senate vacancy from the District 15 Representative Steve Toth of The Woodlands, the District 16 Representative Brandon Creighton of Conroe, and Gordy Bunch, who serves on The Woodlands township council.

During these decades, closer settlement legislation and the arrival of the Great Southern Railway sparked a dramatic intensification of agricultural development in the Wagga district.Sherry Morris, Wagga Wagga: A History, Council of the City of Wagga Wagga, Wagga Wagga, 1999, p. 50. Town growth and the arrival of farming families displaced Wiradjuri survivors of violence and disease from station camps and waterways.Gilmore, Old Days: Old Ways, p. 152Gilmore, Old Days: Old Ways, pp. 118-120. Through her father Donald Cameron, who held the Wiradjuri people in great regard, and from her own experiences, Mary learned much about the ways that Wiradjuri thought and lived. She later recorded her childhood memories of the Wagga district. Gilmore's memories are worth exploring at length, as they offer a rare and valuable insight into early Wagga history.  The meaning of 'Wagga Wagga'  Mary Gilmore suggested that the name 'Wagga Wagga', given to the area by Wiradjuri people, was associated with the methods used by Wiradjuri to maintain the ecological well-being and natural abundance of the land. Crows abounded in the area, she explained, because of the many bird eggs and chicks on which the crows could feast: Wagga Wagga means the meeting-place of the crows. The locality was the breeding-ground of birds of all kinds. Food abounded on land and in the water, consequently eggs were plentiful (young birds too), and the crows fared well. So did the eagles, some of which were of great size.Jennifer Strauss, Collected verse of Mary Gilmore,, University of Queensland Press, 2007, p. 642. The abundance of eggs and chicks was probably the result of strategies developed by Wiradjuri to tend the land. Like other Aboriginal groups across Australia, Wiradjuri clans reserved places where no hunting, fishing, gathering, or burning was allowed. The sites held special religious and social significance.Deborah Rose, Diana James and Christine Watson, Indigenous Kinship with the Natural World in New South Wales, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Hurstville, 2003. Animals and plants flourished inside the sacred refuges, spreading beyond sanctuary boundaries to replenish populations legally available for hunting and gathering.  Ecological abundance  Parkan Pregan lagoon in North Wagga Mary Gilmore told how Wiradjuri applied sanctuary laws to protect and nurture animals and plants: All billabongs, rivers, and marshes were treated as food reserves and supply depots by the natives. The bird whose name was given to a place bred there unmolested. The same with plants and animals. Thus storage never failed.Mary Gilmore, Old Days: Old Ways, A Book of Recollections, Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1963 [1934], p. 145. According to Gilmore, Wiradjuri reserved Parkan Pregan lagoon on the Murrumbidgee River floodplain at North Wagga for pelicans, swans, and cranes. Pregan Island, a grassy space between the lagoon and the river, was reserved for the 'guriban', or bush-stone Curlew. Sanctuary regulations fostered vast populations of various species. Often as a child, Gilmore heard thunder in a cloudless sky. She remembered running terrified to her mother: And she would tell me it was swans in the distance beating their wings as they readied for flight. Later on I learned to recognise the sound, and to listen to it unafraid.Mary Gilmore, The Passionate Heart and other poems, Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1979, p. 307. Graziers thought immense flocks of swans nesting at Wiradjuri sanctuaries a nuisance. Reeds polluted by the birds repelled cattle from drinking places. As livestock ate feathers trapped in grass, feather-balls gathered inside their stomachs, eventually killing them. Concentrated populations of swans, Gilmore noted, enriched the soil and naturally boosted its productivity. Squatters didn‚Äôt recognise or value the ecological offerings of the swans, and rejected Wiradjuri sanctuary regulations in brutal style. Mary Gilmore wrote of ‚Äòthe swan-hoppers‚Äô: Their work was to hop the swans off the nests in the breeding- season, and smash the eggs. It was filthy work; they reeked of the half- hatched and the addled, and their trousers grew stiffer and stiffer, and filthier and filthier, as the yolks and the whites of the smashed eggs set in the material of which they were made. The old cattle town of Wagga Wagga once had its swan-hoppers on all the stations round about; and the more they stank the prouder they were.Gilmore, Old Days: Old Ways, p. 168.  Destruction of the sanctuaries In the final decades of the nineteenth century, as farmland spread and settlement intensified, Wiradjuri could no longer enforce sanctuary law or maintain established ways of engaging with country. The natural productivity and bounty of land and river systems declined. Even though fewer people now lived beside the Murrumbidgee River, fish and freshwater lobsters became scarce, Mary Gilmore told: I do not remember in just what year it was, but the chief of the tribe at Wagga Wagga in talking to my father, said that, white settlement increasing along the river, it was not only fished in by the settlers, but fished in season and out, so that the breeding-stocks were diminishing as well as the grown fish which the blacks‚Äô laws allowed them to take for sustenance.Gilmore, Old Days: Old Ways, p. 140. When Mary Gilmore first knew Parkan Pregan lagoon beside the Murrumbidgee at North Wagga, it was simply covered with pelicans, teal, duck, cranes, and swans; but being specially a pelican sanctuary, these birds predominated. When I first went to the Wagga Wagga school, as we trudged in from Brucedale Road, where I remembered clouds of them there were seventy only, then forty, then twenty, then four, and then there were no pelicans at all. The swans went till there were but two; the ducks came only at night‚Äîthe few that survived.Gilmore, Old Days: Old Ways, p. 119. Wiradjuri complained with bitterness to Donald Cameron, Mary Gilmore's father, about the destruction of native animal populations by settlers. Cameron listened and acted. He argued for the maintenance of Wiradjuri sanctuaries on Deepwater and Ganmain stations, to the west of Wagga, ‚Äòto be held as such in perpetuity for the people.‚Äô Cameron and several other Wagga men tried to enforce the wide boundaries of an emu sanctuary on Eunonyhareenyha station, northeast of Wagga.Gilmore, Old Days: Old Ways, pp. 118-120. The Wiradjuri placename ‚ÄòEunonyhareenyha‚Äô, according to Mary Gilmore, meant ‚Äòthe breeding place of the emus‚Äô. For a short while, the men convinced people not to shoot emus on Eunonyhareenyha, or to hunt there with dogs at nesting time. When Donald Cameron counted the once numerous emu flock inside the sanctuary, only a few hundred birds remained. ‚ÄòThen‚Äô, wrote Gilmore, ‚Äòthe town growing, and land-settlement increasing, there was objection made that one of the sweetest spots for grazing should be set aside for birds, when selectors could farm and make homes there.‚Äô Department of Lands officials opened to selection the part of Eunonyhareenyha ‚Äòsemi- reserved‚Äô for emus. Donald Cameron spoke with the station manager, who then erected notices banning shooting and dogs. Unluckily the eggs were forgotten, wrote Gilmore of the action to protect the emus, so next year when we drove out to see them there were only about half a dozen flocks of young birds to be found in the whole area. The nests had been raided everywhere. Donald Cameron made other attempts to reserve land for wildlife. His daughter remembered him returning home excited one evening, ‚Äòsaying that the larks were coming back again.‚Äô On a grassy flat beside Houlaghan's Creek, northwest of Wagga, Donald Cameron counted a hundred groundlark nests. Flocks of groundlarks nesting among tussocks had vanished in recent years, as agricultural development erased and modified grassy woodland. Mary Gilmore recalled how the brown, mottled birds shot into the air when disturbed, and ‚Äòglittered like sparks in the sun, as they mounted and sang in their myriads.‚Äô Her father built a log fence around the creek flat to exclude horses and cattle. Grass tussocks thickened, sheltering the nesting larks. Travellers on a passing road noticed the dense grasses, and put horses inside the enclosure to graze. Donald Cameron found the nests trampled, the air above empty and silent. The event pained him: After that father went by a different road to town. He had loved the larks, and they were gone. As to the fence, it became a neighbour‚Äôs firewood.Gilmore, The Passionate Heart, pp. 317-318.  River oaks and ecological regeneration Mary Gilmore also wrote about the loss of river oaks (Casuarina cunninghamiana) along the Murrumbidgee River in the Wagga area: The river-oaks were once a feature of the Murrumbidgee. Half a mile away you could hear the sigh of the wind as it swept through them. One after another they went, the last lone one a few years ago, and no one bothered to keep even a panel of its wood as a record. So goes all our unwritten and ancient romance, unless a newer generation pauses to pick it up.Strauss, Collected verse of Mary Gilmore, p. 642. In recent years, local organisations like the Wagga Wagga Urban Landcare Group have replanted river oaks and many other local species alongside the Murrumbidgee River.

At these dimensions upon completion it would be the largest structure (in floor space) on earth. The architectural firm behind the design is Foster and Partners. History The tent-like superstructure would rise to 450 m, and form a breathable \\"second skin\\" and thermal buffer for the main building, shielding the interior spaces from Moscow‚Äôs weather. This section skin will be sealed in winter to minimize heat loss, and opened in the summer to naturally cool the interior. The building would be integrated into a new park, which would provide a range of activities throughout the year, with cross country skiing and ice skating in the winter. It is stated to have a multitude of cultural, exhibition, performance, hotel, apartment, retail and office space, as well as an international school for 500 students. The building would be powered by built-in solar panels and wind turbines. The structure would also feature on-site renewable and low-carbon energy generation. In 2009, due to the global economic crisis, financial backing for the project was lost, and construction of the project was postponed.

It's located to the East of Lima at 2,378 m (7,802 ft) above sea level, along the Central Road () at km 74\\\\. History Matucana was founded in 1647 by Miguel de Castro y Garc√≠a, a descendant of one of Francisco Pizarro's Conquistadores. He discovered gold in the hills outside of Matucana at a site that was once a holy shrine for the Incas. Using Inca slaves to operate the mine, he became very wealthy and eventually returned to live in Lima, Peru. The gold mine was unfortunately buried in a huge avalanche triggered by the devastating Santa Ursula earthquake of October 21, 1756, which also caused great damage to the City of Lima. Society and culture The City of Matucana is a popular destination for eco-tourists, as it has beautiful water falls in the deep valleys outside of the town and plentiful hiking trails. It is also the starting point for the increasingly popular \\"De Las Montanas y Mar\\" bicycle race held every year between Matucana and Lima. The bicycle race starts at the Chez Victor Restaurant in Matucana and finishes at the La Rosa Nautica Restaurant in Lima. One of Don Miguel's descendants runs the Chez Victor restaurant in Matucana, while the La Rosa Nautica Restaurant is owned by the descendants of the Viceroy who granted the lands around Matucana to Don Miguel de Castro y Garcia. Coincidentally, the Chez Victor Restaurant was started with a grant received from Hernando De Soto's Institute for Liberty and Democracy.

McGraw joined the Army from Camden, New Jersey, and by November 19, 1944 was serving as a private first class in Company H, 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. At that time, the 26th Regiment was fighting in the Battle of Hurtgen Forest, a grueling dense- forest offensive near the German-Belgian border. During a German counterattack on that day, near Schevenh√ºtte, Germany, he manned his machine gun despite intense enemy fire and left cover in order to retrieve more ammunition. Although wounded, he continued to fire his machine gun until again running out of ammunition. He then engaged the German troops with a carbine, but was subsequently killed. For these gallant actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on October 25, 1945. McGraw, aged 26 at his death, was buried at the Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery in Henri-Chapelle, Belgium. The McGraw Kaserne in Munich has been named after him. Medal of Honor citation Private First Class McGraw's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > He manned a heavy machine gun in a foxhole near Schevenhutte, Germany, on 19 > November 1944, when the enemy launched a fierce counterattack. Braving an > intense hour-long preparatory barrage, he maintained his stand and poured > deadly accurate fire into the advancing foot troops, until they faltered and > came to a halt. The hostile forces brought up a machine gun in an effort to > dislodge him but were frustrated when he lifted his gun to an exposed but > advantageous position atop a log, courageously stood up in his foxhole and > knocked out the enemy weapon. A rocket blasted his gun from position, but he > retrieved it and continued firing. He silenced a second machine gun and then > made repeated trips over fire-swept terrain to replenish his ammunition > supply.

Honors The United States Army ship , which served from 1946 to 1950, was named in his honor.

Carolyn F. Ruffin in The Christian Science Monitor, notes that \\"[g]ood science fiction spooks, startles, or awes,\\" and that three stories in the anthology accomplish the first, two the second and one the third. With a nod to Delany's contention in the introduction that \\"the stories reflect a current trend in science fiction away from 'interest in physics and cosmology ... toward biology,'\\" she feels \\"[t]he effect ... is to heighten the impact of the writing.\\" While praising all the selections, she singles \\"Stardance\\" out as \\"among the best in science fiction,\\" a story that \\"puts one in awe.\\"Ruffin, Carolyn F. Review in The Christian Science Monitor, March 5, 1980, p. 17.

Initiating his exploration of the daguerreotype in San Francisco in 1994, Spagnoli experimented with nineteenth-century materials and studied the effects achieved by early practitioners to understand the technical aspects of the process, as well as its expressive and visual potential as a medium. He began work on an ongoing series entitled ‚ÄúThe Last Great Daguerreian Survey of the 20th Century‚Äù in 1995, continuing the series upon returning to the east coast in 1998. The project features views of the metropolis as well as images of historically significant events including the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11, the vigil following the disappearance of John F. Kennedy, Jr.., and Times Square at midnight on the eve of the new millennium. Considered the leading expert in the revitalization of the daguerreotype process, Spagnoli is also noted for his collaboration with artist Chuck Close on daguerreotype portraits and nudes. Spagnoli‚Äôs interest in the characteristic qualities of photographic processes extends to other aspects of his work. In his ‚ÄúPhotomicrograph‚Äù series Spagnoli explores how people, photographed at great distances onto a small piece of film and enlarged many times, are readable as human forms from the most minimal information. In ‚ÄúPantheon,‚Äù a recent series of color photographs, Spagnoli placed a radiating sun at the center of each image, the effect of which is enhanced by his use of a pinhole camera. Recently this project has morphed into ‚ÄúLocal Stories.‚Äù Exchanging the pinhole for a super-wide-angle lens the project has taken on a more documentarian agenda while retaining the preoccupation with the sun as a central motif. Of his work, Spagnoli comments, ‚ÄúUltimately my use of various materials and methods is centered in my desire to make complicated stories out of the everyday world, which is my apparent subject matter. Photography allows me to engage viewers with images and ideas which are filtered through the abstracting apparatus of the camera and woven into the matrix of its rich history.‚Äù Collections *The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY *The National Portrait Gallery, Washington DC *The Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, VA *The Fogg Museum, Boston, MA *The High Museum, Atlanta, GA *The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston MA *The Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY *The Nelson Atkins Museum, Kansas City, MO *The Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL *The Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA *The New York Historical Society, New York, NY *The Museum of the City of New York, New York, NY *The Cleveland Museum, Cleveland, OH *Musee Carnavalet, Paris, France Books *Daguerreotypes, Steidl Verlag, (2006) *American Dreaming, Steidl Verlag, (Spring 2010) =In collaboration with Chuck Close= *A Couple of Ways of Doing Something, Chuck Close and Bob Holman, Aperture, New York, (2006) *Chuck Close: Daguerreotypes, Demetrio Paparoni, Alberico Cetti Serbelloni Editor, (2002) =Other books featuring Spagnoli‚Äôs work= *The Journal of Contemporary Photography VI, (2004), ‚ÄúFlesh and Spirit: The Photomicrographs of Jerry Spagnoli‚Äù *Photography‚Äôs Antiquarian Avant-Garde, Lyle Rexer, Abrams, (2002) *The Photographic Arts, John Wood, University of Iowa Press, (1997), ‚ÄúPassed, Passing or to Come: The Conceptual Songs of Jerry Spagnoli‚Äù ReferencesExternal links *home page *A podcast of a presentation at the University of Utah in 2006 *An interview with National Public Radio in 2001 *The Jerry Spagnoli Photograph Collection at the New York Historical Society Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:American photographers ","title":"Jerry Spagnoli"},{"id":"15032334","text":"Rosebud Kitmaster was the brand name of a short-lived but critically acclaimed range of plastic assembly kits, manufactured in the UK by Rosebud Dolls Ltd of Raunds, Northamptonshire. Introduced from May 1959, the range rapidly expanded to include 34 models of railway locomotives and coaches in OO, HO and TT scales, and eventually, one motorcycle in 1/16 scale. The assets of Rosebud Kitmaster were sold to Airfix Products Ltd in late 1962. Nine locomotives and the motorcycle were later re-issued under the Airfix brand. The range comprised mainly British railway rolling stock but there were a few kits of other subjects. The range consisted of 34 kits of individual locomotives or carriages, a model of the Ariel Arrow motorcycle, the \\"Fireball XL5\\" rocket, parts to motorise the railway kits (using a motorised box wagon supplied pre- built, or a motor bogie) and three railway presentation sets: * P1: 100 Years of British Steam - this included kits of Stephenson's Rocket, the Stirling 8' Single locomotive and a Coronation class locomotive in 00 scale. * P2: Battle of Britain Set - this contained a Battle of Britain class locomotive and three BR Mark 1 coaches in 00 scale. * P3: TT3 Royal Scot Set - this contained a Royal Scot class locomotive and four BR Mark 1 coaches in TT3 (3mm = 1 foot) scale. All of the moulds for the kits produced by Rosebud Dolls Ltd under the Kitmaster name were sold to Airfix Products Ltd in 1962, and later in 1982 some of them were sold to Dapol Model Railways. However, not all of the kits were passed over and several were destroyed by General Mills / Palitoy at the Glenfield warehouse where they had been stored following the liquidation of Airfix Products Ltd that year. As such, some Kitmaster kits are extremely collectable and can be very valuable to a dedicated collector. Prices of unmade kits for the rarer models, such as the 00 gauge LMS Beyer-Garratt locomotive, can reach as much as ¬£100. Before its demise, the company announced the introduction of a number of kits that never knowingly entered production, including the LNER Flying Scotsman, Southern Railway Class USA Tank engine and Canadian National U-4A.

He served as Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Religious from 1913 to 1915, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1905. Biography Ottavio Cagiano de Azevedo was born in Frosinone, and held the title of count; he was a nephew of Cardinal Antonio Cagiano de Azevedo. He studied at the seminary in Grottaferrata, and was ordained to the priesthood in September 1868. Cagiano then did pastoral work in Rome until 1874, the same year he was made a canon of the Liberian Basilica on 1 April. He later became an abreviattore de parco maggiore on 1 January 1876, protonotary apostolic ad instar participantium on 9 April 1880 and canon of St. Peter's Basilica on 3 December 1886. On 31 December 1891 Cagiano was appointed Master of the Papal Chamber by Pope Leo XIII, and later papal majordomo on 29 May 1901. Raised to the rank of cardinal without ever receiving an episcopal ordination, he was created Cardinal Deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano by Pope Pius X in the consistory of 11 December 1905. After becoming Apostolic Visitor of the Hospice of Catechumens on 17 January 1911, Cagiano was named Pro-Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Religious on 12 June 1913, rising to become full Prefect on the following 31 October. He was made Protector of the Order of the Servants of Mary on 10 March 1914 and then participated in the conclave of 1914, which selected Pope Benedict XV. During the conclave, Cagiano supposedly served as a scrutineer on the last day of balloting with Cardinals Bartolomeo Bacilieri and Rafael Merry del Val.Burkle- Young, Francis A. \\"Papal Elections in the Age of Transition, 1878-1922\\". 2000 On 6 December 1915 he was named Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, remaining in that post until his death. Cagiano, after ten years' standing as a Cardinal Deacon, opted for the order of Cardinal Priests and was assigned the titular church of San Lorenzo in Damaso in the consistory of the same date. He was also one of the cardinal electors in the conclave of 1922, which resulted in the election of Pope Pius XI. In addition to being appointed a Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Siam, he was appointed a Grand Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph of Austria, of the Order of Isabella the Catholic of Spain, and of the Civil Order of Tuscany. He was also appointed a Commander with Plaque of the Order of the Red Eagle of Prussia and an Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. Cardinal Cagiano died in Anzio, at age 81. He is buried in the tomb of the Order of the Servants of Mary at the Campo Verano cemetery.

It peaked at number 132 on the Billboard 200 chart. Overview After the band achieved fame and a new audience with '\\"Closer to Free\\", they resisted the pressure to duplicate the single's success and wanted to avoid rehashing the same formula. Like Go Slow Down, the band chose to record their next album at Hacksville, their studio in a rented storefront, and self-produced the album with the assistance of producer/engineer Greg Goldman. Recording took place over a two- year period during the time in between tours. Bob Clearmountain was hired to mix \\"The Understanding\\" and \\"Hurt By Love\\", while Tchad Blake mixed the uptempo \\"Hey Pretty Girl\\". The result was a more rock-oriented sound than their previous album, though it continued along a similar direction. Reception Despite not matching the success of \\"Closer to Free\\", \\"Hurt By Love\\" saw minor chart success and critics commented on the album's consistency. Music critic Rick Anderson, writing for AllMusic, praised the songwriting though he criticized the lyrics. He said, \\"'Hurt By Love' is what the BoDeans are trying for throughout this whole album, but they only get there once or twice.\\" However, Chuck Eddy of Entertainment Weekly gave it a mixed review, stating: \\"Having finally achieved pop stardom via their Party of Five theme song, this long-suffering Wisconsin bar band now tries to preserve their meager integrity by acting as un-Hollywood as possible.

Psyren follows Ageha Yoshina, a high school student who is chosen by Nemesis Q as a participant in the Psyren games. The games take place in a world known as Psyren. The manga was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine from December 2007 to November 2010, and has been collected in sixteen tank≈çbon volumes. In North America; Viz Media licensed the series in 2010 and serialized its chapters in Shonen Jump. Plot After Ageha Yoshina beats up a bully for 10,000 yen, he heads home anticipating a scolding from his sister for breaking curfew. On his way there, a pay phone nearby starts ringing, and he picks it up only to hear his own echo. Shrugging it off, he places the receiver back only to find a mysterious calling card with the word \\"Psyren\\" written on it. Curious about the sudden appearance of the card, he goes to his school's Occult Club and asks about it. It turns about Psyren was an urban myth, and whoever found out what it really was would get a reward of 500 million yen. The same day, he find his classmate's (Sakurako Amamiya's) wallet, which some other girls hid, and notices she has the same card. After he returns it to her, she runs off and disappears. The last thing he hears is \\"Save me\\". The next day she isn't at school and soon she is declared missing. Ageha calls the number on the card in hopes of finding her. After answering a long and detailed quiz on a pay phone, he is asked if he wants to go to Psyren. The next day, while he is being chased by two mysterious people pretending to be police officers; his phone rings. In a panic, he picks up and is suddenly drawn into the world of Psyren, which is a wasteland inhabited by monsters called Taboo. It is later revealed that the Taboo were once humans that were turned into Taboo by an organization known as the W.I.S.E. The voice from the phone, dubbed Nemesis Q, assigns missions which people must complete if they wish to return home. While in Psyren for the first time newcomers are informed of the rules, which basically state that if you tell anyone about Psyren you die; when the number on your card hits zero you beat the game and can't come back; never lose your card, you can't go home if you do; and don't go near the towers. The Psyren Drifters (as they come to be called) breathe in the polluted air from this world of Psyren and it alters their brains, allowing them to surpass human limits and use all their brain cells, at the cost of serious damage. This lets them use a power called PSI, which usually lies dormant, and is usually never awakened. PSI consists of three categories, Enhance (use of PSI to enhance their physical abilities), Blast (external usage of PSI to create power blasts or creatures), and Trance (the ability to affect someone's mental state). As the game continues Ageha and his friends meet a group of kids who are adopted by Elmore Tenju, the old lady who posted the 500 million reward offer. Each child has the ability to use PSI, and Tenju has trained them to one day fight W.I.S.E as the hope of the world. Each child has their own distinct and unique abilities and traumatic background. Ageha stays with them for a while and his abilities really start to grow with the help of techniques developed by the children. They train until he gets called back through his phone and goes back to fight in the game. The game continues until eventually, Ageha, Sakurako, Hiry≈´ Asaga, Oboro Mochizuki, and Kabuto Kirisaki are the only contenders left. They are trained by former Psyren contestant Matsuri Yagumo and the psychic children from the Tenju Roots Orphanage. Miroku Amagi, a psychic from their timeline, and his organization called W.I.S.E. are revealed to be the cause of Japan's destruction. Their actions slowly change the world of Psyren, resulting in the Tenju Root's survival in the Psyren timeline. In the Psyren timeline, Mithra, a psychic from W.I.S.E, is revealed to have been manipulating Miroku the whole time. She reveals that a meteorite called Promised Tear turned her into a host for Ouroboros, a planet-eating meteor, and she calls the meteor to Earth. Before the Earth is destroyed, Nemesis Q's controller, No.7, transports them back to their own timeline. Ageha and friends intercept the W.I.S.E group before they gain possession of the Promised Tear. Ageha gives Miroku a card from No.7 allowing him to witness events that occur in the future. Together, Ageha and Miroku are able to defeat Mithra but Ageha falls into a coma. No.7 contacts Ageha while he is in the coma, revealing the outcome of the Psyren timeline‚ÄîMiroku and Grana sacrificed their lives to destroy Ouroboros and Mithra. As Ageha wakes up from his coma, he travels with Sakurako and frees No.7 from her cell. Characters=Protagonists= ; :Ageha is a brash high-schooler who offers to take care of anyone's problems for the price of 10,000 yen ($100). Yoshina and Amamiya were childhood friends, but they grew apart. When they finally talk again in high school, Amamiya runs away but inadvertently asks Yoshina to save her. Later, Yoshina receives a calling card and becomes a participant in the game, Psyren. Upon arriving in the future, he immediately gets attacked by a Taboo but gets saved by Amamiya. Amamiya, after hearing Yoshina came to save her, hugs the confused Yoshina. :After completing the first round, Yoshina trains under Amamiya and Matsuri to improve his PSI abilities. He makes some progress, and they get called into the next round of Psyren. Yoshina's power manifests as a massive black sphere that reacts to PSI. This power is known as \\"Melzez Door\\", an ability that creates a concentrated ball of pure Blast energy. It seeks out any PSI energy in the area and completely absorbs it, and it also eradicates any physical matter it touches. Yoshina realizes that if he is not able to control this power, he may end up hurting his friends. After seeing the kids at the Elmore Tenjuin mansion, he figures out how to control his PSI. Yoshina slowly gets used to his power and is constantly thinking of ways to get stronger. As a result, Yoshina has refined his power to the point where it can be used offensively and defensively. Yoshina begins training in the fourth ability of PSI, \\"Nova\\", which combines all three PSI abilities of \\"Enhance\\", \\"Blast\\", and \\"Trance\\" in order to surpass the usual limits and achieve a great power boost than other PSI users. :Although hot-blooded, Yoshina has proven himself to be very capable. He understands his lack of power and strives to become strong to protect his friends, especially Amamiya. In chapter 126, while training with Amamiya to learn \\"Nova\\", Yoshina confessed his romantic feelings for Amamiya. :Yoshina's main offensive technique is \\"Melzez Lance\\". Yoshina creates a condensed sphere and releases it, relying on the indiscriminate targeting of \\"Melzez Door\\". Because the sphere is small, it gains enormous speed, but it is less powerful, and thus less taxing on Yoshina's mind. His second technique, he keeps \\"Melzez Door\\" in one place by rotating it, which creates a flat disk used like a shield in order to block, and also for close-range offensive attacks. His third technique, \\"Melzez Vortex\\", can be used both offensively and defensively. Yoshina creates condensed spheres linked together in a line, allowing for greater control. In the defensive mode, \\"Melzez Vortex\\" forms a semi-sphere around him and absorbs PSI attacks. In the attack mode, Yoshina breaks the links and releases the spheres, causing them to target PSI sources. (Voiced by): Takahiro Sakurai in the VOMIC. ; :Childhood friend of Yoshina Ageha, she comforted him when his mom died. During the first day of high school, Amamiya coldly told everyone to leave her alone until graduation. As a result, \\"Ice Queen\\" has no friends and is the victim of constant bullying. When Yoshina returns her stolen wallet, Amamiya hurries away but asks, under her breath, for him to come save her. Amamiya has been back and forth to Psyren a couple of times before the start of the series. :Amamiya is proficient in Trance, using illusions to deceive her opponents, reading their minds, forcefully extracting information from their memories, and manipulating their perceptions of reality. She is also proficient in Enhance, physically defeating her opponents after mindjacking them via Trance, and she uses various samurai swords, scythes, tonfas, and other traditional Japanese and Chinese weaponry that she brings to Psyren. Because she was usually the only one to return from Psyren, she blamed herself for everyone who died. In order to cope with this, Amamiya developed a split personality. Any emotions that she cannot handle, including her feelings for Yoshina, are locked away in an alternate personality known as \\"Abyss\\" that resides deep within her. When Amamiya was heavily wounded, Abyss took over. Abyss refers to herself as \\"the beautiful, cool me\\" while Amamiya is \\"the cute, kind me\\". Abyss, identified by her darker skin, has homicidal tendencies but resists them because Yoshina would hate her if she killed anyone. Amamiya excels at Trance while Abyss excels at Blast. :Amamiya is innocent when it comes to love. She could not handle her feelings for Yoshina and locked them away in her split personality. When Abyss surfaced and proclaimed her love to Yoshina, Amamiya once again becomes aware of her feelings. When Amamiya confronts Yoshina about what Abyss said, they almost kiss, but are interrupted by the kids. :Amamiya is strong, but she realizes that she causes trouble for Yoshina. In order to stay by his side forever, Amamiya wants to become stronger. When she overhears Yoshina's conversation with his dad about \\"Nova\\", Amamiya decides she wants to learn it as well. She has trouble learning until Yoshina holds her hand and tells her they'll learn it together. After hearing Yoshina confess his long-time feelings for her, she breaks down and the two embrace. During the Resistance's liberation of Astral Nova, Amamiya uses her newly gained Nova ability, which divides her into two beings‚Äîherself and Abyss‚Äîwhile fighting Shiner (the 4th Star Commander), and kills him quickly. :Amamiya has shown two techniques. One is \\"Wired Mind Jack\\", where she sends a wired Trance into her enemy's mind and attempts to extract information. Her second technique is \\"Mind Jack: Insanity Scythe\\". Amamiya creates a giant crystallization of her Trance in the shape of a scythe. When shattered, it releases quantum thought waves that cause the enemy to hallucinate. Her Nova ability allows her to split into two beings, her original self and Abyss. This ability allows Amamiya and Abyss to work together as a team; Amamiya reads her opponent's mind using Trance and relays information to Abyss via telepathy, allowing the latter to perform actions immediately. (Voiced by):Yui Horie in the VOMIC. ; :Asaga is a tough guy who says that he came to Psyren in search of his friend, Tatsuo. He agrees to help Amamiya for Yoshina. After their safe return to earth, he comforts Yoshina about Amamiya being taken by an unknown friend, and reveals himself to be Asaga Hiry≈´, Ageha's former classmate from elementary school who used to be a crybaby. He displays more proficiency with PSI than Ageha, quickly learning how to use and control his abilities. Asaga's PSI ability resembles the tail of a Dragon in its Blast state, fitting his nickname, Dragon; he chose it as a heroic monicker, hoping to become worthy of it for Tatsuo's sake. Advances in his PSI ability allow him to create the wings of a Dragon that can whip up huge gales. Matsuri warns him to keep an eye on Ageha and Oboro's abilities; He claims Asaga is the only one who could take them out if necessary. He has decided to stay in Psyren to help build resistance against WISE. He appeared alongside Tatsuo and Kusakabe to aid in the defense of Tenju's Root. Eventually he is able to manifest a complete dragon using his PSI. ; :An idol in the present, Oboro received a calling card and tried to tell the nation about it on a local talk show, but was silenced by Nemesis Q. He develops PSI powers that allows him to heal his comrades. He joins Matsuri's training session, completing it without any problems. He demonstrates an ability to kill a Taboo by 'dissolving' it when he touches it. He is the fastest when using Enhance. He has taken a liking to Ageha, stating that if Ageha got hurt, he would \\"hug him any time\\". Oboro later reappears during the initial battle at WISE's main base, having survived his fatal wound by using Cure to assimilate numerous Taboo illumina cores; as a result, he gained a new ability called 'Harmonious', which allows him to manipulate and assimulate life. In Kabuto's words, Oboro is absolutely nuts (and someone he doesn't want to trust his life too), not to mention how weird he is found by his comrades. He later resumes his career upon returning from the final battle in Psyren, spared from disintegration since the Illumina cores were disabled by No.7. ; :A local playboy, Kabuto's former way of life was running away from problems and annoyances as a way to achieve peace. He is also greedy, owing his uncle several thousand Yen. After a talk with his uncle, he decides to change. Kabuto goes to Psyren to try to make his fortune, and is among the new arrivals during the group's second trip to Psyren. Kabuto's PSI is a type of precognition known as \\"Menace\\", an ability to predict danger that allows him to avoid enemy attacks. He later creates an avatar on the same level as Nemesis Q, naming it YoYo. It allows him to dodge attacks and deflect them back at the enemy with incredible force. YoYo cannot be seen, so many mistake Kabuto for a telekenesis user. =Antagonists= The antagonists are a group known as W.I.S.E. that are led by Miroku Amagi. ; :Miroku is a mysterious man who appears in the present disguised as Inui's brother who had died years ago. Miroku hypnotizes Inui, and has him steal money to advance his plans to create a new world with his organization called W.I.S.E. Miroku's psychic ability is called Sephirot, which allows him to create trees made of light for offensive and defensive purposes. One of his signature abilities is an attack called \\"Gevurah\\", which allows Miroku to create a tree of light which pierces everything. The attack is extremely powerful, as it allowed Miroku to finish all of the Elmore Wood children in one blow. This incident is seen in the original videotape that the drifters find in Psyren. It has been implied that he may have been behind the arrival of the meteor Uroboros that destroyed and transformed the earth. He is responsible for hunting survivors and turning them into Taboo. He is the younger twin brother of the Creator of Nemesis Q. He is one of the Grigori's experimental subject and was known as #06. During the Resistance's liberation of Astral Nova, Miroku creates a gigantic tree of light. He is confronted by Ageha. The two battle, and Ageha overpowers Miroku using his newly developed Nova ability, dealing a critical blow on the W.I.S.E. leader's body. Though wounded, Miroku states that his ultimate plan had finally come to fruition, as the tree he just created is beginning to destroy the surrounding environment. The tree is spawning strange growths that look like embryos. Miroku reveals that this is the effect of Sephirot's final ability, \\"Keter\\", which will destroy all life on Earth and replace it with the new life form that the tree creates. Mithra shows herself and sabotages Miroku's plan, revealing that she was manipulating Miroku all along to suit her own agenda. She reveals that she serves under a planet-eating entity called Quat Nevas, and that Miroku's plan has created enough energy for her master to devour Earth. ; (Star Commander No. 1) :The leader of the Star Commanders, he is lazy and forgetful. He has an eye-patch over his right eye. His PSI ability is telekinesis; he uses it to create a massive building from thousands of pieces in a matter of minutes. Grana has also demonstrated an ability called 'Sun Fall': he uses telekinesis to bend light photons and create a massive beam capable of disintegrating most matter instantly. He orders Shiner and Dholaki to retrieve Ageha and bring him back to the WISE headquarters. Grana, known as Grigori #01 was the original 'prototype', a type of experimental subject who was brought up from fetus, created through Grigori's Gene manipulation. It is revealed that he was the one responsible for killing Matsuri and Kagetora in the future. ; (Star Commander No. 2) : The second member of W.I.S.E. introduced, he has the appearance of a young teenager. He wears a distinctive black helmet with a fin on the crest. He appears to be a swordsman, and has the ability to materialize swords. He appears with Dholaki and Miroku in his declaration of war in the second version of the future, and it is assumed he was there in the unchanged future. He takes a job has a janitor in a disbanded orphanage in order to look for Caprico, to convince her to join WISE. He is one of the Grigori and was known as #05. His PSI ability is called \\"Bishamon-Mura\\". It takes the form of hundreds of fragile swords that float in the air. When they break the pieces drop down and cut the enemy to pieces. He also has shown an ability called \\"Bishamon-Tsubute\\". By using a knife medium, he stabs or slashes towards an enemy. He leads the assault on Tenju's Root, and would have killed Ageha if not for the timely intervention of Asuka, who injures him using the newly discovered PSI ability known as Nova. ; (Star Commander No. 3) :Also known as 'Grigori 03', he is a psychicer with a youthful appearance. He, like Grana and Miroku, is a product of the Grigori research facility. With his PSI ability \\"Deep Freeze\\", Uranus is capable of manipulating ice in whatever way he chooses. He is able to materialize guns made of ice, which shoot bullets that cover the target with thick ice. He is able to create ice skate blades on the bottom of his shoes to accommodate for the change in the environment that his attacks create. Uranus made his first appearance when he and Eiji Kise are recruited into W.I.S.E. shortly after Grana joins the group in the present timeline. Uranus once worked for the government as an assassin, and tracked Grana after he escaped from the Grigori. After being defeated by Grana, Uranus severed his ties with the government. Uranus make his second appearance in the current version of the future, criticizing Junas' failure to invade Tenju's Roots and losing half of the Scourge unit. He is now W.I.S.E.'s Star Commander No. 3, a position which belonged to Shiner (now Star Commander No. 4) in the previous version of the future. He was killed in battle by Kyle and Frederica during the Resistance's attempt to liberate Astral Nova. ; (Star Commander No. 4; demoted from 3rd after he was almost killed by Shao and Frederica) :The third member of W.I.S.E. introduced, he arrives after Dholaki is defeated by Ageha. His outward appearance is calm and gentle. He is very curious. He is the head of W.I.S.E.'s PSI Research Division. He takes a special interest in Ageha and his ability. Shiner's PSI ability, dubbed the \\"Hexagonal Transfer System\\", allows him to teleport himself or other people, making it easy for him to kill his opponents. In chapter 66 he was defeated after being outdone by Shao's power. His arm was broken by Amamiya, and he was almost killed by Frederica. After returning to his tower, he kills a Taboo, not wanting anyone to see him in such a \\"disgraceful manner\\". He wonders if the reason he escaped to the tower was because of fear. Shiner is now W.I.S.E.'s Star Commander No. 4 in the current version of the future (the No. 3 position belongs to Uranus). During the Resistance's liberation of Astral Nova, Shiner is killed by Amamiya, who uses her new Nova ability against him. ; (Star Commander No. 5, Former) :The first member of W.I.S.E introduced, he has long silvery hair and a wears a long coat with a large collar. His upper face is covered with a bird-like visor similar to that of Nemesis Q. He is the head of W.I.S.E.'s Border Security Division. Dholki is very proud, so after being defeated by Ageha's \\"Melchsee's Door\\", he implanted a second core into himself. This gives him more power, but he only has a .5% chance of surviving a year. He is seen in Tatsuo's flashback as the man who oversaw the implanting of the core in Tatsuo's chest. Matsuri briefly met him in the tower during her time in Psyren, and was attacked before narrowly escaping. During Ageha's third trip to Psyren, Dholaki is alerted to the drifters' presence and offers to confront them on his own. Dholki does battle with Ageha and his upgraded \\"Melchsee's Door\\", but is defeated. Dholki possesses a PSI ability called \\"Explosia\\" that creates massive explosions using Burst, which also allows him to deviate PSI waves. He appears along with Junas and Miroku in his declaration of war in the second version of the future, and it is assumed he was there in the unchanged future. He came back to take revenge on Yoshina. He quickly shows that his upgraded Explosia is more than a match for Ageha's Melchsee's Door, but he is killed by Kyle when both his cores are destroyed. ; (Vigo) (Star Commander No. 5) :A demented serial killer with long limbs and lanky stature, he was recruited into W.I.S.E. along with Grigori #03 shortly after Grana joins the group in the present timeline. Kise considers his killings an art form, and views himself as a genius in performing such acts. He joined Miroku to learn greater powers for his art. His PSI ability, \\"Zone Diver\\", grants him the ability to phase himself through solid objects such as walls, allowing him to stealthily kill his victims using his two knives. Kise is capable of assimilating his body into the surrounding environment. This allows him to create a countless number of limbs or move his vitals anywhere within the environment. He can drag his victims into the environment, which either traps them or turns them into a statue by encasing them with materials from the environment. In the future timeline, Kise (now referred as Vigo) joins Junas and the Star Commander's elite Scourge unit to invade Tenju's Roots. During the invasion, Vigo develops an interest on Marie and threatened to turn her into one of his collections, but was stopped in time by Shao. The two engage in a brutal battle, with Shao emerging as the victor, breaking Vigo's neck. Vigo survives Shao's killing blow and knocks Marie unconscious and kidnaps her. As Vigo leaves Tenju's Roots with the unconscious Marie, he chillingly tells a helpless Van to send a message to Shao, informing him that if he wishes to rescue Marie, he will have to travel to W.I.S.E.'s capital at Astral Nova, and face him there. He is killed by Mithra while trying to save Marie. ; (Star Commander No. 6, 4 in previous timeline)) :The fourth member of W.I.S.E. introduced, she has the appearance of a cute teenage girl with a distinctive star-shaped scar on her forehead. She appears to be the head of W.I.S.E.'s Biological Research Division. It's suggested some of the wild Taboo are her creations; most are mutations from Illumina cores. Back in the present world, she is a girl from a disbanded orphanage who gained her abilities after falling from a cliff. She is called the \\"creator\\" by Miroku. She has the ability to bring to life anything that she draws. When Junas recruits her in the present, she instantly becomes attached to him, seeing him as her first true friend as he lets her draw to her heart's content; she was forbidden by others due to her powers. By the Psyren timeline, her attachment to Junas has grown into a deep love; because of this, Kagetora spare his life. ; :A mysterious figure with the appearance of a young woman, not much is known about Misura other than that she is a member of W.I.S.E.'s Council of Elders. She is not a human nor from the earth. When Misura's body begins to crack, it looks similar to the alien life form within the Ouroboros Meteor that hit the Earth in December of 2009. Misura develops an interest in Marie, who was captured and brought to Astral Nova by Vigo. Misura wants to take Marie as its next host. Misura seems to be able to track the lives of other PSI users using her PSI ability called \\"Bonfire\\", evidenced when she telepathically informs Miroku of Yusaka's death shortly after it happened. She possesses some kind of precognitive ability similar to those of Kabuto and Elmore Tenjuin, as she is confident that Yusaka would eventually betray W.I.S.E. Small flames resembling a will-o'-wisp can be seen when Misura uses her telepathy to communicate with Miroku. She refers to people with the name of their PSI power rather than their actual names. ; :A W.I.S.E. member introduced in the present, he is a dark-skinned man with a slender build. Although he appears to be a trusted friend of Kouichi Iba, Yusaka is a spy sent by Miroku Amagi to keep an eye on Kouichi Iba and ensure that he doesn't betray Miroku. Initially Yusaka seems to be a friendly person, but he is actually a violent psychopath that enjoys killing. His PSI ability is called \\"Candyman\\". This ability allows Yusaka to create various kinds of insects which create poisonous gas when he injects himself with different kinds of poison. \\"Candyman\\" also allows Yusaka to infect his victims with a poisonous virus when he touches them. Yusaka is the one responsible for infecting Matsuri with a virus in the unchanged version of the future, which eventually led to her and Kagetora's demise at the hands of Grana and Shiner. Yusaka was confronted by Yoshina and Amamiya, which led to a violent battle. He was defeated by Yoshina, who uses his newly developed Melzez Vortex to mortally wound Yusaka. Before he died he used nitroglycerin to blow up the laboratory. ; :The main force behind the events in the series, as well as Mithra's true master, Quat Nevas is a planet-eating entity which existed long before humans were born. It waited patiently during the Psyren timeline, for when Miroku would produce enough energy for it to eat earth. =Side characters=Tenju's Root ; :Elmore Tenjuin is an old woman, a clairvoyant Psychicer in current-day Japan who is trying to unlock the secrets of Psyren to save Japan from its intended future. She is offering 500 million yen to whoever can figure out Psyren. With her ability to see into the future, called Millennium Kaleidoscope, she has seen what Japan will eventually become. Her husband, Koper, was a Psyren drifter who could read minds. Together, they became wealthy and famous for their fortune-telling ability. After retiring, the couple began taking in gifted orphan children and helping them train their PSI abilities. One year ago, Koper turned into ash when he attempted to tell her about Psyren. Before he died, Elmore looked into Koper's mind and saw Psyren's calling card, Nemesis Q, the future of the world. Tenjuin Elmore trains PSI-training orphans in her home, known as Elmore Wood. She was destined to die in a plane crash, but Ageha delayed her trip to the airport and saved her life. In the future, she is leading the group known as \\"Tenju's Root\\". During the attack on Tenju's Root by members of WISE, she was injured trying to prevent Mari's kidnapping. Despite Van's healing abilities, he deems her \\"uncurable\\" and she soon dies of old age. ; :A cute blonde spoiled girl with pyrokinesis, Frederica has fire-based powers and a temper to match. She dislikes outsiders and is loud-mouthed and inconsiderate. She refers to herself as a spy codenamed \\"Ravishing Rose\\". She unknowingly lost control of her powers and burnt down her house when she fell ill. She disliked Ageha in the past, but she cooperates to teach him 'Blast Stream'. Although her personality has not changed much in the future, Frederica displays tsundere-like behavior. Frederica often tries to make people her servant. She eventually warms up to people a little more, including Kabuto, with whom she had the most difficulty. She is starting to have a crush on Ageha, and she deeply cares about Marie, but is too shy to say so. As a child, she dubbed her ability \\"Pyro Queen.\\" In the second future, she develops a program called \\"Salamandra\\" for her Pyro Queen. During the Resistance's attempt to liberate Astral Nova, she was critically injured by Grana. ; :A girl who uses telekinesis. She is the complete opposite of her friend Frederica, being shy and very kind. In the future, Marie is revealed to have developed a crush on Ageha during his time at Elmore Wood to train. Her telekinetic abilities are highly developed; she is able to rip apart an environment and avoid harming important people or friends. Thanks to a janken game, Marie is the leader of Tenju's Root. She was kidnapped by the WISE in their assault on Tenju's Root. ; :A mischievous, but powerful boy, Kyle is quite handsome though he has a scar on his face caused by Miroku. He has a good build. He and Ageha have established a brotherly relationship and he is quite clingy as he wants Ageha to stay around to play in the present. His ability, called \\"Material High\\" is Blast-based. It lets him create nearly invisible solid material by super-compressing the air. He says in his fight with Dholaki that his main power lies in Enhance. In the future, Kyle develops his Enhance abilities, which give him superhuman speed and strength. He shows up in Beelzebub, chapter 69 page 3, along with Frederica and Ageha. ; :Shao is a calm, rational Chinese boy. He specializes in tracking people down. His past is similar to Frederica's. His power, dubbed \\"Shinra-Banshou\\" or \\"All Creation\\", enables him to sense and redirect the PSI energy around him. It also allows him to sense other PSI users, as well as seeing the \\"true nature\\" of people. He describes Amamiya as \\"seven finely sharpened blades\\", Oboro as \\"white sea\\", and Ageha as \\"starry sky\\". In the future, Shao develops the ability to nullify other people's PSI powers through their mind. Shao has a crush on Marie. ; :Van is a quiet and apathetic boy who possesses the ability to heal people. He likes to eat a lot of sweets. He is kind and generous, as seen when he gives his plate to Frederica to lick when she can't have any desserts. In the future, his personality changes into a talkative and emotional teenager, often spilling secrets such as Marie and Shao's respective crushes. It is later revealed that the reason behind his personality change is because he was the only one left with healing powers after Ian died. His healing abilities progress to the point he is able to regenerate peoples' limbs when they are within his Cure Zone. He speaks French. ; :A Psychicer chosen by Kyotada Inui for his unique ability to transport items with his PSI ability, called \\"Trick Room\\". He creates two boxes that are linked by an alternate dimension, then places one box over the specific coordinates of an item and \\"downloads\\" the contents into the other box, making a completely untraceable robbery. Lan agrees to help Inui because he needs money to pay for his comatose sister's hospital stay. He is alive in the future, and is a part of \\"Tenju's Root\\". He helps transport Marie, Kyle, Van, Kabuto, and Ageha to the hideout using his Trick Room. ; :Haruhiko is a Psychicer with the ability, called \\"Shocker\\", to manipulate electricity. Haruhiko was chosen by Kyotada for his current operations of stealing money from the underworld. In the future, he joins \\"Tenju's Root\\", and is responsible for supplying most of the base's energy with his Shocker ability. He is defender of Tenju's Root, fending off potential attackers with his enhanced Shocker abilities. He refers to himself as the Root's protector \\"deity.\\" He powers came in handy when the team hacked into one of the towers in Psyren. ; :Chicka is the comatose sister of Lan Shinonome; she is the reason her older brother agreed to aid Inui in his illicit activities, in order to obtain money for her medical treatment. In the future, she has recovered from her coma, and is among the members of \\"Tenju's Root\\". She is healed by Ian after receiving a request from his rival. It is assumed that she, like her brother, is a Psychicer, though her abilities have yet to be demonstrated. She can drive a motorcycle, like Matsuri. Other ; :Nemesis is a PSI program with basic intelligence and individuality sent back from the future to select people worthy of using PSI to teach them about the future, discover the truth, and stop Psyren from occurring. The creator of \\"Q\\" mentioned that her body could not withstand the time-travel transfer so she sent a program to do her work. Its creator embedded another order in Q: to kill those who divulge information about Psyren. Nemesis Q's creator is Miroku Amagi's older twin sister, a psychicher girl that was taken, along with her brother, by the government at the age of six. When Q transports someone into the future, events in the interval occur as if the person involved simply disappeared. Q gives special treatments to Ageha, because she thinks Ageha's powers are significant. ; :A famous concert pianist and veteran Psyren drifter, Matsuri taught Amamiya about Psyren. Because her card's value is already at zero, she cannot help the main characters, and acts in a mentor role. She is a talented pianist, drinks a lot, and drives a motorcycle. When Ageha and Asaga first met her, she was drunk and responding to a call for assistance from Amamiya. She reacts playfully in regards to Ian and Kagetora's crush on her. She is concerned about Ageha and Oboro's abilities, and tells Hiryu that he is the only one who could take them down if necessary. Matsuri is an extremely competent user of Blast: using her vast telekinetic abilities, she trains Ageha in controlling his highly destructive Blast abilities. She deflected his full \\"Melzez Door\\" a number of times, while showing no visible strain. In the future she is suspected to be dead, along with Kagetora. Her true level of power was revealed by Grana, supposedly the strongest member of the WISE; he stated that she was \\"more like an Almighty Type\\". He remarks that, had she been in a better condition, she might have \\"stood a chance\\" against him. When she later appears in Psyren, having been given a chance to return by Nemesis Q, her PSI manifests as multiple spheres of energy ‚Äì when her spheres make contact with something, they explode with great force. Grana stated that while Matsuri's strength and speed were below his, they were made equal by Matsuri's impressive sense of battle, and an ability she had that Grana described as \\"a rhythm that pulls her opponent into her own pace\\". He commented that her \\"emotions were like a wave\\". ; :Kagetora is friend of Matsuri who is an expert user of Enhance-type PSI, claiming to be the best Enhance user in all of eastern Japan. Kagetora says that he is always available to die or kill for Matsuri ever since she saved him; he has proposed to Matsuri 22 times and was turned down every time. His physical appearance is that of a gangster, with sunglasses, slicked-back hair, and a print button-down shirt. His favorite food is Mont Blanc cake, he loves cats, and he would never harm a woman or child. Kagetora is a Psychicer, and does not know any of the details of Psyren. He comes to help Matsuri train the new Psyren Drifters in Enhance techniques. While trying to stop a group of PSI users that were using their power to commit crimes, he was nearly killed by Inui, but was saved by Ageha. In the future, he is suspected to be dead, along with Matsuri. The Kagetora of the past appears in Psyren alongside Matsuri to save Agehea and Amamiya from Grana and Junas, having been given a chance to do so by Nemesis Q. His PSI allows him to regenerate from damage at an extremely accelerated rate. ; :Tatsuo is a friend of Asaga's who is sick with a hereditary disease. He grew angry with the outside world so he went to Psyren and offered Asaga a card, but he refused. In Psyren, a masked figure that strongly resembles Tatsuo appears, holding a rifle that uses PSI energy: he kills all but five survivors, takes his aim at them, and destroys part of a building. He is a Blast user, and he also uses Enhance; however, after using Trance, Amamiya realizes that Tatsuo was transformed into a Taboo by having an orb implanted. Tatsuo regains his mind after being hit by Ageha; however, his core remains because it is integrated to his body. Because he does not have his card, he stays in Psyren. He will die when his core runs out of energy, but will look for a way around this. He describes his time as a Taboo as being trapped in someone else's body and regrets all the killing he did. He appears in chapter 69, when he saves Asaga from some Taboo. He is later shown with a new Asaga, as they are planning to take down a tower. Tatsuo appears during the WISE attack on Tenju's Root, riding atop Hiryu's dragon PSI: he uses his gun to poke holes in the dark sky, revealing the sun and causing the Taboo in the area to disintegrate. ; :Ian is a superior cure user and old friend of Matsuri with a rather unfriendly personality: he doesn't want others to know about his power, because he wants to live his life in peace. Ian has proposed to Matsuri 12 times and has been refused every time, but has not given up. He is a born PSI user and thus cannot be told anything related to Psyren. He is willing to wait until Matsuri can tell him, and promised not stick his nose in it. After Matsuri and Kagetora die in the old future, he becomes extremely upset. He dies while over-using his powers to save 30 people who should have died from their wounds; after the loss of their savior, Van steps in as healer. He was married to Fubuki Yoshina in the new future and had a son named Marco, but all three were captured by W.I.S.E.‚Äîalong with many other civilians‚Äîduring the invasion of Tenju's Roots. His son breaks the seal on the prison, releasing all the captives; at the same moment, reinforcements sent to release them arrived. He trained Van in the new future in cure and he helped train Kabuto in the new past. ; :Fubuki is the older sister and guardian of Ageha Yoshina. She lectures him, hits him for little things like being late, and goes as far as tying him up from the ceiling repeatedly. She has a crush on the idol Oboro Mochizuki. In the new future, she is married to Ian and had a baby son named Marco, but all three were captured by W.I.S.E. during the invasion of Tenju's Roots. ; :Asuka is the father of both Ageha and Fubuki; although 47 years old, he doesn't look that much older than his children. He is an astronomer, and, before his wife's death, was very much an absent father; after his wife died, he tried his best to become the father he felt his children deserved. He is normally calm, but is quick to discipline Ageha, with violence if necessary; he is physically strong, apparently from learning karate online. Rather than trying to find out what Ageha is doing every time he goes missing, Asuka decides to disown his son; in the future, Asuka returns to aid Ageha in the defense of Tenju's Root: he battles Star Commander Junas using his newly developed PSI power ‚Äì the ability to control gravity. He demonstrates the ability to expand his power's range alongside a literal sphere of influence: within it, he can control gravity completely, drastically weakening his opponent's PSI powers; he curves the time-space continuum around the sphere, thus slowing the progress of time for those within. Ageha comments that perhaps this power was always active within his father, as it would help explain his youthful looks: he is capable of using PSI's hidden potential, known as \\"Nova\\", to enhance his powers; however, he cannot maintain this enhanced state for very long, as it puts great strain on his brain. ; :A strange man met in the world of Psyren, Kusakabe is an acquaintance of Tatsuo and has an inhuman appearance; they have been working together on a plan to take down the WISE, which involves making the membrane covering the sky of Psyren weaker in specific areas: this would allow an attack to rip through the membrane and cause the sun to shine through. Since the sun is toxic to anyone with an Illumina core, if they could split the membrane above Tokyo, they would be able to disperse and potentially kill the forces of WISE. He was previously employed by WISE and he hacked into their Neural Control Programme using his PSI-power ‚Äì the ability to communicate with technology as if it were sentient.

Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Diocese of Tivoli\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 History Tivoli was strongly fortified by Belisarius in the Gothic War, but almost destroyed by Totila in 540. After the Lombard invasion it was in the power of the Byzantines and formed part of the patrimony of St. Peter. It had a count, representing the emperor. In 916 Pope John X won a victory there over the Saracens. It rebelled at times against the popes, under Emperor Henry IV and Emperor Henry V, and against Pope Innocent II; at other times it fought against the Roman rebels, as under Pope Eugene III and Pope Adrian IV. In the 13th century the Senate of Rome succeeded (under Pope Innocent IV) in imposing a tribute on the city, and arrogated to itself the right of appointing a count to govern it in conjunction with the local consuls. In the 14th century it sided with the Guelphs and strongly supported Pope Urban VI against Pope Clement VII. King Ladislaus of Naples was twice, and later Braccio da Montone once, repulsed from the city. But its strength was undermined by internal factions, in consequence of which Pope Pius II constructed the fortress which still exists. Pope Adrian VI withdrew it from the jurisdiction of the Roman Senate. In 1527 it was sacked by bands of the supporters of the emperor and the Colonna, important archives being destroyed during the attack. In 1547 it was again occupied by the Duke of Alba in a war against Pope Paul IV, and in 1744 by the Austrians. Bishops=to 1000= *Paulus (366)Paulus is also called Paulinus.

Differing in size and color depending on origin of development, the creek chub can usually be defined by a dark brown body with a black lateral line spanning horizontally across the body. It lives primarily within streams and rivers. Creek Chubs attain lengths of 2-6 inches with larger specimens of up to 12 inches possible. The genus name Semotilus derives from the Greek word sema (also known as dorsal fin), and atromaculatus comes from the Latin word \\"black spots\\".  Distribution and habitat A fish which can withstand many different environments, the creek chub's current range is the eastern two- thirds of the US and southeastern Canada. It can quickly adapt to different extreme environments, and can live on many different foods. Documented to span throughout the Great Lakes surrounding Wisconsin, and into Minnesota, this species has been described as plentiful. However, reports of this species have fallen throughout Wisconsin and the Great Lakes, suggesting a decline in its population in these regions.Hubbs, Carl L., Karl F. Lagler, and Gerald Ray. Smith. 2004. Fishes of the Great Lakes Region. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan. pg 213. Though populations have been declining within the Great Lakes, they have been continually documented throughout small and medium rivers and streams. Thriving in small stream environments, the creek chub gravitates toward areas of weeds to appear secure and avoid predation. Varying in environments containing a multitude of substrates, they have been documented over gravel, sand, silt, rubble, mud, boulders, clay, bedrock and detritus bottoms.Becker, George C. 1983. Fishes of Wisconsin. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1983. pg. 437-441. This fish actually prefers the stream or river environment compared to that of a lake, as they have been recorded in streams far more than lakes. Of over 440 individuals caught, only 9 were from lakes, and when limiting the locations to solely lakes, only six individuals were caught.Copes, F. 1978. Ecology of the creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus (Mitchill) in northern waters. Univ. Wis., Stevens Point, Mus. Nat. Hist. Fauna and Flora Wis. Rep. No. 12:1-21.  Appearance  The creek chub is a small chub with a greenish-brown back, cream-colored sides interrupted by horizontal black stripes running from the nose to the tail, and a white belly. Having a round, cylindrical body with a compressed posterior, males average 125 mm in length, while females average 105 mm.Becker, George C. 1983. Fishes of Wisconsin. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1983. pg. 437-441. As the specimen eats what is directly in front of it, the mouth is terminal, large and under the anterior of the eye. The creek chub has been known to slightly differ in coloration, containing black backs with a brown or yellowish middle lines. The average chub ranges in size from 127-178 mm in length, with the largest chub documented to be 197 mm long.Edwards, R. J. 1997. Ecological profiles for selected stream-dwelling Texas freshwater fishes I. Texas Water Development Board. March 31, 1997. TWBD 95-483-107. 89 pp. They can be identified from other common minnow species by the black \\"moustache\\" on their upper lips, along with a black dot on their dorsal fins. Additionally, juvenile males develop a rosy band on their sides, along with glossy, dark dorsal fin spots.Etnier, D.A., and W.C. Starnes. 1993. The Fishes of Tennessee. The University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville. 681 pp. Biology The scales of this species are quite unique to the needs of the creek chub, ultimately helping to protect and maneuver. Scales do not appear until the fish is 26 mm long, leaving 30-mm-long individuals having small scales with few circuli. Major growth occurs during the first year, often jumping by over 50‚Äì70 mm in one year.Dinsmore, J.J. 1962. Life history of the creek chub with emphasis on growth. Proc. Iowa Acad. Sci. 69:296-301 Males grow far more quickly than females, allowing maturity to occur at one to one and a half years of age. The main scales covering the creek chub are bony-ridge scales; they are thin and flexible to aid movement. Cycloid scales are also found, allowing for smooth transport within the water with little disturbance from the scales themselves. They also have leptoid scales, which are flexible plates of bone which help to protect the fish from prey and act as armor. Behavior The creek chub has specific behaviors at different ages. Commonly a school fish, they have been documented to school from birth to late adult, occupying the edges of pools. Their upper lethal temperature is 32 ¬∞C, while the lower lethal temperature is 1.7 ¬∞C.Brett, J.R. 1944. Some lethal temperature relations of Algonquin Park fishes. Univ. Toronto Stud. Biol. Ser. No. 52. 49 pp. Initially, the creek chub is quite hesitant to venture from its known territory. For instance, while developing and growing, a school of creek chub travels together within the same 50-meter radius.Becker, George C. 1983. Fishes of Wisconsin. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1983. pg. 437-441. Ensuring safety from unknown predators and environment, this increases their potential for survival. As the creek chub grows and develops, traveling outside its radius, it engages in aggressive behavior with other members of the species.Ross,M.R. 1977. Aggression as a social mechanism in the creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus). Copeia 1977(2):393-397. The creek chub engages in ritualized aggression when others of the species invade its territory. Engaging in parallel swim, the fish widens its fins and mouth and swims at a caudal beat. Intimidating opponent fish throughout these rituals, the forward fish stops and directs blows to the head of the other fish. This ensures territory dominance, forcing intruders out of its area. In central Ohio, creek chubs tend to dominate small creeks, where predators such as smallmouth, largemouth, and spotted bass are unable to thrive. They will be present in larger creeks and rivers, but they will no longer be a dominant species, and their population numbers will suffer from predation. Creek chubs can be caught on small hooks with small sections of nightcrawlers. They feed in schools during daylight, and aggressively compete for the bait at first. After several of their comrades are pulled from the water, creek chubs become wary, and they will no longer aggressively take the bait. At this point, they may nibble at the bait, or look at the bait and avoid striking at it. Creek chubs can be effectively caught in minnow traps with dry dog food. More information is needed about effective daytime angling hours. Creek chubs are a hardy minnow that can easily be caught in small creeks, stored in aquariums, and used as bait to catch larger fish such as bass and catfish. Since creek chubs do not have sharp spines that make up their dorsal fins, like a bluegill or largemouth bass does, they may be a preferred food source for fish that prey on smaller fish. Diet The creek chub is described as an opportunist and a carnivore, and consumes many different foods to survive, including fish, insect remains and vegetation, amphipods, adult Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera nymphs, Odonata larvae and Diptera adults and larvae.Copes, F. 1978. Ecology of the creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus (Mitchill) in northern waters. Univ. Wis., Stevens Point, Mus. Nat. Hist. Fauna and Flora Wis. Rep. No. 12:1-21. Feeding habits are specific to the creeks and rivers where in the chub exists. As a juvenile, it actively feeds throughout the early morning on organisms within the water. As an adult, the creek chub does not feed until the afternoon, being documented to never feed before 1100 hours.Harrison, H.M. 1950. The foods used by some common fish of the Des Moines River drainage. pp. 31-44 in Biology seminar held at Des Moines, Iowa, 11 Jul 1950. Iowa Conserv. Comm. Div. Fish Game. Fish often do not leave their shelter until temperatures have increased to a daily maximum. Large chubs actively forage for 1‚Äì2 hr, then wait in their environment to feed on drift items. Reproduction Males increase reproductive success by migrating to a spawning area. The male then initiates building a spawning site to draw in females in the surrounding area. This most likely occurs in small pits with small pebbles to protect the area where eggs are laid. Once females enter, the male wraps around her pectoral fin and body, fertilization occurs, and the female leaves.Reighard, J. 1910. Methods of studying the habits of fishes, with an account of the breeding habits of the horned dace. Bull. U.S. Bur. Fish. 28(2):1111-1136 + figs. 1-5, pls. 114-120 Around 25-30 eggs are released each fertilization cycle. Often, these reproductive cycles occur in communal nesting sites, where the male controls the territory and protects it from intruders.Ross, M.R. 1976. Nest- entry behavior of female creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) in different habitats. Copeia 1976(2):378-380 During the breeding season, males grow small, keratin-based bumps, called tubercles, on their head, which are used in ritualized combat. This hardly ever gets dangerous or destructive, but it is used to ward off intruding males on communal nesting sites. Predation and management The creek chub is often preyed on by species ranging from birds to fish, such as loons, kingfishers, brown trout and northern pike.Hart, C.W., Jr., and S.L.H. Fuller. 1974. Pollution ecology of freshwater invertebrates. Academic Press, N.Y. 389 pp. Viruses infecting the creek chub have been documented to decrease this species' population. Additionally, the food of the creekchub is limited by other animals, such as trout and other chubs.Hubbs, C.L., and G.P. Cooper. 1936. Minnows of Michigan. Cranbrook Inst. Sci. Bull. No. 8. 95 pp. Managing creek chub has been recorded to work in small growing ponds. Providing the right conditions, with flowing water through the pond, gives the chub the necessary environment to survive.

He is best known as the co-founder, producer and former bass guitar player of KC and the Sunshine Band. Along with Harry Wayne Casey, he co-wrote six No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits.  Biography  Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Finch‚Äôs family moved to Hialeah, Florida, when he was an infant. His favorite group growing up was The Beatles. His musical tastes grew to include soul and country and western music. In his early teens, Finch got his first electric bass guitar and began to learn country music bass lines. He joined several country bands before joining the band Ball & Chain. Finch became interested in audio recording techniques and a schoolmate introduced him to the singer-songwriter Clarence Reid from TK Records. His high school attendance suffered as he spent every free moment at TK Records and eventually was hired as a part-time recording engineer for the label. Henry Stone and Clarence Reid introduced him to Harry Wayne Casey, three years his senior, who worked in the shipping department. Prior to his introduction to Casey, Finch had already established himself at TK as a skilled engineer, with over 127 singles recorded before the age of 17 (including various tracks for the Allman Brothers and Mother‚Äôs Finest). Within weeks of meeting, the Finch/Casey songwriting collaboration began, with their first hit songs recorded by Betty Wright and George McCrae (\\"Where Is the Love\\" and \\"Rock Your Baby\\"). Finch then assembled the future Sunshine Band members, utilizing his already-established friendships with TK session musicians, guitarist Jerome Smith and drummer Robert Johnson. The Finch-Casey collaboration produced numerous hits, including \\"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty\\", \\"Get Down Tonight\\", \\"Please Don't Go\\", \\"Boogie Shoes\\" and \\"I'm Your Boogie Man\\". Criminal conviction On March 23, 2010, Finch was arrested in Newark, Ohio, accused of having sexual contact with a 17-year-old male. Police stated that during an interview, he admitted to having sexual contact with that teen, and other teens aged 13 to 17. At his bond hearing on April 6, 2010, Finch entered a plea of not guilty to all charges. In December 2010, Finch pleaded 'no contest' and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. He served his sentence in Chillicothe Correctional Institution, a medium-security state prison in Ohio and was released on March 13, 2017. He currently lives in Heath, Ohio. Legacy Finch is a multi-Grammy Award winner and was nominated in the 2010 first round Grammy ballot as producer. He is the recipient of an American Music Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In October 2010, Finch became a nominee to the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

He was the son of a Scottish shipowner and spent his commercial life in the same field and as a director of shipbuilders, but fought in both World Wars during a long military career. He distinguished himself as the principal British liaison officer with the French Resistance during the Second World War in which he needed plastic surgery to disguise his appearance from the Germans; he was nicknamed the \\"Pimpernel of the Maquis\\". At the end of the Second World War he was elected as a Unionist Member of Parliament in Glasgow, and although the city was turning against his party he enjoyed a 14-year Parliamentary career. First World War service Hutchison's father, Thomas Holt Hutchison (1861-1918), was a shipowner and Glasgow magistrate\\"Quickening Pace In Glasgow\\", The Times, 21 June 1945, p. 4. who had a love of the sea and the shipping business; he was to pass on the same attitudes to his son.\\"Sir James Hutchison\\" (Obituary), The Times, 19 November 1979, p. 26. He was sent to Stanmore Park Preparatory School\\"The Times House of Commons, 1951\\", p. 191. followed by Harrow School for his education, followed by some study in France,\\"Who Was Who\\", A & C Black. before joining the family firm at the age of 19 in 1912. He was still learning the trade when the outbreak of the First World War led him to enlist in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry. Hutchison later transferred to the 17th Cavalry of the Indian Army, and served throughout the war. Hutchison kept up his connections with the Lanarkshire Yeomanry and three decades later was appointed as the regiment's honorary colonel. Business life On his return from the war, Hutchison resumed business life, where he rose to senior management positions. He was the representative of Glasgow to the Chamber of Shipping from 1933 to 1935,M. Stenton and S. Lees, \\"Who's Who of British MPs\\" vol. IV (Harvester Press, 1981), p. 184. and became chairman of the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, Hutchison and Craft Ltd, and Grampian Holdings, and also a Director of the Tayside Floorcloth Company Ltd. He was also an insurance broker. In 1928 Hutchison married Winefryde Craft, who bore him a son and a daughter (who predeceased her father). Second World War Although he was in his late 40s, Hutchison enlisted again at the start of the Second World War. In the early part of the war he served in France and North Africa, before joining the Staff. There he was appointed as the principal link between the British forces and the French section of the Special Operations Executive, the secretive and daring body who undertook sabotage operations behind enemy lines. French resistance Despite turning 50, Hutchison was instructed to go to France to continue liaison work with the French Resistance after the Normandy landings. However, the face of 'Colonel Hutchison' was well known to the Gestapo, who shot saboteurs after capture. He therefore went to London plastic surgeons to have his appearance disguised before going to France. When the surgery was complete, he was dropped by parachute in Normandy and resumed his work. So effective was Hutchison that he was nicknamed the \\"Pimpernel of the Maquis\\"; he was not captured during four months in France, and at the end of the war he received the Distinguished Service Order from the British. The French awarded him the Croix de Guerre and made him a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. MP for Glasgow Immediately on leaving the Army, Hutchison pitched into the political world as Conservative candidate in Glasgow Central. The previous election had seen a relatively narrow Conservative majority of 3,521, and was regarded as close enough to be a test of opinion among the Glasgow business community. Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill (who was somewhat late arriving) addressed a mass meeting at Blythswood Square in the division and received a warm reception from a large crowd.R.B. McCallum and Alison Readman, \\"The British General Election of 1945\\" (Oxford University Press, 1947), p. 168-169. In the circumstances of the election (where the Conservatives lost 180 seats), Hutchison did well to win by 1,516 although the swing in Glasgow was much less than elsewhere.\\"The Times House of Commons, 1945\\", p. 113. Without delay Hutchison made his maiden speech in the debate on the King's Speech, lauding the United Kingdom for leading the progress of the peoples of the world along the road of social improvement, and calling for a minimum wage and maximum working day to be imposed on the defeated nations.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 21 August 1945, p. 8.

Nicholas, \\"The British General Election of 1950\\" (Macmillan, 1951), p. 278-279.

The name is an abbreviation of Super Sport Kurz, German for \\"Super Sport Short\\", as it was a short wheelbase development of the Mercedes-Benz Modell S. The SSK's extreme performance and numerous competitive successes made it one of the most highly regarded sports cars of its era. Design and achievements The SSK was the last car designed for Mercedes-Benz by Ferdinand Porsche before he left to found his own company. The SSK is an evolution of the 1927 Modell S (S for Sport) which was based on the Modell K (K for \\"Kurzer Radstand\\" which means short wheelbase) variant of the Mercedes-Benz Typ 630. The SSK chassis was shorter than the Modell S to make the car even lighter and more agile for racing, especially short races and hillclimbs. Fitted with a supercharged single overhead camshaft 7-litre straight-6 engine producing and over of torque (depending on the state of tune), the SSK had a top speed of up to , making it the fastest car of its day. The supercharger on the SSK's engine was operated by a clutch that was engaged by fully depressing the throttle pedal and then giving the pedal an extra push. Backing off the throttle pedal disengaged the supercharger clutch. The SSK was driven to victory in numerous races, including in 1929 the 500 Miles of Argentina, the 1929 and 1930 Cordoba Grands Prix, the 1931 Argentine Grand Prix, and, in the hands of legendary Grand Prix racing driver Rudolf Caracciola, the 1929 Ulster Tourist Trophy race (Ards road circuit), the 1930 Irish Grand Prix, the 1931 German Grand Prix, and the 1931 Mille Miglia. The S/SS/SSK line was one of the nominees in the penultimate round of voting for the Car of the Century award in 1999, as chosen by a panel of 132 motoring journalists and a public internet vote. Authenticity and value Fewer than 40 SSKs were built during its production span, of which about half were sold as Rennwagen (racing cars). Many were crashed while racing and subsequently cannibalised for parts. Only four or five entirely original models remain, and their scarcity and rich heritage make them among the most sought after cars in the world; a 1929 model was auctioned at Bonhams in Chichester in September 2004 for ¬£4.17 million (US$7.4 million), making it the second most expensive automobile ever sold at that time. Another SSK, a streamlined \\"Count Trossi\\"‚Äìbodied version (see photo) owned and restored by fashion designer Ralph Lauren, has won best of show at both the 1993 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and the 2007 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este.  In popular culture  The car is a favorite of the manga and cartoon character Lupin III, appearing throughout the enteriety of the first and second anime series along with movies and specials. The car has also appeared in the video game Forza Horizon 4 as DLC.

The station is intended to serve the Green Park business area and the Madejski Stadium, as well as the proposed Green Park Village residential development. It is planned to be on the Reading to Basingstoke Line, south of Southcote Junction. The station, which has planning permission from Reading Borough Council and funding in place from the Government, was set to open in 2020 but its completion is expected to delayed by the coronavirus pandemic Proposals Plans were announced in July 2007 and approved by the Office of Rail Regulation in March 2009. Building was originally expected to begin in early 2009, and be completed in early 2010. However, by late November 2010 building had not begun. Submissions were made to extend the planning permission for the station, which were due to expire in late 2010 and early 2011. It was reported that the extended applications for planning consent contain a clause which, if approved, would ensure the developer of Green Park Village pays a premium of ¬£4.26 million to find an alternative developer for the station if work has not begun on it within two years. The station is expected to be served by stopping services operated by Great Western Railway between Reading and Basingstoke, with an expected frequency of two trains per hour in each direction. Additional services are expected to be provided on match days. The proposed station has two 5-car long canopied platforms and an interchange with the existing Green Park Park and Ride bus system. =Suspension= On 27 October 2011 the owners of the business park, Prupim, announced that plans for the station had been suspended after a local housing development project had been scaled down. =Resumption= On 3 December 2013 Reading Borough Council stated that it would re-submit planning proposals for the station in 2014. It was reported on 9 July 2014 that a ¬£17 million Government investment in road and rail projects in Berkshire will include a sum for the station, enabling building work to start in 2015‚Äì16. In November 2014 the total investment was cited as ¬£21.4 million, and that the station would cost ¬£6.4 million. In March 2015 this cost was revised to ¬£8 million in planning submissions to Reading Borough Council. The first ¬£6.4 million would be met by the local enterprise partnership and the remaining ¬£1.6 million covered by Reading Borough Council. On 29 April 2015 the council's planning committee renewed planning permission for the station. It was planned to open in 2018, which should have coincided with electrification of the Reading ‚Äì Basingstoke Line and introduction of new or refurbished trains. However, the electrification of the line is now not due to be started until after 2019. The station is planned to be built in four phases, with its facilities expanding as the business park and residential development are built. Each phase will be built only when there is the required funding or demand. Phase One will provide a station with two platforms, each long enough for a five- coach train, platform canopies and a footbridge. There will be an access road and shared cycle and footway to the station. The station will have two bus bays, a cycle hire hub and cycle parking with an unspecified number of spaces. Phase Two would add a separate footpath to segregate pedestrians from cyclists, as well as a rank for five taxis, and increase the number of bus bays from two to three. Phase Three would add another section of access road, increase the number of bus bays to six and add a ground-level car park with 103 spaces. If enough funds were forthcoming soon enough, the project could proceed straight from Phase One to Phase Three. Phase Four would add a 200-space four-storey car park and reduce the ground level car park to 42 spaces. In July 2016 the Berkshire Local Transport Body (BLTB) awarded an additional ¬£3m to the initial ¬£6.4m contract for Green Park Station after a review concluded \\"a significant increase in the forecast passenger demand for the station in comparison to the calculations undertaken in 2013\\". The additional funding would be for additional shelters and improved ticketing facilities. The Department for Transport confirmed in July 2017 that Reading Green Park station would receive ¬£2.3m towards a total project cost of ¬£16.5m. The station was originally due for opening in May 2020 and then brought forward to Summer 2019; but was then set to open by the end of 2020, before being delayed by the coronavirus pandemic until an unspecified future date. Proposed service Great Western Railway ‚Äî local trains would serve the station. There are generally two trains per hour in each direction on weekdays and Saturdays, and one train per hour on Sundays. The proposed service was discussed at a meeting of Reading Borough Council's strategic environment, planning and transport committee on 24 November 2015. Concern was expressed that delay to the electrification of the railway line between Southcote Junction and Basingstoke could adversely affect the proposed train service.Reading Chronicle, 26 November 2015, page 19 ReferencesSources * Category:Proposed railway stations in England ","title":"Reading Green Park railway station"},{"id":"15032822","text":"Elliot Silverstein (born August 3, 1927, in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American director, who is best known for being the director of the movie Cat Ballou (1965).

He is also known for his contributions to the evaluation and support of patient quality of life. He has been Professor of Surgery in King's College London, the Royal Marsden Hospital and UCL. He is a notable critic of alternative medicine. In 2007, Baum received the St Gallen lifetime achievement award for the treatment of breast cancer. Baum's team was the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of adjuvant tamoxifen for early breast cancer, which has contributed to the 30 per cent reduction in breast cancer mortality and its efficacy in the prevention of breast cancer in susceptible women. Since then, while at UCL, he was responsible for the largest-ever international cancer trial (ATAC - Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination), which in record time showed anastrozole to be better than tamoxifen. Baum was active in the successful campaign to retain the Royal Marsden's site at Fulham in central London.

On 3 September 1783, representatives of King George III of Great Britain signed a treaty in Paris with representatives of the United States of America‚Äîcommonly known as the Treaty of Paris (1783)‚Äîand two treaties at Versailles with representatives of King Louis XVI of France and King Charles III of Spain‚Äîcommonly known as the Treaties of Versailles (1783). The previous day, a preliminary treaty had been signed with representatives of the States General of the Dutch Republic, but the final treaty which ended the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War was not signed until 20 May 1784; for convenience, however, it is included in the summaries below. The treaty dictated that the British would lose their Thirteen Colonies and also marked the end of the First British Empire. The United States gained more than it expected, thanks to the award of western territory.Richard Morris, The Peacemakers: The Great Powers and American Independence (1983) The other Allies had mixed-to-poor results. France got its revenge over Britain after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, but its material gains were minor (Tobago, Senegal and small territories in India) and its financial losses huge. It was already in financial trouble and its borrowing to pay for the war used up all its credit and created the financial disasters that marked the 1780s. Historians link those disasters to the coming of the French Revolution. The Dutch did not gain anything of significant value at the end of the war. The Spanish had a mixed result; they regained Menorca and Florida, but Gibraltar remained in British hands.Lawrence S. Kaplan, \\"The Treaty of Paris, 1783: A Historiographical Challenge,\\" International History Review, Sept 1983, Vol. 5 Issue 3, pp 431‚Äì442  The path to negotiation  News of the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown reached Britain late in November 1781, shortly before Parliament was due to debate the military spending estimates for the following year. The hastily revised plan was that forces in America were to be retained at their existing level, but the policy of \\"offensive\\" war and long campaigns away from well-supplied strongholds (which had also led to the Saratoga defeat four years earlier) was to be abandoned in favour of a new approach, details of which had to remain secret. The budget was passed by a large majority, but a few days later news was received that the British fleet in the Bay of Biscay had been able to capture only a fraction of a very large French fleet, carrying troops for invasions of British colonies around the world. Parliament immediately ordered an inquiry into the administration of the Royal Navy, to be held after the Christmas recess. At the beginning of January, it was learned that French forces had begun capturing small British-held islands in the West Indies even without the help of the new fleet (which had been driven back to France by storms), so a large British fleet was sent westwards as soon as possible. Also in that month, the government appointed a new commander for the American forces, General Carleton who had defeated the American invasion of Canada in the early phase of the war, and the Colonial Secretary, Lord George Germain, was replaced by the hawkish Welbore Ellis. The inquiry into Navy administration was followed by a Parliamentary vote on 20 February in which the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Sandwich, narrowly escaped dismissal. The following week, Parliament voted for a guarantee of the \\"no offensive war\\" claim made the previous autumn, on the grounds that increased military commitment to America would, among other things, be \\"the means of weakening the efforts of this country against her European enemies\\". On 27 February 1782, the House voted against further war in America, by 19 votes. At the beginning of March news arrived which absolutely confirmed the wisdom of this position ‚Äî the loss of two more West Indian islands in January (with a third seemingly at the mercy of the French navy), and of the Mediterranean base on Menorca in February. The opposition in Parliament then began tabling motions alleging that Great Britain had no confidence in its government; the first of these was rejected by just 10 votes, another a week later by 9 votes. Hours before yet another such vote was due, on 20 March, the government leader, Lord North, persuaded the King to accept his resignation (this set a precedent that successful Parliamentary votes of \\"no confidence\\" would automatically force a Prime Minister to resign). The King's choice as replacement, Lord Shelburne (who, though an old friend of Benjamin Franklin, had initially stated in February that he \\"would never consent, under any possible given circumstances, to acknowledge the independency of America\\") refused the post, leading to the formation of a strange new government team, nominally led by Lord Rockingham, whom the King hated, with Shelburne and Charles James Fox, who hated each other, as Secretaries of State.Lucas, Reginald J. \\"Lord North\\", London, Humphreys (1913)  The negotiation process = Establishing ground rules = Rockingham's team recognised that their priority was to get Britain out of its four linked wars, and that time might be short‚Äîwithin days of his appointment, news came from the West Indies that three more British islands had been captured by the French. Therefore, the decision was made to build on the \\"no offensive war\\" policy and begin peace talks with the Americans. Three factors made this the logical approach: first, the stated aim of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance between the United States and France was specifically to maintain the independence of the United States. Second, for well over a year, informal discussions had been held with Henry Laurens, an American envoy captured on his way to Amsterdam. On 31 December 1781 Laurens had been released on parole, and now he was offered the chance to help begin negotiations. Third, on hearing of Lord North's resignation, Benjamin Franklin immediately wrote from Paris, making it clear that the Americans were ready to begin talking. However, Laurens, Franklin, and John Adams (then representing America in the Dutch Republic) all made it clear to the British that America could not, under the 1778 alliance treaty, make peace without French agreement. What none of them knew was that France, under its completely separate treaty of alliance with Spain, could not make peace without Spanish agreement; indeed, not without a guarantee that the British stronghold of Gibraltar, commanding the narrow entrance to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean, would be handed over to Spain. Spanish and French forces had been besieging Gibraltar for nearly three years without success, so it was likely that they would have to negotiate with Britain to exchange it for some other territory, perhaps some of the captured West Indian islands. For Britain that would be a tough decision‚Äîalthough the West Indies produced vast profits, holding Gibraltar allowed unhindered sea trade with all the Mediterranean countries. The British government decided to resist accepting American independence as a precondition for negotiation, as they were aware that the French government was nearly bankrupt, and that the British reinforcements sent to the West Indies might well reverse the situation there at any moment (the fleet was commanded by Admiral Rodney, who had returned to England from the Caribbean on sick-leave just before the French fleet there sailed north to blockade Yorktown; he also faced numerous expensive lawsuits over his looting of the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius‚Äîin short, a glorious victory was his only option). The British negotiator sent to Paris was Richard Oswald, an old slave-trading partner of Henry Laurens, who had been one of his visitors in the Tower of London. His first talks with Franklin led to a proposal that Britain should hand over Canada to the Americans. On 23 April, Lord Shelburne, without specifically referring to the terms of that proposal, which he kept a secret from nearly all his colleagues, replied with an offer to accept full American independence, but on the existing borders. A second British envoy, Thomas Grenville (unaware of the Canada suggestion), was now sent to begin talks with the French government, based on this proposal. He indicated that the French could help to secure American independence, their avowed reason for entering the war back in 1778, by offering to return the British possessions they had captured in the West Indies, but the French rejected this, and separated their own peace demands from America's. That did indeed violate the spirit of their 1778 treaty of alliance with America, and fundamentally affected the future of the negotiations. Another factor which gave added power to the Americans was the decision on 19 April of the Dutch Republic (otherwise known as the United Provinces of the Netherlands, its 200-year-old federal government structure being a model from which the United States would learn) to recognise John Adams as the ambassador of an independent country. This led swiftly to the offer of a much-needed loan from the Netherlands, following which Adams went to Paris to join the impending peace negotiations.Fiske, John The Critical Period of American History 1783‚Äì1789 Boston, Houghton Mifflin (1896), via unimelb.edu.au‚Äî accessed 2008-01-11 = British government changes again = On 18 May, the decision to keep full independence as a point for negotiation was vindicated by the arrival in Europe of news that, over a month previously, Admiral Rodney had gained the victory over the French in the Caribbean, which he and Britain so desperately needed, capturing the French Admiral de Grasse. Grenville was sent back to France to negotiate with both the Americans and the French, but found himself making little progress with either‚Äîonly when Oswald told him about the Canada proposal did he begin to understand why, and he wrote an indignant letter to Charles Fox, who was no happier about what his hated rival Shelburne was doing. Having exposed the trickery to his colleagues, at the end of June Fox proposed a vote that the independence of the United States should be accepted without preconditions, but in the light of Rodney's victory and the consequent French weakness, this was rejected (though the news that a combined Spanish and American fleet had forced the surrender to Spain of the Bahamas arrived in Britain at about this time). On 1 July Lord Rockingham, the figurehead leader of the government, died, so Shelburne was forced to take over, which led to the resignation of Fox and a massive split in the anti-war Whig party in Parliament. Regardless of this, the remainder of the negotiations would be carried out under Shelburne's devious leadership. For example, he took advantage of the great delay in trans-Atlantic communication to send a letter to George Washington stating that Britain was accepting American independence without preconditions, while not authorising Richard Oswald to make any such promise when he returned to Paris to negotiate with Franklin and his colleagues (John Jay had by this time returned from Spain). = Diplomatic manoeuvres = While the British were busy trying to stabilise their second new government of the year, Franklin neutralised what could have been France's biggest weapon against the United States‚Äîthe vagueness of the repayment terms for the loans the French had been making to the Americans every few months since 1778. These totalled 18,000,000 livres (equivalent to over 2.5 million Spanish dollars‚Äîthe preferred hard currency in America) plus an additional 10,000,000 livres (nearly 1.5 million dollars) which had been borrowed from the Dutch by the King of France on America's behalf in 1781 when no international lender would loan anything directly to the Americans. By a contract dated 16 July 1782, America was to pay this money back on very favourable terms, with no payments due at all until three years after peace was finalised (a stipulation which would lead fairly directly to the next great milestone in American history, the Constitution of 1787). The French too played their diplomatic cards with some skill. While preparing to aid the Spanish forces in a massive assault on the fortress at Gibraltar, they stalled for time by insisting on American independence as a precondition for negotiation. They also sent a secret envoy to speak directly with Shelburne in England, for there were some matters on which they were seriously opposed to the Americans. The most notable of these was the rich Newfoundland fishery, one of the main factors which had drawn the French across the Atlantic over 250 years earlier, and which they had managed to retain as a concession when the British took Canada in 1763. As British colonists, the Americans had rights to fish in these waters, but as the United States they would have no legal right to fish there unless it could be written into the peace treaty. For Britain, the logical course would be to make France give its rights to the Americans. The Americans also wanted fishing rights in the Gulf of Mexico, to which again they had previously been entitled thanks to the British colonies in Florida (now partly controlled by Spain). The French and Spanish negotiators were also concerned about the American insistence on the Mississippi River as a western border; the existing area of the thirteen States was already about as large as France and Spain combined, and the proposed border would double that. In particular Spain's territories in Louisiana (New France) (and the newly reconquered West Florida) would be severely threatened if the American trend of economic growth based on expanded land holdings continued. The situation of the American Indians in these lands was noted, but for practical purposes ignored because they could not significantly defend themselves. In their opposition to this expansion, ironically, the French and Spanish governments were effectively supporting the British on one of the points which had begun the move towards revolution in the 1760s‚Äîthe use of military forces (paid for by taxes) to maintain a clear border between the colonies and the American Indian lands west of the Appalachians. Meanwhile, the American case was strengthened by the charters of the earliest colonies, which specified, in deliberate disregard of the claims of other nations, that they could expand from the east coast of America to the west coast.Warren, Mercy O. The Rise, Progress and Termination of the American Revolution (vol. 3, chap. 26) , Boston MA, Larkin (1805), via samizdat.com‚Äî accessed 2008-01-11 = Anglo-American understanding = Franklin became ill with gout towards the end of summer, but when John Jay learned in September of the secret French mission to England, and the French position on the fisheries, he sent a message to Shelburne himself, explaining in some detail why he should avoid being influenced too much by the French and Spanish. At the same time Richard Oswald was asking if the terms of his commission to negotiate with the Americans could be slightly reworded to acknowledge that the 13 so-called colonies referred to themselves as \\"United States\\", and about 24 September, the Americans received word that this had been done. This was one of the best-timed British moves of the whole war. From 20 September, reports of the great French and Spanish assault on Gibraltar began to reach Paris; all were negative, and by 27 September it was clear that the operation, involving more troops than had ever been in service at one time on the entire North American continent, had been a horrific disaster. The French had done all they could to help the Spanish achieve their essential war aim, and began serious discussions on alternative exit strategies, urging Spain to offer Britain some very large concessions in return for Gibraltar. Nonetheless, the fortress remained under siege.Jay, William The Life of John Jay New York New York, Harper (1833), via Google Books‚Äî accessed 2008-01-09 In Paris, the British and American negotiators left the French and Spanish to argue between themselves, but John Adams was also still negotiating actively with the Dutch Republic, and on 8 October, the United Provinces and the United States signed a full treaty of amity and commerce. By this time the American envoys were aware of the letter to George Washington, so independence was taken as a done deal, and discussions concentrated on the details. Remarkably, Britain accepted the American demand that the boundary with Canada should revert to its state after the Seven Years' War in 1763, not the revision of the Quebec Act in 1774. The difference between the two was the whole area east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio River‚Äîthe Northwest Territory, from which five-and-a-half new States would later emerge. John Adams can claim credit for smoothing the peace talks by separating the issues of personal debts and war reparations. The latter were a particular problem for the British, because as early as 1775 Loyalists in some parts of the then-colonies had been forced into exile by local statutes imposing an \\"Army Test\\"‚Äînearly all males of suitable age had to join the local militia, which, as had become clear in the first battles of the Revolution, would be expected to fight against the forces of the legal ruler, King George III. Possessions these law-abiding people could not take with them had quickly been confiscated and sold off. It was equally clear that those who had stayed in America and fought for their legitimate sovereign would be even more heavily penalised unless safeguards could be built into the treaty. Franklin countered this argument by suggesting that reparations could be demanded for the massive destruction of American property by British forces, which had been a very deliberate policy in the later stages of the war, and for the \\"kidnap\\" of tens of thousands of valuable slaves (who had roughly the same consideration in these negotiations as the American Indians); besides which, the confiscations of Loyalist property had been made by individual State governments, not the Congress. French negotiator the Comte de Vergennes intervened in this discussion on the British side, but the result was a messy compromise, in which Congress was instructed merely to urge the State governments to make reparations to the Loyalists. = Peace with the United States = In the Caribbean at this time, the British were not using their fleet to recapture islands which would then have to be defended, but concentrating on holding the few that remained. The same principle applied everywhere, and in September 1782, the Royal Navy had sent a large supply convoy to Gibraltar on the assumption that by the time it arrived, either the fortress would have been conquered, or the great assault would have been repelled and the siege weakened. The convoy was protected by 33 of the Navy's biggest ships, and on 10 October, as hoped, unloading of supplies at Gibraltar began. A large combined French and Spanish fleet hovered nearby, so on 20 October the British fleet, without seriously engaging for battle, lured them away. News that Gibraltar was fully resupplied, with no problems for the convoy, reached London on 7 November, and probably reached Paris about the same time. The objections of Spain ceased to be of any relevance, and the French accepted the preliminary peace treaty between Great Britain and the United States, on 30 November, with protests but no action. = Peace with France and Spain = Over the next few weeks, serious negotiations began between Britain, France and Spain (for which Britain's chief negotiator was Alleyne Fitzherbert, and Spain's the Count of Aranda). Although a French naval expedition had destroyed British trading posts in Hudson Bay during the summer, no territory had actually been captured. From time to time, news would arrive from India of continuing stalemate, both in the land wars (which involved the French only as supporters to local rulers) and in naval battles; the British still appeared to hold all the French territory there that they had captured in 1778‚Äì79, while the French held no British territory. In the West Indies, on the other hand, the French still held all the territory they had captured, while the British held only one French island, St. Lucia. The Spanish held West Florida, the Bahamas and Menorca, and they were still maintaining an increasingly futile siege of Gibraltar. An attempt to exchange Puerto Rico for Gibraltar collapsed, probably because it would have brought too much competition for Jamaican products into the protected British market. In the preliminary treaties signed with France and Spain on 20 January 1783, France and Britain therefore returned to each other nearly all the territories they had taken from each other since 1778, except for Tobago, which the French had captured in 1781 and were allowed to keep. France also gained some territory around the Senegal River in Africa which it had lost to Britain in 1763. The whole arrangement for fishing around the Newfoundland coast had to be renegotiated because of the rights awarded to the Americans. The Spanish did much better. They did not have to hand back West Florida or Menorca, and were also given East Florida in exchange for the Bahamas (so tens of thousands of refugees who had fled to East Florida from the United States had to move again). Both East Florida and part of West Florida had been Spanish possessions before 1763, so the 1783 treaty did not specify boundaries, allowing the Spanish to claim that the 1763 boundaries still applied (the remainder of West Florida had been part of French Louisiana before 1763, and the rest of Louisiana had then been handed over to Spain). The opportunity was taken to resolve long-standing disputes about logwood cutting in Central America. The British, however, continued to hold Gibraltar after the siege was abandoned. Although France was an ally of both the United States and Spain, Spain was not an ally of the United States, though an informal alliance had existed since at least 1776 between the Americans and Bernardo de G√°lvez, Spanish governor of Louisiana, one of the most successful leaders in the war. Spain's economy depended almost entirely on its colonial empire in the Americas, and a successful revolt by subjects of another colonial empire could set a ruinous example. In fact, there had been a series of three rebellions by native South Americans against Spain between 1777 and 1781, led by Tom√°s Katari, Tupac Amaru II, and Julian Apasa (who adopted the name Tupac Katari)‚Äîall had been crushed with utter ruthlessness. With such considerations in mind, Spain continually thwarted John Jay's attempts to establish diplomatic relations during his long assignments in Madrid, and was the last participant in the American Revolutionary War to acknowledge the independence of the United States, a fortnight after the preliminary peace treaty with Britain, on 3 February 1783. = Peace with the Dutch republic = The Dutch had never captured anything from the British, and only French military action had saved them from losing virtually all their colonies. They could exercise no leverage over Britain, Spain, France or the United States in the peace negotiations, and did not make a preliminary treaty until 2 September 1783, the day before the other three treaties were formalised. Britain agreed to return nearly all Dutch possessions captured in the East Indies (the most important of which, Trincomalee on Ceylon, had already been retaken by the French anyway) but kept Negapatnam on the Indian coast. In a major concession Britain also secured free trade rights in parts of the Dutch East Indies.  Sealing the deal  The terms of the peace, particularly the proposed treaty with the United States, caused a political storm in Britain. The concession of the Northwest Territory and the Newfoundland fisheries, and especially the apparent abandonment of Loyalists by an Article which the individual States would inevitably ignore, were condemned in Parliament. The last point was the easiest solved‚ÄîBritish tax revenue saved by not continuing the war would be used to compensate Loyalists. Nevertheless, on 17 February 1783 and again on 21 February, motions against the treaty were successful in Parliament, so on 24 February Lord Shelburne resigned, and for five weeks the British government was without a leader. Finally, a solution similar to the previous year's choice of Lord Rockingham was found. The government was to be led, nominally, by the Duke of Portland, while the two Secretaries of State were to be Charles Fox and, remarkably, Lord North. Richard Oswald was replaced by a new negotiator, David Hartley, but the Americans refused to allow any modifications to the treaty‚Äîpartly because they would have to be approved by Congress, which, with two Atlantic crossings, would take several months. Therefore, on 3 September 1783, at Hartley's hotel in Paris, the treaty as agreed by Richard Oswald the previous November was formally signed, and at Versailles the separate treaties with France and Spain were also formalized.  Treaty with the United States of America  Based on preliminary articles made 30 November 1782, and approved by the Congress of the Confederation on 15 April 1783, this treaty was signed on 3 September 1783, and ratified by Congress on 14 January 1784, formally ending the American Revolutionary War.

He is best known today for his portrayal of the character Lamont Cranston in The Shadow films in addition to his leading role in the successful serials Spy Smasher and Brick Bradford. Early years Richmond was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Pearlie Watkins Bowditch and Mary Elizabeth (Waters) Bowditch. He had a sister, Marie, and a brother, Russell. He attended St. Thomas College and the University of Minnesota, playing football at both schools. He moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s to pursue a career in acting.  Film  Before becoming an actor, Richmond (then still known as Fred Bowditch) was a film salesman. In its entry on Richmond, The Film Encyclopedia relates: \\"[H]e was on a business trip to Hollywood when a Universal executive asked him to test for the lead in The Leather Pushers two-reel action series. He got the part and went on to appear in many other films through the late 40s.\\"Katz, Ephraim (1979). The Film Encyclopedia: The Most Comprehensive Encyclopedia of World Cinema in a Single Volume. Perigee Books. . Pp. 972‚Äì973. He received his first film roles in 1929, appearing in Song of Love, followed by Their Own Desire, both of which were uncredited. In 1930 he had two more uncredited roles, then landed the lead role in the boxing serial The Leather Pushers, an 11-film series that ran into 1931. Richmond did all of the fight scenes in the serial himself and suffered a broken nose (twice) and a broken ankle as a result. From the remainder of 1931 through 1939 Richmond appeared in fifty films, many of which were cliffhangers, serials, and B-movies. In The Devil Tiger (1934), Director Clyde E. Elliott allowed his star, Richmond, to fight a 25-foot python. Richmond hated doubles and had insisted on playing the scene himself. The actor succeeded in holding the snake's snapping mouth away from his face while struggling to free himself from the triple coils around his body. At the height of the struggle, the heroine, Marion Burns, runs in and saves the hero from the python. Burns had to fight the snake too, in order to get at Richmond's pistol, with which she was supposed to shoot the python. In the serial Spy Smasher for Republic Studios Richmond played not only the title character, but his twin brother (a character not present in the comic book). Richmond appeared in several Charlie Chan films, and in 1940 landed a main supporting role in Knute Rockne All American, which starred Pat O'Brien, Gale Page, and Ronald Reagan. From 1940 through 1946 he appeared in thirty films, including his best known roles today, three films in The Shadow series, starring opposite Barbara Read. Following these films, his movie career declined considerably, with only three film roles in 1947 and 1948. During the 1950s and 1960s he appeared on several television series' until 1966 when he retired. Richmond was residing in Corona Del Mar, California, at the time of his death at the age of 66. Personal life Richmond was married in 1934 to actress Marion Burns. The marriage lasted until his death. They had 2 children.

It was instituted on 2 August 1939 and was given to those who designed and built the fortifications on Germany's western borders, known as the Westwall or, in English, the Siegfried Line, between 15 June 1938 to 31 March 1939. On 13 November 1939 eligibility was extended to include servicemen of the Wehrmacht who served on the Westwall for at least ten weeks. In all 622,064 medals were awarded until 31 January 1941, when awards of the medal ceased. In 1944, after the allied invasion, the medal was re-instituted and awarded to those who renovated and strengthened the fortifications on the western borders. This version of the medal was commonly known as the \\"Defence Wall Honor Award\\", to distinguish the decoration from its 1939 counterpart. It was awarded to over 800,000 men in total by the end of the war.  Background  The original proposal, in January 1939, had been for the award of a non-wearable medallion bearing the obverse inscription: \\"Dem Arbeiter zur Ehr; Der Heimat zur Wehr\\" (To the Worker, Honor; The Homeland, Defense) with the recipient's name engraved on the reverse. This version was never issued. After the outbreak of war in 1939, Fritz Todt, founder of the Organization Todt which helped build the wall, claimed that the medal could be worn with \\"the same right and the same pride\\" as military decorations such as the Iron Cross. However, in view of the large numbers awarded, many recipients disparagingly referred to it as the 'Order of Clay' (Lehmorden).  Description  The medal was awarded in one class. It was struck in bronze. Its oval shape featured on the obverse (from bottom to top) a bunker, a crossed sword and shovel, and the German Eagle. The reverse bore the inscription \\"F√ºr Arbeit zum Schutze Deutschlands\\" (For Work in the Defence of Germany). Both sides of the medal were edged with a wreath of oak leaves. The medal was designed by Professor Richard Klein of Munich. The ribbon is golden brown with a white stripe towards each edge. On 10 October 1944 a second production run was authorized to reward the workers and military personnel strengthening the Siegfried line. This version of the medal was made of a bronzed zinc. A bar with the date \\"1944\\" was authorized for those who already held the 1939 version, but it was never mass-produced.

All characters were introduced by executive producer Diederick Santer. Santer introduced four characters in January, Mr Lister, a new market inspector; Christian Clarke, the brother of Jane Beale and two members of the Branning family, Selina and Penny. In March, he introduced Jalil Iqbal, a new love interest for Shabnam Masood and in April he introduced Ricky Butcher's fianc√©e, Melinda as well as Bianca Jackson's children, Whitney, Morgan and Tiffany. Also in April he introduced Denise Fox's ex-husband, Lucas Johnson, and Opal Smith, the aunt of Gus and Juley Smith. In May he extended the Johnson family and introduced Lucas's son, Jordan as well as introducing Brenda Boyle, a new love interest for Charlie Slater. In July, he introduced two members of the long-established Mitchell family, Archie Mitchell and Danielle Jones. In August, he introduced Callum Monks, the son of Vinnie and in September, Tony King, arrived as the partner of Bianca, and Poppy Merritt, the new GP of Walford. November saw the only birth of the year, Amy Mitchell, the child of Roxy Mitchell and Jack Branning. The final introduction of the year was Dotty, Nick Cotton's daughter. Mr Lister Robert \\"Bob\\" Lister, usually referred to as Mr Lister, played by Nick Wilton, is the market inspector at Bridge Street market, the successor of Marie Matthews (Susan Cruse). He makes his first appearance on 3 January 2008, but his first name is not revealed until 7 June 2013, his last appearance for three years. Wilton reprised the role in 2016 for one episode broadcast on 15 August. The character was reintroduced for a story with Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) in July 2017, and again in December 2017. He then appears in one episode, broadcast in July 2018. The character returns again for one episode, broadcast on 7 January 2020. In his first appearance, Lister sacks his assistant, Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements). He appears on a recurring basis thereafter, his next appearance being when Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel) seeks approval for a new stall, which Lister accepts. In August 2008, Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) gets a job as the market cleaner but Lister sacks him when he loses his cart. In October 2008, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) phones him because Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) is selling stolen nightwear on the clothes stall. In May 2009, Lister closes down Stacey Slater's (Lacey Turner) stall and in September that year, he closes it again and gives it to Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott). In February 2010, Stacey and her friend Becca Swanson (Simone James) decide to set up a stall but Lister turns them down as he does not like Stacey. Becca dresses up and pretends to be from Walford Council and tells Lister that Stacey has lodged a complaint against him and makes legal threats. Lister then gives Stacey her stall. In April 2010, Lister is seen investigating Fatboy's (Ricky Norwood) van, as Fatboy is trying to sell T-shirts from the vehicle without a market license. In May 2010, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) asks Lister if he can start a market stall, and Lister suggests a mobile phone stall, whilst having a drink with Syed, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) refuses to serve Syed, Lister interprets this as racism. In October 2010, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) squirts water at him, so he orders Stacey to discipline or sack Kat, but Stacey refuses and squirts him as well, so he revokes Stacey's market traders' licence. In March 2011, Lister offers Fatboy a month's trial on his own stall after Fatboy and Mo Harris (Laila Morse) argue over it. In April 2011, he complains to Billy that his stall is in the wrong position, but Billy says nobody cares. Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) asks for her stall back, and they get chatting. He moans about his life as he gets abused by stallholders regularly, and his wife has left him so he rarely sees his two children. He then invites Whitney for a drink and comforts her saying that her stepfather, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), is doing what is best for her. Lister gets up to leave but falls onto Whitney, so Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) threatens him and calls him a pervert. In May, Denise Fox (Diane Parish) asks Lister to get involved with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) but Lister says he has no say over the shop, which Patrick owns. In June, Whitney and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) ask Lister for a stall, but he is reluctant as Whitney lost a stall for not paying her rent. However, he agrees as long as the owed rent is paid and a month's rent is paid in advance. In July, Lister issues Fatboy with a warning for kicking his own stall, but Fatboy decides to abandon his stall before he can be disciplined. He warns Eddie Moon (David Essex) about flytipping, and is threatened by Eddie's son Tyler (Tony Discipline). Lister later accepts a bribe from Eddie. In November, Lister appears following reports that someone is selling Dutch Father Christmas toys, and asks Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) if he knows anything. Alfie denies this, although it is his relatives Tyler and Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskis) who have done it. Anthony asks Fatboy to change them so they no longer speak Dutch, and when Lister sees Fatboy with one, it plays a jingle in Fatboy's voice. In April 2012, Lister complains to Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) that the rubbish from the caf√© is overspilling into the market, so she angrily empties the rubbish into the street. A few days later, Bianca attempts to steal a handbag belonging to a market seller. She is caught and in the struggle, Lister is injured after Bianca hits him. He calls the police, resulting in Bianca's arrest and imprisonment. It later emerges that he has taken out a restraining order against Bianca, meaning that she cannot go to the market or Bridge Street. In September, Lister threatens to call the police on Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who is lying drunk in the street. Later that month, he reprimands Syed for not selling his usual stock. In November, Lister accuses Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) of stealing a bag that he donated to the charity shop she manages. This leads to Cora being fired. Lister goes to the salon for a haircut, where Bianca gives him a shampoo. It is awkward at first, but then they start to bond when they talk about their children, as Lister's daughter is getting married and he thinks he will feel left out at the wedding. Lister agrees to have the restraining order dropped and gives Bianca a ¬£5 tip, accidentally leaving ¬£20 behind. He later accuses Bianca of stealing it, but when it is found, he apologises and gives her the money. In April 2013 Lister temporarily bans Bianca and Kat from trading on the market after they play various pranks on him. Kat pretends to seduce Lister and Bianca takes a photo of him with his trousers down, which they use to blackmail him to get their stall back. In June, Lister speaks to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) about his new restaurant and introduces him to Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy). Ian hopes that Danny will find someone to invest in his new business. After Lister loses his job, he is replaced by Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling). after apparently being given a promotion from the council. In August 2016, Mr Lister interviews Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) for the market inspector position. In July 2017, Mr Lister has a meeting with new Market Inspector Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) to discuss 'big changes' to the market and orders Robbie that he has until Christmas to eject Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) from the market. =Development= In April 2013, when Bianca and Kat puts a note on Lister's back saying \\"prat\\", Heat said, \\"we know Lister is a prat, and a pompous one at that, but you were never going to get away with it.\\" Wilton confirmed his departure on his website, adding that he was unable to film Lister's departure scenes as planned, due to pantomime commitments. Wilton said, \\"I originally went into the soap for three episodes that went out in January 2008, and ended up staying for 6 years, during which time I met some lovely people, had a lot of fun and a few really good storylines\\". Christian Clarke Christian Clarke, played by John Partridge, is introduced to the show as a new gay character and the brother of Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) as the show's bosses had seen how popular Antony Cotton was in the role of Sean Tully in Coronation Street. However, Partridge's character is not as camp as Cotton's, and is described as \\"very suave and a real charmer\\" and a \\"savvy, bright character [who is] very fun.\\" He made his first appearance on 17 January 2008. His main storyline is having an affair with Muslim character Syed Masood (Marc Elliott), while Syed is engaged to Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas). Ashley Jennings Ashley Jennings played by Tony Boncza, is the fianc√© of Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who appeared in the episode broadcast on 17 January 2008. He was described by Soaplife as Christian's rich \\"sugar daddy\\". In the episode, Ashley and Christian have a meal with Christian's sister Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) and her husband Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ashley leaves the meal early after Christian reveals that he was in love with Jane's ex-husband David Collins (Dan Milne). He and Christian break up, and Christian moves in with the Beales. Tegs Teague \\"Tegs\\" Teague, played by Ben Smith, is the main leader of a gang called the 'E20'. He appears between 17 and 22 January 2008 along with the rest of the gang. The gang harass Dot Branning (June Brown) by wolf-whistling at her and calling her a \\"zombie\\". Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) sees them and tells them to leave her alone. The gang, including Tegs' friend Ziggy (Ashley Horne), steal DVDs from Winston's (Ulric Browne) market stall with the help of Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). Tegs asks Jay if he wants to join the gang and gives him a mobile phone so they can call each other. Jay later sneaks out and Tegs hands him a knife, which is found by Jay's father, Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord) and his girlfriend Dawn Swann (Kara Tointon). The next day, the gang steal several packs of cigarettes from the local shop, the Minute Mart. They harass Dot by making silent phone calls and knocking on her door and running away. Tegs pulls a knife on Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi), who confronts the group of youths. After Jay criticises Tegs's harassment of Dot, they have a fight. After appearing to have reconciled their differences, Tegs is asked by his gang whether he is with them or Jay, at which point he stabs Jay in the leg, leaving him bleeding on the ground in the park. Tegs' mum, Tina Teague (Kerry Ann White) arrives before the trial to try and persuade Jay to drop the charges against Tegs but he does not and Tegs is sentenced in an off-screen trial on 29 February to two years in a Young Offenders Institution for his crime. =Development= The storyline in which Tegs stabs Jay was to be the first teenage gang-related attack that EastEnders has featured. Kris Green from Digital Spy described him as 'out of control'. Ofcom received seven complaints about the stabbing episode. A BBC spokesperson responded to the complaints about the scenes being shown before the watershed: \\"The BBC has a strict set of editorial guidelines that all programmes must adhere to, to ensure that the violence portrayed was suitable for pre- watershed viewing.\\" Kris Green from Digital Spy defended the episode saying, \\"I have to say that it wasn't as gruesome as I'd imagined it would be. There's no screaming, no scuffling‚Äîit's all quiet and it happens in about 10 seconds.\\" Selina Branning Selina Branning, played by Daisy Beaumont, is the ex-wife of Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and mother of their daughter Penny Branning (Mia McKenna Bruce). This was Beaumont's second role in EastEnders as she previously played Helen Graham in 2000. She was listed by Digital Spy as a suspect in Max Branning's (Jake Wood) hit-and-run. However, Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) was the culprit. She appears between 21 January and 1 February 2008. Selina is first heard when she leaves a message for Jack and Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) speaks to her on the phone. Ronnie later visits Selina and speaks to her about Jack not being allowed to see their daughter, Penny. It is revealed that Penny is in a wheelchair, paralysed from the waist down. Jack sleeps with Selina in his club's office and they are seen by Ronnie's sister Roxy Slater (Rita Simons). A week later, Selina phones Jack to say that she and Penny are leaving to live in France.

Maslen who plays Penny's dad revealed that Penny will be returning to the serial intermittently, though she has not returned since her departure. Jack's girlfriend Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) finds tickets for a ballet, which Jack says are for Penny as it is her birthday on the day of the performance and she loves dancing. Later, Jack finds a message on his answerphone from Selina, ranting about the birthday present. Ronnie answers the phone and meets Selina. At the house, while talking to Selina about the circumstances of her and Jack's relationship, Penny enters the room in a wheelchair. Selina asks Ronnie if she knows why Penny is paralysed from the waist down. Later, Jack tells Ronnie that when he was a police officer, he caught a drug dealer who deliberately hit Penny with his car when she and Selina were waiting at a bus stop, causing Penny's spine to be severed. It is later revealed that it was due to Jack being a corrupt police officer and taking payment from a drugs baron in return for tip-offs. When Jack was unable to tip off the baron and he was arrested, one of his associates carried out the attack in revenge. Jack takes Penny and Selina out for Penny's birthday and they go back to Selina's flat and kiss. Selina reveals the next day how upset Penny was that Jack was not there when she woke up. Selina decides to move to France where her parents live and takes Penny with her. Penny visits Jack in April 2008 and is cold towards Ronnie, preferring her aunt Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) with whom she goes shopping. Tanya cooks Penny a farewell meal, but Ronnie still struggles to bond with her. She decides that she does not want to return to France but is persuaded to go back to Selina by Jack. In March 2010, Ronnie asks Jack about Penny and he says she is doing fine without him and that Penny made the right decision to go to France.

He appears on 5 February 2008, selling some clothes to Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) for her stall. Mo insists that the stock is faulty, and tries to make the dye on a shirt run by pouring tea over it, and when Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) tries to wash the tea stain out, the top gets ruined. Gold also played Dougie Briggs in 1994, and his casting as Roger was criticised by entertainment website Digital Spy's television critic Dek Hogan, as Briggs was \\"such an iconic role\\", calling it \\"an insult to the audience\\".

Callum is a great part to play and I can't wait for him to make his mark in Walford.\\" He also said it was an \\"honour\\". EastEnders executive producer, Diederick Santer, commented: \\"Callum [...] will bring a breath of fresh air to Walford. Bright, twinkly, and with the gift of the gab, he'll get the women of Walford all of a flutter.\\" Describing his character, Jordan said, \\"he's a very laid back and easy going character. He doesn't think too far ahead. He's a bit of a Casanova, definitely a jack the lad. He's very confident and streetwise and he reads people and situations very well, which allows him to get what he wants.\\" Jordan said that one of the writers told him that Callum reminded him of Vincent Chase in Entourage. Callum was listed by Ladbrokes as a contender for the father of Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby, and was ranked by them as an outsider with odds of 16/1. He was also named by website Digital Spy as a possible suspect in Max Branning's (Jake Wood) hit-and-run. It was reported on 20 January 2009 that the character was to depart from the series in March 2009. An EastEnders insider told Digital Spy, \\"Viewers will learn a little more about Callum before he leaves Albert Square behind.\\" Speaking of his departure, Jordan said: \\"I've had a really great time at EastEnders and I've enjoyed working with all the cast. I've loved every minute of it and I'm looking forward to trying new things.\\" Tony King Tony King, played by Chris Coghill, is the partner of established character Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), and a father-figure to her four children.

BBC News described the plot as an ongoing \\"predatory paedophile storyline\\", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera. The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded the plot strand \\"one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted\\", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it to be a \\"new low\\" for EastEnders. Tony sexually abuses Whitney, and begins grooming her school- friend Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan), before his predatory nature is uncovered and he is arrested for his crimes. Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 to stand trial.

He first appeared when Ronnie attended a school reunion, with Christian Clarke (John Partridge) posing as her husband. Lee revealed he is the best friend of Joel Reynolds (Cavan Clerkin), the father of Ronnie's daughter. He revealed that Joel knew about the school reunion but wouldn't be coming. Lee also realised that Christian was not Ronnie's husband and was in fact gay, so slid his own contact details into Christian's blazer pocket. Christian later went out for a drink with him and got Joel's contact details for Ronnie. Over the next few days Lee and Christian started a relationship, this was thanks to Christian's sister Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) sending Lee a text from Christian's phone. A few days into this relationship, Lee said that he was surprised he was attracted to Christian, as he tended to prefer younger men. They later kiss but are told by Dot Branning (June Brown) that she is as liberal as the next person, but does not approve of canoodling in public places. Christian later invited Lee for a lunch with some 'friends', Jane and Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), who had both insisted on meeting Lee. However, Lee ended up being rude to both Jane and Roxy, and later left while Christian was out buying wine, telling Jane and Roxy that Christian was too old for him and they ended their relationship. =Reception= After screening the kiss on 7 October 2008 between Lee and Christian 145 complaints were made after screening the kiss before the watershed. Writing on the Points of View message board, one viewer said: \\"I am appalled by the display of homosexual kissing before the watershed shown on EastEnders. This is disgraceful whilst young children are watching and sets the wrong example.\\" Though one viewer said, \\"I don't see what the fuss is about, given the context of their kissing and messing about and the way it was portrayed.\\" The BBC defended it though saying, Gareth McLean from The Guardian defended the kiss saying, Who are the people that complain about gay kissing in EastEnders? Don't they have anything better to do? Other than sell their daughters into slavery, kill their neighbour for working the Sabbath and stone infidels, I mean. (\\"Day 44 in the Old Testament House and it's time to burn a witch!\\"). Every time there's a bit of man-on-man kissage in Walford, the BBC gets complaints that \\"this filth\\", or words to that effect, shouldn't be on the telly. \\"How do I explain this to my child?\\" runs the gist of some of the gripes. He finished of saying 'Let's congratulate the BBC'. Stuart Turner Detective Inspector Stuart Turner played by Ray MacAllan, first arrived in Walford along with Kenny Morris (Ryan Philpott) after Max Branning (Jake Wood) reported a burglary at his home. He made his first appearance on 27 October and his last on 11 November 2008. After Sergeant Morris found bullet holes in the wall, Max said that they were the work of his brother Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). This however turned out to be a ploy of his to prevent Jack moving away to France with Max's wife Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) and their three children. As a result, Jack was arrested for attempted murder, but was later released due to lack of evidence. The gun had been found by Turner, however he later met Jack and handed the gun over to him, as he had respect for him as a former police officer. He later appeared after Max was mowed down by a moving car. He was worried about being discovered for giving Jack the gun, but Jack assured him that he was safe. However things got worse for him when Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman) turned up and announced that she was taking over the case of the Branning brothers' feud. After Tanya confessed to the hit and run and later refused bail, Jack enlisted DI Turner to help find the witness of Max's hit-and-run. He was reluctant, but after being blackmailed by Jack over his involvement with the \\"missing\\" gun, he relented and later revealed that the witness was Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner). Samantha Keeble Detective Inspector Samantha Keeble, played by Alison Newman, is a police officer who appears between 3 and 27 November 2008, and then again from 15 July 2014 to 16 June 2016. Keeble investigates Max Branning's (Jake Wood) hit-and-run. She is angered by his former wife Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) who does not let her speak to their daughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald). Abi was in Max's house and near the 'accident' and is a key witness. In July 2014, Keeble takes over the investigation into the murder of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), and interviews Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) about an argument he had with Lucy on the night she died. The following day, Keeble visits Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and brother Peter Beale (Ben Hardy) informing them of Jake Stone's (Jamie Lomas) release from custody after the case against him is dropped and admitting that the investigation has stalled, and asks him to participate in a televised appeal for information from the public about the murder. At the appeal, she highlights details of the case to the assembled reporters and plays CCTV footage of Lucy on a bus on the night she died. When reporter Beth Kennedy (Jordan Baker) upsets Ian by asking questions about Lucy's drug using, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), who had seen Keeble talking to Kennedy before the press conference, thinks that Keeble believes Ian is hiding something, which is why she allowed the questioning. Two days later, Ian and Peter visit Keeble to be told that they have received new leads from members of the public about a man seen getting off the bus at the same stop as Lucy. Keeble speaks to Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) having identified him as the man from the bus. In October, with DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton), she bumps into Max as he is leaving Ian's house. Summerhayes is surprised to discover Max and Keeble know each other. Keeble informs Ian that they had traced and eliminated all the witnesses from the bus. Keeble takes Summerhayes off the case, after discovering that she has been having a sexual relationship with Max. Keeble tells Summerhayes that she has jeopardised the murder investigation and faces an investigation by the force's professional standards department. Keeble visits Max when he complains about a reporter stalking his daughter Lauren (Jacqueline Jossa). Keeble assures Max that the police have spoken to the so- called journalist, who is actually Detective Sergeant Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace), and told him to back off. Keeble then warns Summerhayes, telling her not to put her police career at any further risk by remaining with Max. Keeble and Bryant later arrest Max for Lucy's murder, and they find her blood on his shoes. Max is found guilty after his trial but escapes the court. He soon realises that Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) killed Lucy and tries to pass this information on to the police, but they dismiss it as an act of desperation, and take him back into custody, and he is sentenced to 21 years in prison. Bobby later confesses to the police that he killed Lucy, but Keeble is reluctant to reopen the case. She is stunned when Bobby says he still has the murder weapon. Bobby is later sentenced to three years for killing Lucy. Keeble is later shocked when she discovers that Ian has known Bobby was Lucy's murderer since his wedding day. However, she chooses not to do anything about it and simply wishes him good luck. When she is confronted, she says that everyone has made mistakes in the murder investigation and insists that the case is well and truly over. Inside Soap praised Keeble's part in Lucy's murder investigation, calling her \\"flinty\\" and saying she \\"brought some proper policing\\" to the case.

Despite promising Jack Tanya's freedom and helping her client in every way she could to see that she would be given bail, she admitted to Jack that Tanya didn't stand a chance of getting released. This proved true when Tanya's bail application was denied later that day. She later appeared, when she visited Tanya in prison to inform her that Max is concerned she is covering for Jack. However, this has been proven incorrect, although it has been revealed that Tanya is covering for her daughter, Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) . She returned to accompany Tanya in court, she asked Tanya to think about what her plea would be. When the truth about Lauren was revealed, she asked Kendra to contact social services because she felt that she will only make things worse for her family.

She made her first appearance on 17 November 2008, the episode in which she is born. For the first few weeks of her life, she is raised as the daughter of Roxy's husband Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) and was briefly given his name, as he and Jack are unaware of Amy's true paternity. Amy is born two months premature and is put on a ventilator from birth. She is named after the daughter of Roxy's sister Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), whom she put up for adoption. Roxy initially decides to raise Amy with her friend Christian Clarke (John Partridge), after Sean misses Amy's birth but changes her mind when she and Sean reconcile.

It transpires that this is so on Christmas Day 2008, when Suzy Branning (Maggie O'Neill) gives Sean the results as a present, which leads to Sean abducting Amy. There is a fierce argument when Sean is found with Amy, which leads to Sean leaving and Amy is returned to Roxy by Sean's sister Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) on New Year's Day. Jack then spends more time with Amy and Ronnie decides Amy should be Christened and Roxy agrees. Amy's godfather is Christian and her godmother is her step- grandmother Dot Branning (June Brown), although Ronnie is originally meant to be her godmother, but gets drunk and turns up late to the ceremony. Christian and his partner Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) look after Amy for a day and decide that they want a child. While Amy is being looked after by Ronnie, she draws a picture, which upsets Ronnie has Ronnie interprets it as including her son who died.

When Ben discovers her, Dr. Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) is called and he revives her. Amy is taken to hospital in a critical condition. She recovers, but she is found to have a fracture from her previous fall, so a social worker awards temporary custody of Amy to Jack. Roxy later is allowed to see Amy, whilst a social worker evaluates Roxy's parenting skills. Jack refuses to allow Roxy to see Amy other than at arranged times. A solicitor tells Roxy to dig up as much dirt on Jack and his family as she can, but this does not work as a court grants full custody to Jack. When Roxy's cousin Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) has Jack's car crushed, Jack tells Roxy she cannot see Amy until it is replaced. Jack does not allow Roxy to give Amy her gift at Christmas, so Roxy shows Amy her puppet toy through the window, meaning Jack is forced to let Amy see Roxy. Amy starts scratching other children at nursery because of the tension between Roxy and Jack. Eventually, Roxy wins her custody case, though Jack reveals he dropped it because Roxy threatened to report him for fraud, as he forged her signature to get Amy a passport. When Roxy catches head lice, she blames Bianca Butcher's (Patsy Palmer) children, but she finds out she actually caught them from Amy. Amy's father, Jack moves away in October 2013, and Amy lived full-time with Roxy and her fianc√©, Alfie Moon (Shane Ritchie) until the couple separate on their wedding day in November 2013.

Roxy leaves Amy with Jack in January 2016 after Dean tries to rape her. Jack and Amy temporarily leave Walford but return when Jack decides to move back to the square permanently so he can be with Ronnie. Roxy returns to Walford but when Jack finds out Roxy agreed to be a drug mule and smuggled ¬£10,000 of cocaine into the country, he is reluctant to let Roxy see Amy. Eventually, Ronnie persuades him to let Amy stay in Roxy's flat overnight but while Jay and Roxy argue over the drugs, Amy finds them and her rabbit Hercules dies after eating cocaine. Amy runs away but is soon found by Andy Flynn (Jack Derges). Jack worries that Amy may have taken drugs so takes her to hospital. Amy is fine but upon realising Social Services are going to be involved, Jack threatens to go for full custody of Amy. However he drops the case when he realises how much Roxy has suffered after Dean attacked her. Roxy begins to feel distant from Amy and tries to do things right for her, deciding she wants Ronnie to adopt Amy. Ronnie reluctantly agrees. On Jack and Ronnie's wedding night, both Ronnie and Roxy drown and die in the hotel swimming pool. Jack does not want Amy to know but she asks questions about their whereabouts, so he confuses her by saying they have \\"gone away\\" and will never return. Amy and her half-brother Ricky (Henri Charles) continue to question Jack, so Dot explains to them with sensitivity that they have gone to heaven. Ronnie and Roxy's mother and Amy's maternal grandmother, Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) returns to Walford and convinces Jack not let Amy and Ricky attend their funerals, but he later changes his mind. Jack allows Glenda to move in to help raise Amy, Ricky and Ronnie's young son, Matthew Mitchell Cotton. Jack and Glenda talk to Amy when they find out she has been wetting the bed over Ronnie and Roxy's deaths. When Glenda has Amy's ears pierced like Roxy's, Jack throws Glenda out because he does not want Amy to see Roxy as a role model. Jack hires Ingrid Solberg (Pernille Broch) as an au pair and she fails to connect with Amy and Ricky by preparing a Norwegian meal, but they bond over pizza. At Halloween, Amy, her cousin Janet Mitchell (Grace) and neighbour Riley Taylor (Tom Jacobs) go missing and when a child is hit by Tina Carter's (Luisa Bradshaw-White) car, Jack fears that is it is Amy. The child is revealed to be Janet. Amy is later found with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). =Development= Robert Kazinsky who plays Sean Slater teased the Christmas storyline saying, \\"Sean ultimately deceives Roxy and snatches baby Amy from The Vic. Then there's a whole week of the Mitchells trying to track Sean and Amy down. Sean's holed up in a squat with the baby to give them more time together. He's simply looking after Amy, who's become the most important person in his life. Even if she isn't his child, mentally and emotionally, she is to Sean. Eventually, Sean's found and it all kicks off, culminating in a stunt with an icy lake‚Ä¶\\" Kazinsky said that he thinks Sean would be a good dad to Amy saying, Sean was 16 when his father died, so for Sean, bringing up baby Amy was a way for him to make it up to his dad ‚Äì by being the father to Amy that his father was to him.\\" Ahmet Tamer Hassan guest starred as Ahmet.

Her father was a Methodist minister who managed a hotel. Her future husband persuaded her father to permit Bingham to go on stage approximately a year before the couple married. Vintage postcard of actress Amelia Bingham. Theatrical career Amelia Bingham Her first role in a stage production came on the Pacific Coast. Her New York City debut came at the People's Theatre, 199 Bowery, Manhattan, in 1893. People's Theatre CinemaTreasures.org; accessed July 21, 2020. Her role was a leading part in a melodrama, The Struggle For Life. Her early successes in the 1890s included The Power of Gold, The Shaughran, Colleen Bawn, The Village Postmaster, and Captain Impudence. By 1897 she was managed by Charles Frohman and was the leading lady in The White Heather. With Frohman she was featured in The Pink Domino, The Proper Caper, On and Off, At the White Horse Tavern, The Cuckoo, and His Excellency The Governor. Bingham's popularity as a performer peaked around 1897. She tallied more than 9,000 of 30,000 votes cast in a newspaper competition for the title of American State Queen. Earlier stars like Lillian Russell, Maud Allan, Ada Rehan, and Fannie Davenport received a mere hundred votes each. She started the Amelia Bingham Company which produced The Climbers starring Bijou Fernandez.Bijou Fernandez, Stage Actress, November 8, 1961, pg. 35. A visit to London, England in 1900 acquainted her with actresses who were their own producers. The Climbers by Clyde Fitch premiered at the Bijou Theatre on January 15, 1901, and had an extended run. Other plays that were staged with her oversight were Lady Margaret, The Modern Magdalen, and The Frisky Mrs. Johnson. Bingham performed and produced Olympe (1904), a Broadway play in which she later toured with Gilbert Miller.Gilbert Miller- International Trader, New York Times, November 19, 1950, pg. X4. Bingham acted the lead in Big Moments from Great Plays (1909) and starred with William H. Crane and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. in The New Henrietta, prior to World War I. However, illness began to hinder her from working around 1914. In 1918 she appeared in The Man Who Stayed Home. Her final stage appearance came at the Century Theatre in The Pearl of Great Price. She depicted Shame in the 1926 production. Bingham detested having to play the type of woman she portrayed in this production. She commented, for years I have played decent women on the stage. Financial circumstances forced her into accepting the part. The previous year she participated in a revival of Trelawny of the Wells (1925), written by Arthur Wing Pinero. Death Bingham died in 1927 following an eight month battle with heart disease complicated by pneumonia. She was 58 years old. She died at her home at 103 Riverside Drive, Manhattan, New York City, a house formerly owned by Joseph Jefferson. Her husband, Lloyd Bingham, had predeceased her. He died in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway on a mission of peace for Henry Ford to Scandinavia in 1915. Bingham resided in the Riverside Drive mansion for a decade after her husband's demise. Passers-by noticed statues and black curtains inside. Its interior also housed gilt-framed mirrors with intricate decorative patterns, clocks, coats of armor, helmets, lances, swords, candelabra, and crucifixes. Many of the items were collected by Lloyd Bingham and some were sold when it was discovered that Bingham's estate amounted to less than $5,000. In 1925 two thieves stole $1,500 in jewelry from the home. Bingham's quick thinking prevented them from noticing a bag that contained $20,000 in jewels. Amelia Bingham was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx after her funeral at the Little Church Around the Corner.

Career with Matson Lines Monterey was built to promote travel to Hawaii and for Pacific Ocean liner service including regular stops in ports along the West Coast of the United States, Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. On 12 May 1932 she took 83 passengers from New York City to the West Coast on a positioning cruise. Her maiden voyage officially began 3 June 1932 in San Francisco, California after which she made stops in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Auckland, Pago Pago, Suva, Sydney and Melbourne. She scored a public relations triumph when she carried much-appreciated supplies to the Bear of Oakland on Byrd's second expedition to the South Pole.Maritime Matters. S.S. BELOFIN-1: MONTEREY, MATSONIA, LURLINE, BRITANIS War service In World War II Monterey served as a fast troop carrier, often operating alone so she would not be slowed by formation navigation in a convoy. The United States Maritime Commission chartered her in 1941 before the US declaration of war to carry 150 Chinese, Korean and Japanese missionaries and stranded US citizens back to San Francisco. Once home, she was quickly refitted to hold 3,500 soldiers. The ship was delivered to WSA by Oceanic Steamship Company, a Matson entity, 3 December 1941 at San Francisco. On 16 December 1941 she steamed to Hawaii with 3,349 fresh troops, returning with 800 casualties of the attack on Pearl Harbor. =War voyages= *1941 With urgent need to reinforce Hawaii the Army pushed loading two fast ships, Monterey and Matsonia with troops, aircraft and ammunition in hopes of their sailing independently by 13 December. The Navy opposed any unescorted convoys and, despite Army arguments at the highest levels, the ships were delayed until the 16th when Monterey, Matsonia and Lurline sailed under escort. *6 January 1942 San Diego to Pago Pago filled to capacity with Marines, arrived 19 January.Troopships of World War II by Roland W.

Money ran out on the project after 30% of the work had been completed. For five years she sat idle in Alameda, then was purchased by the US Government in August 1952. She was towed to the mothball fleet in nearby Suisun Bay. =Monterey to Matsonia= Meanwhile, Matson was enjoying fair post-war success with Lurline and was looking to expand their passenger operation once more. Matson had a C4 \\"Mariner\\" class vessel undergoing conversion to a cruise ship for the Oceania and Australasia region; this ship was originally named Free State Mariner but Matson had renamed her Monterey.Mariner class vessels Matson bought the old mothballed SS Monterey back from the US Government on 3 February 1956 and had to come up with a new name for her: she was rechristened SS Matsonia, replacing their earlier Matsonia which had been sold to Home Lines in 1954 and subsequently renamed. The new Matsonia (ex-Monterey) first sailed from New York to San Francisco on 22 May 1957 to team up with her sister Lurline on the San Francisco ‚Äì Los Angeles ‚Äì Honolulu run. =Matsonia to Lurline= Within five years, profits from passenger service had fallen to the point where Matson decided to anchor Matsonia indefinitely in San Francisco Bay. Sister ship Lurline continued to operate but suffered a major turbine problem in February 1963; one that would require costly repairs. Instead of repairing Lurline, Matson sold the well-loved ship to Chandris Lines to be rechristened Ellinis. Stung by poor public opinion regarding the maneuver, Matson rechristened the former Matsonia (ex-Monterey) as the new Lurline on 6 December 1963 and returned her to service. Lurline to Britanis By 1970, passenger receipts were down so low that Matson chose to cease passenger liner service altogether. On 25 June 1970, Lurline arrived in San Francisco to be sold to Chandris Lines. Five days later she steamed under new ownership out of the Golden Gate toward Piraeus with the new name Britanis with radio callsign SZWE (later HPEN). Service with Chandris Lines Britanis tendering at Grand Cayman. At Piraeus, Britanis was greatly modified to hold 1,655 passengers, mainly by subdividing existing cabins and converting cargo holds to new cabin areas. She re-entered service on 21 February 1971 under the Chandris 'Fantasy Cruises' division, leaving Southampton bound for Sydney and back; a regular round-trip she would make for three years. In 1974 she saw service as a cruise ship in the Caribbean during winter and Europe during the summer. In May 1982 Britanis cruised between New York and Bermuda with a smaller capacity of 1,200 passengers. In winter 1983‚Äì1984, Britanis sailed from Miami to the Caribbean, then sailed from New York in the summer. A major overhaul in 1986 included parts from her sister Ellinis (ex-Lurline), some of which went to Ellinis from Homeric (ex-Mariposa) when Homeric was scrapped in 1974. At this point, parts from three sister ships were now bound together in Britanis. The refit gave Britanis eight years of Caribbean cruising until 19 November 1994. =US Government charter= Britanis was chartered by the US Government in 1994 as a floating barracks for military personnel at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She suffered minor damage from an electrical fire, was repaired at US Government expense, then laid up at Tampa, Florida in late 1996. Final years Chandris opted to sell Britanis as part of a plan to cease cruise line operations for Fantasy Cruises and further invest in their newer Celebrity Cruises brand. The ship was maintained in anchorage until 24 January 1998 when she was sold to AG Belofin Investments of Liechtenstein and renamed Belofin-1. Her new owners intended to recoup their investment by selling the ship to scrappers, but a downturn in steel prices held them up for more than a year. On 3 July 2000, Belofin-1 was towed by the Ukrainian tug Iribis out of Tampa Bay with the former CN Marine ferry MV Bluenose lashed to her port side. The ships were bound for ship breakers in India, but Bluenose ended up going to Mexico. Belofin-1 apparently began taking on water and listing during the voyage but nobody was on board to correct the list. The tugboat crew cut her free and Belofin-1 capsized and sank due to progressive flooding, some south of Cape Town, South Africa on 21 October 2000.

Introduced in Half-Life and expansion packs This section deals with characters that appear in Half-Life, Opposing Force, Blue Shift, and Decay. =Gordon Freeman= Gordon Freeman, Ph.D., is the silent protagonist of the Half-Life series and the playable character in Half-Life and all games in the Half-Life 2 series. He is a theoretical physicist and holds a Ph.D. from MIT in that field. At the time of Half-Life, he works at Black Mesa Research Facility, a facility in New Mexico, conducting nuclear and subatomic research. =The G-Man= The G-Man (voiced by Michael Shapiro) is a mysterious recurring character in the Half-Life series of first-person shooter computer games. He is known to display peculiar behavior and capabilities beyond that of a normal human, and his identity and motives remain almost completely unexplained. He plays the role of an overseer and employer, both observing the player as the games progress and pulling strings to control the outcome of specific events throughout the Half-Life saga. The G-Man's constant appearances in the Half-Life games, as well as his revealing monologues with series protagonist Gordon Freeman, imply that he is of great importance and somewhat anchors the endeavors of the player. His mysterious nature has made him an icon of the Half-Life series. =Barney Calhoun= Barney Calhoun is the playable character in Half-Life: Blue Shift and a major character in Half- Life 2 as well as Half-Life 2: Episode One. Michael Shapiro provided Barney's voice in the games of the Half-Life series. Scott Lynch, Valve's Chief Operating Officer, lent his face to the game for use in-game as Barney in Half-Life 2. Barney's name stemmed from the earlier alpha versions of Half- Life in which the model for the security guards held a resemblance to actor Don Knotts, inspiring comparisons with Knotts's character Barney Fife from The Andy Griffith Show, which in the United States has long been a disparaging term for an inept policeman or security guard. Initially, the \\"Barneys\\" were intended to be hostile NPCs who would attack the player. In Half-Life: Blue Shift, the playable Barney progresses through Black Mesa to escape the events of the Resonance Cascade and is able to do so, in contrast to Gordon Freeman and Adrian Shephard, who are held in stasis. In Half-Life 2, Barney works as a mole for the Lambda Resistance in the Combine Civil Protection Forces. He provides the player information in the first chapter, leading him to Kleiner and Vance, and in the end of the second chapter, he provides the player with his crowbar. The fact that Barney owes Gordon Freeman a beer is a running gag in the series. =Adrian Shephard= Adrian Shephard, a 22-year-old U.S. Marine Corporal, is the playable character in Half-Life: Opposing Force. Assigned to the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) from the fictional Santego Military Base in Arizona, he is one of the personnel sent into the Black Mesa Research Facility to kill the aliens and silence the witnesses, especially a scientist named Gordon Freeman, the player character in the original game. However, during the events subsequent to the Resonance Cascade, Shephard finds himself separated from his unit and fighting for his life. Unlike the other Marines, he works with the increasingly distrustful scientists and guards in order to make it out of Black Mesa alive. He and Gordon Freeman do cross paths during the game, but at that point, Shephard is merely an observer to a climactic event from the original game: the time when Freeman jumps into the portal that leads to Xen; however, if players tried to follow Freeman, they would appear in Xen but subsequently fall to their deaths. Shephard never fights alongside or against Gordon Freeman. The G-Man appears to take an interest in his movements, even before the Black Mesa Incident. As early as three months prior, Shephard spots the G-Man during the boot camp training mission. Later on, as he makes his escape from Black Mesa, he comes across a thermonuclear warhead brought in by the Black Ops and deactivates it, but the G-Man later reactivates it, leading to the eventual destruction of Black Mesa. In the end, the G-Man reveals that he has successfully argued for Shephard's life, detaining him in some unknown void. The G-Man expresses a degree of respect for Shephard, offering praise for his ability to \\"adapt and survive against all odds\\" which \\"rather reminds [the G-Man] of [himself]\\". Shephard is briefly mentioned in Half-Life: Blue Shift, where a soldier grumbles about taking over some of Shephard's squad's duties. Shephard was planned to be the player character of Arkane Studios' Ravenholm spinoff game, developed around 2007 to 2008, a project which Valve later cancelled. Valve also affirmed that Shephard had no connection to Portal after players found that the keyboard images in game showed the lit characters \\"ASHPD\\" and believed that hinted at Shephard's return; the letters instead referred to the long name of the \\"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\\" a.k.a. the \\"portal gun\\", with the nearness to Shephard's name a \\"total freak coincidence\\" according to Valve's Doug Lombardi. =Rosenberg= Dr. Rosenberg (voiced by Jon St. John) is a scientist and a survivor of the Black Mesa incident. He first appears in Half-Life: Decay. When Gina Cross and Colette Green first arrive at the test chamber's control room and are receiving instructions from Dr. Keller, Rosenberg interrupts and voices his concern to Keller over having the anti-mass spectrometer run above 90% capacity, which is past the safety buffer zone for the equipment. Dr. Keller, however, dismisses his concern and states that the administrator's orders for this were clear. He tells Rosenberg that he can either stay and watch the experiment or return to his labs by the train yards. Rosenberg remains, and shortly thereafter the Resonance Cascade occurs. Immediately after the disaster, Rosenberg converses with Dr. Keller and makes it clear that he believes their greatest responsibility should be the safety of the people at Black Mesa. Although Keller thinks that they should attempt to reset the displacement fields first, he eventually agrees with Rosenberg, and they come up with a plan to contact the military, so that they can help and evacuate the facility as soon as possible. Gina and Colette escort Rosenberg through the Hazard Course to a satellite communications center on the surface, where he is able to transmit a distress signal. Dr. Rosenberg decides to wait there for the military, and this is the last time he is seen in Decay as Gina and Colette return below to assist Dr. Keller. However, his voice is heard once more in the game later on. In Half-Life: Blue Shift, Rosenberg makes his first appearance during the Hazard Course tutorial, long before Calhoun encounters him in the train yards. He can be seen behind the observer's window during the duck-jump portion of the training. Some time between Gina and Colette's last sight of Rosenberg in Decay and Calhoun's eventual rescue of the scientist in Blue Shift, he tries to enact an escape plan to get out of Black Mesa with the help of several other scientists. During this time, he is captured by soldiers and held captive in a freight car for questioning, while a colleague, Harold, is cornered and fatally wounded. Before Harold dies, Barney Calhoun discovers him, and he instructs Calhoun to find Dr. Rosenberg to help him with his plan. Calhoun is able to reach the train yards and free Dr. Rosenberg. Rosenberg informs him that their plan is to use the equipment in the prototype labs to teleport to safety. He leads Calhoun to the unused part of the complex where two other scientists, Walter Bennett and Simmons, are already preparing the machine. Rosenberg instructs Calhoun that he must activate and align a relay device on Xen in order for them to be able to accurately set their destination. Calhoun travels to Xen and is successful in accomplishing this task, but after returning through the portal back to Earth (it is here that Gina and Colette in Decay, temporarily caught in a harmonic reflux, hear Rosenberg's voice calling Calhoun through the portal), they discover that they need another power cell to replenish the teleporter's power for their escape. Calhoun acquires a newly charged power cell from the lab's sub-basement and delivers it to Rosenberg and the others. Dr. Rosenberg then initiates the system and brings it online. They all narrowly avoid the military's invasion of the prototype labs, teleporting to the safety of an unnoticed access tunnel. They get into an SUV and leave Black Mesa. Rosenberg's fate remains unknown. =Gina Cross= Dr. Gina Cross (voiced by Kathy Levin) is a Black Mesa scientist who first appears as the Holographic Assistant for Gordon Freeman in the Black Mesa's Hazard Course and then later as one half of the protagonists in Half-Life: Decay. In Decay, Cross is the one who delivers the GG-3883 crystal sample to the delivery system and then heads to an area below the test chamber, where Dr. Colette Green is stationed, to fix a jam in the lift that allows the specimen to be delivered up to Gordon. After the Resonance Cascade occurs, Cross teams up with Dr. Green to battle their way through the now alien-infested facility. They first escort Rosenberg to the surface to contact the military, and then under the guidance of Dr. Richard Keller, they succeed in starting a resonance reversal to help lessen the effects of the dimensional rift. In Half-Life: Blue Shift, Cross can briefly be seen on a security camera in the surveillance room, delivering the GG-3883 crystal. In Half-Life: Opposing Force, Adrian Shephard finds Cross's corpse in Xen after being teleported there by the Displacer Cannon, which implies that she died sometime after the events of Decay. Randy Pitchford, the president and CEO of Gearbox Software, has since confirmed this fate. Cross was originally planned to be Gordon Freeman's spouse as well as another playable character in the original Half-Life, but this idea was cut from the final game. =Colette Green= Dr. Colette Green (voiced by Lani Minella) is a Black Mesa scientist and one half of the protagonist team in Half-Life: Decay. In Decay, Dr. Green's role in the experiment is to make preparations in a room below the test chamber and initiate the Anti-Mass Spectrometer to run at 105%. Dr. Gina Cross also enters the same room to fix a jam in the specimen delivery system's lift mechanism, meaning they are both in the same place when the Resonance Cascade finally occurs. Following the disaster, the two team up to fight their way through the facility for survival. They escort Dr. Rosenberg to the surface to call the military for help and then, with the help of Dr. Richard Keller, manage to start a resonance reversal to prevent the dimensional rift from becoming too large to be repaired. The outcome for Dr. Green, along with the rest of the survivors in Decay (with the exception of Dr. Cross, who later died in Xen), is unknown to the other Black Mesa survivors. =Richard Keller= Dr. Richard Keller (voiced by Brice Armstrong) is a Black Mesa scientist, working with Colette and Gina. He appears in Half- Life: Decay. He is a 55-year-old, senior scientist in a wheel chair. He gives missions to Colette and Gina during the game. Keller also condemns Gordon Freeman and asks himself what Kleiner sees in him. His final fate is unknown. Keller was originally going to be an antagonist, who lied about his ability not to walk, but the idea was scrapped. =Walter Bennet= Dr. Walter Bennet (voiced by Harry S. Robins) is a Black Mesa scientist. He is seen in Half- Life: Blue Shift. In Blue Shift, Dr. Bennet is seen fixing a battery in Dr. Rosenberg's office, along with Dr. Simmons. The three scientists soon get it fixed with the help of Barney Calhoun, and they start their teleportation out of Black Mesa. The four successfully make it out the facility, making Dr. Bennet one of the few known survivors of the incident. They open the gates and start their journey to the outside world with an SUV. Dr. Bennet is briefly mentioned in Half-Life: Opposing Force. As Adrian Shephard travels within Sector E of Black Mesa, he enters a testing laboratory where Xen specimens were being experimented on prior to the Resonance Cascade. He opens up a transmission intended for Dr. Bennet, revealing a hologram of a scientist talking about the results of an experiment conducted on a Barnacle, one of the Xen creatures being examined. Following the transmission, Shephard takes a nearby Barnacle specimen that was intended for Dr. Bennet to experiment on before the Resonance Cascade. Dr. Bennet's final fate is unknown. =Simmons= Dr. Simmons is a Black Mesa scientist. He is seen in Half-Life: Blue Shift. In Blue Shift, Dr. Simmons is seen fixing a battery in Dr. Rosenberg's office, along with Dr. Walter Bennet. The three scientists soon get it fixed with the help of Barney Calhoun, and they start their teleportation out of Black Mesa. The four successfully make it out the facility, making Dr. Simmons one of the few known survivors of the incident. They open the gates and start their journey to the outside world with an SUV. Simmons does not talk at all in the game, and his first name is unknown. Furthermore, his final fate is unknown like all of his colleagues. Introduced in Half-Life 2 and episodes This section deals with characters that appear in Half-Life 2, Episode One, and Episode Two. =Alyx Vance= Alyx Vance (voiced by Merle Dandridge in Half-Life 2 and its episodes and by Ozioma Akagha in the prequel Half-Life: Alyx) is a prominent figure in the human resistance against the rule of the Combine over Earth and their human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. Alyx is the daughter of Dr. Eli Vance and his deceased wife Azian, and she becomes a close friend and ally of Gordon Freeman over the course of Half-Life 2. The 2020 VR title Half-Life: Alyx, which takes place between the events of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, focuses on Alyx and Eli Vance as they fight against the Combine's occupation of Earth. =Isaac Kleiner= Dr. Isaac Kleiner (voiced by Harry S. Robins), a Black Mesa survivor, is one of the leading scientists in the human resistance to the Combine. His character design is based on the generic \\"bald, glasses (Walter, as its model name suggests)\\" scientist model from the original Half-Life. Dr. Kleiner was one of Gordon Freeman's professors at MIT, recommending him for employment at the Black Mesa to the Civilian Recruitment Division and working with him as part of the facility's Anomalous Materials team. He managed to survive the Resonance Cascade disaster of the first game with the aid of Eli Vance. In Half-Life 2, he operates an underground lab in an abandoned Northern Petrol building. A teleportation system, developed jointly by Kleiner and Eli Vance, connects to Vance's facility, several miles away. As a pet, Dr. Kleiner keeps a debeaked headcrab he calls 'Lamarr' (after the 1930s actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr). In Episode One, Kleiner appears on the video screens previously reserved for Dr. Breen's propaganda and instructs survivors to evacuate City 17, also encouraging them to procreate. He rallies people to prepare for the Combine's retaliation, stating that several new technologies developed during their occupation would be deployed as soon as possible to help fight the Combine. In Episode Two, Kleiner is working out of the White Forest Rocket Facility with Eli Vance and Arne Magnusson on a device intended to close the Combine superportal created by the Citadel's destruction. He mostly appears during radio transmissions while guiding Alyx and Gordon to White Forest, and argues bitterly with Magnusson, whom Vance states was Kleiner's rival for grant money at Black Mesa. Upon the discovery of the Borealis in Judith Mossman's decoded message, Kleiner expresses a wish to use the technology residing in the ship against the Combine, opposing Eli's vehement desire to destroy it in order to prevent \\"another Black Mesa\\". =Eli Vance= Dr. Eli Vance (voiced by Robert Guillaume in Half-Life 2 and its episodes and by James Moses Black in the prequel Half-Life: Alyx) is a physicist, researcher, and Harvard University graduate who worked with Gordon Freeman at Black Mesa. He wears a prosthetic that replaces his left leg beneath the knee, which was lost when he was attacked by a Bullsquid while helping Dr. Isaac Kleiner climb over a wall into a Combine city. He is Alyx Vance's father; his late wife, Azian, died in the aftermath of the resonance cascade. The leader of the Lambda Resistance, Dr. Vance was the first human being to make peaceful contact with the Vortigaunt species and thus the \\"first collaborator\\", quickly persuading the alien race to ally with humanity against the Combine invasion of Earth. In Episode Two, Eli Vance works at the White Forest base before being killed by a Combine Advisor. The 2020 VR game Half- Life: Alyx, which takes place between the events of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, focuses on Eli and Alyx Vance as they fight against the Combine's occupation of Earth. As a result of the events of the game, his death is prevented, albeit at the cost of his daughter Alyx becoming a willing agent of the G-Man. Upon learning the truth, Eli seeks to rescue her. =Arne Magnusson= In Episode Two, Dr. Arne Magnusson (voiced by John Aylward) runs the White Forest base and is described as a Black Mesa survivor. He gets on poorly with Dr. Kleiner due to their clashing personalities, as spelled out by their very names: 'Magnus' means 'great' in Latin, while 'klein' means 'small' in German and Dutch. Magnusson's peculiar personality seems to have gained him much respect from the Vortigaunts, such as his assistant Uriah, who makes awed references to him. Magnusson also makes a remark to Freeman saying that if he successfully defends White Forest, then he will forgive Freeman for an earlier incident in Black Mesa, involving his 'Microwave Casserole', a reference to a scene in the first Half-Life. =Dog= Dog is a hulking robot belonging to Alyx Vance, built by her father Eli to provide both companionship and to protect her. Alyx subsequently upgraded the robot into its current form. Despite its name, Dog is anthropomorphic in appearance. Dog provides support to Freeman during training with the Gravity Gun, and makes appearances several times after. =Judith Mossman= Dr. Judith Mossman (voiced by Michelle Forbes) is introduced in Half-Life 2 as a physicist working with Eli Vance at the Black Mesa East Research Facility. Although she is apparently friendly with other scientists, her condescending attitude toward laypeople annoys Alyx. Over the course of the game, she is revealed as a double agent who betrays the resistance in an attempt to form an alliance with Dr. Breen, then betrays him in turn. In the follow-on episodes, she is again working for the resistance in a remote location. =Odessa Cubbage= Colonel Odessa Cubbage (voiced by John Patrick Lowrie) is a member of the Resistance against the Combine who speaks in distinct Received Pronunciation. He wears a jacket with emblems on it indicating that he was possibly once a security officer as part of the University of Rochester Security Services. According to Raising the Bar, his model was based on the martial arts instructor for one of the game's developers, and the name was found in a spam filter. Odessa Cubbage leads a small Resistance base and town, dubbed \\"New Little Odessa\\", in a coastal region outside City 17. Before arriving at New Little Odessa, the player can see Cubbage speaking with the G-Man by looking through a binocular spotting- scope device. When Gordon Freeman arrives at New Little Odessa en route to Nova Prospekt, Cubbage is briefing members on the use of the rocket launcher against Combine gunships. Cubbage entrusts the rocket launcher to Gordon and never turns up to fight himself, instead staying behind to attempt to contact another Resistance settlement. =Grigori= Father Grigori (voiced by Jim French) is an Eastern Orthodox-like priest who appears throughout the Ravenholm chapter of Half-Life 2. He is the only human survivor encountered in Ravenholm. He speaks enthusiastically about \\"tending to his flock\\", i.e. dispatching the remaining zombie inhabitants of the city with a hunting rifle and homemade traps while offering them consolatory words. He helps Gordon Freeman intermittently in Ravenholm, giving him a shotgun, combat tips and advice mingled with biblical quotations. Eventually, Grigori escorts Freeman through a cemetery infested with zombies to show him a hidden passage to the mines out of the haunted town. After waving Gordon off, Grigori continues fighting the hordes of enemies until he retreats into a nearby tomb, ignites a wall of fire around it and disappears, laughing maniacally. =Wallace Breen= Dr. Wallace Breen (voiced by Robert Culp) was the administrator of the Black Mesa Research Facility at the time of the \\"Black Mesa Incident,\\" the events depicted in Half-Life, but he was neither seen nor mentioned by name (he was instead referred to always as \\"the Administrator\\"). After the Seven Hour War, he \\"negotiated\\" a peace agreement with the Combine that saved humanity at the cost of enslavement. Dr. Breen was appointed as ruler of Earth -- a puppet of the Combine, who have little physical presence on the planet. The Half-Life 2 art book, Raising the Bar, has information that indicates Breen used, at least at one point of the planned story if not in the final version, a radio transmitter tower on the surface (i.e., not in Black Mesa) to communicate directly to the Combine and negotiate a surrender. Draft scripts for Half-Life 2 indicate that this would have been shown in an introductory segment to the game carried out through a series of projector slides. One of the slides would have shown Breen at the foot of a tower wearing a headset linked directly to it, with arms held wide and speaking to the skies. Breen is alerted to the return of Gordon Freeman in Half-Life 2 when Gordon is temporarily teleported, by accident, to his office in the Citadel. Dr. Breen informs the Combine and immediately dispatches the forces at his disposal to capture Freeman and break the associated Resistance movement in City 17. During Gordon Freeman's raid on the Citadel, Freeman is temporarily in the custody of Breen, until Judith Mossman turns against the administrator. During this period, Breen makes a very notable statement while in the presence of Alyx Vance and her father, Eli (who are also in his custody). He claims that Gordon \\"has proven a fine pawn to those who control him.\\" He also comments that Gordon's services are \\"open to the highest bidder,\\" and says he would understand if Gordon doesn't want to discuss it in front of his friends. These remarks imply that Breen may be aware of the mysterious G-Man and his influence over Freeman. It was also mentioned in one of the \\"Breencasts\\" to the Sector Seventeen Overwatch in Nova Prospekt; \\"I have good reason to believe that in the intervening years, he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills.\\" When Judith Mossman frees Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance in his office, Dr. Breen attacks Gordon by firing at him with the supercharged Gravity Gun; however, the charge doesn't kill him, and Breen leaves it behind while escaping. Gordon manages to stop him by destroying the Citadel's dark fusion reactor, which destroys the teleporter Breen attempted to use to escape in a massive explosion; the platform Breen was standing on collapses, dropping Breen from the Citadel to his death. Introduced in Half-Life: Alyx=Russell= Russell (voiced by Rhys Darby) is a member of the Resistance who serves as a mechanic. FootnotesReferences * Hodgson, David. Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar.

Campanus was famous for his Latin orations, poems and letters. In addition to Bessarion's Academy, Campanus was a member of the Roman circle of Pomponius Leto. After the death of the Pope in 1464, Campani taught at the Florentine Academy. Campanus was known for his Latin poetry.

Giovanni Battista Campani was born at Cavelli, near Galluccio, in the province of Caserta, to a family of very modest condition, in the midst of the war between Angevin and Aragonese contenders for the Kingdom of Naples. A place as tutor to the sons of the noble Carlo Pandoni, where he spent six years, brought him to the notice of Michel Ferno. In 1452 he went to Perugia, under the patronage of the Baglioni,His De ingratitudine fugienda was dedicated to Pandulfo Baglioni (in Opera). and, to his Latin added Greek, under the guidance of Demetrius Chalcondyles.Deutscher 2003. Having been part of the loyal embassy sent on the city's behalf to Pope Callixtus III in 1455, on his return was called to the chair of rhetoric at the University of Perugia, 16 November 1455. At the elevation of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini to the papacy as Pope Pius II in August 1458, Campani was again among the delegation from Perugia. It was Giacomo Cardinal Ammannati, apostolic secretary, who introduced him to the learned humanist Pius II, who named him bishop of Crotone in Calabria, 20 October 1462, the first of a series of episcopal appointments that found Campani at last Bishop of Teramo (23 May 1463). In Rome Campani was attached as secretary to the household of Alessandro Cardinal Oliva. After Oliva's death in 1463, Campani joined the familia of Pius' nephew Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini (later briefly pope as Pius III), whom he accompanied to Germany in 1471. Following the death of Pius, his relations with Paul II deteriorated, but he was protected from the persecution of the humanists in 1468. On March 7, 1469, the feast of St. Thomas, Campani delivered the annual encomium in honor of the \\"angelic doctor\\" for the Santa Maria sopra Minerva studium generale, the future Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum.https://www.academia.edu/7428931/I_panegirici_in_onore_di_s._Tommaso_d_Aquino_alla_Minerva_nel_XV_secolo_Memorie_Domenicane_N.S._30_1999_pp._19-146_recensito_su_Medioevo_latino_XXII_2001_n._4538_ Accessed 31 Dec., 2014 Under Sixtus IV he was appointed governor of Todi (1472) and Citt√† di Castello (1474), but his public comparison of papal military activities with the Turks resulted in his permanent disgrace.

Some of these color forms differ to the extent that at first they were thought to be separate species. The background coloration ranges from cream through yellow to light orange, but not red. Usually there are 14 black, almost rectangular spots on the elytra, but only rarely are all of these spots separate from one another. Most commonly, several of the spots are fused into larger markings, particularly along the midline, where they often create a shape resembling an anchor, sometimes fusing to such an extent that the yellow disappears almost completely, rendering the body almost entirely black except for 12 pale yellow spots. The pronotum is whitish or pale yellow, with four to eight black spots. The antennae and legs are yellowish-brown. Distribution This species is native and widespread in the Palearctic north to the Arctic Circle. It is a common species in Europe, North Africa, Cyprus, European Russia, the Caucasus, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Western Asia, Pakistan, Mongolia, temperate China (Tarim Basin deciduous forests and steppe), Korea and Japan.N.

Wilson, MD (October 5, 1904 - November 16, 1967) was an American physician born to Protestant missionaries Wilbur F. Wilson and Mary Rowley Wilson in Nanjing, China. Wilson attended Princeton University and subsequently obtained his medical training at Harvard Medical School, graduating in 1929. He returned to Nanjing in 1936, where he assumed a housestaff position at Drum Tower Hospital of Gin Ling University(Nanjing University). Amidst the chaos and bloodshed that followed in the months leading up to the Japanese occupation of Nanjing, Wilson worked tirelessly at his post, eventually becoming one among only a handful of physicians who had not left the city by 1937. Nanking Massacre During the Nanjing Massacre, Wilson was the main surgeon responsible for treating the victims of the ongoing atrocities (although several nurses were still available) and, along with John Rabe and Minnie Vautrin, was instrumental in the establishment of the Nanjing Safety Zone, which sheltered more than 200,000 people within its confined walls. During that time, the selfless work of Wilson and his associates saved the lives of countless civilians and POW's who would have otherwise perished at the hands of the aggressors. He worked tirelessly on the victims despite there being a shortage of both water and electricity. Testimony before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East After the surrender of Japan, Wilson testified before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East about the atrocities that he had witnessed during the massacre. A collection of diary entries kept by Wilson during his tenure at Nanjing Hospital were later released and offers a grim look into the stark reality that was Nanjing at the time of the atrocities: > The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of > cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief.

The abnormal \\"collapsing\\" pulse of aortic valve insufficiency is named Corrigan's pulse after him. Birth and education Corrigan was born in Thomas Street, Dublin, the son of a dealer in agricultural tools. He was educated in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, which then had a department for secular students apart from the ecclesiastical seminary. He was attracted to the study of medicine by the physician in attendance, and spent several years as apprentice to the local doctor, Edward Talbot O'Kelly. Corrigan studied medicine in Dublin later transferring to Edinburgh Medical School where he received his degree as MD in August 1825. Career Corrigan returned to Dublin in 1825 and set up a private practice at 11 Ormond Street, as his practice grew he moved to 12 Bachelors Walk in 1832, and in 1837 to 4 Merrion Square West. Apart from his private practice, Corrigan held many public appointments; he was physician to Maynooth College, the Sick Poor Institute, the Charitable Infirmary Jervis Street (1830‚Äì43) and the House of Industry Hospitals (1840‚Äì1866). His work with many of Dublin's poorest inhabitants led to him specialising in diseases of the heart and lungs, and he lectured and published extensively on the subject. He was known as a very hard-working physician, especially during the Great Famine of Ireland.O'Brien, Eoin (1983) Conscience and Conflict. Sir Dominic Corrigan 1802‚Äì1880. Glendale Press, Dublin. . At a by-election in 1870 Corrigan was elected a Liberal Member of Parliament for Dublin. In parliament he actively campaigned for reforms to education in Ireland and the early release of Fenian prisoners. He did not stand for re-election in 1874; his support for temperance and Sunday closing (of pubs) is thought to have antagonised his constituents and alcohol companies. Honours In 1847 Corrigan was appoint physician-in-ordinary to the Queen in Ireland. Two years later he was given an honorary MD from Trinity College. In 1846 Corrigan's application to become a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland was blocked. In 1855 he got around this opposition by sitting the college's entrance exam with the newly qualified doctors. He became a fellow in 1856, and in 1859 was elected president, the first Catholic to hold the position; he was re-elected president an unprecedented four times. There is a statue of Corrigan in the Graves' Hall of the College by John Henry Foley.Sir Dominic Corrigan Statue 1869 ‚Äì HISTORY HEROES AND VILLAINS John Henry Foley, RA (1818‚Äì1874). Turtlebunbury.com. Retrieved on 10 June 2014. He was President of the Royal Zoological Society of Dublin, the Dublin Pathological Society, and the Dublin Pharmaceutical Society. From the 1840s he was a member of the senate of the Queen's University and in 1871 became its vice-chancellor. In 1866 he was created a baronet, of Cappagh and Inniscorrig in the County of Dublin and of Merrion Square in the City of Dublin, partly as a reward for his services as Commissioner of Education for many years. He was a member of the board of Glasnevin Cemetery and a member of the Daniel O'Connell Memorial Committee.Chapter XIV. Chapters of Dublin History Armand Trousseau, the French clinician, proposed that aortic heart disease should be called Corrigan's disease.

In 1911 he signed for Cardiff City for a fee of ¬£25 which, due to the financial position of the club at the time, was paid by manager Fred Stewart, and it was there his career flourished. Having joined the club when they were playing in the Southern League he was an ever-present for the next decade before Cardiff joined the Football League in 1920. His first ever match in the Football league was against his former side Stockport County and he was the club's only ever-present player in the 1920‚Äì21 season. Incredibly Hardy continued to be ever-present in the following decade for the Bluebirds, including both of their FA Cup Final appearances in 1925 and 1927. Instantly recognisable - he was stocky and practically bald from an early age ‚Äì he played his last ever game for Cardiff in March 1932 in a 1‚Äì0 win over Gillingham at the age of 41 and when he left the club he had played in a total of 590 first team games. After leaving Cardiff he joined Bradford Park Avenue as a coach, later managing the Yorkshire club between March 1934 to April 1936. Despite his unquestionable ability Hardy was never selected for the England national football team. It was often thought he was denied an international cap because he played for a Welsh team. Hardy's long career with Cardiff established him as a hero in the town. Described by a local newspaper as \\"the idol of all South Wales,\\" it was said that when he appeared on a newsreel shown in Cardiff cinemas, the audience cheered for 10 minutes.South Wales Echo, 20 February 1922. Hardy still remains as Cardiff City's record appearance holder with 590 appearances over all competitions. Personal life Alongside his playing career, Hardy started his own business as a coal merchant in 1913, operating in Cathays, Cardiff. As a player for Cardiff City, his business was often promoted in the club's programmes. Following his retirement he ran the Dolphin Hotel in Somerset until 1949 when he emigrated with his wife Olive to Tasmania where he ran a grocery store. They returned to Cardiff in February 1963 eventually moving to Teignmouth in Devon. Hardy died in March 1981 in Iver, Buckinghamshire at the age of 89.

Biography In 1982, Taft moved from Ohio to Atlanta to attend Emory University. His first band of note was The Chowder Shouters, whose instruments included garbage cans. They released a six-song vinyl record. After the demise of the Chowder Shouters, Taft joined The Opal Foxx Quartet, a group consisting of anywhere from 2 to 14 members at a time. They broke up in 1992 after the deaths of several members. They released a posthumous CD, which was largely produced by Michael Stipe. Around 1988, Taft started An Evening with the Garbageman, a spoken-word open-mic variety show, which he hosted and that eventually morphed into The Jody Grind. The Jody Grind released two CDs before disbanding following the deaths of half their members. Drummer Robert Clayton and bassist Robert Hayes died in a horrific traffic accident which also claimed the life of performer Deacon Lunchbox. The accident occurred as the band was returning to Atlanta after performing in Montgomery, AL. After The Jody Grind broke up in 1992, Taft formed Kick Me, with Allen Page (of Opal Foxx Quartet) and Kelly Hogan (of The Jody Grind). They recorded several songs that eventually came out on a compilation album called Hidden Tracks, released by Daemon Records. Kick Me broke up after Allen Page died of a drug overdose. . Smoke recorded two full-length CDs and several compilation tracks, playing until 1999 when lead singer Benjamin died of hepatitis C. A year after Benjamin died, Taft started Hubcap City, which continues to this day. He has also started Another Evening with the Garbageman, an open-mic spoken word project similar to An Evening with the Garbageman.

It was screened in the Dramatic Competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, and received a limited theatrical release on March 6, 2009. Plot A 9-year-old girl, Phoebe (Elle Fanning), has apparent Tourette syndrome. While she deals with being odd and insecure, her mother (Felicity Huffman) and father (Bill Pullman) are dealing with complexities in their relationship with each other and their challenging child. Her younger sister (Bailee Madison) feels neglected as Phoebe gains more attention. Phoebe seeks a role in her school's play, Alice In Wonderland, directed by her school's off-beat drama teacher, Miss Dodger (Patricia Clarkson). Phoebe flourishes on stage, relaxing and feeling normal, but her impulsive speech and behavior persist off stage. Her parents hire a therapist for her, but after he proposes medication, Phoebe's mother fires him. She does not want to accept that there is anything wrong with Phoebe; when the principal questions if Phoebe behaves oddly outside of the classroom, her mother denies it even though she has many times witnessed her daughter's self-destructive rituals at home. When Phoebe is taken out of the play due to her classroom behavior, her dreams are shattered. Her mother, desperate to help her daughter feel normal, works with the drama teacher to bring Phoebe back on stage. Although Phoebe is put back into the play, her challenges continue as she is driven to behavior she doesn't understand. She hurts herself jumping off the catwalk onto the stage, and the drama teacher is fired. Phoebe's fellow-actors descend into chaos, but Phoebe alone clings to a sense of purpose. She urges her classmates to continue their rehearsals on their own, and they do. Her mother, who has resisted efforts to label Phoebe, tells Phoebe that she has Tourette syndrome, and Phoebe helps her classmates understand her by explaining the condition to them.

The term refers to the phenomenon of businesses failing abruptly after a period of apparent success, where this failure is brought about by the very elements that led to their initial success. It alludes to Icarus of Greek mythology, who drowned after flying too close to the Sun. The failure of the very wings that allowed him to escape imprisonment and soar through the skies was what ultimately led to his demise, hence the paradox.  Overview  In many industries, extremely successful businesses often face problems maintaining their success. Of the companies in the 1966 Fortune 100, 66 no longer existed by 2006, 15 still existed but were no longer on the list, and only 19 remained on the list. In a 1992 article, Miller noted that successful companies tend to fail precisely because of their strengths and past victories, which engendered over-confidence and lulled them into complacency. The characteristics that drove their success such as tried-and- true business strategies, dauntless and self-assured management, signature products and the reciprocal action and overall combination of all these elements when employed in excess may ultimately lead to declining sales and profits and even bankruptcy. This happens as managers make unwise decisions based on past strategies that they mistakenly believe will always be relevant and companies exploit as much as possible the strategies that contributed to their success, centralise their focus on the products that launched their brand and become blinded to changes in the external business environment.  Reasons for failure  According to Miller, success seduces companies into failure through fostering overconfidence, complacency, specialisation, exaggeration, dogma and ritual. Most successful firms owe their fortune to a unique competitive formula. As the company continues to grow, the manager's confidence in this winning formula is bolstered. Eventually, the firm ends up focusing only on refining and extending the strategies, products and values that propelled their success. Any other activities are neglected or even discouraged. This may be profitable in the short run as companies continue to specialise and improve in a certain product or strategy, leading to higher efficiency, sales and growth as they cultivate their competitive advantage in that particular area. In the long run, however, this attitude is unsustainable. They become unable to keep up with the threats of new competitors, changing consumer demands, newly developed business models and changes in the external environment. Some examples are Laura Ashley, Atari, Digital Equipment, Tupperware and Revlon. = Overconfidence and complacency = Failures in business projects happen all too often. Firms tend to invest too much and too long in activities that are elementally inoperative in its design or concept. Some examples are Merrill Lynch, RBS, AIG, Citibank, Lehman Brothers and Fresh & Easy. Most large capital investment projects come in late and over budget, never living up to expectations. Over 70% of new manufacturing plants in North America, for example, close within the first decade of operations. Around 75% of mergers and acquisitions do not pay off ‚Äì the acquiring firm's shareholders lose more than the acquired firm's shareholders gain. The vast majority of efforts to break into new markets are abandoned within a few years. Standard economic theory explains the high rate of failures as an inevitable result of companies taking rational risks in the face of uncertain situations. The rewards of a few successes outweigh losses incurred from many failures in the long run. Executives know this and accept the risk. This theory absolves them from blame ‚Äì they were simply making rational risks after all. Lovallo and Kahneman argue, however, that most of these failures are actually the results of flawed decision making. When predicting the outcomes of risky projects, executives easily fall victim to what psychologists call the planning fallacy. They make decisions based on delusional optimism instead of on rational weighing of gains, losses and probabilities. They spin scenarios of success while overlooking potential problems. Consequently, they pursue initiatives that are unlikely to succeed. Research into human cognition has traced this over-optimism to many sources.  Natural tendency  Humans have a native tendency to exaggerate their own talents, so many executives believe they are above average in their endowment of positive traits and abilities. This is amplified by the tendency to misperceive causes of certain events. People tend to take credit for positive outcomes and attribute negative outcomes to external factors. A study of letters to shareholders in annual reports, for example, found that executives tend to attribute favourable outcomes to factors under their control, like corporate strategy or R&D; programmes. Unfavourable outcomes were more likely to be attributed to uncontrollable external factors like the weather or inflation. People also tend to exaggerate the control we have over events, discounting the role of luck.  The illusion of control  Managers explicitly deny the role of chance in affecting the outcome of their plans. They see risk as a challenge to be met by their skills, and believe that results are determined purely by actions they and their organisation have taken. In making forecasts, they therefore tend to ignore or downplay the possibility of random, uncontrollable occurrences that may impede their progress towards a goal.  Anchoring  In making forecasts about a project, executives and their subordinates typically have a preliminary plan drawn up by whomever proposed the initiative, which is then adjusted based on market research, financial analysis or their own professional judgement, before deciding on how to proceed. This process has some serious pitfalls, however. The initial plan tends to accentuate the positive because as a proposal, it was designed to make the case for the project as compelling as possible, thus skewing the subsequent analysis towards over-optimism. Anchoring can be especially pernicious when it comes to forecasting the costs of major capital projects. Executives often fail to build in enough contingency funds to cover overruns because they are anchored to their original cost estimates and do not sufficiently adjust them to account for possible delays, problems and expansions of project scope. A study by Rand Corporation found that the construction costs of 44 chemical-processing plants owned by major companies such as 3M, DuPont and Texaco are, on average, more than double the initial estimates. Furthermore, about half produced less than 75% of their design capacity and a quarter produced less than 50%. Most plants had their performance expectations permanently lowered and the owners never realised a return on their investments.  Competitor neglect  In making forecasts, executives tend to focus on their own company's capabilities and plans and are thus prone to neglect the potential abilities and actions of rivals. Again, this results in underestimation of negative events such as price wars, overcapacity etc. This is particularly destructive in ventures to enter new markets. When a company identifies a rapidly growing market well suited to its products and capabilities, it often rushes to gain a beachhead in it, investing heavily in production capacity and marketing. However, attractive pro forma forecasts of financial results that motivate this expansion rarely account for other competitors also targeting the same market. As all these companies invest at the same time, supply outstrips demand and the new market quickly becomes unprofitable.  Organisational pressure  Each firm has a limited amount of time and capital to be invested into new projects. There is intense competition for this time and money as individuals and units jockey to present their own proposals as being the most potentially lucrative. There are thus large incentives for these individuals and units to accentuate the positives in predicting outcomes. As a result, it ensures that forecasts used in planning are overoptimistic (which later distorts all further analysis). Also, it increases the odds that the projects chosen for investment are the ones with the most over-optimistic forecasts, and hence the highest probability of disappointment. Other organisational practices also encourage over-optimism. For example, senior executives tend to stress the importance of stretch goals for their business units. This may increase motivation, but it also leads to unit managers further skewing their forecasts towards improbably rosy outcomes. Additionally, organisations may discourage pessimism, which is perceived as disloyalty. Other employees shun the bearer of bad news. Suppressing pessimistic opinions while rewarding optimistic ones will cripple an organisation's ability to think critically and analyse objectively.  Machiavelli factor  The Machiavelli factor is defined by Flybjerg in his review of Lovallo and Kahneman's work in 2003 as the deliberate \\"cooking\\" of forecasts in order to get ventures started. Flyjberg opines that adjusting forecasts due to political pressures can hardly be called optimism or a fallacy ‚Äì deliberate deception would be more accurate. He believes that Lovallo and Kahneman's analysis of the planning fallacy is valid only when political pressures are insignificant. In his study of bias in cost and demand forecasting in capital-investment transport projects, he found strong evidence of substantial political pressures on executives to make rosy forecasts ‚Äì and minor penalties for having made them. The study covered 7 decades, and in that time span, forecasters made constant errors of the same magnitude and frequency, leading to repeated cost overruns and demand failures. For example, urban rail investments had average cost overruns of 45% in constant prices and demand was 50% lower than predicted. He found similar patterns in date for other types of investments. Over-optimism is responsible for this phenomenon only if inexperienced forecasters were involved. Given that humans can, and do, learn from experience, however, it is unlikely that forecasters continually make the same errors for so many years. Over time, forecasters should have learnt to avoid being over-optimistic and accuracy of cost and demand estimates should improve. His data, however, shows that this has not happened. After testing his data for technical, economic, psychological and political factors that may induce bias in forecasting, Flyvberg concluded that political explanations fit best. If indeed executives are purposely cooking their estimates due to organisational pressure, they will have little incentive to accept the outside view. = Dogma, ritual and specialisation = There are perils associated with following a certain system, even a winning one, for too long. Clear commitments are required for initial success, but these commitments harden with time and ultimately constrain a firm's ability to adapt when its competitive environment shifts. As the market environment evolves, the fresh competitive formula that led to a firm's initial success instead becomes a rigid set of rules that dictate and confine their strategies. This dynamic can lead good firms to go bad, even when executives avoid arrogance and complacency. To win in the market, executives must make a set of commitments that together constitute the organisation's success formula. A distinctive success formula focuses employees, confers efficiency, attracts resources, and differentiates the company from rivals. Five categories of commitments comprise the success formula: *Strategic frames: What we see when we look at the world, including definition of industry, relevant competitors and how to create value. *Processes: How we do things around here entailing both informal and formal routines. *Resources: Tangible and intangible assets that we control which help us compete, such as brand, technology, real estate, expertise, etc. *Relationships: Established links with external stakeholders including investors, technology partners or distributors *Values: Beliefs that inspire, unify and identify us. Although commitments are essential for initial success, they tend to harden over time. Initial success reinforces management's belief that they should fortify their success formula. With time and repetition, people stop considering alternatives to their commitments, and take them for granted. When the environment shifts, a gap can grow between what the market demands and what the firm does. Managers see the gap, often at an early stage, and respond aggressively to close it. But their hardened commitments channel their responses into well-worn ruts. The harder they work, the wider the gap becomes. The result is active inertia. According to Sull's paper in 1999, active inertia ‚Äì an organisation's tendency to follow established behavioural patterns ‚Äì encompasses and details the ways success can eventually breed failure.  Frames become blinders  Strategic frames are the mind-sets that help managers evaluate how and what the business is doing, judge the market they are operating in, determine the importance of each segment of customers and decide on how to best increase the value of their firms. Strategic frames provide focus and fit new information into a broader pattern. They help managers focus among the flurry of raw information they are bombarded with each day. Managers can see patterns in raw data by fitting them into a familiar information model. They can quickly judge the potential of new product ideas by seeing whether or not they fit in with the existing ‚Äústyle‚Äù of the company. However, as the managers‚Äô attention is drawn consistently to particular details and into certain frameworks, they eventually begin to believe that these are the only things that work and matter. Essentially, frames can constrict managers‚Äô peripheral vision, blinding them to novel opportunities and threats. As their strategic frames grow more rigid, managers often shoe-horn surprising information into existing frames or ignore it altogether. Consider NatWest Bank (National Westminster until 1995). At its foundation, National Westminster's executives committed to a clear set of strategic frames‚Äîretail banking is stagnant and UK suffering irreversible decline. The bank diversified into the US, Europe, Far East and Soviet Union and expanded into new financial services. When the Big Bank deregulation heightened competition, rivals such as Lloyds TSB refocused on their domestic retail business. NatWest, in contrast, responded by accelerating geographic and product diversification. Critics blasted NatWest throughout the 1990s for waiting too long to divest money-losing distractions until RBS acquired NatWest in 2000. The evolution of the French military strategy in the first half of this century is a prime example. Initially, they emphasized attack, believing it to be the way to win against all odds. This strategy, however, wrought only disaster for them during World War I, leading France to adopt instead a purely defensive strategy. This is reflected in the construction of the Maginot Line to protect France's borders from invasion by Germany. Unfortunately, this defence proved futile in stopping the Blitzkrieg attacks. So in effect, the lessons they gleaned from World War I led them to tragedy in World War II. As strategic frames become entrenched, companies keep fighting the way they did in the last \\"war\\".  Processes become routines  In the beginning, employees in a company will usually test out different ways of carrying out tasks until they find one that works exceptionally well. Once they do, they tend to lock into this one method and no longer try to find alternatives that may work better. Sticking to one particular process improves productivity and efficiency by freeing up employees‚Äô time and the predictability of using the same method time and time again provides the stability and predictability need to organise effectively the activities in a large and complex firm. Over time, these routines resist change. With repetition, processes become second nature; people stop thinking of them as a means to an end, if they think of them at all. When the environment shifts, managers‚Äô commitments to existing processes trigger an actively inert response. Consider Compaq, which grew to sales of $3.6 billion in its first eight years based on processes that consistently produced high quality products. Manufacturing routines made quality the first priority (and cost a distant fifth) while the product development process sacrificed speed and thrift to get the product specs 100% right every time. Compaq's quality-at- any-price processes served the company well in the early days of the PC industry when customers worried about the product's usability and low-cost alternatives were rare. As PCs became commodities and nimble rivals like Dell rose to the fore, competition shifted to value for money. Compaq relied on its well-honed processes to churn out gold-plated products priced to gather dust on dealers‚Äô shelves.  Resources become millstones  Specialized resources build competitive advantage that rivals cannot easily replicate. Shifts in the competitive environment, however, can devalue established resources. Major airlines historically competed on the strength of their hub- and-spoke systems in which the carriers controlled valuable real estate at hub airports and a fleet optimised for this business model. The rise of low-cost upstarts such as Southwest and Ryanair depressed industry pricing and poached customers. Traditional carriers could not easily redeploy their hubs and planes to compete cost-effectively against new entrants.  Relationships become shackles  To be successful, consumers must build and maintain strong relationships with their various stakeholders ‚Äì employees, customers, suppliers, investors etc. Managers commit to external relationships by investing in specialized facilities to serve a key customer, for example, or writing long-term service contracts. These relationships can make or break a company‚Äîthink of Microsoft and Intel or Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Over time, however, maintaining these established relationships shackles a firm and limits its flexibility to act appropriately, especially when market conditions change. These relationships become shackles. *Relationships with customers: Companies cannot focus on new markets or on developing new products, as they need to maintain a good relationship with their existing consumer base. For example, in the 1980s, Kirin Brewery was slow to offer trendy dry beers, which were increasingly popular among younger drinkers, because they did not want to estrange their main market of Japanese businessmen. Consequently, Asahi Breweries beat them and became the new leader of the post-war Japanese beer market. *Relationships with employees: For example, Apple's relaxed and innovation-driven corporate culture had attracted some of the best engineers to work for them, who invented smashingly successful products. As computers became more commonplace, Apple had to keep costs down and market new products more quickly. This required discipline that Apple was reluctant to impose for fear of alienating their creative employees. Strict control deviated from Apple's corporate culture and the engineers were too comfortable to change their ways, hence making it difficult for managers to impose control and hindering it from responding to market changes more efficiently. Another example is Banc One. Their strategy was to acquire local banks, retain the managers and grant them enough freedom to run their businesses. This encouraged the managers to be more entrepreneurial and attentive to environmental changes. As the banking industry was deregulated and consolidated, Banc One started to struggle. The high operating costs due to decentralisation made them inefficient, but Banc One was slow to standardise and centralise their back-office operations because they did not want to restrict the autonomy of the bank managers. Their performance only improved after their CEO, John B. McCoy, dropped the uncommon partnerships with the managers entirely. *Relationships with external allies: The Daewoo Group, which at its peak approached $20 billion in revenues and employed two hundred thousand worldwide before falling into bankruptcy. Daewoo owed much of its growth to cosy relationships with South Korea's General Park, who ruled the country with an iron fist for nearly two decades. Park supported Daewoo and other favored conglomerates with financing and tariffs. In exchange, Daewoo invested in industries targeted for expansion. When subsequent governments ended policies that favored the conglomerates, Daewoo's Chairman Kim tightened links with remaining friendly Korean politicians, and forged bonds with politicians in emerging markets such as Vietnam, the Sudan and Uzbekistan to replicate cozy relationships at home.  Values becomes dogmas  A company's values unify its people. Strong values can elicit fierce loyalty from employees, strengthen the bonds between a company and its customers, attract like-minded partners, and hold together a company's far-flung operations. These entrenched beliefs define how they see themselves and the firm. However, as companies mature, these values may become a rigid set of rules that oppress and not inspire. For example, Polaroid's employees once prided themselves on the company's cutting edge innovations. It valued technological breakthroughs first and foremost. Other business activities such as marketing and finance were deemed unimportant as long as they were technologically up-to-date. Polaroid's managers then invested heavily in research, without considering changes in the consumer's tastes. Consequently, sales declined. Shell is another company hindered by their values. In the 1930s, Henri Deterding, a Nazi sympathiser and strong leader dominated Shell. When he was finally forced out, the company grew distasteful of centralised management, leading to the rise of extremely independent country managers. While Shell's decentralisation allowed it to quickly grow globally, it also prevented Shell from quickly cutting costs and rationalising its operations when oil prices fell in the 1990s. Also consider Laura Ashley who founded her company to defend traditional British values under siege from miniskirts. Laura Ashley's commitment to traditional values of modesty initially appealed to many women but lost their appeal as more women entered the workforce. The company, however, continued to pursue the old-fashioned designs that represents their fossilised core values, leading to their irreversible decline.  The paradox of information systems  Drummond suggests in her paper in 2008 that computer-based information systems can undermine or even destroy the organisation that they were meant to support, and it is precisely what makes them useful that makes them destructive ‚Äì a phenomenon encapsulated by the Icarus Paradox. For examples, a defence communication system is designed to improve efficiency by eliminating the need for meetings between military commanders who can now simply use the system to brief one another or answer to a higher authority. However, this new system becomes destructive precisely because the commanders no longer need to meet face-to-face, which consequently weakened mutual trust, thus undermining the organisation. Ultimately, computer-based systems are reliable and efficient only to a point. For more complex tasks, it is recommended for organisations to focus on developing their workforce. A reason for the paradox is that rationality assumes that more is better, but intensification may be counter-productive. = The irrationality of rationality = Rationality means calculation of the most efficient means of accomplishing a particular end. Taylor's brand of rationality recommends the separation of the conception of work to its actual execution ‚Äì the management assume control of work processes and methods and the employees simply carry out their given tasks. These tasks should be spliced into small portions requiring minimal training or knowledge to minimise costs and increase efficiency. This theory offers four benefits: efficiency, predictability, calculability and control. At some point though, irrationality of rationality sets in ‚Äì a paradox whereby rational systems of production produce patently absurd results. Specifically, using computers to control work processes and de-skill execution may be efficient, but beyond a certain point this becomes counter-productive as computers observe the law of diminishing returns An information system becomes destructive when it undermines the organisational structure. This situation arises due to a mismatch between espoused theory and theory-in-use (i.e. practice). = How computers can be destructive = *Computers can only deal with well-structured problems. As a result, complex cases are reduced to yes/no situations that computers can handle. *Employees mindlessly follow the system. This leads to a higher frequency of mistakes and lack of drive and motivation. *Over-reliance upon computers in decision-making *Information systems change how an organisation is perceived. For example, banking is now perceived as commodities due to the internet, which forces banks to consider e-opening branches in order to re-establish their brand image. = Recommendations for practice = Computers become counter-productive where more nuanced work is involved. It is thus most important to establish the limits to which information systems should control a firm. Making optimal use of information technology does not mean using computers for everything. Until more intelligent technology is invented that can handle complexity, the most effective organisations are not the ones with the most advanced and comprehensive information systems but the ones that recognise the limits of their systems.  Case studies = Fresh & Easy = A prime example of the Icarus Paradox at work would be Tesco's experimental venture into the U.S. market - Fresh & Easy. After making a loss of ¬£1.2bn ($1.8bn), sending Tesco's net profit down 96%, Tesco decided to finally pull out of the U.S.. Fresh & Easy has around 200 stores in Arizona, California and Nevada. They failed for several reasons: *Tesco opened the chain in 2007 right before the subprime mortgage crisis hit, which severely adversely impacted consumer spending. *Tesco did not expect online grocery shopping to be as popular as it was. *Tesco's research misjudged the spending habits of their consumer base. While their Metro stores in the UK were popular, there was not enough demand for grab-and-go meals in the US. This is a new concept in the US where, unlike in Europe, most people would usually order take out or cook their own meals. Purchasing such meals are also more expensive for customers than buying groceries and cooking meals themselves. *In the US, most shoppers only buy their groceries once a week, and they do so in bulk and purchase a large variety of products, while Europeans tend to make more frequent, but smaller trips to the grocery stores. *According to Marc Levinson, author of \\"The Great A&P; and the Struggle for Small Business in America\\", Fresh & Easy was not unique and had flaws that Tesco had no time to fix due to shareholder pressure. He also believed that Tesco had an inaccurate model of the US market and underestimated the effort required to adapt to changes in said market. *\\"It (Tesco) was engaging in hubris, and that brings arrogance. You lose touch with your customers,\\" said Clive Black, an analyst from Shore Capital in London watching Tesco. He believes that the US market was simply too different from the UK and that Tesco's aggressive geographical expansion strategy only detracts from their focus in the changing UK market. In Fresh & Easy's case, TESCO's confidence in bringing its successful concept of ready meals to the US market contributed heavily to its failure. The intensive marketing required to change people's daily consumption habits take time and money, neither of which TESCO invested enough of. TESCO was also confident enough to continue to hang on for over 5 years despite indications of possible failure - In 2009, Fresh&Easy; made a loss of ¬£142m, up from ¬£62m in 2008. This is a case of overconfidence and specialisation leading to the demise of a potentially successful business. = Firestone Tire and Rubber Company = Firestone Tire and Rubber Company was a leading player in the US tire industry, but failed to meet the challenge of change because they did not act appropriately. Entering the 1970s, Firestone had enjoyed 7 decades of uninterrupted growth. Their main rival was Goodyear, also based in Akron, Ohio, and a few other leading US tire producers. Firestone saw their challenge as simply keeping up with the steadily increasing demand for tires. Strategy: *Strong company culture and loyalty: The company's culture and operations reflected Harvey Firestone, Sr.‚Äôs vision, who treated customers and employees as part of the ‚ÄúFirestone family‚Äù. They had a country club open to all employees, regardless of rank, and Harvey himself maintained close relationships with the top executives of big carmakers. They had fiercely loyal managers, all of whom believed in the company's family values and Akron-centred worldview. *Focus on maximising output: The company's operating and capital allocation processes were designed to maximise output and exploit the booming demand for tires. In the capital- budgeting process for examples, frontline employees identified market opportunities and translated them into proposals for investing in additional capacity. Top executives then speedily approves recommendations made by middle managers regarding the most promising proposals. Firestone's long-standing success gave them a strong, unified sense of their strategies and values, their relationships with employees and customers and their investments and operating processes. This formula worked well for them, until the French company Michelin introduced the radial tire to the US market. Radials were safer, lasted longer and more economical than traditional tires. They had already dominated the European market and were soon going to dominate US markets as well, which Firestone very well knew. Their large operations in Europe had seen how quickly the market embraced radial tires in the 1960s, so they immediately invested almost $400m in radial production, building a new plant dedicated to manufacturing radial tires and converting a few existing factories. However, Firestone failed to respond effectively to radial technology due to their routinised system. They attempted to tweak their existing processes to allow for radial manufacturing, thereby causing production and quality problems. As US demand for tires plateaued, mainly due to radial tires lasting longer than conventional tires, Firestone's CEO stubbornly assumed that demand was ever-growing and made no move to close plants. They made tires for which there was not enough demand because their budgets encouraged excessive investments in capacity, driven by frontline managers who did not want their own plants to close. Additionally, Firestone was shackled by its relationships with its employees. Its loyalty-focused hiring and promotion process resulted in Firestone failing to recruit newcomers to introduce fresh opinions. Even as the market environment changed, Firestone insisted on hiring ‚Äúpeople like us.‚Äù In 1972, all its top managers had never worked anywhere else and one-third continued their father's legacy as Firestone executives. By 1979, Firestone was in deep trouble. Their plants were running at 59% capacity and they started renting warehouses to store unsold stocks. They also made costly product recalls that damaged their reputation. Firestone's domestic tire business lost over $200m in cash. Eventually, Firestone lost most of their market share to foreign firms and went through two hostile takeover bids before Bridgestone finally acquired them in 1988. = Laura Ashley = Laura Ashley is another victim to active inertia. The company was started in 1953 with a vision of re-creating the British countryside. Their style referred to the romantic image of English ladies tending roses at their country manors, and it resonated with many women in the 1970s. The business rapidly expanded from a single silk-screen press to a major retailer with 500 shops and a globally famous brand. Laura Ashley expanded her business not for profits, but to protect and promote British values, which she felt were threatened by sex, drugs and miniskirts in the 1960s. She exercised tight control over her business ‚Äì design, manufacturing, distribution and retailing were kept in-house. In 1985, Laura died and her husband, Bernard, continued the company on the same course his wife had set. Fashion, however, evolved. As more women entered the workplace, they began to prefer more practical styles over Laura Ashley's romantic garb, which was dismissed as suited to milkmaids in the 1880s rather than CEOs in the 1980s. Apparel manufacturing was also transformed by the fall of trade barriers ‚Äì fashion houses were moving production offshore or outsourcing it entirely in order to cut costs. However, Laura Ashley continued with the out-dated designs and expensive production processes that had served it so well in the past. By the late 1980s, an external consultant outlined remedial actions to overcome the challenges Laura Ashley was facing. Bernard brought in new CEOs to restructure the business to increase sales and cut costs. Unfortunately, none of the many plans were bold enough in recasting the company's image and strategy. Laura Ashley stuck to its traditional values and it remained unclear whether Laura Ashley was a manufacturer, retailer or brand. Laura Ashley was by then afflicted with active inertia. It changed CEOs 6 times in 10 years, yet its decline continued. = Xerox = Xerox is a case study on how strategic frames can blind the management from changes in the market environment. In the 1970s, Xerox's management analysed the market and singled out IBM and Kodak as their main competitors. This mind-set helped Xerox defend its market share. However, Xerox was so focused on IBM and Kodak that it ignored the threat of new entrants: Canon, Ricoh and Sevin. These newcomers targeted the lower-end market and niche segments to sell their high-quality copiers, surely establishing their positions. Xerox's manufacturing process, and hence product prices, were costly and the quality of their products were subpar relative to the competition. It also suffered from its highly autocratic management. As a result of this, return on assets fell to less than 8% and marketshare in copiers came down sharply from 86% in 1974 to just 17% in 1984. Between 1980 and 1984, Xerox's profits decreased from $1.15 billion to $290 million. In 1982, David T. Kearns took over as CEO and quickly launched initiatives to hedge their share losses ‚Äì cutting costs and reinforced quality control through its benchmarking program ‚Äì and was successful. However, it then became so focused on battling the Japanese that Xerox was unprepared to fight the upcoming war waged for the personal computer. While Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre pioneered several technologies that impelled the rise of the personal computer (the mouse and the graphical user interface), Xerox did not grab the new opportunities this posed as they were outside its strategic frames.

Background  Wang Jishan was born in 618, around the time of the founding of Tang Dynasty. His family was from Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei). His father Wang Jun'e (ÁéãÂêõÊÑï) had, at the end of Tang's predecessor Sui Dynasty, served under the agrarian rebel leader Wang Junkuo (ÁéãÂêõÂªì), and after Tang was founded, surrendered to Tang with Wang Junkuo and subsequently served as a Tang general. Wang Jun'e participated in Emperor Taizong's campaign against Goguryeo, and died in 645 during the Battle of Mount Zhubi (ÈßêÈ©ÜÂ±±). Emperor Taizong posthumously created him the Duke of Xing. After Wang Jun'e's death, Wang Jishan inherited the title of Duke of XingWang's biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that he was 13 when he inherited his father's title. However, if the 618 birth date is correct (and both the Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang indicated that it was), Wang Jishan would be 27 at the time of Wang Jun'e's death. The New Book of Tang gave no age for Wang Jishan at the time of Wang Jun'e's death. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 90 with New Book of Tang, vol. 116. and was given the additional honorific title of Chaosan Daifu (ÊúùÊï£Â§ßÂ§´).  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  During the reign of Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong, Wang Jishan served on the staff of his son and crown prince Li Hong. Once, Li Hong gathered his staff members for a gave of zhidao (Êì≤ÂÄí, probably traversing on one's hands with feet in the air). When Wang's turn was up, he opined that there were people whose responsibilities were to entertain the crown prince, and that it was inappropriate for staff members to be participating in the game. Li Hong thanked him and excused him. When Emperor Gaozong heard this, he awarded Wang with silk and made him a commanding general of the imperial guards, commenting, \\"I know that you are faithful and diligent, and that is why I give you an office of the third rank.Tang officials were ranked from first rank to ninth rank in order of importance, and third rank was considered a high honor, as first and second ranks were rarely conferred. Other people need to be searched before they could enter the palace, but you are allowed to holster a large sword to be by my side. Do you understand the honor that this is?\\" Soon thereafter, however, Wang was dismissed on account of illness, but later on was made the minister of military supplies (Ë°õÂ∞âÂçø, Weiwei Qing).  During Emperor Ruizong's first reign  During the first reign of Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Ruizong (Li Hong's younger brother, as Li Hong having predeceased Emperor Gaozong), with Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) serving as empress dowager and regent, Wang Jishan served as the minister of imperial clan affairs (Âè∏Â±¨Âçø, Sishu Qing). During a famine in the region east of the Taihang Mountains, Wang served as the coordinator of famine relief. He then successively served as the minister of rites (Êò•ÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Chunguan Shangshu), the commandant at Qin Prefecture (Áß¶Â∑û, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu), and then the secretary general at Yi Prefecture (ÁõäÂ∑û, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan). He eventually requested retirement on account of old age and illness.  During Wu Zetian's reign  In 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as \\"emperor,\\" establishing a new Zhou Dynasty and interrupting Tang. During a Khitan attack in 697, Wu Zetian requested Wang Jishan to come out of retirement to serve as the prefect of Hua Prefecture (ÊªëÂ∑û, roughly modern Anyang, Henan),Wang's biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that he was asked to serve as the prefect of Hua Prefecture, and this was followed by the Zizhi Tongjian. However, the New Book of Tang indicated that he was asked to serve as the prefect of Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan). Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 90 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 206, with New Book of Tang, vol. 116. stating to him, \\"The thieves on the border have rebelled. Even though you are ill, you can head slowly to your post 30 li a day [(i.e., 15 kilometers a day)]) with your wife and children. Even if you can only govern the prefecture while lying on your bed, you can cut off the Yellow River for me.\\" She then inquired him as to his opinion on a number of central government affairs. He gave her some 10-odd items of opinion. She, in turn, responded, \\"A prefecture is unimportant compared to the important matters of the central government. You must not leave.\\" She then made him Neishi (ÂÖßÂè≤), the head of the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge) and a post considered one for a chancellor. Later that year, when her secret police official Lai Junchen were accused of crimes warranting death and yet she considered pardoning Lai on account of his contributions to her in the past, Wang pointed out that Lai had falsely killed many virtuous officials and that he must be killed. Wu Zetian agreed and executed Lai. In 698, the chancellor Di Renjie advocated that Wu Zetian recall Emperor Ruizong's older brother Li Zhe the Prince of Luling, himself a former emperor, from exile, an opinion that Wang Jishan and fellow chancellor Wang Fangqing shared. With her close advisor Ji Xu and her lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong advocating the same, she agreed and recalled Li Zhe, soon changing his name to Li Xian and making him crown prince. Later in 698, with rumors that Li Xian's crown prince position was not secure, Wang Jishan requested that Wu Zetian have Li Xian go to the central government buildings to meet with the officials, to quell the rumors, and she agreed. It was said that Wang was not well-studied, but was honest and upright in his acts. Around 699, at imperial feasts, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were often not acting in accordance with proper regulations for imperial subjects, and Wang often counseled Wu Zetian not to allow them to carry out these actions. This displeased her, and she told Wang, \\"You are old. It is not right that you be required to attend so many feasts. From now on, just tend to the matters of the legislative bureau.\\" Wang, in turn, claimed illness and requested sick leave. After taking leave for a month, Wu Zetian had not yet tried to see him. He sighed and stated, \\"How can the Son of Heaven not see someone as important as the head of the legislative bureau on a daily basis? This shows how unimportant I am viewed.\\" He then requested retirement, but she did not approve of it. Instead, she made him Wenchang Zuo Xiang (ÊñáÊòåÂ∑¶Áõ∏), one of the heads of the executive bureau (ÊñáÊòåËá∫, Wenchang Tai), and gave him the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫‰∏âÂìÅ), having him still serve as a chancellor de facto. He died a month later and was buried with honors, near the tomb of Emperor Gaozong, where Wu Zetian herself would eventually be buried as well.

Sleep Dealer depicts a dystopian future to explore ways in which technology both oppresses and connects migrants. A fortified wall has ended unauthorized Mexico-US immigration, but migrant workers are replaced by robots, remotely controlled by the same class of would-be emigrants. Their life force is inevitably used up, and they are discarded without medical compensation. Plot Sleep Dealer is set in a future, militarized world marked by closed borders, virtual labor and a global digital network that joins minds and experiences, where three strangers risk their lives to connect with each other and break the barriers of technology. Memo Cruz works at a factory, one of several sleep dealers. Here, workers are connected to the network via suspended cables that plug into nodes in their arms and back, allowing them to control the robots that have replaced them as unskilled labor on the other side of the border. The sleep dealers are called so because one may collapse if one works long enough. The story is told as a flashback, as Memo remembers his home in Santa Ana Del Rio, Oaxaca. His father wants him to participate in growing crops on the meager family homestead. Memo's passion, however, is electronics and hacking. The homestead also has dried up on account of a dam built nearby and owned by the private corporation Del Rio Water. Memo and his father must trek on foot to buy water by the bag, while monitored by security cameras armed with machine guns. The media on American hi-def TV shows glimpses of a technological dystopia, although in a positive light with superficial spin-doctoring. As a hobby, Memo is building an electronic receiver that can tap into communications. As he continues to work on it, its range increases to far away cities. One summer, a remote-controlled military aerial vehicle operated by the security forces of Del Rio Water catches Memo monitoring a frequency used by the drones, an act that warrants a brutal attack. He disconnects in time before the drone can locate him with certainty. On another occasion, he and his brother watch a live TV broadcast about a drone action that is about to destroy a building known to be intercepting drone communication. They quickly realize that the building is their own home where Memo has his equipment, and run to save their father whose life is in danger. However, they are too late, and the vehicle launches a rocket at the father, instantly killing him. The pilot of the drone is shown to be Rudy Ramirez. Memo boards a bus to the city Tijuana to find work. The same bus is also boarded by Luz Mart√≠nez. Memo notices that Luz has nodes on the wrist for interfacing with the digital network, and asks her where he can get them for free. She tells him that he can find someone, known as a coyotek, to connect him by asking around in a certain alley. Luz has loans and may default. She makes a living by uploading memories to an online memory trading company, TruNode, where viewers pay for content. She uploads her memory of meeting Memo. Memo is robbed of his money during his first attempt to seek a coyotek. He finds an abandoned shack in which to stay at the edge of the city, where other node workers live. Luz gets a sale for her memory of Memo, and a prepaid offer for her next memory of him. Luz finds him and comes to know he is out of money. She helps him get a node-job at a bar that has the equipment. It so happens that she is the coyotek, having learned from her ex-boyfriend, and she does him a favor. Luz tries to upload more experiences. TruNode makes her reveal feelings rather than just the story. The person who requested the information is revealed to be Ramirez working for Del Rio Water. Luz and Memo open up to each other and have a connected sex. Upon receiving the next upload, Ramirez has his doubts confirmed that his work made him kill a good man. Memo discovers that Luz has been paid to upload her memories of him, and so he leaves her feeling betrayed. He works over-time at the sleep-dealer, risking exhaustion. Luz writes to him and mails him a recording of her memories as a parting gift. In the meantime, Ramirez has crossed the fortified US-Mexican border to meet Memo. As Ramirez explains himself, Memo tries to run perceiving danger. Ramirez catches up and explains he was under orders and offers to help. Memo rejoins Luz and recruits her help to connect Ramirez into the network. He accesses the Del Rio Water security network to control one of the company's drones. Upon discovery that Ramirez is not heeding orders, Ramirez is pursued by other drones. After heated aerial dogfighting, Ramirez manages to blast a hole in the dam, directly where Memo's father had once tossed a pebble in helpless frustration. Memo receives news from his home and neighboring subsistence farms, celebrations of the return of ancestral waters, albeit not necessarily a permanent one. Ramirez goes farther south in Mexico as he is no longer able to return to his family in the US. Memo moves on with his life in Tijuana. Cast * Leonor Varela as Luz Mart√≠nez * Jacob Vargas as Rudy Ramirez * Luis Fernando Pe√±a as Memo Cruz Reception Sleep Dealer was generally well received by critics, with a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, The H.R. Giger Award for the Best International Film at The Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival, and a special mention Amnesty International Film Prize at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival. The film was nominated for the Breakthrough Director Award at the Gotham Independent Film Awards 2008, and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature in 2009. A.O. Scott, of The New York Times wrote \\"Exuberantly entertaining ‚Äî a dystopian fable of globalization disguised as a science- fiction adventure‚Ä¶. Mr. Rivera ‚Äî a brilliant young director ‚Äî takes his audience into a future of ‚Äúaqua-terrorism‚Äù and cyberlabor that I wish I could dismiss as implausible...\\" in his review of the 2008 New Directors/New Films Festival.Article from The New York Times, Mar 28th 2008, Big Ideas in Deceptively Small Packages Kenneth Turan, of the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"Adventurous, ambitious and ingeniously futuristic, \\"Sleep Dealer\\" is a welcome surprise. It combines visually arresting science fiction done on a budget with a strong sense of social commentary in a way that few films attempt, let alone achieve...\\" in his review of the film.Article from The Los Angeles Times, Apr 17th 2009, Movie Review: Sleep Dealer  Cultural Impact  Sleep Dealer‚Äôs cultural impact relates to its social commentary on contemporary issues through the lens of science-fiction. Javier Ram√≠rez remarks that Rivera‚Äôs ‚Äúinnovative deployment of science fiction encourages us to question our present reality, by projecting into the future.‚Äù Through his imagining of a possible future, Rivera critiques today‚Äôs issues including immigration, drone warfare, and technological advances. His film is part of the emerging genre of speculative fiction called Latinxfuturism or Chicanafuturism, of which both have roots in Afrofuturism. Latinxfuturism defamiliarizes the familiar and challenges the status quo of society by reimagining reality or providing alternative representations. In his film review in the New York Times, A.O. Scott writes that ‚ÄúMr. Rivera‚Äôs vision of Tijuana‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶an unsettlingly plausible extrapolation of what that city already represents.‚Äù In this way, Rivera uses the reality of what Tijuana and the maquiladoras represent for Mexicans and society as a whole to project a dystopic possibility of what its progress may become, making the audience question current conditions. The possibility of complete human exploitation of foreign labor markets through the use of nodes becomes a little less fictional with the referential point of Tijuana today, thus, defamiliarizing what is familiar. Arguably the most important cultural impact of the film, Sleep Dealer provides POC representation and humanizes political issues through characters such as Memo and Luz. David Montgomery of The Washington Post comments that the film ‚Äúputs a human face on all‚Äù the problems explored in the movie. The significance of seeing oneself in the stories told about the future is not lost on the film makers or its reviewers. Part of the goal of Latinxfuturist works is situating people of color as the protagonists in the representations of what our world could be. Montgomery goes on to comment, ‚ÄúThe whole world has a future, yet ‚ÄòSleep Dealer‚Äô is one of the first science fiction films largely set in the underdeveloped parts ‚Äî a milestone in film history.‚Äù The placing of bodies of color within a pre-existing system is part of the rebellion against hegemonic colonial narratives with which Latinxfuturism contends. The other Latinxfuturist path is creating alternative systems that people of color exist in without the restraints of the present reality. In Aimee Bahng‚Äôs book Migrant Futures, she points out that ‚ÄúSleep dealer argues for and instantiates the production of alternative futures that fight against not only obsolescence but also obfusciations of the past that paved the way for the colonization of the future.‚Äù That is to say, sleep dealer not only criticizes the current system but works to deconstruct the narrative mechanisms that uphold colonial influences. Sleep Dealer contributes to the Latinxfuturist works that try to represent people of color as well as reimagine a future without the colonialist androcentric oppressive forces that mark today‚Äôs society. = See also = * Speculative Fiction_(by_writers_of_color) * Weird Fiction ReferencesExternal links  Category:2008 films Category:2000s multilingual films Category:2008 science fiction films Category:Alfred P.

It follows the story of Miguel Santos, also known as Sugar (Algenis Perez Soto), a Dominican pitcher from San Pedro de Macor√≠s, struggling to make it to the big leagues and pull himself and his family out of poverty. Playing professionally at a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic, Miguel finally gets his break at age 19 when he advances to the United States' minor league system; but when his play on the mound falters, he begins to question the single-mindedness of his life's ambition. Plot Miguel \\"Sugar\\" Santos (Perez Soto) spends his weekends at home, passing from the landscaped gardens and manicured fields on one side of the guarded academy gate to the underdeveloped, more chaotic world beyond. In his small village outside San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Miguel enjoys a kind of celebrity status. His neighbors gather to welcome him back for the weekend; the children ask him for extra baseballs or an old glove. To his family, who lost their father years before, Miguel is their hope and shining star. With the small bonus he earned when he signed with the academy some time ago, he has started to build his family a new house‚Äîone that has a bigger kitchen for his mom and a separate room for his grandmother. After learning a devastating knuckle curve, Sugar is invited to spring training by the fictional Kansas City Knights. He is assigned to their Single A affiliate in Iowa, the Swing. He is housed by the Higgins family, who take in Swing players every year. Jorge (Rufino), a veteran player and the only other Dominican on the team, also tries to help Miguel learn the ropes. However, despite the Higgins' welcoming efforts and Jorge's guidance, the challenge of Miguel's acceptance into the community is exposed in small ways every day, from his struggle to communicate in the English language to an accident of casual bigotry at a local bar. Miguel's domination on the mound masks his underlying sense of isolation, until he injures himself during a routine play at first. While Miguel is on the disabled list, Jorge, his one familiar connection to home in this strange new place, is cut from the team, never fully regaining his ability following an off-season knee surgery. The new vulnerability of Miguel's injury, coupled with the loneliness of losing his closest friend, force Miguel to begin examining the world around him and his place within it. Pressure mounts when Salvador, a young pitching phenomenon who used to play with Miguel, is brought up from the Dominican Republic to join the team. Miguel's play falters, and the increased isolation begins to take its toll on him. As his dream begins to fall apart, Miguel decides to leave baseball to follow another kind of American Dream. His odyssey finally brings him to New York City, where at first he struggles to find community and make a new home for himself, like so many before him. Miguel ends up playing baseball with rejected players from the minor leagues.
