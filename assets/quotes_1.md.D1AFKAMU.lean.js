Selections from his correspondence with American composer George Rochberg were published in 2007.István Anhalt and George Rochberg, Eagle Minds: Selected Correspondence of Istvan Anhalt and George Rochberg, 1961–2005, edited by Alan M. Gillmor (Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2007). .  Early life and education  =Childhood= István Anhalt was born in Budapest, Hungary to a Jewish family on April 12, 1919.Elliott; Smith, p.19 He was son of Arnold Anhalt and Katalin Anhalt (née Herzfeld), When he was still an infant, Anhalt's parents separated; he lived with his mother until the age of twelve, attending elementary school from 1925 to 1929. Although she had some interest in serious music and opera, his mother was not especially musical, she did have a piano; Anhalt began taking piano lessons at the age of six with a teacher who lived in his neighborhood and later from a family friend until he was twelve years of age. From the age of ten, he attended the Dániel Berzsenyi Secondary school, failing several subjects at first but later excelling and graduating in 1937. He also attended outdoor musical performances on Margaret Island. At age twelve, Anhalt went to live with his father, who had remarried in 1931. Encouraged by his father's love of music, Anhalt developed a good ear for harmony, and taught himself to play the violin.Elliott; Smith, p.37 Anhalt learned to speak four languages, Hungarian, German, French, and English.Gillmor, p.40 His father's financial troubles, his half-sister's birth in 1935, and tension between him and his step mother led Anhalt to move again a few years later to stay with his maternal grandparents.Elliott; Smith, p.35 At about that time, Anhalt overheard László Gyopár, a peer from a neighboring school, play a piece he had composed himself at the piano. Anhalt recognized the influence of Bach on the piece, and, admiring Gyopár's compositional achievements, decided to learn how to write music and compose his own pieces.Elliott; Smith, p.38 Anhalt and Gyopár became good friends, and soon after, Anhalt began to receive private harmony lessons with Géza Falk. Gyopár was attending the Academy of Music at the time, where Anhalt audited Zoltán Kodály's class from 1936 to 1937 before passing the entrance exam and joining his friend at the academy. Anhalt studied piano with Kodaly at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music; he graduated with exceptional marks in 1941. He also continued his studies for the next year and a half by attending classes from Turkish linguistics to Folklore at Pázmány University and attending a seminar by János Ferencsik for conductors.Elliott; Smith, p.40 Anhalt was drafted into the forced labour service of the Hungarian Army in 1940 during World War II. = 1942: World War II = In 1942, during the Second World War, Anhalt and his best friend at the academy were both forced to enter a forced-labour brigade for young Jewish men. Anhalt's friend was killed by a soldier in the unit.Gesing, p.18 Anhalt escaped from the brigade, disguised himself as a seminarian, and hid until the war was over. He then made his way to Paris, where he had access to music teachers and abundant artistic stimulation.Gesing, p.20 In the late 1940s, he studied under Louis Fourestier, Nadia Boulanger and Soulima Stravinsky before emigrating to Canada in 1949.  Career  =Emigration to Canada and academic position= Anhalt emigrated to Canada in 1949, as a recipient of a Lady Davis Fellowship.Elliott; Smith, p.17 He settled in Montreal, and soon met Beate Frankenberg, a biochemist. The pair married in 1952, and together they have two daughters, Carol Greaves and Helen Jennifer Marcello, and two grandchildren.Gazette, C.11 For twenty two years Anhalt taught analysis and composition at McGill University in the Faculty of Music. He established the Theory and Composition Departments, He established the music composition program for the institution, was chairman for the Theory Department, and developed and directed the McGill University Electronic Music Studio (EMS). He composed continually during that time as well. Anhalt met George Rochberg at an International Conference of Composers at the Stratford Festival in Ontario during the summer of 1960, and the two became friends. Rochberg was born in New Jersey, and both come from a Jewish background.Sallis, p.472 = 1971–1984, move to Kingston = Anhalt's mixed work schedule of administration, composition, and teaching was one he carried with him to Kingston, Ontario in 1971 when he became the head of Queen's University's Department of Music. He remained in this position until 1981. He continued to teach at the university until 1984 when he retired. During his years at Queen's University, Anhalt continued to write, compose and teach. His composition La Tourangelle premiered in July 1975, and soon after he began to work on another piece, which would be his second opera, Winthrop. All the while, he also worked on his monograph Alternative Voices.Gillmor, p.38 He became a mentor for a number of his students, many of whom kept in touch with him until the final years of his life. =Retirement and death= After his retirement, Anhalt continued to composer, and to write scholarly and other articles. He died at the age of 92, on February 24, 2012, in Kingston, at St. Mary's of the Lake Hospital.  Composition  Anhalt is one of the earliest serious composers of electronic music. His music underwent changes over the years, and can be divided into four periods.Applebaum, p.3 Anhalt has a librettist for his dramatic works, beginning in 1969 with Foci, and ending in 1999 with Millennial Mall.Gillmor, p.33 = 1919–1958 = Anhalt's early composing focused on a variety of works for chorus, solo voice, ensembles, and instrumental soloists. This period ended with the finalization of his work Symphony No. 1, which won Anhalt both a national and an international reputation. = 1959–1961 = The next brief period in Anhalt's musical career was entirely dedicated to electronic music where he produced four compositions, and studying first-hand the newest developments and media during that time, in order to establish fresh and current concepts for his original work. = 1962–1971 = From 1962 until 1971 Anhalt reworked, consolidated and expanded his experiences during the two previous periods. He combined electronic sounds with the sounds of the chorus or the orchestra in his Symphony of Modules, Foci, and Cento. Anhalt also adopted a more flexible syntax, as well as a larger musical vocabulary to create new vocal and instrumental sounds. He began to use timbre, timing, and musical densities in new ways in his compositions.Applebaum, p.3-4 = 1971–2012 = La Tourangelle is the first of three large scale works created by Anhalt after 1971.Applebaum, p.4 It is an hour-long piece that premiered in 1975, in a performance broadcast by CBC Radio. This \\"musical tableau\\" was composed for an orchestra of 16 players, five singer-narrators, and pre-recorded tapes for five operators. Its theme is the pursuit of God and meaning, and is based on the life of one of the earliest French women to settle in Canada, Marie de l’Incarnation.Gesing, p.20 Winthrop is a parallel piece to La Tourangelle, but focused on English Canada. The story is based on John Winthrop, a 17th-century Englishman who was the founder and governor of Boston, Massachusetts. It was completed in March 1983, and calls for a mixed choir, six solo singers, an instrumental ensemble of no less than 30 players, and a boys’ choir. Anhalt described this \\"musical pageant\\" as an exploration into the spiritual and personal aspects of a man, depicting how these supply meaning and significance to his actions. Published in 1984, Alternative Voices is a written study of linguistics as a way of acquiring an understanding of the human voices’ potential in a choral compositional, as well as a contemporary vocal, context. In about 1967 Anhalt had started studies of the reflection of personalty through the voice in the composition classes he taught; he concentrated on this research while on his first sabbatical leave from 1976 to 1977.Elliott; Smith, p.97 The work received favourable reviews, and was included in the list the 1984 outstanding academic books by Choice.Elliott; Smith, p.100 In Alternative Voices, Anhalt makes recurrent references to some Canadian composers, as well as their music.Elliott; Smith, p.103 He discusses the role of Canadian music and composers in the context of present-day thought in contemporary Western art, music, and philosophy. Rhythm, theatre, poetry, performing techniques, sound, speech, and the roots of language and music are explored, their components interconnected, as well as their usage are examined. The publication of his work Alternative Voices and the finalization of Winthrop occurred in the same year that Anhalt retired from university teaching,.

Marine Shrimp grow-out pond on a farm in South Korea Commercial marine shrimp farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply, particularly to match the market demands of the United States, Japan, and Western Europe. The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 2.1 million tonnes in 1991, representing a value of nearly US$9 billion. About 30% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, particularly in China and Indonesia. The other 54.1% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico are the largest producers. The largest exporting nation is Indonesia. Shrimp farming has changed from traditional, small-scale businesses in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to growing shrimp at ever higher densities, and broodstock is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are of the family Penaeidae, and just two species – Litopenaeus vannamei (Pacific white shrimp) and Penaeus monodon (giant tiger prawn) – account for roughly 32.14% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial monocultures are very susceptible to diseases, which have caused several regional wipe-outs of farm shrimp populations. Increasing ecological problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both NGOs and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulation by governments. In 1999, a program aimed at developing and promoting more sustainable farming practices was initiated, including governmental bodies, industry representatives, and environmental organizations. Freshwater A farmer constructing a shrimp farm in Pekalongan, Indonesia Freshwater prawn farming shares many characteristics with, and many of the same problems as, marine shrimp farming. Unique problems are introduced by the developmental lifecycle of the main species (the giant river prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii).New, M. B.: Farming Freshwater Prawns; FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 428, 2002. ISSN 0429-9345. The global annual production of freshwater prawns in 2010 was about 670,000 tons, of which China produced 615,000 tons (92%).Data extracted from the FAO Fisheries Global Aquaculture Production Database for freshwater crustaceans. , the most recent data sets are for 2010 and sometimes contain estimates. Accessed October 21, 2012. Animal welfare Eyestalk ablation is the removal of one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) eyestalks from a crustacean. It is routinely practiced on female shrimps (or prawns) in almost every marine shrimp maturation or reproduction facility in the world, both research and commercial. The aim of ablation under these circumstances is to stimulate the female shrimp to develop mature ovaries and spawn. Most captive conditions for shrimp cause inhibitions in females that prevent them from developing mature ovaries. Even in conditions where a given species will develop ovaries and spawn in captivity, use of eyestalk ablation increases total egg production and increases the percentage of females in a given population that participate in reproduction. Once females have been subjected to eyestalk ablation, complete ovarian development often ensues within as little as 3 to 10 days.

After appearing in one story in 1968, the character lay dormant for almost 20 years. In 1984, Cobalt 60 was revived by Vaughn Bodē's son Mark Bodé and writer Larry Todd. Publication history Vaughn Bodē reputedly first drew the character Cobalt 60 on a piece of scratch paper in 1959. Nearly ten years later, in 1968, he wrote and drew a ten-page, black-and-white, pen- and-ink Cobalt 60 story for Ken Rudolph's sci-fi fanzine Shangri L'Affaires (a.k.a. Shaggy) #73. The story did not expound much on the character, instead concentrating on action and a thorough depiction of the story's setting. Bodē wrote a prose follow-up of the story, with pencil illustrations, for Shaggy #74. Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine Artist largely on the strength of Cobalt 60. In addition, the initial ten-page story was later republished in Witzend #7 (April 1970), in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Metal Hurlant in 1980, and in Epic Illustrated #27 (Dec. 1984). Although Bodē had created a cast of characters with whom he could populate a more involved story, he never did anything else with the material. (His son Mark Bodé said the project had made him too depressed.) In 1984, Cobalt 60 was revived via full-color art by Mark Bodé and a story scripted by Larry Todd (a former friend and collaborator of Vaughn Bodē's from the 1960s). These latter-day Cobalt 60 stories were serialized in the magazine Epic Illustrated starting with the December 1984 issue. Although the story included all of Vaughn Bodé's original elements, Mark Bodé said the finished product was more \\"lighthearted\\" than what he felt his father would have done. In 1988 The Donning Company/Starblaze Graphics published a 1988 Cobalt 60 book collection. The separate episodes were later gathered in four magazine-sized comics published in 1992 by Tundra Press. An additional Cobalt 60 episode by Todd and Mark Bodé, titled \\"Da Dust Devil,\\" appeared in Heavy Metal Overdrive (a Heavy Metal Special) vol. 9, #1 (1995).  Plot  Cobalt 60 takes place in a post- apocalyptic, Mad Max-like world inhabited by mutants, aliens, and other fantastic creatures. Its titular character embarks on a quest to avenge the death of his parents, murdered by the evil Strontium 90. After he succeeds in his quest, he inherits his father's kingdom, but prefers to return to his wild ways. Cobalt 60 is very violent and quite graphic in its action scenes.  Characters  * Cobalt 60 — carries a high-caliber carbine sniper rifle, a short revolver, and a trench knife * Strontium 90 — evil murderer who killed Cobalt 60's parents * Franklin Gothic Green * General History * Cordwainer Bigeye * Radio-men — Cobalt 60's enemies, they are technologically advanced and carry superior firepower, but lack the brutal skills for hand-to-hand combat. They instead rely upon larger mutants called Lopers.  Influence  The visual style of Ralph Bakshi's 1977 animated film Wizards is heavily indebted to Cobalt 60 and other works by Vaughn Bodē.Beck, Jerry (2005). \\"Wizards\\". The Animated Movie Guide.

In 1970 he pioneered Systems trading by using early punched card computers to test ideas on trading the markets. Seykota resided in Incline Village, Nevada, on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, but recently moved to Texas.  Career  As a young man he attended high school near The Hague, Netherlands and also lived in Voorburg. In 1970, he pioneered a computerized trading system (now known as Trading System) for the futures market for the brokerage house he and Michael Marcus were working for. Later, he decided to venture out on his own and manage a few of his client's accounts. Much of Seykota's success was attributed to his development and utilization of computerized trading systems to which he first tested on a mainframe IBM computer. Later on, the brokerage house he had been working for adopted his system for their trades. His interest in creating a computerized system was spawned after he read a letter by Richard Donchian on utilizing mechanical trend following systems for trading and also Donchian's 5- and 20-day moving average system. He was also inspired by the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre. His first trading system was developed based on exponential moving averages. Ed Seykota, Market Wizards Seykota improved this system over time, adapting the system to fit his trading style and preferences. With the initial version of the system being rigid, he later introduced more rules into the system in addition to pattern triggers and money management algorithms. Another aspect of his success was his genuine love for trading and his optimistic demeanour. This factor sustained his efforts to continuously improve on his system although he never changed the response indicators of the system and instead fine tuned market stimuli.  The Trading Tribe  In 1992, Seykota gathered together a group of traders to discuss their emotions, due to his concern that traders often allow their emotions to overrule their logic. They start gathering regularly and Seykota develops methods to support personal growth. Over the years it expands to include Tribes all over the world and people in many professions. Members help to develop a common set of practices Seykota calls TTP, the Trading Tribe Process.

Kaithal was previously a part of Karnal district and later, Kurukshetra district until 1 November 1989, when it became the headquarters of the Kaithal. It shares a border with the Patiala district of state Punjab and the Kurukshetra, Jind and Karnal districts of Haryana. Kaithal district is situated in the North-West of the Haryana state. Its North-West boundaries , which include Guhla-Cheeka are attached to Punjab. History =Mythology= Kaithal was known as Kapisthala during the Vedic period as seen in the map of the Indian subcontinent. Historically the city was known as Kapisthal, meaning \\"Abode of Kapi\\", another name of Lord Hanuman, and it is said to have been founded by the Pandava Emperor, Yudhishthira of Mahabharata. The later word Kaithal is said to be derived from Kapisthala. It is traditionally connected with Hanuman and has a temple dedicated to Anjani, the mother of Hanuman. It is also said that it is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman and there is a temple constructed at that place known as \\"Anjani Tila\\" among the residents of Kaithal. The Vridhakedara (Vidkyar) sanctum of Kaithal finds a mention in the Vedic texts of Vaman Puran. Kaithal, with many of its temples, is also an important milestone in the 48 Kos Parikrama pilgrimage. =Early and medieval history= Timur stopped here in 1398, before attacking Delhi. Later, the city became a Muslim cultural centre, under the rule of Delhi Sultanate. Tombs of several Sufi saints dating from the 13th century can be found in the city today; most important among them is that of Sheikh Salah- ud-din of Bhalkh (1246 CE). The town was renovated and a fort was built during the rule of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar, and as per Ain-i-Akbari, it was a pargana, under the sarkar of Sirhind, and had developed into an agricultural centre.Sarkar of Sirhind - Kethal (Kaithal) Ain-i-Akbari. Razia Sultana, the first woman ruler of India, reigned as the Sultana of Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240. She fled Delhi with Malik Altúniya after they were defeated on the 24th of Rabí'u-l awwal A.H. 638 (Oct. 1240), and reached Kaithal the next day, where their remaining forces abandoned them, and were killed on 13 November 1240. IntroductionRazia Sultan The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians. The Muhammadan Period, 1867-1877. The tomb of Rajia Begam is still found here. This aspect is still not well known outside Kaithal, but residents know about the Mazaar of Razia Begum even generations later. Timur took the town in 1398, with his army massacring or plundering the inhabitants and destroying all villages along the way to Assandh. Many of the residents of Kaithal and the other cities had fled to Delhi in fear. =Modern history= In 1767, the city fell into the hands of the Singh Krora Misl chieftain, Bhai Desu Singh (d. 1781), who led a large Sikh force from his native village of Bhucho. In the Punjab whose descendants, the bhais of Kaithal, ranked among the most powerful Cis-Sutlej states. The Sikh Chieftains of Kaithal, ruled from 1767 until its fall in 1843. By 1808, it came under British influence. The state was ruled by the Scindhia dynasty of the Maratha Empire and paid tributes to the Marathas, until the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost this territory to the British. Bhai Udey Singh ruled over Kaithal and proved to be the last King. Bhai Udey Singh died on 14 March 1843. It became a municipality in 1867. In 1901, the town had a population of 14,408 and was the tehsil in the district of Karnal. The fort of the Bhais is still extant, and their title Bhai became common with the primary Sikh rulers. Peoples of Kaithal took active part in the freedom struggle in 1857.Kaithal Town The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 14, p. 288-289. Geographics =Topography= Kaithal is located at .

It now forms one of the most visible and important landmarks of Kaithal. =Tomb of Razia Sultana= Razia sultana tomb painting The tomb of Razia Sultana, who gained the throne of Delhi Sultanate under the Mamluk Sultanate, is situated 10 km north-west of the Kaithal city in Siwan on the Kaithal-Cheeka-Patiala road. It is close to the jail constructed nearby by the present administration. She and her husband Malik Altunia, who was the governor of Bhatinda (Punjab), were decapitated by the local Jat people of the area. It is speculated that she might have been disinterred from Kaithal and then reburied at her tomb in Delhi. Raziya al-Din (1205 in Budaun – 13 October 1240), throne name Jalâlat ud-Dîn Raziyâ, usually referred to in history as Razia Sultana, was the Sultan of Delhi in India from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other Muslim princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary.Gloria Steinem (Introduction), Herstory: Women Who Changed the World, eds. Deborah G. Ohrn and Ruth Ashby, Viking, (1995) p. 34-36. Razia Sultan was the only woman ruler of both the Sultanate and the Mughal period, although other women ruled from behind the scenes.Table of Delhi Kings: Muazzi Slave King The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 2, p. 368..

The Vridhakedara sanctum changed to \\"Vidkyara\\" as a result of the philological principle of \\"mukhasukha\\", or ease of speaking. it is located near pehowa chowk, the central point of Kaithal. =Shree Gyarah Rudri Mandir= It is one of the famous temples of city, where divine eleven Rudra were placed long ago.

He stopped here on his way from Anandpur Sahib to Delhi. Guruji stayed at the site of Gurudwara Manji Sahib. Early in the morning, Guruji came to this place. After taking a bath at the Thandar Tirth (also referred to as the Dandhar Tirth), Guru sat in meditation under a neem tree at this place. A large congregation of people who had heard of the Guru's arrival gathered there. One amongst them suffered from high fever. Guruji gave him the leaves of the neem tree and he was cured. This place then came to be known as Neem Sahib. All gurpurabs are celebrated here. Langar is organised every month on Sangrand (the first day of the month in the lunar calendar).

The Guru told a carpenter from Bahir, named Malla, that he wanted to go to Kaithal and asked if there was any Sikh devotee there. Malla replied that there were two houses belonging to Banias and one to a Sikh there. On reaching Kaithal, Malla asked Guru whose house he would like to go to first. Guru replied the one that is nearest. Malla took Guru to the house o f a fellow carpenter, also named Malla, who served the Guru with great devotion. Pleased with his devotion, the Guru told him to light a lamp for 40 days in honour of the Guru's darbar and he would be blessed with a son. The carpenter was blessed with a son in due course and he donated this place to the Gurudwara. On the request of the banias, Guru visited their house for lunch. He blessed the spot by saying that kirtan (singing of devotional songs) would be the norm here. This is the site of the Gurudwaras Manji Sahib. Guru spent three days preaching the tenets of Sikhism here and then left for village Barne.

It was announced that people from all over the city can come and eat day and night and take away this Dalya to their homes as well. There was a miracle that despite thousands of people eating from this langar, big pots were still filled with food. When famine ended, this food was also discontinued. After that incident, it was a tradition that every year in the month of \\"sawan\\" rainy season, on all four Thursdays of rainy season, people of every religion used to get this special food \\"dalya\\" prepared and send it to the dargah of baba shah kamal to be distributed among the needful.

It represented public sector workers in local government, the Health Service, universities, and water authorities. History The union was founded in 1908 as the National Union of Corporation Workers, which split from the Municipal Employees Association, following Albin Taylor's dismissal as General Secretary. The union became NUPE in 1928. B. Dix and S. Williams, 'Serving the public - building the union : the history of the National Union of Public Employees', Vol.1, 'The forerunners 1889-1928'. London, 1987 NUPE grew rapidly during the post WWII expansion of the public sector, and especially during the 1960s and early 1970s. It grew from a membership of 250,100 in 1966 to 693,100 members in 1977, making it the fifth largest union in Britain. It was particularly successful in recruiting amongst sections of the workforce previously seen as a lower priority by rival trade unions (primarily the TGWU and the GMWU), such as part-time women workers, and it was these members who made NUPE the largest manual workers' union in local government by the 1970s. NUPE had Regional and Area offices across the whole of Britain and was active in the mobilisation of employees in those parts of the public sector where it had substantial membership (local government, the NHS, the universities, and the publicly owned water authorities) against the attacks on trade union organisation and workers' rights by the Thatcher government from 1979. In 1993, NUPE merged with NALGO (the National and Local Government Officers Association) and COHSE (the Confederation of Health Service Employees) to form UNISON.

Patented by Elijah Galloway in 1843, kamptulicon was first launched in public at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, where it caused a sensation. Its promoters compared it to thick, soft leather, and lauded its ease of cleaning, water resistance, warmth, and sound-deadening qualities. Critics, however, pointed out that its grey-brown colour was unattractive. Attempts were made to brighten it up by stencilling patterns on it with oil paint, but these suffered from a lack of durability. Kamptulicon was manufactured by sprinkling powdered cork on to thin bands of rubber, which was then rolled and rerolled until thoroughly mixed. It was then coated on one or both sides with linseed oil varnish or oil paint. Powdered sulphur was also sometimes mixed in, and the material then heated to produce a form of vulcanized kamptulicon. As well as a floor covering, kamptulicon was also used as cushions in stamping presses, and as polishing wheels for metals. Within a few years, faced by stiff competition from the manufacturers of oilcloth coupled with huge increases in the price of natural rubber, kamptulicon production ceased.

Zurcher, Turkey: A Modern History. New York, J.B. Tauris & Co ltd. page 181 Kemalism, as it was implemented by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was defined by sweeping political, social, cultural and religious reforms designed to separate the new Turkish state from its Ottoman predecessor and embrace a modernized lifestyle,Cleveland, William L., and Martin P. Bunton. A History of the Modern Middle East. Boulder: Westview, 2013. Print. including the establishment of democracy, secularism, and state support of the sciences and free education, many of which were first introduced to Turkey during Atatürk's presidency in his reforms.Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition Many of the root ideas of Kemalism began during the late Ottoman Empire under various reforms to avoid the imminent collapse of the Empire, beginning chiefly in the early 19th-century Tanzimat reforms. The mid- century Young Ottomans attempted to create the ideology of Ottoman nationalism, or Ottomanism, to quell the rising ethnic nationalism in the Empire and introduce limited democracy for the first time while maintaining Islamist influences. In the early 20th century, the Young Turks abandoned Ottoman nationalism in favor of early Turkish nationalism, while adopting a secular political outlook. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, Atatürk, influenced by both the Young Ottomans and the Young Turks, as well as by their successes and failures, led the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, borrowing from the earlier movements' ideas of secularism and Turkish nationalism, while bringing about, for the first time, free education and other reforms that have been enshrined by later leaders into guidelines for governing Turkey. Philosophy Kemalism is a modernization philosophy which guided the transition between the multi-religious, multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire to the secular, unitary Republic of Turkey. Kemalism sets the boundaries of the social process in the Turkish Reformation. Atatürk is the founder of Kemalism, and his doctrine was implemented as state ideology even after his death. Kemalism has also sometimes been called \\"Socialism peculiar to Turkey\\" or \\"Turkish socialism\\". Fundamentals There are six fundamental pillars (ilke) of the ideology: Republicanism (), Populism (), Nationalism (), Laicism (), Statism (), and Reformism (or called \\"Revolutionism\\", ). Together they represent a kind of Jacobinism, defined by Atatürk himself as a method of utilizing political despotism in order to break down the social despotism prevalent among the traditionally minded Turkish-Muslim population, for which he blamed foremost the bigotry of the ulema. The principles came to be recognized as unchangeable and sacrosanct. =Republicanism= Republicanism () in the Kemalist framework replaced the absolute monarchy of the Ottoman dynasty with the rule of law, popular sovereignty and civic virtue, including an emphasis on liberty practiced by citizens. Kemalist republicanism defines a type of constitutional republic, in which representatives of the people are elected, and must govern in accordance with existing constitutional law limiting governmental power over citizens. The head of state and other officials are chosen by election rather than inheriting their positions, and their decisions are subject to judicial review. In defending the change from the Ottoman State, Kemalism asserts that all laws of the Republic of Turkey should be inspired by actual needs here on Earth as a basic tenet of national life.Mustafa Kemal as quoted in \\"A World View of Criminal Justice (2005)\\" by Richard K. Vogler, p. 116 Kemalism advocates a republican system as the best representative of the wishes of the people. Among the many types of republic, the Kemalist republic is a representative, parliamentary democracy with a Parliament chosen in general elections, a President as head of state elected by Parliament and serving for a limited term, a Prime Minister appointed by the President, and other Ministers appointed by Parliament. The Kemalist President does not have direct executive powers, but has limited veto powers, and the right to contest with referendum. The day-to-day operation of government is the responsibility of the Council of Ministers formed by the Prime Minister and the other Ministers. There is a separation of powers between the executive (President and Council of Ministers), the legislative (Parliament) and the judiciary, in which no one branch of government has authority over another–although parliament is charged with the supervision of the Council of Ministers, which can be compelled to resign by a vote of no- confidence. The Kemalist republic is a unitary state in which three organs of state govern the nation as a single unit, with one constitutionally created legislature. On some issues, the political power of government is transferred to lower levels, to local elected assemblies represented by mayors, but the central government retains the principal governing role. =Populism= Populism () is defined as a social revolution aimed to transfer the political power to citizenship. Kemalist populism not only to establish popular sovereignty but also the transfer of the social-economic transformation to realize a true populist state. However, Kemalist reject class conflict and believe national unity is above all else. To Kemalist populism envision a sociality that emphasizes work and national unity. Populism in Turkey is to create a unifying force that brings a sense of the Turkish state and the power of the people to bring in that new unity.Kili, Suna. “Kemalism in Contemporary Turkey.” International Political Science Review / Revue Internationale De Science Politique, vol. 1, no. 3, 1980, pp. 381–404. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1601123. Kemalist populism is an extension of the Kemalist modernization movement, aiming to make Islam compatible with the modern nation-state. This included state supervision of religious schools and organizations. Mustafa Kemal himself said “everyone needs a place to learn religion and faith; that place is a Mektep not a Madrasa\\". This was intended to combat the “corruption” of Islam by the Ulema. Kemal believed that during the Ottoman period, the Ulema had come to exploit the power of their office and manipulate religious practices to their own gain. It was also feared that were education not brought under state control, unsupervised Madrasas could exacerbate the rising problem of Tarikat insularity that threatened to undermine the unity of the Turkish state.ÇAKMAK, DİREN. “Pro-Islamic Public Education in Turkey: The Imam-Hatip Schools.” Middle Eastern Studies, vol. 45, no. 5, 2009, pp. 825–846. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40647155. Sovereignty Kemalist social content (populism) does not accept any adjectives placed before the definition of a nation [a nation of ...]; denies the types of national unity based on racial, religious, totalitarian and fascist ideologies. It strongly opposes any kind of authority, oppression, colonialism, imperialism, etc., against the sovereignty of the people. Sovereignty must belong solely to people without any term, condition, etc.: Motto Kemalist social content (populism) was brought against the political domination of sheiks, tribal leaders, and Islamism (Islam as a political system) of the Ottoman Empire. Initially, the declaration of the republic was perceived as \\"Returning to the days of the first caliphs\\". However, Kemalist nationalism aimed to shift the political legitimacy from autocracy (by the Ottoman dynasty), theocracy (based in the Ottoman Caliphate), and feudalism (tribal leaders) to the active participation of its citizenry, the Turks. Kemalist social content wanted to establish the value of Turkish citizenship. A sense of pride associated with this citizenship would give the needed psychological spur for people to work harder and achieve a sense of unity and national identity. Active participation, or the \\"will of the people\\", was established with the republican regime and Turkishness replacing the other forms of affiliations that were promoted in the Ottoman Empire (such as the allegiance to the different millets that eventually led to divisiveness in the Empire). The shift in affiliation was symbolized with: The motto \\"Ne mutlu Türküm diyene\\" was promoted against the \\"long live the Sultan,\\" \\"long live the Sheikh\\", or \\"long live the Caliph.\\" =Laicism= The laicism () of Kemalist ideology aims to banish religious interference in government affairs, and vice versa. It differs from the passive Anglo-American concept of secularism, but is similar to the concept of laïcité in France. The roots of Kemalist secularism lie in the reform efforts in the late Ottoman Empire, especially the Tanzimat period and the later Second Constitutional Era. The Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state in which the head of the Ottoman state held the position of the Caliph. The social system was organized according to various systems, including the religiously-organized Millet system and Shari'ah law, allowing religious ideology to be incorporated into the Ottoman administrative, economic, and political system. This way of life is today defined as Islamism (political Islam): \\"the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life\\". In the Second Constitutional Era, the Ottoman Parliament pursued largely secular policies, although techniques of religious populism and attacks on other candidates' piety still occurred between Ottoman political parties during elections. These policies were stated as the reason for the countercoup of 1909 by Islamists and absolute monarchists. The secular policies of the Ottoman parliament also factored in the Arab Revolt during World War I. When secularism was implemented in the fledgling Turkish state, it was initiated by the abolition of the centuries-old Caliphate in March 1924. The office of Shaykh al-Islām was replaced with the Presidency of Religious Affairs (). In 1926, the Mejelle and shari'ah law codes were abandoned in favor of an adapted Swiss Civil Code and a penal code modeled on the German and Italian codes. Other religious practices were done away with, including the dissolution of Sufi orders and the penalization of wearing a Fez, which was viewed by Atatürk as a tie to the Ottoman past. State and religion (Laïcité) Atatürk was profoundly influenced by the triumph of laïcité in France. Atatürk perceived the French model as the authentic form of secularism. Kemalism strove to control religion and transform it into a private affair rather than an institution interfering with politics, scientific and social progress. \\"Sane reason,\\" and \\"the liberty of [one's] fellow man,\\" as Atatürk once put it.Ruşen Eşref Ünaydin, 1954, \\"Atatürk -Tarih ve Dil Kurumları Hatıraları\\" Türk Tarih Kurumu. pp. 28–31. It is more than merely creating a separation between state and religion. Atatürk has been described as working as if he were Leo the Isaurian, Martin Luther, the Baron d'Holbach, Ludwig Büchner, Émile Combes, and Jules Ferry rolled into one in creating Kemalist secularism. Kemalist secularism does not imply nor advocate agnosticism or nihilism; it means freedom of thought and independence of the institutions of the state from the dominance of religious thought and religious institutions. The Kemalist principle of laicism is not against moderate and apolitical religion, but against religious forces opposed to and fighting modernization and democracy. According to the Kemalist perception, the Turkish state is to stand at an equal distance from every religion, neither promoting nor condemning any set of religious beliefs. Kemalist, however, has called for not only separation of church and state but also a call for the state control of the Muslim religious establishment. For some Kemalists, this means that the state must be at the helm of religious affairs, and all religious activities be under the supervision of the state. This in turn drew criticism by the religious conservatives. Religious conservatives were vocal in rejecting this idea, saying that to have a secular state, the state can't control the activities of religious institutions. Despite their protest, this policy was officially adopted by the 1961 constitution. Kemalism must stamp out the religious element within society. After the Turkish independence of the Western powers all education was under the control of the state in both secular and religious schools. They centralized the education system with one curriculum in both religious and secular public school in hope this would eliminate or lessen the appeal of religious schools. The laws were meant to abolish the religious order called Tarikats. Titles like Shirk and dervish were abolished, and their activities banned by the government. The day of rest was changed by the government from Friday to Sunday. But the restrictions on personal choice extended to both religious duty and naming. Turks had to adopt a surname and are not allowed to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. Politics and religion (Secularism) The Kemalist form of separation of state and religion sought the reform of a complete set of institutions, interest groups (such as political parties, unions, and lobbies), the relationships between those institutions, and the political norms and rules that governed their functions (constitution, election law). The biggest change in this perspective was the abolishment of the Ottoman Caliphate on March 3, 1924, followed by the removal of its political mechanisms. The article stating that \\"the established religion of Turkey is Islam\\" was removed from the constitution on April 10, 1928. From a political perspective, Kemalism is anti-clerical in that it seeks to prevent religious influence on the democratic process, which was a problem even in the largely secular politics of the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire, when even non-religiously affiliated political parties like the Committee of Union and Progress and the Freedom and Accord Party feuded over matters such as the Islamic piety of their candidates in the Ottoman elections of 1912.Hasan Kayalı (1995) \\"Elections and the Electoral Process in the Ottoman Empire, 1876-1919\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp 273–274. \\"The prominent leaders of the Entente [Freedom and Accord Party] were Turkish-speaking and no different from the Unionists as far as their basic attitudes toward Islam were concerned. Nevertheless, they sought to frustrate the CUP by encouraging non-Turkish groups to attack it for pursuing a policy of Turkification and by pointing out to the conservatives its alleged disregard for Islamic principles and values. The overall effect of this propaganda was to instill ethnic and sectarian-religious discord, which survived the Entente's defeat at the polls ... The Unionists proved to be less vulnerable to accusations of disregard for Islamic precepts and values. Some of the Entente members were known for their cosmopolitan attitudes and close relations with foreign interests. But this did not keep the Entente from accusing the CUP of violating Islamic principles and attempting to restrict the prerogatives of the sultan-caliph in its pamphlets. One such pamphlet, Afiksoz (Candid Words), appealed to the religious-national sentiments of Arabs and claimed that Zionist intrigue was responsible for the abandonment of Libya to the Italians. Such propaganda forced the CUP to seize the role of the champion of Islam. After all, the secular integrationist Ottomanism that it had preached was failing, and the latest manifestation of this failure was the Entente's appeal to segments of Christian communities. The Unionists used Islamic symbols effectively in their election propaganda in 1912. They accused the Entente of trying to separate the offices of the caliphate and the sultanate and thus weakening Islam and the Muslims. There seemed no end to the capital to be gained from the exploitation and manipulation of religious rhetoric. In Izmir, the Entente attacked the CUP's intention to amend Article 35 of the constitution by arguing that the Unionists were thus denouncing the \\"thirty\\" days of fasting and \\"five\\" daily prayers. This led the town's mufti to plead that \\"for the sake of Islam and the welfare of the country\\" religion not be used to achieve political objectives. As with the rhetoric on Turkification, Islam too remained in political discourse long after the elections were over.\\" Thus, in the Kemalist political perspective, politicians cannot claim to be the protector of any religion or religious sect, and such claims constitute sufficient legal grounds for the permanent banning of political parties. Insignia The Ottoman social system was based on religious affiliation. Religious insignia extended to every social function. Clothing identified citizens with their own particular religious grouping; headgear distinguished rank and profession. Turbans, fezes, bonnets, and head- dresses denoted the sex, rank, and profession — both civil and military — of the wearer. Religious insignia outside of worship areas was banned. While Atatürk considered women's religious coverings as antithetical to progress and equality, he also recognized that headscarves were not such a danger to the separation of church and state to warrant an outright ban., [Politics of the Headscarf in Turkey], Harvard Journal of Law & Gender Vol. 33 But the Constitution was amended in 1982, following the 1980 coup by the Kemalist- leaning military, to prohibit women's use of Islamic coverings such as headscarves at higher education institutions., [Roots of the Headscarf Debate: Laicism and Secularism in France and Turkey], 2011 Joost Lagendijk, a member of the European Parliament and chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Turkey, has publicly criticized these clothing restrictions for Muslim women,Lagendijk, Joost (2006-03-22). Başörtüsü yasağı savunulamaz. Sabah. whereas the European Court of Human Rights ruled in numerous cases that such restrictions in public buildings and educational institutions do not constitute a violation of human rights.ECHR Rules for Turkish Headscarf Ban : The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in favor of Turkey's policy of banning headscarves at universities. (Today's Zaman, 30 June 2004)ECHR Insists on Headscarf Ban, Journal of Turkish Weekly, 2006-10-17 =Reformism= Reformism or \\"Revolutionism\\" () is a principle which calls for the country to replace the traditional institutions and concepts with modern institutions and concepts. This principle advocated the need for fundamental social change through revolution as a strategy to achieve a modern society. The core of the revolution, in the Kemalist sense, was an accomplished fact. In a Kemalist sense there is no possibility of return to the old systems because they were deemed backward. The principle of revolutionism went beyond the recognition of the reforms made during Atatürk's lifetime. Atatürk's reforms in the social and political life are accepted as irreversible. Atatürk never entertained the possibility of a pause or transition phase during the course of the progressive unfolding or implementation of the revolution. The current understanding of this concept can be described that active modification. Turkey and its society, taking over institutions from Western Europe, must add Turkish traits and patterns to them and adapt them to the Turkish culture, according to Kemalism. The making of the Turkish traits and patterns of these reforms takes generations of cultural and social experience (which results in the collective memory of the Turkish nation). =Nationalism= Nationalism (): The Kemalist revolution aimed to create a nation state from the remnants of the multi-religious and multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire. Kemalist nationalism originates from the social contract theories, especially from the principles advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his Social Contract. The Kemalist perception of social contract was effected by the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire which was perceived as a product of failure of the Ottoman \\"Millet\\" system and the ineffective Ottomanism. Kemalist nationalism, after experiencing the Ottoman Empire's breakdown into pieces, defined the social contract as its \\"highest ideal\\". Kemalist ideology defines the \\"Turkish Nation\\" () as a nation of Turkish People who always love and seek to exalt their family, country and nation, who know their duties and responsibilities towards the democratic, secular and social state governed by the rule of law, founded on human rights, and on the tenets laid down in the preamble to the constitution of the Republic of Turkey. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk defines the Turkish Nation by saying Criteria Kemalist criteria for national identity or simply being Turkish () refers to a shared language, and/or shared values defined as a common history, and the will to share a future. Kemalist ideology defines the \\"Turkish people\\" as: Membership is usually gained through birth within the borders of the state and also the principle of jus sanguinis. Kemalist form of nationality is integrated to the Article 66 of the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey. Every citizen is recognized as a Turk, regardless of ethnicity, belief, and gender, etc. Turkish nationality law states that he or she can be deprived of his/her nationality only through an act of treason.Citizenship is defined in the (amended on October 17, 2001). In 2005, the Article 301 of the Turkish Penal code made it a crime to insult Turkishness (), but under pressure of the EU, this was changed in 2008 to protect the \\"Turkish nation\\" instead of Turkish ethnicity in 2008, an 'imagined' nationhood of people living within the National Pact () borders. Extent Kemalist nationalism believes in the principle that the Turkish state is an indivisible whole comprising its territory and people, which is defined as the \\"unity of the state\\". It is a concept of nationalism which respects the right to independence of all other nations. =Pan-Turkism= Kemalism had not only displaced \\"Pan-Turkism\\" as the official state ideology; it also focused on the nation-state's narrower interests, renouncing the concern for the \\"Outside Turks\\". Page 186-187 Pan-Turkism was an ethnocentric ideology [to unite all ethnically Turkic nations] while Kemalism is polycentric [united under a \\" common will\\"] in character. Kemalism wants to have an equal footing among the mainstream world civilizations. Pan-Turkists have consistently emphasized the special attributes of the Turkic peoples, and wanted to unite all of the Turkic peoples. Kemalism wants an equal footing (based on respect) and does not aim to unite the people of Turkey with all the other Turkic nations. Most Kemalists were not interested in Pan-Turkism and from 1923 to 1950 (the single state period) reacted with particular firmness. =Turanism= Kemalism had not only displaced \\"Turanism\\" as the official state ideology; it also focused on the Turkish People, within the alive and historical cultures and peoples of Anatolia [an Anatolian-centered view]. Turanism centered the nation as the union of all Turanian peoples (Tungus, Hungarians, Finns, Mongols, Estonians and Koreans) stretching from the Altai Mountains in Eastern Asia to the Bosphorus.Paksoy, H.B., ‘Basmachi’: Turkestan National Liberation Movement 1916-1930s, Modern Encyclopedia of Religions in Russia and the Soviet Union, Florida: Academic International Press, 1991, Vol. 4 Kemalism had a narrower definition of language which wanted to remove [purify] the Persian, Arabic, Greek, Latin, etc. words from the language used in Anatolia. Turanian leaders, such as Enver Pasha, wanted an evolving language common to all Turanian peoples, minimizing differences and maximizing similarities between them. =Expansionism= Regarding expansionism, Kemalist nationalism opposes imperialism and aims to promote \\"peace\\" in both the domestic and the international arenas. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk wrote in 1930: =Statism= Statism (): Kemal Atatürk made clear in his statements and policies that Turkey's complete modernization was very much dependent on economic and technological development. The principle of Kemalist Statism is generally interpreted to mean that the state was to regulate the country's general economic activities and engage in areas where private enterprises are not willing to do so. This was the result of post-revolutionary Turkey needing to redefine the relationship between societal and international capitalism. The revolution left Turkey in ruins as the Ottoman Empire was focused on raw materials and was an open market in the international capitalist system. Post- revolutionary Turkey is largely defined by its agricultural society which includes many landlords and merchant. The control of people in the Turkish economy is quite evident from 1923 to 1930s but they still managed, through foreign joint investment, to establish a state economic enterprise. However, after the 1930s depression, there was a shift to more inward-looking development strategies during an era generally referred to as etatism. During this era, the state had an active involvement in both capital accumulation and investment as well as taking the interest of private businesses into consideration. The state often stepped into economic areas that the private sector did not cover, either due to not being strong enough or having failed to do so. These were often infrastructure projects and power stations but also iron and steel industries, while the masses shouldered the burden of the capital accumulation.Aydın, Zülküf. “The State.” The Political Economy of Turkey, Pluto Press, LONDON; ANN ARBOR, MI, 2005, pp. 25–56. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18dzt8j.5. Analysis =Kemalism and Turkey's political parties= CHP's logo The Republican People's Party (CHP) was established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on September 9, 1923, not long before the declaration of the Republic of Turkey on October 29. The Republican People's Party did not attempt to update or define the philosophical roots of it party Kemalism from the 1940s to the 1960s. However, since the 1960s, there has being a move to the left-of-center. The supporter of the left-of-center accepts the tented of the Kemalism also entrained the idea that structural changes brought forth by the government are necessary for modernization. Later in the 1970s, the CHP had to make fundamental changes to its party platform as the country Abandonment of Kemalism. The party thought several programs as being labeled the democratic left. Most still believe in the six principles of Kemalism while others seek to reduce the role of etatism in Turkish society.İrem, Nazım. “Undercurrents of European Modernity and the Foundations of Modern Turkish Conservatism: Bergsonism in Retrospect.” Middle Eastern Studies, vol. 40, no. 4, 2004, pp. 79–112. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4289929 =Kemalism and Turkey's constitutional law= The six principles were solidified on 5 February 1937, 14 years after establishment of the Republic of Turkey. In the 1924 Constitutional Law Article 2, Clause 1: Both the military coup of 1960 and the military coup of 1980 were followed by fundamental revisions of the Turkish Constitution. The texts of the new constitutions were approved by popular referendum in each case. In the 1961 Constitutional Law Article 1, Clause 1 states \\"The Turkish State is a Republic.\\" Article 2, Clause 1: In the 1982 Constitutional Law Article 1, Clause 1 states \\"The Turkish State is a Republic.\\" Article 2, Clause 1: Only the principles of secularism, nationalism and democracy were maintained in each change to the constitution. The 1961 Constitution more strongly emphasized human rights, the rule of law, and the welfare state than the original 1924 constitution, while the 1982 constitution focused on the peace of the community and national solidarity, but also explicitly referenced some of Atatürk's principles and included them as well. =External interpretations of Kemalism= In the 1920s and 1930s, Turkey's domestic transformations and the evolution of the Kemalist system of ideological and political principles were closely observed in Germany, France, Britain, the US, and beyond, including several nations farther East. In recent years, scholarly interest in the transnational history of Kemalism has expanded. Some scholars have focused on the interwar period in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Egypt to reveal how, as a practical tool, Kemalism was relocated as a global movement, whose influence is still felt today.\\"Kemalism: Transnational Politics in the Post Ottoman World.\\", eds. N. Clayer, F. Giomi, E. Szurek. London. I.B. Tauris. 2018. Some scholars have examined the impact of Atatürk's reforms and his image on the Jewish community in British-ruled Palestine before the establishment of Israel,Jacob Landau. \\"A Note on Kemalizm in the Hebrew Press of Palestine.\\" 2018.

International Journal of Turkish Studies 2 (2): 25–32 and other parts of the Muslim world—to assess the influence wielded by Mustafa Kemal and his modernization project. These works explore perceptions of Kemalism that are mostly positive in their respective countries providing few critical insights into Kemalism's evolution and its reception as an ideological project. Against this background, one of the critical partners of Turkey in the interwar period – the Soviet Union, its leaders, Communist Party functionaries, journalists and scholars initially interpreted Kemalism as an ideological ally in the struggle against the West. Since the late 1920s until the 1950s, Kemalism was viewed negatively by the Communists. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Soviet position returned to normalization. Views and analyses of Soviet leaders, diplomats, Communist party functionaries, and scholars helps us grasp the underlying dynamics behind these changing attitudes. Placing them in the larger context of republican history—delineating phases in the Kemalist paradigm of development and discerning its various rises and falls—will enrich our knowledge of the transnational history of Kemalism.Vahram Ter-Matevosyan. \\"Turkey, Kemalism and the Soviet Union: Problems of Modernization, Ideology and Interpretation.\\" London & New York, Palgrave Macmillan. 2019.

The abbey was first mentioned in the city records in 1623, although it is believed that it had existed for more than a century prior to that.

It is a major stop on the London–Aylesbury line from via Amersham. It is from Aylesbury to Marylebone. A branch line from on the Chiltern Main Line terminates at the station. It was the terminus for London Underground's Metropolitan line until the service was cut back to Amersham in 1961. The station was also known as Aylesbury Town under the management of British Railways from until the 1960s. History The first station on the site was opened in 1863 by the Wycombe Railway, which in 1867 was taken over by the Great Western Railway. In 1868 the Aylesbury & Buckingham Railway (later part of the Metropolitan Railway) reached Aylesbury. When opened, the line to Aylesbury from Princes Risborough was broad gauge. To avoid mixed gauge track when the standard gauge Aylesbury and Buckingham arrived at the station in 1868, the section to Princes Risborough was converted to standard gauge, and therefore until the rest of the Wycombe Railway was converted in 1870 there was no access to the rest of the GWR system. The GWR provided motive power and trains to both the Wycombe Railway and the A&B;, and ran a shuttle service from Princes Risborough to Verney Junction. A broad gauge single-road engine shed was provided from the station's opening in 1863; the shed was doubled in length within a year or two, and in 1870 became a two-road shed with a lean-to added to the east side of the original shed. By 1892, with the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway, the shed was converted to a north-light two-road shed using the west wall of the original broad gauge shed and the east wall of the 1870 extension. The Metropolitan Railway opened from Chalfont Road in 1892 to a separate station named Aylesbury (Brook Street) adjacent to the GWR station. It closed in 1894 when services were diverted to the GW station. The Great Central Railway reached Aylesbury in 1899 from Annesley Junction just north of Nottingham on its London extension line to . =Aylesbury Railway Disaster of 1904= A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in and around Aylesbury Because the station had been a terminus for the Metropolitan Railway the original junction layout on the route to London Marylebone included a sharp curve. This became inconvenient once some Great Central trains began to run non-stop through Aylesbury from 1899 onwards. Rather than change the junction layout to suit faster trains, a speed restriction was applied to the curve. On 23 December 1904 at about 3:38 a.m. this curve was the site of the Aylesbury Railway Disaster. The 2:45 a.m. Great Central express newspaper train from London Marylebone consisting of a locomotive, tender, and ten vehicles—three coaches, an assortment of six fish, meat and parcel vans, and a brake van—failed to slow for the curve, and was completely derailed. The locomotive, tender, and the first three or four vehicles mounted the \\"down\\" platform of the station, two vehicles mounted the \\"up\\" platform, and the rest of the train was smashed to pieces and scattered over a distance of between the two platforms. The driver of the train, Joseph Barnshaw was seriously injured and died the next day. The fireman George Masters was killed as also were London-based driver David Summers and fireman Josiah Stanton who were travelling as passengers in the first coach on their way to , Manchester. There was heavy fog at the time of the accident, and at the subsequent Board of Trade inquiry there was some doubt as to how well driver Barnshaw knew the route. What the inquiry did not touch on was that there had been a history of fast running of these newspaper trains, which had become an important traffic for the Great Central Railway. This dated back to the Boer War which had ended only two years earlier. The Manchester Guardians stance on the Boer War had resulted in significant drops in circulation. London newspapers, led by the Daily Mail, saw a significant business opportunity in the Manchester area, and sought to get their morning newspapers to Manchester in time to win a share of this market. These trains recorded fast times for the era, including an authenticated timing of 220 minutes for the journey including stops. Afterwards in 1908 the station was reconstructed and tracks at the curve were realigned. =Station buildings= The original station had one platform with a brick-built station building a canopy projected from the building over the platform supported on cast iron pillars. The cost of the station building was shared between the Wycombe Railway and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway; the original plans are in Aylesbury local records office. The current station buildings date from 1926, when the station was extensively rebuilt again—this time by the London and North Eastern Railway. Until nationalisation in 1948, Aylesbury station was operated by a joint committee whose constituents were also joint committees: the GWR & GCR Joint and the Metropolitan and GCR Joint; although the LNER had taken on the role of the former Great Central Railway in all three joint committees, these committees were not renamed. Motive Power Depot The Wycombe Railway opened a single-road engine shed fifty feet in length to the west of the station in 1863. This was extended to the rear shortly after and enlarged to a two-road shed by the Great Western Railway in 1871, around 1893 the saw tooth roof was added on the original walls; it was closed on 16 June 1962 and was demolished in 1967. A wooden water tank was positioned outside the locomotive shed from the station's opening, being replaced by a standard GWR water tank with decorative supports and coaling stage underneath in 1899; this itself was replaced by a Braithwaite tank in the mid-1950s. The first mention of a locomotive at Aylesbury was of the broad-gauge loco Giraffe in 1863, a member of the Sun class. =1930s to the present day= Platform 3 with a train about to depart for Marylebone Platforms 3 and 2, looking south from the bridge Until 1966 Aylesbury was an intermediate station on the former Great Central Main Line between London Marylebone and and on to Manchester London Road via the Woodhead Tunnel. Aylesbury was also on the Metropolitan Railway (later Metropolitan line) and through trains from Baker Street to operated until 1936. From 1948 to 1961 Aylesbury was the terminus of the Met's main line, on which trains had to change between electric and steam locomotives at Rickmansworth.Initially at least, the Metropolitan Railway labelled its line from Bishop's Road Paddington to Farringdon as the 'main line' and the line through St John's Wood and Swiss Cottage northwards as the 'branch'. Although the former lengthened to form the Hammersmith and City, running from Hammersmith to Barking, the latter had the characteristics of a main line railway in the twentieth century, with locomotive-hauled trains of large bogie carriages, including Pullman cars for a time, running to Chesham, Aylesbury and Verney Junction. Following electrification from Rickmansworth to Amersham, Aylesbury was no longer served by London Underground trains. In 1966 British Railways closed the Great Central Main Line north of Aylesbury. Aylesbury was thus left with commuter services to London only. From the 1960s until the 1980s, passenger trains at Aylesbury were almost exclusively operated by British Rail Class 115 diesel multiple units. By the 1980s the lines serving Aylesbury were in a poor state. Aylesbury station itself was run down and needed refurbishment. Network SouthEast decided to refurbish the lines out of Marylebone, and Aylesbury received a new waiting room, new toilets and better lighting. Platform 4 was closed and the car park was extended. A new driver's staff room was established on platform 3 and a new heavy maintenance depot was built just north of the station. Aylesbury became the headquarters of the operational side of the Chiltern Line. (For more information, see: Chiltern Line Modernisation) On 14 December 2008 of the line north of Aylesbury was reopened for passenger service, with regular passenger services running north of the station for the first time since 1966. This serves the new station, which is situated on the northwestern outskirts of Aylesbury and is operated by Chiltern Railways. Present layout Aylesbury station is laid out for through traffic, with hourly trains to/from Aylesbury Vale Parkway and waste freight trains to the landfill site at Calvert heading north. On selected days, usually bank holidays, special passenger services run to the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at . In addition there is a major repair and maintenance depot just north of the station, and several sidings. There are three platforms. Platform 3 gives access to Amersham and London Marylebone only, whilst platform 1 gives access to Princes Risborough and London Marylebone via only. Platform 2 can serve both routes. There used to be a bay platform (platform 4) that served as the terminus for Metropolitan trains and several freight sidings but the car park now lies on the trackbed and bike racks occupy the platform. The goods depot was to the west of the station and was demolished in the 1960s. Modern apartments now occupy the site. The station is managed by Chiltern Railways, which has recently had automatic ticket gates installed. There are two FastTicket self-service ticket machines accepting cash and cards, a permit to travel machine and two ticket windows. There is a taxi rank outside the station. From 21 January 2008 the taxi rank was moved to the car park for 52 weeks as a result of major engineering work on the new Southcourt Bridge and the new Station Boulevard. Seven first generation DMUs built in the late 1950s are based at Aylesbury. These units are jointly used by Chiltern Railways and Network Rail for route learning and Sandite duties. One unit was used solely for passenger services until 2017 to and from Princes Risborough. All three station platforms have step-free access, with access to platforms 1 and 2 via a pair of lifts. Future A further expansion of rail services to Bletchley and Bedford is suggested in a consultants' report written to provide regional planning guidance to Bucks County Council concerning the development of Aylesbury Vale. As part of the East West Rail plan to reinstate the Oxford-Cambridge line, these services would be extended from the current freight-only line north of Aylesbury Vale Parkway to the new line via Claydon LNE Junction and terminate at or . The Department for Transport endorsed the scheme in December 2017, with opening planned for 2024.Transport Secretary officially launches East West Railway Company at Bletchley Park East West Rail, 22 November 2017 After it is completed, rail passengers between Aylesbury and the Midlands or the North will no longer need to travel via London or Princes Risborough. Aylesbury may also feature in the Croxley Rail Link project which envisages re-routing part of the London Underground Metropolitan line to . Proposals also exist to start direct rail services between Watford Junction and Aylesbury via Rickmansworth and Amersham. Services All services at Aylesbury are operated by Chiltern Railways. Most services operate to London Marylebone although services can take one of two routes running via either on the London-Aylesbury line or via on the Aylesbury–Princes Risborough line and the Chiltern Main Line. The current off-peak service is: * 2 tph to London Marylebone via * 1 tph to London Marylebone via * 1 tph to During the peak hours, additional shuttle services run to and from and there are additional services to/from London via the London-Aylesbury line that do not call at some of the stations nearer London (those shared with the Metropolitan line). On Sundays, the services on the London-Aylesbury line are reduced to 1 train per hour. During Bank Holidays in Spring and Summer there is a frequent shuttle service to Quainton Road. Onward connections Aylesbury bus station is a two-minute walk from the station. Buses, the majority of which are operated by Arriva Shires & Essex, depart to several destinations across Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Oxfordshire, including Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Milton Keynes, Oxford, Tring, Watford, Luton and Leighton Buzzard. Bus departure times are displayed on screens outside the rail station's departure lounge as well as at the bus station itself. The Aylesbury - Princes Risborough rail link offers connections to High Wycombe, Bicester, Banbury and Birmingham. This route was greatly improved by \\"Project Evergreen\\" - the re-dualing and speeding-up of Marylebone - Risborough - Birmingham track and services. Since 2015 Risborough has also had access to direct Oxford trains via a new junction at Bicester Village.

Biography Francis J. Herron attended the Western University of Pennsylvania, but left at the age of sixteen without completing his degree to become a bank clerk. In 1855, he joined his three brothers in Dubuque, Iowa, where they established a bank. In 1859, he organized and was elected captain of a militia company known as the \\"Governor's Grays,\\" which Herron offered to President-elect Abraham Lincoln in January 1861, two months prior to Lincoln's inauguration. In April 1861, Herron was appointed captain of the 1st Iowa Volunteer Regiment. He served with Nathaniel Lyon's forces in Missouri, participating in the battles of Boonville and Wilson's Creek. In August, Herron was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 9th Iowa Volunteer Regiment and fought in the battle of Pea Ridge, where he was wounded and taken prisoner, but exchanged shortly afterwards. He received a promotion to brigadier general of volunteers for his actions in this battle, and later received the Medal of Honor. He commanded both the 2nd and 3rd Divisions of the Army of the Frontier and made a forced march of in three days to join James G. Blunt's division in western Arkansas. Herron's and Blunt's combined command engaged Thomas C. Hindman in the battle of Prairie Grove and forced the Confederates to abandon western Arkansas. For his actions at Prairie Grove, Herron was appointed major general of volunteers, becoming the youngest major general on either side at the time of his promotion. His two divisions were consolidated to form \\"Herron's Division\\" which was attached to the XVII Corps. During the Siege of Vicksburg, Herron's division was placed on the extreme left flank of the Union lines. Upon the surrender of the city Ulysses S. Grant chose Herron, along with generals James B. McPherson and John A. Logan, to lead the procession into the city and accept the formal surrender of arms on July 4, 1863. He next led the Yazoo City expedition, capturing the city, a Confederate fleet and supplies there. Herron was appointed to command of the XIII Corps and occupied the Texas coast with headquarters at Brownsville. During this time, he provided aid to Mexican President Benito Juárez and prevented French troops of Emperor Maximilian from establishing themselves along the Rio Grande. As the Civil War came to an end, Herron commanded the District of Northern Louisiana. After the Civil War, he stayed in Baton Rouge. He was tax collector for a district in New Orleans and served as a United States Marshal from 1867 until 1869.

The idea for the JamMan began with modifications Gary Hall had devised for the Lexicon PCM-42 that allowed him to play into a long, looping delay whose clock could be synchronized to an external source. (Hall, who worked for Lexicon in two different periods, was the primary architect of the PCM41 and PCM42, as well as the non-reverberation effects that first appeared in the 224X and became better known in the PCM70.) Bob Sellon extended the concept considerably, starting with elaborate PCM42 modifications and eventually working with several others at Lexicon to arrive at the JamMan. The product allowed musicians to record musical phrases at the touch of a button which were then played back, looping indefinitely. The musician would typically use the looping audio as a backing track providing a virtual backing band. The device also allowed MIDI drum machines and sequencers to be synchronized to them providing additional accompaniment. By pressing a button on the floor pedal, the device begins recording a rhythm (8 seconds of memory comes standard, but an upgraded 32-second memory chip is a common upgrade). When the musician is finished playing the part to be looped, simply press the tap button on the floor again and the machine does two things immediately: replays the part from the beginning looping it indefinitely while sending a MIDI clock signal to a drum machine which kicks in right on time and is synchronized to the rhythm part. The JamMan is a 1U rack mounted unit that is controlled using 1 or 2 footswitches or via MIDI.

He served as Vice President under Nicolás Ardito Barletta. Following the disputed 1984 election, and after Barletta's forced resignation, Delvalle served as President of Panama from 28 September 1985 until 26 February 1988. In 1988, he attempted to remove Manuel Noriega as head of the armed forces, but was himself deposed by the Legislative Assembly, going into hiding and eventually exile. Background Delvalle was born in Panama City. His brother Raúl is a former member of the National Assembly (1984–1989). His uncle Max Delvalle was the first Jewish president in Latin America (both were members of Kol Shearit Israel Synagogue). He belonged to the Republican Party founded by his family. Presidency Delvalle was elected as Nicolás Ardito Barletta's Vice President in the disputed 1984 election, and after Barletta's forced resignation he served as President of Panama from 28 September 1985 to 26 February 1988. Delvalle's presidency occurred during Manuel Noriega's de facto military rule of the country, and he was a loyal ally of Noriega for much of his administration. In 1986, US Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliot Abrams openly called on the Panamanian military to overthrow Noriega and suggested that it could lead to the restoration of military aid. The Delvalle government protested, filing a complaint with the Organization of American States; sixteen Latin American states joined Panama in condemning the US statement. After Noriega's indictment on 4 February 1988 by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Delvalle unsuccessfully attempted to remove Noriega from his formal post as head of the Panamanian Defense Forces. Instead, Noriega's allies in the Legislative Assembly voted on 22 February to oust Delvalle as president, appointing Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma in his place. Delvalle then went into hiding with the help of the American government. Though initially stating that he intended to remain in Panama, Delvalle soon went into the exile in the US. The administration of US President Ronald Reagan refused to recognize the legitimacy of Delvalle's successors and continued to officially support the legitimacy of Delvalle's presidency until his term's official ending in late 1989. Delvalle and his Noriega-appointed successors are nicknamed the \\"Kleenex presidents\\" in Panama due to their \\"disposability\\". In 1994, he was pardoned by President Guillermo Endara for any crimes committed during the Noriega years. Personal life and death Delvalle was married to Mariela Delvalle.

Port of Santa Maria di Salina Salina () is one of the Aeolian Islands north of Sicily, southern Italy. It is the second largest island in the archipelago. Salina is divided between three comuni: Santa Marina on the eastern coast, Malfa to the north, and Leni to the south-west. From Leni down towards the sea is the village of Rinella. Above the village of Leni is Valdichiesa in the center of the island. The other smaller villages are Capo Faro, Pollara and Lingua. There are currently approximately 2,600 residents living on the island. Geography Salina has a total surface area of . It is included on the World Heritage List especially because of its worth for vulcanology. It is composed of six volcanoes: the oldest ones are at Pizzo di Corvo, Monte Rivi and close to Capo Faro, although these are barely recognisable from a morphological point of view, while the volcano-layer of Monte Fossa delle Felci at is the highest peak in the archipelago and Monte dei Porri are both almost perfectly preserved. A lower crater lies just above sea level near the small village of Pollara, on the north west corner of the island, half of which has fallen into the sea. The most recent eruption on Salina occurred on the western part of the island about 13,000 years ago and formed the semi-circular crater of Pollara; its activity was mainly explosive and produced large pumice deposits. All that remains of the endogenic activities are some post-volcanic phenomena called “gurgling” and a thermal spring at Pertuso. The gurgling phenomena are at Rinella and are basically caused by the emission of underwater gas (hydrogen sulphate) and vapours. When this phenomenon is at its most active it can lift the sea-bed. Vegetation From a distance Salina looks entirely green with two rounded high mountains and a smooth coastline. More than 400 different types of plants grow on the island and grapes, olives and capers are cultivated. Salina was the first among the Aeolian islands to protect its environment with a natural preserve, known as the Riserva Naturale del Fossa delle Felci e dei Porri. The mountainsides of the island are covered with ferns, poplars, chestnut trees and typical Mediterranean vegetation including with caper bushes, prickly pear cactus. and a variety of orchards, olive groves and vineyards. The island is particularly notable for Malvasia, a famous white wine that is only produced on Salina. It is golden in colour and has an intense, delicately sweet bouquet. There has also been a local revival of the production of superior- quality low-acid olive oil. It is claimed that Salina produces the best capers in the world and during the first weekend of June there is an annual caper festival. History A Greek settlement, from the fourth century BC through to the times of Imperial Rome, once lay on the modern-day site of the small town of Santa Marina. A number of tombs from this era have been discovered further inland. Several traces of Greek and Roman culture have been found on the island. In the Hellenic Age the island was named \\"Didyme\\" (Δίδυμη), a Greek name which refers to the two mountains as \\"twins\\". The island was inhabited as far back as the Bronze Age and has been developed and then abandoned many times over the subsequent millennia. Areas on the island, including the two mountain peaks, were designated as a natural reserve in 1981. Main sights *The salt lake in Lingua was once a site for production of sea salt, hence the name Salina (\\"salt mill\\" in Italian). *On the slopes of the Fossa, several Roman tombs have been excavated. *Sanctuary of the Madonna del Terzito, located between Malfa and Leni in the saddle known as Valdichiesa between the twin volcanoes, and built in 1630. The religious centre of Salina, it attracts pilgrims on the main feast day of July 23 every year. In the 18th century the ruins of a typical Imperial Roman villa were noted here but have since sunk into the ground. Transportation Salina has two ports, Santa Marina and Rinella, served by ferries and hydrofoils. Hydrofoil service is active from Naples, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Messina and Milazzo. There is a regular bus service connecting all the villages on the island. A main road connects Lingua, Santa Marina, Malfa and Pollara; a side road runs between the two volcanoes to Leni and Rinella.  Culture The island was the setting of the 1970 film Road to Salina (in Italy released as Quando il sole scotta and in France as La route de Salina) directed by George Lautner. Christophe's composition \\"The Girl From Salina,\\" written for the film's score, became a hit in Europe on its own right. The track was later used by Quentin Tarantino in his 2004 film Kill Bill 2. The 1994 Michael Radford film Il Postino: The Postman, casting Messinese actress Maria Grazia Cucinotta, was filmed on the island of Procida and on Salina.

Biography Piotr Gembicki born into a Polish noble family of Nałęcz coat of arms in Gniezno on 10 October 1585 and began his ecclesiastical career early and attended academies abroad. Later he became the secretary of king Sigismund III Vasa and regent of the Crown's Chancery. After Sigismund's son, Władysław IV Vasa, succeeded to the Polish throne in 1632, Gembicki led the diplomatic mission to Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1635 he took part in the negotiations with Muscovy following the Smolensk War. In December 1635 he became the Deputy Crown Chancellor and Bishop of Przemyśl. Since then, his influence and wealth grew, and in 1638 he became the Great Crown Chancellor. He was a supporter of Habsburgs, which earned him a nickname covert Spaniard, and an opponent of the pro-French faction. He advocated tightening Polish control over the Commonwealth vassal, prince-elector of the Duchy of Prussia. Fighting for power and influence with magnate Jerzy Ossoliński, he became an ally of Adam Kazanowski and opponent of queen Cecilia Renata. In 1642 he lost the political battle and retired from court politics to the see of Bishop of Kraków, passing the chancery to Ossoliński. Since then, he focused mostly on religious matters, coming back into politics only in 1646 with his vocal and strong opposition of King Władysław's planned campaign against the Ottoman Empire, after which he was accused of being a traitor and exiled to the Holy Roman Empire. He died in Racibórz on 14 July 1657. His body was brought back to Poland and buried inside the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. Legacy Viewed by szlachta as a prideful and greedy, he supported the position of the Commonwealth king over orders from distant Rome when disputes arose between those two powers. He disliked the Jesuits and often sent complains about their actions destabilising the fragile religious tolerance in the Commonwealth.

The family farm was located north of Lloydminster, in Alberta; the eastern margin of the farm was the Alberta-Saskatchewan boundary. He attended the University of Saskatchewan with scholarships awarded by the Standard Oil Company and the National Research Council, graduating with a B.Sc. in 1952 and a M.Sc. in physics in 1954. Some of his early work was conducted with Harold E. Johns, a pioneer in cobalt-60 radiotherapy. Till proceeded to Yale University, where he received a Ph.D. in biophysics in 1957. He then became a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. Stem cells Harold E. Johns recruited Till to the Ontario Cancer Institute at Princess Margaret Hospital shortly after he completed his work at Yale. Subsequently, Till chose to work with Ernest McCulloch at the University of Toronto. Thus, the older physician's insight was combined with the younger physicist's rigorous and thorough nature. In the early 1960s, McCulloch and Till started a series of experiments that involved injecting bone marrow cells into irradiated mice. They observed that small raised lumps grew on the spleens of the mice, in proportion to the number of bone marrow cells injected. Till and McCulloch dubbed the lumps 'spleen colonies', and speculated that each lump arose from a single marrow cell: perhaps a stem cell. In later work, Till and McCulloch were joined by graduate student Andy Becker. They cemented their stem cell theory and in 1963 published their results in Nature. In the same year, in collaboration with Lou Siminovitch, a trailblazer for molecular biology in Canada, they obtained evidence that these same marrow cells were capable of self-renewal, a crucial aspect of the functional definition of stem cells that they had formulated. In 1969, Till became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.  Later career  In the 1980s Till's focus shifted, moving gradually into evaluation of cancer therapies, quality of life issues, and Internet research, including Internet research ethics and the ethics of List mining. Till holds the distinguished title of University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto. Recently, Till has been a vocal proponent of open access to scientific publications. Until 2019, Till was an editorial member of the open access journal Journal of Medical Internet Research. Till was a founding member of the Board of Directors of the Canadian Stem Cell Foundation (no longer active).  Honours  *1993, awarded Robert L.

It was aired also in Finland (Viimeiseen mieheen) in 2007.http://www.telvis.fi/tvopas/?vw=program&key;=32359_1203551400000 The series did not return for a second season. Overview The main characters are three best friends — Adam, Bruno and Cameron — who live and work in Melbourne. Adam is newly single, having come out of a long-term relationship, and is dealing with the dating world for the first time in a long time. Cameron is the sexual predator of the group, although this role has been somewhat lessened by the fact that his ex-wife Zoe — who left when he had an affair — is now part of the group, and is becoming friends with the women he dates. Bruno is a nurse who has a habit of falling for women who don't care for him, while ignoring the many women who do. All three are discovering that, in their late twenties, they are still single and really have no idea about women whatsoever. In keeping with the show's distinctly Melbourne feel, iconic Melbourne rock band Dallas Crane recorded a cover of Come See Me, originally by The Pretty Things, for the show's theme tune. The cover can be found as a B-side to the band's Curiosity single Cast =Main= * Rodger Corser as Adam Logan * Travis McMahon as Bruno Palmer * Matt Passmore as Cameron Kennedy * Miriama Smith as Zoe Hesketh =Recurring= * Fletcher Humphrys as Anto * Anita Hegh as Marly * Jesse Griffin as Chich * Nikola Dubois as Taia * Jacinta Stapleton as Syl * Stephen Phillips as Mark * Gillian Hardy as Anne * Terry Kenwrick as Gavin * Kat Stewart as Claire * Cal Wilson as Nurse Jude Vanderwert * Susan Godfrey as Nurse Rachel Barton Broadcast history The series premiered in Australia on 6 June 2005 - although it premiered in New Zealand some two months earlier. It struggled to find an audience from the beginning, with an average Australian viewership of 750,000 weekly viewers. These low ratings occurred despite the show having Desperate Housewives as a lead in, which at the time was attracting over 2 million viewers a week. It was thought by critics that Last Man Standing appealed only to \\"inner city lefties\\", unlike past successful Australian dramas such as Blue Heelers and All Saints which have more widespread demographic appeal. Given that a full 22 episodes had been filmed before the series began airing, the Seven Network aired consistent repeats to allow the show to find an audience. Ratings didn't climb, however, and in early September, the network announced the show's cancellation. The series finale aired on 25 October. This episode ended in a cliffhanger, which - due to the show's cancellation - will remain unresolved. The series began its airing in the UK on the FX channel in early 2006. The series began its airing in Finland on the Sub (formerly known as Subtv) channel in June 2007.

It is located at 14 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Hall was designed by Solomon Willard and Thomas Sumner, and dedicated on August 29, 1826, with William Ellery Channing giving the dedicatory speech, \\"The Christian Ministry.\\" It was the first Harvard building constructed outside Harvard Yard. As George Huntston Williams wrote in his 1954 history of the Divinity School, theological students needed to be isolated from undergraduates lest they drink up \\"more of the spirit of the University than of the spirit of their profession.\\" A decade later, on July 15, 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered his famous Divinity School Address,Field, Peter S.

The building is a rectangular two story brick building, laid in Flemish bond, with only minimal brownstone trim. It has a hip roof that is only broken by a gable at the center of the long side, part of a projecting central section three bays wide. The build has a pair of entrances on either side of this central section, which are framed by Greek Revival Doric porticos. In its early days, Divinity Hall contained the entire Divinity School. It was later used as a dormitory, then classrooms. Notable residents have included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Theodore Parker, and philosopher George Santayana. Its chapel contains a fine organ by George S. Hutchings, recently restored. Today, the building houses classrooms, faculty offices, and several administrative offices, including the Office of Student Life, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of Communications, and the Office of Development and External Relations.

Education Barletta Vallarino attended North Carolina State University, where he obtained in 1959 a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Engineering, and later an M.Sc. in Agricultural Economics. In 1971, he received a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. The title of his PhD dissertation was \\"Costs and social benefits of agricultural research in Mexico\\". Early career From 1968 until 1970 and 1973 until 1978, Barletta was one of General Omar Torrijos's trusted advisers as minister of planning and economic policy, president of the national banking commission and member of Panama's negotiation team on economic aspects, for the Panama Canal treaties. From 1978 to 1984, he was World Bank vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean. In late 1983, he was approached by President Ricardo de la Espriella about running for president as de la Espriella's successor. Presidency In February 1984, President Ricardo de la Espriella unexpectedly resigned the office and was succeeded by his vice president, Jorge Illueca, who did not enter the race for a full term. Ardito Barletta ran as the coalition candidate backed by the National Guard, and his candidacy had the support of the government. Opposing Ardito Barletta and the Unión Nacional Democrática (UNADE) coalition was the Democratic Opposition Alliance (Alianza Democrática de Oposición, or ADO) and its candidate, the 82-year-old veteran politician Arnulfo Arias, who had previously been president three times, each time being ousted from office by a military coup. 1984 election poster in support of Barletta The election was the country's first after 16 years of military rule, something that had been agreed to during US negotiations that led to the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977. Ardito Barletta was among the negotiators for Panama. The campaign proved to be bitterly contested, with both sides predicting victory. Arias and his backers claimed that Ardito Barletta was conducting the campaign unfairly. In addition, most of the media—television, radio stations, and newspapers—favored the government coalition. For example, only one of the country's five daily newspapers supported the ADO. Voting day on 6 May 1984 was peaceful, but violence led by Arias's supporters broke out the next day in front of the Legislative Palace, where the electoral board was meeting. One person was killed. The opposition charged that there was electoral misconduct and fraud. The candidates for congress on both sides challenged the vote count at the district level, delaying the final count. Meanwhile, both sides claimed victory. When the initial results showed Arias, who had the support of much of the opposition, on his way to a landslide victory, Noriega halted the count. After brazenly manipulating the results, the government announced that Barletta had won by a slim margin of 1,713 votes. Independent estimates suggested that Arias would have won by as many as 50,000 votes had the election been conducted fairly. More than 60,000 votes were not included in the final count. On 16 May 1984, the district results were finally tallied by the Electoral Tribunal and Ardito Barletta was declared the winner by 1,713 votes, defeating Arias. The U.S. government was aware of this manipulation, but chose not to comment on it. Noriega's rule became increasingly repressive, even as the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan began relying on him in its covert efforts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The U.S. accepted Barletta's election, and signaled a willingness to cooperate with him, despite recognizing the flaws in the election process. Arias's platform emphasized the need to reduce the influence of the military in Panamanian politics. Ardito Barletta's platform emphasized the reestablishment of democracy, economic development, and honest and efficient government. The US government declared that Ardito Barletta's victory must be seen as an important forward step in Panama's transition to democracy. Ardito Barletta, a strait-laced and soft-spoken technocrat, took office on 11 October 1984. In his inaugural address, the newly elected president pledged to repair the economy, fight corruption, and unite Panama's political parties. He quickly launched an attack on the country's economic problems and sought help from multilateral institutions to support an economic restructuring program. He promised to modernize the government's bureaucracy and implement an economic program that would generate a 5% annual growth rate. On 13 November 1984, to meet the IMF's requirements for a US$603 million loan renegotiation, Ardito Barletta announced economic austerity measures, including a 7% tax on all services and reduced budgets for cabinet ministries and autonomous government agencies, including the Defense Forces. In response to massive protests and strikes by labor, student, and professional organizations, he revoked some of those measures ten days later. Ardito Barletta's headstrong administrative style also offended Panamanian politicians, who had a customary backslapping and backroom style of politicking. During his tenure, the Defense Forces promised support to his program but effectively undermined the negotiations Ardito Barletta was pursuing with industrialists, labor leaders, and other business groups to achieve some economic reforms. While Ardito Barletta was visiting New York City, government critic Hugo Spadafora was found brutally murdered and decapitated. Spadafora had revealed that he had evidence linking Noriega to drug trafficking and illegal arms dealing. Relatives of Spadafora claimed that witnesses had seen him in the custody of Panamanian security forces near the Costa Rica border immediately before his decapitated body was found on 14 September 1985. Ardito Barletta promised to bring the killers to justice and recommended an independent commission to investigate the crime. At a meeting at Defense Forces Headquarters between Ardito Barletta and the commanders, serious discrepancies arose, leading to Ardito Barletta's resignation on 27 September 1985, after only eleven months in office. Ardito Barletta was succeeded the next day by his first vice president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, who announced a new cabinet on 3 October 1985. The ousting of Ardito Barletta is considered to have been the beginning of the end for Noriega; Ardito Barletta had been considered the best hope for a transition to democracy by Washington. Within four years, Noriega had been thrown out of office by American military intervention. Post-presidency Later on, Ardito Barletta was General Administrator of the Interoceanic Region Authority (ARI) from 1995 to 2000, an agency in charge of receiving, administrating, planning, and incorporating the former Canal Zone to national development. Today Ardito Barletta is a member of the Washington based think-tank The Inter-American Dialogue. References *Panama: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1987. Sandra W.

The Secretary for the Civil Service (SCS) is one of the Principal Officials appointed under the Accountability System and a Member of the Executive Council. He heads the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) of the Government Secretariat and is responsible to the Chief Executive (CE) for civil service policies as well as the overall management and development of the civil service. His primary role is to ensure that the civil service serves the best interests of the community and delivers various services in a trustworthy, efficient and cost effective manner. The CSB assumes overall policy responsibility for the management of the civil service, including such matters as appointment, pay and conditions of service, staff management, manpower planning, training, and discipline. Appointment Appointments to the civil service are based on open and fair competition. Candidates have to go through competitive appointment processes and are appointed only if they possess the qualifications and capabilities required for the job. Vacancies can be filled by promotion from within the service. In the case of basic ranks or where promotion is not possible or where there is a special need, vacancies are filled by open recruitment. To achieve the target of reducing the civil service establishment, the Government implemented a general recruitment freeze to the civil service with effect from 1 April 2003, with exemption granted only on very exceptional circumstances. Entry requirements for civil service posts in general are set on the basis of academic or professional qualifications obtainable from local institutions or professional bodies (or equivalent), technical skills, work experience, language proficiency and other qualities and attributes as required. To achieve the aim of a civil service which is biliterate (Chinese and English) and trilingual (generally conversant in spoken Cantonese, English and Mandarin), language proficiency in Chinese and English is also required. From January 2003 onwards, for civil service posts requiring degree or professional qualifications, applicants should pass the two language papers (Use of Chinese and Use of English) in the Common Recruitment Examination before job application. For civil service posts with general academic qualifications set below degree level, applicants should attain at least Grade E in Chinese and English (Syllabus B) in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, or equivalent. In accordance with the Basic Law, new recruits appointed on or after 1 July 1997 must be permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, save for certain specified exceptions. Promotion Officers are promoted on the criteria of character, ability, experience and prescribed qualifications. All eligible officers are considered on an equal basis. The officer selected for promotion must be the most meritorious one who is able and ready to perform duties at a higher rank. Public Service Commission The commission is an independent statutory body responsible for advising the CE on civil service appointment, promotion and disciplinary matters. In practice, the advice is rendered to the SCS and the CSB deals with the commission on individual cases. The chairman and members of the commission are appointed by the CE. The commission seeks to ensure the impartiality and fairness in appointments to the civil service and also advises on discipline matters. In accordance with the Public Service Commission Ordinance, advice of the commission has to be sought for appointment or promotion of officers to middle and senior ranking posts (excluding the disciplined ranks of the Hong Kong Police Force). The commission is also consulted on changes in appointment procedures applicable to civil service posts. Independent advisory bodies on pay and conditions of service Three independent bodies advise the Government on matters relating to pay and conditions of service. Their members are selected from outside the Government. * The Standing Committee on Directorate Salaries and Conditions of Service advises on matters affecting the directorate. * The Standing Commission on Civil Service Salaries and Conditions of Service advises on the principles and practices governing the pay and conditions of service of all non-directorate staff except those in the judicial and disciplined services.About SCCS * The Standing Committee on Disciplined Services Salaries and Conditions of Service advises on the pay and conditions of service of all disciplined services staff except the heads of the services who remain under the purview of the Standing Committee on Directorate Salaries and Conditions of Services. * The Standing Commission on Judicial Salaries and Conditions of Services advises on the structure, and matters relating to the system, institutional structure, methodology and mechanism for the determination of judicial salary. Key pay principles of civil service The objective of civil service pay is to offer sufficient remuneration to attract, retain, and motivate staff of suitable calibre to provide quality service to the public.Civil Service into the 21st Century Civil Service Reform Consultation Document. (1999, March). Retrieved from http://www.info.gov.hk/archive/consult/1999/reforme.pdf; Hong Kong Standing Commission on Civil Service Salaries and Conditions of Service, First Report on 1989 Salwy Structure Review (Report No. 23), October 1989. Both civil servants and the general public should view the pay for civil service fair. Broad Comparability with the private sector is important when considering the pay for the civil servants. This pay principle was sourced from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service in 1953.So, M. N. [蘇美儀]. (2003). Civil service reform in Hong Kong : pay determination system. (Thesis). University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. Retrieved from http://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b3196731 In 1965, the Commission further suggested that the principle of fair comparison should be weighted the most among all other considerations, including internal relatives, which is being emphasised too much in the past, commented by the Task Force on the HKSAR Civil Service Pay System. Training and development Job-related training is arranged by departments while induction and grade-specific management training are generally provided by respective grade management. The CSB provides training and development support to departments through its Civil Service Training and Development Institute. There are four core service areas: senior executive development, national studies programmes, human resources management consultancy service and promotion of a continuous learning culture. Senior executive development programmes include leadership development and national studies programmes for directorate and potential directorate officers. Advisory services on Human Resources Development (HRD) and succession planning are also provided. National studies programmes include courses at Mainland institutes such as the National School of Administration, Foreign Affairs University, Tsinghua University and Peking University. There are also local programmes on national affairs and the Basic Law, as well as staff exchange programme with the Mainland. An e-learning portal, the Cyber Learning Centre Plus is intended to promote a continuous learning culture. The Institute also disseminates best practices in HRD through its advisory services in training needs analysis, learning strategies, development of competency profiles, and performance management systems. Performance management Through the performance appraisal process, staff at different levels are made aware of the standard of performance expected of them. Management of the process helps maximise individual performance and enhance the corporate efficiency and effectiveness of the civil service as a whole. As an integral part of the overall human resource management functions, it is a major tool in human resource planning (e.g. succession planning), development (e.g. training and job rotation), and management (e.g. confirmation, promotion, posting and disciplinary action). Performance appraisal of staff is an ongoing process. Appraisal reports are normally completed annually. Transparency and objectivity of the appraisal process are also emphasised. To improve the system, department management is encouraged to put in place assessment panels to undertake levelling and moderating work among appraisal reports, identify under-performers/outstanding performers for appropriate action, adopt other management tools including target-based assessment and core competencies assessment. The Long and Meritorious Service Travel Award Scheme, the Long and Meritorious Service Award Scheme and the Retirement Souvenir Scheme provide additional rewards. A commendation system also exists to give recognition to exemplary performance. Staff discipline Disciplinary action may be taken against an act of misconduct to achieve a punitive, rehabilitative and deterrent effect. Staff relations There is both a central and a departmental staff consultative machinery. Centrally, there are the Senior Civil Service Council, the Model Scale 1 Staff Consultative Council, the Police Force Council, and the Disciplined Services Consultative Council. Through these channels, the Government consults its staff on any major changes, which affect their conditions of service. At the departmental level, there are Departmental Consultative Committees which aim to improve co- operation and understanding between management and staff through regular exchanges of views. There are established channels to deal with staff grievances and complaints. Individual members of staff with problems can receive counselling, advice and help. A Staff Suggestions Scheme is run by both the CSB and departments to encourage staff to make suggestions for improving the efficiency of the civil service. Awards are given to those whose suggestions are found useful. A Staff Welfare Fund caters for the interests of staff. A Staff Relief Fund provides assistance to meet unforeseen financial needs to staff.

She is best known for her drawings and prints of leading cultural figures, dancers and musicians in action, such as Francis Bacon, Mikhail Baryshnikov, T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky. Biography Milein Cosman was born in Gotha, Germany, in 1921 but spent most of her childhood in Düsseldorf. Because of her Jewish background and the rise of National Socialism, she went to school in Switzerland, at the Ecole d'Humanité and the International School of Geneva between 1937 and 1939. She came to England in 1939. Between 1939 and 1942, Cosman studied at the Slade School of Art. The Slade was located in Oxford during the war years and there Cosman studied drawing under Randolph Schwabe and lithography under Harold Jones. In 1943 she attended evening classes at Oxford Polytechnic, where she was taught by Bernard Meninsky. In the same year she started teaching French and Art at a convent school as well as giving lectures on Art for the Workers' Educational Association (WEA). In 1946, Cosman moved to London. She began book illustration and working as a freelance artist, while continuing to teach evening classes for the WEA and working for the American Broadcasting Station in Europe. She contributed drawings to national and international magazines and newspapers, including the BBC’s Radio Times. Particularly noteworthy is a commission from Heute to draw Konrad Adenauer's post-war cabinet in Germany 1949. In 1947, Cosman met the Viennese-born musician, writer, broadcaster and teacher Hans Keller (1919-1985), whom she married in 1961. Some books of his writings – The Jerusalem Diary (2001), Stravinsky The Music Maker (2010) and Britten (2013), for example – include many of her drawings and prints. Milein Cosman made a series of schools programmes on drawing for ITV in 1958. In all, she has had nearly 30 solo exhibitions in the UK and abroad and her work has been acquired by many leading museums including the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels and the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin. She was renowned for drawing quickly, and much of her work was done from the wings or auditorium during rehearsals for concerts, theatrical and dance performances, capturing movement “in mid-flight” as Ernst Gombrich put it. In 2006, Cosman founded the Cosman Keller Art and Music Trust, which aims to support young musicians and artists as well as publishing, exhibiting and archiving her own and Hans Keller’s work. In 2014, a documentary film on Milein Cosman made by Christoph Böll was premiered in Düsseldorf in her presence. She died in November 2017. She bequeathed a set of over 1300 drawings to the Royal College of Music, London. A biography and comprehensive overview of Cosman's art by art historian Ines Schlenker was released in 2019.Ines Schlenker (2019). Milein Cosman. Capturing Time. Prestel: Munich, London, New York.

Description The onsen consists of multiple ryokan surrounded by old growth forest are located along the Ohatagawa river within the Shimokita Hanto Quasi-National Park. The area includes a nationally run campground called 'Kokusetsu Yagen Yaeijo'. Oku- yagen Hot Spring is located 2 km upriver and an called 'Kappa-no-yu' . The outdoor baths 'Oku-yagen Onsen Rest House' and 'Fufu-kappa-no-yu' (Wedded Kappa Bath) are run by the municipality and are both located along the riverside. Kappa-no-you Hot Spring is located next to an abandoned Inn. With little to no upkeep this hot spring is closed and drained during the winter months (not locked). Clogging the drain will fill the pool in 7–8 hours, but the pool will need to be cleaned by removal of leaves and twigs prior to use. The water is extremely enjoyable during the winter months. During the summer it can be too hot to get into. History The onsen was discovered in 1615 by an ally of Hideyori Toyotomi, who retreated here after the defeat of the Toyotomi forces at the summer siege of Osaka Castle. The onsen was named after a tool used in the making of traditional herbal medicine, which it resembled. Oku-yagen Onsen claims an even older history. In 862, Jikaku Daishi, who discovered Osorezan, suffered a great injury after he got lost. The story is that he was saved by a kappa (water imp) who immersed him in the waters of the 'Kappa-no-yu' bath, thereby healing his injury. Access Shimokita Kotsu bus to Ōhata from Shimokita Station on the Ōminato Line of East Japan Railway Company takes roughly 30 minutes. It takes another 25 minutes after transferring buses in Ōhata.

They are preserved as examples of the thousands of similar houses that were built around shared courtyards, for the rapidly increasing population of Britain's expanding industrial towns. They are a very particular sort of British terraced housing. This sort of housing was deemed unsatisfactory, and the passage of the Public Health Act 1875 meant that no more were built; instead byelaw terraced houses took their place. This court, at 50–54 Inge Street and 55–63 Hurst Street, is now operated as a historic house museum by the National Trust. Numerous back-to-back houses, two or three storeys high, were built in Birmingham during the 19th century. Most of these houses were concentrated in inner-city areas such as Ladywood, Handsworth, Aston, Small Heath and Highgate. Most were still in quite good condition in the early 20th century and also prior to their demolition. By the early 1970s, almost all of Birmingham's back-to-back houses had been demolished. The occupants were rehoused in new council houses and flats, some in redeveloped inner-city areas, while the majority moved to new housing estates such as Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood. History =Lease= By the end of the 18th century, the land where the houses are now located was owned by several families. The Inge family, after whom Inge Street is named, owned the land on the west side of the street whilst the Gooch family owned the land to the east side, where the back to backs were built. The plot of land was 50 yards long and 20 yards wide. In 1789, Sir Thomas Gooch leased the land to John Willmore, a local toymaker. It was agreed that within a year, Willmore should construct two or more large houses at a total cost, including the outbuildings, of no less than £700. Willmore failed to do this and Court 15, as well as Court 14 adjacent, were built by his successors who remained on the street throughout the 19th century. When John Willmore died, the land was split between his sons Joseph and John Willmore, leading to the constructions looking different. =Construction= Court 14 was completed in 1802 by Joseph Willmore, a silversmith. It consisted of six front and eleven back houses with some workshops on the larger southern end of the building plot. When opened, it was known as Willmore's Court but was later renamed Court 14 Inge Street. It has since been demolished. At this time, John Willmore, a carpenter and joiner, constructed a house and workshop for himself. By 1809, the undeveloped remainder of the plot consisted of two nailer's workshops and a cooper's workshop with a knacker's yard behind. The Hurst Street frontage was filled with sheds. By 1821, No. 50 Inge Street/ 1 Court 15 had been converted into a pair of back to backs. No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 and No. 54 Inge Street/3 Court 15 were built about 1830. The terrace along Hurst Street was constructed in 1831. =Occupants= The exterior houses, showing the shop fronts and the entrance to the courtyard Throughout the 19th century, the court was occupied by workers who worked in such industries as button making, glasswork, woodwork, leatherwork, tailoring and were also skilled craftsmen in the jewellery and small metal trades. Many of such workers worked from home. Over 500 families have lived in Court 15. From the 1830s to the 1930s, the Mitchells, a family of locksmiths and bellhangers, lived in the court. At one time, they were occupying both No. 55 Hurst Street and No. 54 Inge Street/3 Court 15. The family also worked at the workshop in the court for over 70 years. In 1851, Joseph Barnett, a travelling jeweller, lived at number 35 Inge Street, with his wife Hanna, and four children, Samuel, Eli Louis, Rebecca and Henry. Other people who lived there highlight the crowded conditions of the houses, which were usually occupied by single families. In 1851, for example Sophia Hudson, a widow who worked as a pearl button driller, probably from home, lived at No. 1 Court 15 with her five children and her mother who also a widow. In 1861, Herbert Oldfield, a glass eye maker, occupied the same address with his wife and their eight children. At the same time, the Mitchell family had an apprentice who lived with them. Despite the cramped conditions, some families, such as the one who occupied 61 Hurst Street in 1851, were able to afford a servant. By 1900, the ground floors had been converted into shops. Services offered from the buildings were a cycle maker, a hairdresser, a ticket writer, a fruiterer and a furniture dealer. The upper floors of No. 55 and No. 59 Hurst Street, the cycle maker's and the ticket writer's properties respectively, were converted into workshops as opposed to residential. Most of the buildings remained in residential use until 1966 when they were declared as unfit for habitation. This resulted in those living in the buildings being required to leave. =Restoration= In 1988, the court received Grade II listed status from the Department of National Heritage. In 1995, Birmingham City Council commissioned the City of Hereford Archaeological Unit to survey and record them. Funding for this project was provided by the city council and English Heritage. The Birmingham Back to Backs were restored by the Birmingham Conservation Trust, in collaboration with architects S. T. Walker & Duckham, and opened to the public on 21 July 2004. Their restoration was the subject of a five-part documentary by Carlton Television. Each of the four houses is decorated and furnished as if in a different era; 1840s, 1870s, 1930s and 1970s. Visits are by pre-booked, timed guided tours only. Layout and design Panorama of the central courtyard The court consists of three pairs of back-to-back houses on Inge Street and a terrace of five blind back houses on Hurst Street, in the form of an L-shaped footprint. All the buildings are three storeys tall with one room on each floor. No. 50 Inge Street/ 1 Court 15, the first to be constructed, is the tallest and the largest in the court. Some evidence exists to indicate that it was originally a single dwelling but it has been occupied for most of its life as a pair of back to backs. Evidence to show that it may have originally been one house is available through the layout of the attic. The attic runs across the whole depth of the pair of houses, but was never divided and can only be reached from the back house of No. 1 Court 15 where the surviving staircase is of much better quality than any remaining in the other houses in Court 15. On the second floor, there is a now-blocked doorway in the spine wall between the two houses indicating that the floors to both houses were both accessible. At this level too, No. 50 Inge Street has been split into two rooms by a partition wall. The smaller of the two rooms is unheated and lit by a casement window. There are two tall chimney stacks, one for each house, in the pair. The tunnel entrance to the court runs between No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 and No. 54 Inge Street/ 3 Court 15. Each pair of houses shares a single chimney set on the ridge of the roof. The two back houses each have a bay window to allow more light into the ground floor room. The lower floors to these houses have been divided by two spine walls. The upper floors are divided by one spine wall. In No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 only one original stairway remains — from the ground to the first floor in the front house. The stair in No. 54 Inge Street has been removed at ground floor level but in No. 3 Court 15 the complete staircase survives. A pail closet The rear entrances to Nos. 55, 57 and 59 are gained through a very narrow tunnel entry from Court 15. A staircase on the back wall of each house led up to the first and second floors. The houses were lit by windows on the Hurst Street side and heated by shared chimney stacks. No. 63 Hurst Street shared a chimney with No. 65 Hurst Street, the front house of a pair of back to backs which were part of Court 2 Hurst Street, now demolished. No. 55 Hurst Street has a large bay window at first floor level overlooking Inge Street, which is an early feature. All the houses in the terrace have late 20th century shop fronts, replacing earlier ones which were installed about 1900. Court 15 may have originally had a water pump in the courtyard, though this is not known for certain. By the 1880s, a single tap had been installed. The brick paved yard contains an open drain running in front of the three back houses. In the 1930s, the two washhouses and water closets (outdoor flush toilets) were constructed on the site of the workshops and outbuildings in the courtyard.

The film takes its name from the 1959 hit song, \\"Love Potion No. 9\\". The story is about a love potion, that enables a person to make people of the opposite sex become completely infatuated with them by simply talking. Plot Paul Matthews (Tate Donovan) is a lonely biochemist with a crush on his unavailable co-worker, biologist Diane Farrow (Sandra Bullock). His friends take him to a gypsy on 34th and Vine named Madame Ruth (Anne Bancroft). After reading his palm and seeing absolutely no romance in his life, Ruth gives him a small amount of Love Potion No. 8 on a piece of paper. As a scientist, Paul has doubts and ends up throwing it in the trash when he gets home. Around this time, Paul's friends buy him the services of Marisa, but all they do is talk. His cat gets into the trash and eats some of the potion, then meows and attracts all the other cats in the neighborhood. When Paul sees the results, he takes it to Diane, and they find out the \\"scientific\\" properties of it. After analyzing it, they decide to use themselves as human test subjects. Diane ends up attracting an Italian car mogul and the prince of England, ending up getting a makeover in the process, while Paul has a string of hookups with women in bars, supermarkets, cars, sorority houses. Paul and Diane realize their romantic attraction to each other and become involved. Eventually, Paul plans a proposal to Diane; however, when he comes by her house to do so, she's not there. Later, she tells him she has fallen for Gary (Dale Midkiff). (We have seen Gary before, taking advantage of her loneliness to have sex with her.) Paul is devastated and decides he really wants to get her back. Marisa comes to his house to steal his stereo, and after trying the potion in his bathroom, she makes Paul gladly give her all his valuables, including the potion. After \\"waking up\\" from his infatuation, Paul gets an idea, and Madame Ruth confirms that somebody looking like Gary has bought all the potion No. 8. He phones Diane to tell her Gary is using the potion on her, but Gary forbids her to talk to him. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts, Paul goes back to Madame Ruth, who gives him Love Potion No. 9, which will not create love, but remove things obscuring it (such as potion No. 8). But if Diane was never really in love with him, Paul will love her for his entire life and she will eternally hate him. Paul asks three friends to help him force Diane to take No. 9, but they can't believe him. Marisa arrives at the house and uses No. 8 to rob all of them, proving the power of the potion. When they arrive at the house, Diane's friend and matron of honor tells them Diane and Gary are marrying in an hour, but that she suspects something is wrong with Diane. Paul explains, she agrees to give Diane the potion, and things go terribly wrong, but Marisa, having tricked Gary's potion bottle from him, causes havoc and effectively ends the wedding, which gives Paul the chance to drink Potion No. 9, kiss Diane and wait five minutes as per the instructions. The effect kicks in too late but in the end, Diane runs away from Gary into Paul's arms. Note The film gives a pseudoscientific explanation as to how Love Potion No. 8 \\"works.\\" It's explained: :When swallowed it affects the vocal cords directly so that when you speak micro-tremors encoded within your voice stimulate tiny little hairs in the inner ear of the opposite sex. The hair vibrates, sending a signal along a nerve to the brain, which in turn produces a combination of mood- altering, endogenous chemicals responsible for the biochemical process of falling in love. It makes members of the same sex hostile. It only works for four hours at a time. Love Potion No. 9 prevents love from fading, and overrides the effects of Love Potion No. 8.

Emanuel Levy of Variety called it \\"a light-hearted one-joke romantic comedy\\" and that it \\"tries too hard to be cute. Glib humor and emphasis on \\"feel good\\" values aim squarely at the dating crowd and twenty-something couples. But lack of real wit and comic vitality, absence of star names and sluggish pace make pic less appealing than it might have been.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"D\\" grade. The film opened in 278 theaters and earned $416,641 in its opening weekend, and its North American domestic total was $754,935.

The title Colonel, however, was honorary. He was the first president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, as well as one of the railroad's directors for nearly 40 years, up to 1900. A number of railway locomotives have been named after him, as well as the former town of Holliday, Kansas. He was also the Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge A.F. & A.M. of Kansas. As a Freemason, he was a member of Topeka Lodge #17 and was highly influential in the decision of moving the State Capitol to the city of Topeka. Education and early career He was born on April 3, 1826, to David and Mary (Kennedy) Holliday, in Kidderminster, Pennsylvania (near Carlisle). The younger Holliday received a public school education, graduating from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he studied law, in 1852. Although he moved to Kansas in 1854, Allegheny College's alumni records show Holliday receiving a master's degree in 1855. While he was still in Meadville, he was asked to prepare legal documentation for a new railroad that would connect to the city. The proposed railroad (likely the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad which was sometimes known as \\"The Meadville Line\\") would almost connect with a larger nearby system (the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad), which meant that it could become a feeder route to the larger railroad. Holliday saw the potential of the line and instead of asking for a standard fee to create the documents, he asked for and was granted a partnership in the new railroad. When this railroad was purchased by the larger system, Holliday earned $20,000 from the sale. After the sale was completed, he married Mary Dillon Jones. He soon followed the many others making the migration to settle land west of the Mississippi River, but Mary stayed behind in Pennsylvania. The two were reunited later in Kansas after the births of their children, Lillie and Charles King. Founding Topeka and military service In 1854 he moved to Kansas, leaving his wife behind in Pennsylvania to follow later. He first settled in Lawrence in October 1854. On December 10, 1854, after helping to find a location for the new townsite of Topeka, he wrote a letter to his wife saying: > I am now thirty miles above Lawrence on the Kansas River assisting in > starting a new town. We are just about in the central portion of the > \\"settled\\" Territory and with perhaps the best landing and the most eligible > site for a city in the entire country. ... So I think it must be, and in a > few years when civilization by its magic influence shall have transformed > this glorious country from what it is now to the brilliant destiny awaiting > it, the Sun in all his course will visit no land more truly lovely and > desirable than this. Here, Mary, with God's kind permission, we will make > our home; and I have every reason to believe a home it will truly be. In 1855 Holliday received the honorary title of Colonel for supervising a regiment during the Wakarusa War. He also served as the Adjutant General of Kansas during the Civil War from May 2, 1864, to March 31, 1865. Although his Colonel title was only honorary, he continued to use it long after his military service. In 1861, Holliday served in the Kansas State Senate, and although he ran for Congress in 1874, he was defeated in that election. He was a Republican. Holliday had broad interests in developing the natural resources of Kansas. In the 1890s he became mistakenly convinced that Ellis and Trego counties in central Kansas contained mineral deposits of tin, zinc, and gold. In 1899 his son Charles K. Holliday founded Smoky Hill City, Kansas, near the supposed mineral deposits. Santa Fe Railroad Once Topeka was founded, it needed transportation to connect it to the rest of the country. Holliday's legal skills were called on again to create the paperwork for a new railroad. In 1859 he singlehandedly wrote the charter for the Atchison and Topeka Railroad Company, which would connect the two cities by rail following the route of the Santa Fe Trail. Kansas Territory governor Samuel Medary approved the charter on February 11, 1859. Holliday was named a director and president of the new railroad on September 17, 1860, which was renamed in 1863 to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. During his tenure as president, Holliday secured land grants from the federal government that would soon be used by the railroad to populate the western portion of Kansas in order to build a customer base for the railroad. He stepped down from the presidency at the end of 1863, but remained on the board of directors until July 27, 1865. He rejoined the board on September 24, 1868, this time serving until his death on March 29, 1900.Waters, p. 346. Legacy Officials of the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe, on the line's Cyrus K.

To prepare the tea, chrysanthemum flowers (usually dried) are steeped in hot water (usually 90 to 95 degrees Celsius after cooling from a boil) in either a teapot, cup, or glass; often rock sugar or cane sugar is also added, and occasionally also wolfberries. The resulting drink is transparent and ranges from pale to bright yellow in color, with a floral aroma. In Chinese tradition, once a pot of chrysanthemum tea has been drunk, hot water is typically added again to the flowers in the pot (producing a tea that is slightly less strong); this process is often repeated several times. Chrysanthemum tea was first drunk during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).  Varieties  = China = Several varieties of chrysanthemum, ranging from white to pale or bright yellow in color, are used for tea. These include: *Huángshān-gòngjú (, literally \\"Yellow Mountain tribute chrysanthemum\\"); also called simply gòngjú () *Hángbáijú (), originating from Tongxiang, near Hangzhou; also called simply Hángjú, () *Chújú (), originating from the Chuzhou district of Anhui *Bójú (), originating in the Bozhou district of Anhui Of these, the first two are most popular.

The drained flowers are covered with hanji and dried in an ondol (floor-heated) room. When served, three to four flowers are added to hot water. * Honey chrysanthemum tea – The flowers are carefully washed and dried, then preserved in honey for three to four weeks. When served, the preserved flowers are added to hot water. * Medicinal chrysanthemum tea – The flowers are washed carefully, steamed using the water mixed with herbal decoction and dried. When fully dried, they are steamed again, and dried again. This process is repeated nine times. Water to decoction ratio can be 8:1, and the decoction is usually made of dried roots of white woodland peony, steamed and dried roots of rehmannia, dried roots of Korean angelica, and dried roots of lovage. Commercial availability Yeo's Chrysanthemum tea, available commercially in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.

Lubaba married Abbas ibn Abd- al-Muttalib al-Hashimi, who was an uncle of Muhammad. Tabari states that Lubaba was only Abbas's concubine, but this suggestion that she was a slave is at odds with her family's middle-class status. The union produced seven children: Al-Fadl, Abdullah, Ubaydullah, Quthum, Mabad, Abdur-Rahman and Umm Habib.Tabari/Landau-Tasseron vol. 39 p. 201. Abbas also had five children by other women.  Islam  Lubaba claimed to be the second woman to convert to Islam, the same day as her close friend Khadijah. She and her sisters were very prominent in the early Muslim community. Muhammad commented on their family effort: \\"The faithful sisters are Asma and Salma, daughters of Umays, and Lubaba and Maymuna, daughters of Al-Harith.\\" Abbas had kept his Islam secret in 622, so he and Lubaba remained in Mecca when other Muslims emigrated to Medina.  Death of Abu Lahab  When the news of the Meccan defeat at the Battle of Badr arrived in Mecca in 624, there was general consternation; but Abbas's Muslim freedman, Abu Rafi, could not contain his joy. Abbas's brother Abu Lahab was so furious that he assaulted Abu Rafi, knocking him to the ground and then kneeling on top of him to continue beating him. Several able- bodied men witnessed or were in calling distance of this attack, but it was Lubaba who grabbed a tent-pole and cracked it across Abu Lahab’s head, asking, “Do you think it’s all right to attack him because Abbas is absent?” Abu Lahab's head was split open, exposing his skull; When he died a week later, it was said to be of an infection, ulcer, or the plague.Bukhari 7:62:38  Attention from Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf  A few months later, Lubaba was the subject of a love-song by the Jewish poet Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf. The song is almost certainly sarcastic, as the Amir tribe were Ka'b's traditional enemies and, in his perception, the reverse of \\"honourable\\" or \\"trustworthy\\". The reference to pedlar's products in the third and fourth lines, and to wobbling flesh in the fifth and sixth, presumably indicates that Lubaba was plump, painted and middle-aged (although she was probably under thirty).

Ricardo de la Espriella is a Stanford-trained economist. Espriella was the general manager of National Bank of Panama from 1970 to 1978, when he became Vice President in 1978, when the all-powerful National Guard pressed then President Aristides Royo (considered a dangerous leftist) to resign before his term ended in 1984. Since de la Espriella was head of the National Finance Commission before Royos's resignation, there was a matter of his involvement with a certain insurance fraud called the \\"Seguros Swindle\\", which cut of his came to $115,000. Being a competent financial manager, he posed no threat to the dominant influence of the National Guard, and wasted no time in referring to them as \\"a partner in power\\". Thus, de la Espriella was a type of \\"puppet\\" president and remained so under the brutal Manuel Noriega (Panama's first Chief of Intelligence, and then Guard commander when Rubén Darío Paredes resigned that title to start his own electoral campaign). When de la Espriella took the oath as Interim President, the then-Commander Paredes immediately decreed that certain Panamanian papers be shut down, including La Prensa, which had become the country's conscience. De la Espriella ordered certain hoodlums to attack the newspaper, smashing the windows, typewriters, the head of a pressman, and an unfortunate unintended victim - the director of the Central American Institute of Business Administration, who had just come by with a press release from his institution. His suit and tie caused him to be mistaken for the \\"La Prensa\\" director. In August 1982, de la Espriella formed a new cabinet that included independents and members of the Liberal Party and the PRD; Jorge Illueca, Royo's foreign minister, became the new vice president. Meanwhile, Colonel Armando Contreras became chief of staff of the National Guard, until December 1982, when Noriega took over that position. The country had only a \\"democratic façade.\\" President Ronald Reagan wrote de la Espriella a response \\"thank you\\" letter on \\"the situation in Central America\\", dated 26 July 1983, regarding a letter received by him from de la Espriella and the presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, written regarding a meeting held by the four in Cancún on 17 July 1983. Reagan's \\"thank you\\" also outlined 4 points the United States expected the \\"Contadora Four\\" (as they were called) to follow. De la Espriella remained public and appeared in Time magazine, Newsweek, and other magazines - one of which printed a 1983 photo of him sitting next to then-Vice President George H. W. Bush who sat alongside a young, uniformed Manuel Noriega. If a picture is worth a thousand words, de la Espriella not only appeared as president, but as a \\"mediator\\" or \\"interpreter of events\\" whenever Noriega hovered. But by 1984, de la Espriella was pressured by the National Defense Forces, according to close friends, to reorganize his Cabinet to include supporters of an official candidate.

Early life Prince Kuni Taka was born in Kyoto, the fifth son of Prince Kuni Asahiko, a scion of the sesshu shinōke line of Fushimi-no-miya. His mother was Izumitei Shizue, the second daughter of Isumitise Shun'eki, a priest at Kamo Shrine, Kyoto. He was a half-brother of Prince Kaya Kuninori, Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi (the father of Empress Kōjun), Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, Prince Asaka Yasuhiko, and Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko. Prince Taka came of age at a time when the Meiji oligarchs deemed to politically expedient to sever the historical links between Buddhism and the imperial house; use the emperor and imperial family as symbols of national unity by having them serve in the military; and increase the size of the imperial family by allowing new princely houses to branch out from the Fushimi-no-miya. Prince Taka's career path was somewhat unusual for the late Meiji period in several respects. First, unlike his half-brothers and other princes of that generation, he never held a commission in the military. Second, Emperor Meiji did not direct him to form a new princely family or to descend to peerage status with a kazoku title. Instead, he remained within the imperial family, although his half-brother, Prince Kuni Kunyoshi, succeeded to the Kuni-no-miya title in 1891. Third, while his father and half-brothers moved to the new capital, Tokyo, in 1892, Prince Taka continued to reside in Kyoto, except for a brief period in 1895, when he served a term in the House of Peers. Marriage & Family On 9 March 1907, Prince Taka of Kuni married Minase Shizuko ( 1 September 1884 – 27 September 1959), the eldest daughter of Viscount Minase Tadasuki. The prince and princess had five children: two daughters who married into kazoku houses, one son who died in childhood, and two other sons who left the imperial family and received peerages upon adulthood: # . # . # ; m. 2 April 1939 to Prince Nijō Tanemoto ( 10 June 1910 - 28 August 1985) and had issue. # ; renounced imperial title and created Count Uji, October 1942; m. Kazuko ( 26 June 1926 - ), third daughter of Prince Nobusuke Takatsukasa, and had issue. # , renounced imperial title and created Count Tatsuda, 7 June 1943; adopted by Nashimoto Itsuko, the widow of former Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, 28 April 1966, and changed surname to Nashimoto; current head of the former Nashimoto-no-miya house; m. at Tokyo 1945 (div. 1979) Princess Kuni Masako ( 8 December 1926 - ), eldest daughter of Prince Kuni Asaakira; and has issue: Norihisa, Toyoko and Kayoko. Prince Taka became acting grand custodian and chief priest of the Shrines of Ise in September 1909, due to the illness of his half brother, Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi. He assumed the post on a permanent basis following Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi's death. References and further reading # Keene, Donald.

Life He worked in the Deptford shipyards in south-east London; he was also associated with neighbouring Rotherhithe, where he lived for a time at 14 Lucas Street. Having unsuccessfully tried to found a labour organisation during the 1790s, Gast helped organise the 'Hearts of Oak Benefit Society' during a shipwrights' strike in 1802 and was advocating workers' rights in radical pamphlets such as 'Calumny Defeated, or A Complete Vindication of the Conduct of the Working Shipwrights', during the late Disputes with their Employers (1802). Having been involved with regional efforts to build trade unions (notably the Metropolitan Trades Committee), in 1822 Gast formed a 'Committee of the Useful Classes', sometimes described as an early national trades council, and in 1824 he was the first secretary of the 'Thames Shipwrights Provident Union'. Gast also promoted an inter-union organisation: 'The Philanthropic Hercules'. In 1825, the Combination Acts were repealed. Employers were furious and lobbied for the Acts’ restoration, prompting the emergence of workers' movements to resist such steps; Gast founded the first Trades Newspaper as part of this resistance, with Joseph Clinton Robertson. In 1836, Gast was a member of the London Working Men's Association, some of whose members drafted the core six points of the People's Charter (the principles at the heart of the Chartist movement). He was also a dissenting preacher and ran the King of Prussia public house at 6 Union Street (now Albury Street), Deptford. E. P.

This was accomplished through Valve's Steam content delivery system. In 2007, Ritual was acquired by casual game developer MumboJumbo, stalling the franchise and leaving the future of the series uncertain. With the sale of Ritual to MumboJumbo and departure of several employees, all future development of Sin Episodes appears to be delayed indefinitely, if not entirely canceled. MumboJumbo has already tasked Ritual to develop \\"high- quality casual content.\\" Gameplay Three Mercenaries, two with the Assault Rifle, one with the Scattergun.

In this high score mode the objective is to survive as long as possible among the steadily spawning and increasing enemies. There are time limits to the maps and it is possible to survive an entire round. The scoring system is also tied to the Personal Challenge System which runs at a much higher rate than in the main game. The challenge level changes every few seconds depending on the player's performance and the higher the challenge, the higher the rate of points that are accumulated. This mode was introduced into the game on June 26, 2006 with four maps available. An update was released on July 18, 2006 which included three further maps. Plot Freeport City is a bustling, futuristic megacity with a population of 27,000,000 and described as a mix of New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo.

Development Ritual's original intention was to release an episode every six months that would cost US$19.95 and take around four to six hours to complete. A total of nine episodes were envisioned. Although originally released as a single-player game, various multiplayer modes were planned including co-operative and team based modes. One of Ritual's main design goals with SiN Episodes was to offer interactivity, character-driven gameplay, emergent AI, and a plot reflecting the choices made by players through an opt-in statistics system that aggregates play data to a database: the intention that future episodes would thus depend on the choices that are made by each player. SiN Episodes is built on the Source engine with additional technology added by Ritual. *Community- driven outcomes: Ritual is considering using the trends of players to decide the plot development of the game in future episodes, a concept only possible with episodic development. If the majority of players make the same decision when faced with a choice, future episodes can be steered towards that outcome. Ritual explains, \\"if a feature is well-received by gamers, we might expand its role in the game, whereas aspects that aren't liked can be changed or phased out completely.\\" At the same time they said, \\"we understand that it may be frustrating to not see 'your' outcome become a reality, so we’re still determining the extent to which this feature will be implemented.\\" *Multiple- material surfaces: The Source engine does not natively support multiple materials on a prop—in other words, a model can only be made out of one thing. If an object such as a vehicle includes glass it will behave like the metal covering the body, and if you add armour to a character it will behave like flesh, unless you set the entire character to be metal. Ritual has added technology to alleviate this and have different material types on the same model. *Dynamic difficulty: Dubbed the Personal Challenge System, SiN Episodes adapts itself to the player's skill level and varies the skill, numbers and toughness of enemies faced in accordance the player's performance to ensure a suitable level of challenge as well as to help pace the player through the game, ensuring an even game length across all skill levels. Indeed, Ritual claims that a proficient FPS player and a brand new FPS player started at the same time and, despite their widely different level of ability, finished within a small range of time of each other. However, a bug present on release in the dynamic difficulty system caused the system to never ease up on players making it overly challenging and unforgiving. An update released through Steam on May 17, 2006 resolved this problem. Reception SiN Episodes: Emergence received generally favorable reviews and currently holds the score of 75 on Metacritic. As of January 27, 2007 the game had sold 150,000 units, enough to recoup development costs but not enough to fund a sequel.

No date of birth is known. He died in 652 CE, at al-Rabadha, in the desert east of Medina. Abu Dhar is remembered for his strict piety and also his opposition to Muawiyah during the caliph Uthman ibn Affan era. He is venerated by Shia Muslims as one of The Four Companions, early Muslims who were followers (Shia) of Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was regarded by many, including Ali Shariati, Muhammad Sharqawi and Sami Ayad Hanna, as a principal antecedent of Islamic socialism, the first Islamic socialist, or the first socialist altogether. He protested against the accumulation of wealth by the ruling class during ‘Uthmān's caliphate and urged the equitable redistribution of wealth. Early life Little is known of his life before his conversion to Islam.[Michael Molloy][Molloy], Experiencing the World's Religions: Traditions, Challenge, and Change, Sixth Edition, 2009, p. 853 Abu Dhar is said to have been a serious young man, an ascetic and a monotheist even before he converted. He was born to the Ghifar clan, found to the western south of Medina.Watt, Muhammad at Medina, 1956, p. 81 Abu Dhar was apparently typical of the early converts to Islam, described by Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri as \\"young men and weak people\\".cited in Watt, Muhammad at Mecca, 1953, p. 87 They were a branch of the Banu Kinanah tribe. The Quraysh clan of Muhammad was also a branch of the Banu Kinanah tribe. Popular accounts of Abu Dhar say that his tribe lived by pillaging caravans, but that he preferred to live a poor but honest life as a shepherd. Having heard the contention that a new prophet had arisen in Mecca, Abu Dhar and his brother travelled to Mecca to find the prophet. The young seeker converted instantly and rushed out to declare his new faith in front of the Kaaba, which at that time was a pagan temple. He was beaten for his religious belief. He did this three days in a row, after which the Prophet Muhammad told him to return to his clan, where he taught his people about Islam. He and his tribe then joined Muhammad after the Hijra, or migration to Medina in 622 CE. Muhammad once said that \\"the sky did not spread its canopy on any man who was more truthful than Abu Dharr.\\" This seems to be a simplified account of stories reported in these hadiths, , and . According to the early Islamic historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Abu Dhar claimed to have been the fourth or fifth convert to Islam. However, Saad bin Abi Waqqas made the same claim. While the exact order of conversion may never be established, no one doubts that he was a very early convert. Military campaigns during Muhammad's era He participated in the Battle of Badr. Muhammad's forces included Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali, Hamza, Mus\`ab ibn \`Umair, Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, Ammar ibn Yasir, and Abu Dharr al- Ghifari. The Muslims also brought seventy camels and two horses, meaning that they either had to walk or fit three to four men per camel.Lings, pp. 138–139 However, many early Muslim sources indicate that no serious fighting was expected, and the future Caliph Uthman stayed behind to care for his sick wife Ruqayyah, the daughter of Muhammad. Salman the Persian also could not join the battle, as he was still not a free man. During the Expedition of Ka’b ibn 'Umair al-Ghifari his son Umair al-Ghifari was killed. In this expedition Muhammad ordered an attack on the Banu Quda‘a tribe because Muhammad received intelligence that they had gathered a large number of men to attack the Muslim positions In response Muhammad ordered the Third Expedition of Dhu Qarad to take revenge for the killing of the son of Abu Dhar Ghifari at al-GhabaA. J. Cameron, A. J. Cameron (Ph.D.), Abû Dharr al-Ghifârî: an examination of his image in the hagiography of Islam, p. 33. After Muhammad's death Abu Dharr had begun his agitation in Medina after Uthman had given 500,000 dirhams to Marwan I, 300,000 to al-Harith b. al-Hakam, and 100,000 to the Medinan Zayd ibn Thabit from the khums of the booty seized in Ifriqiya in 27/647. He then quoted relevant Qur'anic passages threatening the hoarders of riches with hell-fire. Marwan complained to Uthman, who sent his servant Natil to warn Abu Dhar, but to no avail. Uthman displayed patience for some time until, in the presence of the caliph, Abu Dhar launched an angry verbal attack on Ka'ab al- Ahbar, who had backed Uthman's free use of public money. Uthman now chided Abu Dhar and sent him to Damascus.Madelung, Succession to Muhammad, 1997, p. 84 There is a tradition that Muhammad predicted this sad end during the Battle of Tabouk, when Abu Dharr was left behind because his camel was ill or too weak. So he alighted from it and, placing the pack on his back, walked to the rest of the army. Muhammad saw him and exclaimed: > Abu Dharr, may Allah have mercy upon you! You'll live alone, die alone and > enter Paradise alone. Sunni view Many hadith, oral traditions, are traced to Abu Dhar. He is respected as an early and observant Muslim, and a man who was honest and direct to a fault. He was, according to the Sunni tradition, a rough, unlettered Bedouin who held no high office, but who served the Muslim community, the Ummah, with everything he had to give. During the caliphate of Uthman, he stayed in Damascus and witnessed Muslims deviating from Islam, going after worldly pleasures and desires. He was saddened and repelled by this. So Uthman invited him to come to Madinah. where he was also hurt by people's pursuit of worldly goods and pleasures. Al-Rabathah Abu Dhar then asked Uthman for permission to live in al-Rabathah, a small village in eastern Madinah. Uthman approved his request. Abu Dhar stayed there away from people, holding on to the traditions (sunnah) of Muhammad and his companions. A man visited him once and when he found his house almost bare, he asked Abu Dhar: \\"Where are your possessions?\\" Abu Dhar said: \\"We have a house yonder (meaning the Hereafter), to which we send the best of our possessions.\\" The man understood what Abu Dhar meant and said: \\"But you must have some possessions so long as you are in this abode.\\" \\"The owner of this abode will not leave us in it,\\" replied Abu Dharr. Also, when the Prince (Amir) of Syria sent Abu Dhar three hundred dinars to meet his needs, he returned the money saying, \\"Does not the Amir find a servant more deserving of it than I?\\" Abu Dhar continued in his simple life, and dedicated himself to Allah only until he died, in 32 A.H. Shi'a view Aba Dharr is considered one of the greatest and most loyal sahaba, along with Salman the Persian, Miqdad ibn Aswad, and Ammar ibn Yasir. When Abu Dharr was exiled to al-Rabathah by Caliph Uthman bin Affan under duress from Muawiyah, Ali and his sons, Hasan and Husayn, advanced to see him off. Ali said to him: > Abu Dharr, you've become very angry for Allah. The people are worried about > their religion, and you are worried about your religion. So, leave what they > are worried about in your hands and escape from them with what you're > worried about. They're in need of what you've prevented them from. And > you're in no need of what they've prevented you from. Tomorrow you'll know > who will be the winner. Abu Dharr, nothing amuses you but the truth and > nothing annoys you but the untruth. Abu Dharr, his wife, and his daughter were exiled to al-Rabathah, a rural town outside Madinah, as he recalled Muhammad's words: \\"Abu Dharr, may Allah have mercy upon you. You'll live alone, die alone, rise from the dead alone and enter Paradise alone.\\" Abu Dharr was a man of extreme devotion to Islam and Muhammad is believed to have said: > Abu Dharr is like Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus) of my nation in his zuhd > (asceticism) and wara' (peity). > Neither has the sky shaded one more truthful and honest than Abu Dhar nor > has the earth had anyone walk over it like him. Lebanon has two shrines dedicated to Abu Dharr commemorating his effort in spreading Islam, one in Sarepta and the other in Meiss al-Jabal.

Theodore is the subject of an opera by G. Paisiello, Il re Teodoro in Venezia (1784, Vienna), and one of the six kings in Venice in Voltaire's Candide. Biography Theodor von Neuhoff was born in Cologne as the son of a Westphalian nobleman. Educated at the court of France, he served first in the French army and then in that of Sweden. Baron de Goertz, minister to Charles XII, realizing Neuhoff's capacity for intrigue, sent him to England, and to Spain to negotiate with Cardinal Alberoni. Having failed in this mission he returned to Sweden and then went to Spain, where he served Alberoni until his exile, then the Baron Ripperda, and was made colonel and married one of the queen's ladies-in-waiting. Deserting his wife soon afterwards he repaired to France and became mixed up in John Law's financial affairs and the Mississippi Company boom; then he led a wandering existence visiting Portugal, the Netherlands, and Italy. Theodor von Neuhoff (mezzotint by Schad ca. 1740). Note use of Moor's head. At Genoa, Neuhoff made the acquaintance of some Corsican rebels and exiles, and persuaded them that he could free their country from Genoese tyranny if they made him king of the island. With the help of the Bey of Tunis, he landed in Corsica in March 1736 with military aid. The islanders, whose campaign had not been successful, elected and crowned him king. He assumed the title of King Theodore I, issued edicts, instituted an order of knighthood, and waged war on the Genoese, at first with some success. But in-fighting among the rebels soon led to their defeat. The Genoese put a price on his head and published an account of his colourful past, and he left Corsica in November 1736, ostensibly to seek foreign assistance. After sounding out the possibility of protection from Spain and Naples, he set off to Holland where he was arrested for debt in Amsterdam. On regaining his freedom, Theodore sent his nephew to Corsica with a supply of arms; he himself returned to Corsica in 1738, 1739, and 1743, but the combined Genoese and French forces continued to occupy the island. After that he fled to the Netherlands again and lived some years in exile in the manor house ‘t Velde near Zutphen. There he made plans for new actions to gain power again as king of Corsica. 1749 he arrived in England to seek support, but eventually fell into debt and was confined in a debtors' prison in London until 1755. He regained his freedom by declaring himself bankrupt, making over his kingdom of Corsica to his creditors, and subsisted on the charity of Horace Walpole and some other friends until his death in London in 1756, aged 62. Although it is sometimes said that he married the daughter of Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan and Lady Honora Burke, his wife Catalina Sarsfield was in fact from a different branch of the Irish Catholic Sarsfield family, and was the daughter of David Sarsfield of County Limerick. A certain Colonel Frederick (c. 1725-1797), who claimed to be Theodore's son, was known as the Prince of Caprera. He served in the army of King Frederick II of Prussia and afterwards acted as agent in London for the duke of Württemberg. Frederick wrote an account of his purported father's life, Memoires pour servir a l'histoire de la Corse, and also an English translation, both published in London in 1768. In 1795 he published an enlarged edition, A Description of Corsica, with an account of its union to the crown of Great Britain. See also Fitzgerald, King Theodore of Corsica (London, 1890). Epitaph Neuhoff's gravestone Neuhoff was buried in the graveyard of St Anne's Church, Soho in central London. His epitaph was written by Horace Walpole, and can be seen on his gravestone: :The grave, great teacher, to a level brings :Heroes and beggars, galley slaves and kings. :But Theodore this moral learn'd ere dead: :Fate poured its lessons on his living head, :Bestow'd a kingdom, and denied him bread.The Strand District - The Fascination of London - by Sir Walter Besant & Geraldine Edith Mitton Notes *  Bibliography  *Bent, J.

It originally aired on ABC on 18 February 1966. The episode was directed by James Hill (known for A Study in Terror and Born Free) and written by Brian Clemens. The episode is widely known for Diana Rigg's risqué \\"Queen of Sin\\" costume (which she designed herself), and was the most watched episode of The Avengers on its original showing. There is a publicity still of the \\"Queen of Sin\\" holding James Hill, the episode's director, on a leash.  Plot  The story is episodic, beginning with a series of pranks on fictional important international figures, an exploding cigar and a collapsing floor under a potentate's box seat in an auditorium. Mrs Peel investigates the Honorable John Cleverly Cartney, a suave, womanizing gentleman who appears to be present before, during or after these events. Lord Darcy arrives and informs Cartney that he has arranged another prank. Meanwhile, Steed sneaks into Lord Darcy's place and, after knocking out Darcy's male housekeeper, finds a pair of fake scissors made of rubber. But real scissors are used by an unnamed, faceless official opening the \\"International Friendship Club\\" on an electrified ribbon, killing him, and Steed and Mrs Peel can't arrive in time. Lord Darcy did not expect to be involved in murder, and is distraught. Steed gets him drunk and, under guise of knowing him from a party, finds out the truth. Through Darcy, Steed is introduced to the Hellfire Club, responsible for the pranks. Mrs Peel goes to visit Cartney and discovers he is leading the Hellfire Club, an organization based upon dressing up in old costumes and engaging in orgiastic rituals and which thrives in \\"ultimate sins\\" with the purpose to replicate the historic club as closely as possible. Cartney is fascinated by Mrs Peel and tries multiple times to pursue an intimacy. She refuses this but continues to keep in contact with him. During one of the club's parties, Darcy arrives and angrily demands a special meeting with the Assembly of Superiors on the \\"Circle of Justice\\" asking why they plotted a \\"filthy rotten murder\\" and implicated him. The centre of the circle opens as a trapdoor and Darcy is killed. On Mrs Peel's recommendation to Cartney, Steed stands to join the Hellfire Club and is given two membership tests including drinking an industrial amount of alcohol (which Steed does easily), and removing a pea from the line of an axe wielding member. Rather than trying to take the pea away, like another member who lost two fingers because of it, Steed simply blows the pea off the table as the axe is descending. Steed is welcomed by the group. As he is leaving, Steed overhears the gang and learns that they plan to stage an outrageous coup which will have the \\"whole country up in arms\\". Steed and Mrs Peel attend an orgy and investigate, spotting a cache of explosives. Steed questions a drunk girl and is told the gang are aiming to blow up Culverston House where a major international meeting is to take place that night. After being led away by some \\"ladies in waiting\\" at Cartney's request, Mrs Peel re-enters in a \\"Queen of Sin\\" outfit, holding a snake, and Cartney says to the group \\"she's yours to do with what you will\\". The members carry Mrs Peel on their shoulders, throwing rose petals on her as Steed watches with anxiety. As the assembled revelers watch a fight, Darcy's housekeeper recognizes Steed and exposes him to the organization as a spy. He wins the ensuing sword duel against the club expert (the man who lost two fingers). Mrs Peel goes underground and defeats the two members laying out the explosives before being attacked with a whip by Cartney, who drops to his death through the circle trapdoor when his whip catches on the hidden switch. The final scene shows Steed and Mrs Peel decrying the newfangled \\"horseless carriage\\" which passes them as they saunter down the road atop a stagecoach being pulled by a team of horses.

The episode was directed by James Hill. Reception and influence The episode is best known for the scene in which Peel dons a revealing, kinky \\"Queen of Sin\\" costume (which Diana Rigg designed herself), complete with a dog collar with three-inch spikes, whalebone corset, and high leather boots, with a large snake. It is the Hellfire club members who dress her this way; she appears for less than ten minutes of show time in this manner, always demure, though ending with Cartney attacking her with a whip. As a result of this and other elements, the episode was not broadcast when The Avengers aired on American network television; it did air on British television, but with the whipping scene edited down to one crack of the whip, due to objections made by Associated-Rediffusion Television. James Chapman said of the episode, \\"With its visual references to sado-masochistic pornography, 'A Touch of Brimstone' unsurprisingly ran into censorship difficulties with the ITV network; it was not screened in America at all.\\" The episode has been cited as one of Diana Rigg's finest. The members of the Hellfire Club have been described as engaging in \\"uninhibited debauchery\\". This episode was Chris Claremont's inspiration for the Hellfire Club in Marvel Comics' \\"X-Men\\", and in particular the story arc in Uncanny X-Men #132-134. Hellfire Club member Jason Wyngarde's name and likeness is based on Peter Wyngarde (who was later known for the role of Jason King). This episode inspired the band The Electric Hellfire Club's namesake; in addition, the episode is heavily Sampled and used as audio cues/samples in several of EHC's songs, such as: Evil Genius (Queen of Sin) and HellFire!

In Sunni Islam, mostly known for being of the Ten Promised Paradise. Best known for his roles in the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Camel, in which he died, according to Sunnis he was given the title \\"The Generous\\" by Muhammad.سير أعلام النبلاء، لشمس الدين الذهبي، ترجمة طلحة بن عبيد الله، الجزء الأول، صـ 24: 40 Early life Talhah was born c.594,Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013. The Companions of Badr. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. the son of Ubaydallah ibn Uthman of the Taym clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. His mother, al-Saaba bint Abdullah, was from the Hadram tribe. He is described as a dark-skinned man with a lot of wavy hair, a handsome face and a narrow nose. He liked to wear saffron-dyed clothes and musk. He walked swiftly and, when nervous, he would toy with his ring, which was of gold and set with a ruby. Talhah was a successful cloth-merchant who eventually left an estate estimated at 30 million dirhams. Conversion to Islam In 612 his kinsman Abu Bakr took him to visit Muhammad, and Talhah became a Muslim. He was said to have been one of the first eight converts.Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press. During the persecution of the Muslims in 614-616, Nawfal ibn Khuwaylid tied Talhah to Abu Bakr and left them roped together. Nobody from the Taym clan came to help. Thereafter they were known as \\"the Two Tied Together\\". Emigration to Medina In September 622 Talhah was bringing a caravan home from Syria when he met Muhammad and Abu Bakr at al-Kharrar. They had escaped from Mecca and were emigrating to Medina. Talhah gave them some Syrian garments and mentioned that the Muslim community in Medina had said that their Prophet was slow to arrive. As Muhammad and Abu Bakr continued to Medina, Talhah returned to Mecca to put his affairs in order. Soon afterwards, he accompanied Abu Bakr's family to Medina, where he settled. At first he lodged with As'ad ibn Zurarah, but later Muhammad gave him a block of land on which he built his own house. He was made the brother in Islam of Sa'id ibn Zayd. Talhah and Sa'id missed fighting at the Battle of Badr because Muhammad sent them as scouts to locate Abu Sufyan's caravan. However, both were awarded shares of the plunder, as if they had been present. Talhah distinguished himself at the Battle of Uhud by keeping close to Muhammad while most of the Muslim army fled. He protected Muhammad's face from an arrow by taking the shot in his own hand, as a result of which two of his fingers were paralysed. He was also hit twice in the head, and it was said that he suffered a total of 75 wounds in the battle. Talhah also fought at the Battle of the Trench \\"and all the battles with Allah's Messenger\\". Ridda Wars In the third week of July 632, Medina faced an imminent invasion by the apostate forces of Tulayha, a self-proclaimed prophet. Abu Bakr scraped together an army mainly from the Hashim clan (Muhammad's), appointing Talhah, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Zubayr ibn al-Awam as Commanders of one-third of the newly organised force each. However, they did not face any combat scenaria during the Ridda Wars. Family Talhah had at least fifteen children by at least eight different women.Muhammad ibn Saad.

During the battle, Marwan ibn al-Hakam, who was fighting on the same side as Aisha, shot Talhah in the thigh. Marwan commented, \\"After this I will never again seek a killer of Uthman.\\" Talhah hugged his horse and galloped off the battle-field. He lay down using a stone as a pillow, while the auxiliaries tried to staunch the blood-flow. Whenever they stopped pressing, the bleeding resumed. In the end Talhah said, \\"Stop it.

Summary Two criminal plots develop side-by-side: 1) theft of the indestructible Marr-Car, and of Phineas Jackson's process for steel-hardening; 2) ongoing sabotage and blackmail at the Marr plant. An auto manufacturer, Ormsdale, wants control of the process, steals the super car and pursues Jackson. Marr is being harassed by Cole Wilson, adoptive son of Jackson, to get millions for Jackson for his process (Jackson doesn't actually want more money). Wilson, an idealist who always fights for underdogs, is Benson-like: strong, intelligent, fast, handsome, resourceful. While in face-molded disguise at the Marr plant, Benson is attacked, trapped and nearly (accidentally?) killed in the metal-hardening chamber; the radiation restores his face, skin, hair. Wilson, in Benson's usual role, has anticipated the criminals, saves the Justice Inc. team from a fiery death, traps the escaping criminals inside the Marr-Car.

The band was composed of Christopher Possanza (vocals, guitar), Josh Rosenfeld (bass guitar), Jason Avinger (guitar, vocals) and Barrett Wilke (drums). Known for their unconventional song structures, and eclectic instrumentation (including the use of a clarinet in many tracks), the band released three full-length albums, Like Icicles, The Curious Sofa and Fireworks, and released many EPs. This Busy Monster are also notable for forming the record label Barsuk Records, named after Avinger and Possanza's dog, which can be heard barking in the track \\"Song 69\\". Initially created in 1994 to release the band's material during their success in the early 1990s, Barsuk Records later became a very successful label in its own right, signing and releasing material from numerous local and internationally-known artists. History This Busy Monster formed in 1992, taking their name from a poem written by E. E. Cummings, releasing their first tape, Ginger, in early 1992, before they had officially formed the band. With the release of Dark Hands in April 1993, the group was officially formed and began playing local shows. They performed numerous shows at local Seattle venues, playing with other local bands such as Sick and Wrong and The Thingmakers, and opening for the indie band Treepeople. In 1994, the band released two singles, \\"Belated\\" in April with the help of Egg Studios and members of the band Posies, and \\"Swing Dream\\" was released in September. The band continued playing small venues with other local acts, often with members of the yet-to-be-formed Death Cab for Cutie. In 1994, they also created the band's record label Barsuk Records. In 1995, the band went on a small tour with Built to Spill around the Pacific Northwest. In summer and fall, they finally gained notice from various music publications and touring with Modest Mouse. The Rocket (a Northwest music- related newspaper), the Seattle Weekly and the University of Washington Daily all printed good reviews, the UW Daily saying: \\"This four-piece blends the conventions of 'interesting' music, replete with complex structures and difficult-sounding parts, with the undeniable pop-rock sensibility. Thus, they manage to sidestep the ghettoes of prog for something altogether catchier and more satisfying but never let matters become precious or cute. They have an undeniable power when playing live that turns on tightness and the tack-sharp, vaguely dissociative lyrics and vocal lines.\\" In 1996 and 1997, the band continued touring with Built To Spill and Death Cab for Cutie, with the latter signing to the band's Barsuk Records label. The band began recording its first full-length album, Like Icicles, released in June 1998 on Barsuk Records. The band released two further albums, The Curious Sofa and Fireworks, in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The current status of the band is not known, as they have been largely inactive as a group since 2001.

It is available for Windows, and Linux. The latest version of PIL is 1.1.7, was released in September 2009 and supports Python 1.5.2–2.7, with Python 3 support to be released \\"later\\". Development appears to be discontinued, with the last commit to the PIL repository coming in 2011. Consequently, a successor project called Pillow has forked the PIL repository and added Python 3.x support. This fork has been adopted as a replacement for the original PIL in Linux distributions including Debian and Ubuntu (since 13.04). Capabilities Pillow offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include: * per-pixel manipulations, * masking and transparency handling, * image filtering, such as blurring, contouring, smoothing, or edge finding, * image enhancing, such as sharpening, adjusting brightness, contrast or color, * adding text to images and much more.

It is commonly referred to as reading into the text.. It is often done to \\"prove\\" a pre-held point of concern, and to provide confirmation bias corresponding with the pre-held interpretation and any agendas supported by it. Eisegesis is best understood when contrasted with exegesis. Exegesis is drawing out text's meaning in accordance with the author's context and discoverable meaning. Eisegesis is when a reader imposes their interpretation of the text. Thus exegesis tends to be objective; and eisegesis, highly subjective. The plural of eisegesis is eisegeses (). Someone who practices eisegesis is known as an eisegete (); this is also the verb form. \\"Eisegete\\" is often used in a mildly derogatory way. Although the terms eisegesis and exegesis are commonly heard in association with Biblical interpretation, both (especially exegesis) are broadly used across literary disciplines. In Biblical study While exegesis is an attempt to determine the historical context within which a particular verse exists—the so-called \\"Sitz im Leben\\" or life setting—eisegetes often neglect this aspect of Biblical study.Beville, K. A., Preaching Christ in a Postmodern Culture (Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2010), p. 88. In the field of Biblical exegesis, scholars take great care to avoid eisegesis. In this field, eisegesis is regarded as \\"poor exegesis\\". In the field of biblical proof texts, Christian theologians and missionaries are often accused of practicing eisegesis using isolated, out-of-context quotations from the Christian Bible to establish a proposition or to read Christ into the Hebrew Bible. While some denominations and scholars denounce Biblical eisegesis, many Christians are known to employ it—albeit inadvertently—as part of their own experiential theology. Modern evangelical scholars accuse liberal Protestants of practicing Biblical eisegesis, while mainline scholars accuse fundamentalists of practicing eisegesis. Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians say that all Protestants engage in eisegesis, because the Bible can be correctly understood only through the lens of Holy Tradition as handed down by the institutional Church; this is articulated in the Dei verbum. Protestants and fundamentalist Christians likewise often accuse Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians of eisegesis for viewing Scripture through Holy Tradition, and may accuse Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians of fabricating or distorting tradition to support their view, which they see as opposed to the doctrine of Sola scriptura where the text is believed to be able to speak for itself without Holy Tradition. Jews, in turn, might assert that Christians practice eisegesis when they read the Old Testament as anticipating Jesus of Nazareth.Kaiser, W. C., Jr., The Majesty of God in the Old Testament: A Guide for Preaching and Teaching (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2007), pp. 16–17.Roth, M. \\"Isaiah 53: The Suffering Servant—Cutting Through the Distortions and Mistranslations of this Enigmatic Text\\", Aish, May 21, 2011. Exactly what constitutes Biblical eisegesis remains a source of debate among theologians, but most scholars agree about the importance of determining the authorial intentions. Determining the author's intent can often be difficult, especially for books which were written anonymously. = In Bible translation = In conducting Bible translation, translators have to make many exegetical decisions. Sometimes the decisions made by translators are criticized by those who disagree, and who characterize the work of the translators as involving \\"eisegesis\\". Some translators make their doctrinal distinctives clear in a preface, such as Stephen Reynolds in his Purified Translation of the Bible, where he explained his belief that Christians should never drink alcohol, and translated accordingly. Such translators may be accused by some of eisegesis, but they have made their positions clear.

It is supposed to be able both to fly and to travel under water. Starting from the surface of water is also intended. Since the requirements for designing a submarine are practically opposed to those of an airplane, the performance expected from such a construction is usually rather moderate. History = Soviet Union = The Soviet Union started building a naval fleet in the mid 20th century, including battleships, aircraft carriers and other ships. Encouraged by this, the leadership became more open to respective proposals. The Soviet Union tried to develop a flying submarine during World War II, whose production never exceeded design phase. At the Naval Engineering Institute, a flying submarine project was headed by engineer Boris Ushakov. During his studies at the Dzerzhinsky naval engineers' academy in Saint Petersburg, which he finished in 1937, Boris Ushakov presented a draft for a project, which could unite the capabilities of an aircraft with those of a submarine. To be precise, this draft showed a seaplane able to dive. In the following years, the project was revised and presented in multiple variations, enabling him to test the capacity and durability of particular components. In April 1936 the reviewer determined that Ushakov's was interesting and to be implemented. In July 1936 the draft project “Flying submarine” was checked and evaluated positively by the scientific research committee of the forces. The committee recommended to continue the project, to test its realisability using calculations and lab tests. In 1937 the project was included into plan “W” (russ. “В”) of the committee. However, the project was cancelled after a reevaluation. Ushakov, by the time a “military technician 1st class” in department “W” of the committee continued the project in his spare time. In 1938 the draft and the fundamental tactical-technical elements of Ushakov's flying submarine were evaluated once more by the 2nd department of the committee. The design was supposed to be built as an all-metal construction and operate at 100 knots in the air and 3 knots under water. The engines were supposed to be sealed shut by metal plates while under water. The flying submarine was supposed to house six hermetically sealed chambers in its hull and wings: Three chambers to hermetically seal the three aircraft engines (AM-34; 1000 HP; while starting 1200 HP, using the turbo compressor), as well as the hermetically sealed pilot's chamber, a chamber for the accumulator and another one for the electric engine. All the other empty spaces of the aircraft were supposed to be filled with water while submerging. The time for preparation and actual submerging were projected at 1.5 minutes. The hull was to be constructed as a riveted duralumin cylinder, measuring 1.4 m across and 6 mm thick. The cockpit was supposed to be flooded while submerging, after the flying instruments were lowered into a waterproof shaft. The crew was supposed to enter the aft command centre and control the submarine from there. The outer skin of the wings and the empennage was to be made of steel, the floats of duralumin. These parts were supposed to be filled with water while submerging, so they did not have to be designed for the water pressure in diving depth. The water was supposed to enter by itself through opened valves. The containers for fuel and lubricant were to be placed in rubber reservoirs in the flying submarine's hull. As a corrosion prevention, the flying submarine was supposed to be treated with special paints and varnishes. Two special mounts for 18 inch torpedoes were supposed to be placed under the hull. The payload was supposed to be 44.5% of the take-off mass. This is a typical value for heavy aircraft of the time. For surfacing, the excess water was supposed to be pumped out of the empty spaces. The electric engine was designed as an underwater drive. The flying submarine was supposed to be used on the open sea for torpedo attacks on opposing ships. It was supposed to track these ships and await their arrival at the projected course while submerged. In case the opposing ship would not pass closely enough, another trial was supposed to be possible. Therefore the flying aircraft would have had to surface after the opposing ship was out of sight, track them again and await them again at the correct position. Another projected use was entering naval areas and naval bases, which were blocked by mine belts. The flying submarine was supposed to pass the mines while in the air and then land inside an opposing restricted area, bay or naval base at night, submerge and act as a submarine. During the day, it would then have been able to gather intelligence on opposing forces, determine navigable water, or use an opportunity to attack. Especially the combined use of multiple flying submarines offered great opportunities. In theory, three flying submarines would have been able to form a 15 km long cordon sanitaire, able to block the projected way of opposing ships. The project was expected to counter a disadvantage of submarines, their bad manoeuvrability. Expectations were especially high for the ability to repeat attack manoeuvres using a short flight to a different attack location, if opposing ships would not pass closely enough. This was seen as one of the flying submarine's main advantages. In 1939 the project was temporarily suspended and classified. In 1943, on the orders of NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria, the project was resumed. In 1947 the first test of the flying submarine was performed. In 1953, the project was closed by order of Communist Party First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. The design never \\"got off the ground\\".Russian Flying Submarine Unknown, Date Unknown (accessed 21 January 2007) =United Kingdom= As early as 1920, the British trade journal, ″Flying,″ reported conversations between the First Sea Lord and other military leaders and one of the principal aircraft manufacturers concerning a flying submarine (or submersible seaplane). The all-metal craft, its hypothetical design illustrated in the article, was to be a twin-propeller airplane with retractable wings and a hermetically sealed fuselage. There was, however, apparently no further development of the project. = U.S. = In 1961 Donald Reid designed and built a single-seat craft (32.83 ft length) capable of flight and underwater movement, the Reid Flying Submarine 1 (RFS-1Bernhard C.

A 65 hp (48 kW) engine mounted on a pylon provided propulsion for flight; a 1 hp electric motor in the tail provided underwater propulsion. The pilot used an aqualung for breathing underwater.

G. Wodehouse. It was first published in the United Kingdom on April 30, 1929 by Herbert Jenkins, and in the United States on February 21, 1930 by Doubleday, Doran.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 55–56, A40. The stories were originally published in magazines in the UK and the US between 1924 and 1929. All stories are narrated by the inexorable raconteur Mr Mulliner, a fisherman who tells stories at the Angler's Rest about members of his prodigious family, including one who is also a member of the Drones Club. The last three of the stories are about Bobbie Wickham; they were revised and given a Mr Mulliner frame for the book. Contents =\\"The Reverent Wooing of Archibald\\"= * UK: Strand, August 1928 * US: Cosmopolitan, September 1928 The story features Mr Mulliner's nephew Archibald Mulliner, the sock collector who can mimic a hen laying an egg, and his love Aurelia Cammarleigh. They also appear in \\"Archibald and the Masses\\" and \\"The Code of the Mulliners\\", both collected in Young Men in Spats (1936). ;Plot At the Angler's Rest, the subject of the \\"Modern Girl\\" comes up, and four drinkers believe that girls are smaller than before. They agree that it is impossible to understand why. Mr Mulliner interrupts to disagree with his companions, claiming that the disappearance of the \\"dignified, queenly type of girl\\" occurred because young men do not have the nerve to propose to them and their disappearance was Nature's method of ensuring the continuation of humanity. He had become convinced that this was the case upon observing the behavior of his nephew Archibald when he was in love with Aurelia Cammarleigh. Archibald first saw Miss Cammarleigh from out the window of the Drones Club and, though he immediately fell in love, he was careful to mask his feelings when enquiring of a fellow Drone, Algy Wymondham- Wymondham, whether he knew her. Algy does, and informs Archibald of her name as well as her family circumstances: she lives in Park Street with a \\"potty\\" aunt, who believes that Francis Bacon wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. Archibald departs to buy socks and contemplate whether Aurelia would be attracted to him. He thinks she seems very dignified and sophisticated, and concludes that his primary talent, a masterful impression of a hen laying an egg, is insufficient; indeed, he becomes convinced that she would be put off by such a vulgar display. Consequently, when he first meets her at Ascot several weeks thereafter, he denies vehemently the ability to do the impression when she mentions that she heard that he could do the imitation. He reads about Shakespeare and Bacon for two weeks in order to impress Aurelia's aunt with his knowledge of them. This results in the aunt inviting Archibald to her country house. He goes to the house, tries to impress Aurelia and her aunt by not smoking or drinking, and endures abstruse conversation with Aurelia's aunt, but is too nervous to speak to Aurelia. At night, Archibald eavesdrops on Aurelia and her friend Muriel. Aurelia tells her friend that she is disappointed that what Algy told her about Archibald's ability to imitate a hen laying an egg is not true, and thinks Archibald is too uptight. He also hears that Aurelia plans to play a prank on him by sending her bulldog into his room through the window. When Archibald hears her outside his window, he starts to give his imitation of a hen laying an egg. Aurelia is awestruck by his performance. She now sees that he is not uptight like she thought and they embrace. Archibald admits that he does smoke and drink, and that he actually dislikes Aurelia's aunt, which pleases Aurelia. =\\"The Man Who Gave Up Smoking\\"= * UK: Strand, March 1929 * US: Liberty, 23 March 1929 ;Plot An argument in the Angler's Rest about giving up smoking leads to Mr Mulliner telling the following story about his nephew Ignatius Mulliner, a portrait-painter. Ignatius loves Hermione Rossiter and has proposed to her multiple times, but she has always turned him down. Hoping to find out why she has rejected him, Ignatius asks her brother Cyprian. Cyprian, a haughty art critic, claims that Hermione told him she did not like Ignatius because he was too similar to her other brother George, who does no work and lives on borrowed money. George, on the other hand, says that Hermione told him that Ignatius was too much like Cyprian. The only thing the brothers have in common is that they are heavy smokers, like Ignatius, so he believes that Hermione dislikes his smoking. He decides to give up smoking to win her over. Ignatius initially tries to cope with the loss of smoking by devoting himself to selfless acts. He invites Cypress to come to his flat to freely criticise his painting, and also invites George in order to give him a loan. Furthermore, he tells Hermione's mother, Mrs Rossiter, that he will paint Hermione's portrait for free. However, Ignatius is very irritable the next day. He threatens Cyprian with an ornamental dagger, kicks George, and insults Hermione's appearance. Afterward, Ignatius smokes his pipe. He becomes amiable again and regrets his words to Hermione. However, she is glad that he insulted her appearance, because she thought he had proposed to her for her looks alone and not for her intelligence, and she wants to be loved for her intelligence. They share an embrace. She explains that she compared Ignatius to her brothers because he plays the ukulele like George and wears sloppy clothes like Cyprian. Ignatius happily gives his ukulele away and goes with Hermione to a new tailor. =\\"The Story of Cedric\\"= * UK: Strand, May 1929 * US: Liberty, 11 May 1929 ;Plot Miss Postlethwaite, the popular barmaid at the Angler's Rest, has severed her engagement to Alfred Lukyn because he wanted to wear yellow shoes to church despite her objection. Mr Mullier remarks that, while a pair of yellow shoes parted Miss Postlethwaite from her fiancé, a similar pair of shoes brought Mulliner's cousin Cedric a bride. Fastidious 45-year-old bachelor Cedric Mulliner lives at the Albany, and has an efficient secretary, Myrtle Watling. At a luncheon in Grosvenor Square, he sees a friend, Lady Chloe Downblotton. After the luncheon, they run into Lady Chloe's fiancé Claude. Lady Chloe is alarmed that Claude is wearing yellow shoes with otherwise correct morning-clothes. She asks Cedric Mulliner to trade shoes with Claude. Cedric is very fashion-conscious and reluctant to do so, but he agrees because Lady Chloe is the well-connected daughter of an earl and Cedric admires the aristocracy. After trading shoes, he immediately gets a cab to return to the Albany. However, he is unwilling to walk into the prestigious building with the wrong kind of shoes. He tells the cab-driver, Mr Lanchester, to go to the suburb Valley Fields, where Cedric's secretary lives, to get her help. At the house, Cedric tells the cab-driver to wait, but decides he cannot face Miss Watling in morning-clothes and yellow shoes. He hears someone snoring, and looks through a window to see a man fast asleep in an armchair with black boots beside him. Cedric quietly sneaks through the window and tries to grab the boots. The man wakes up and Cedric only manages to exchange one of his yellow shoes for a black one, and drops his top hat too. Discouraged by the loss of his hat, Cedric gives up and decides to exit the house out the back, but he gets stuck in the sash window, with his head outside the house. Cedric blames Lady Chloe for his situation and now hates the aristocracy. Outside, Miss Watling sees Cedric, and he tells her his story. She states that Cedric needs someone to look after him. She does not mind taking on the job and will marry him. The man who had slept in the chair appears along with Mr Lanchester, and Myrtle tells the former, who is her father, that Cedric is her fiancé. Cedric had never thought of marrying, but he agrees anyway, since Myrtle would at least help keep him from predicaments like this and is not part of the aristocracy. =\\"The Ordeal of Osbert Mulliner\\"= * US: Liberty, 24 November 1928 * UK: Strand, December 1928 ;Plot Mr Mulliner claims that a man who has to overcome obstacles to get married will be less likely to get a divorce, because he will not take his wife for granted. He attributes the happiness of his nephew Osbert's marriage to the difficulties Osbert faced to get married. Mulliner tells the following story. Osbert Mulliner is courting Mabel Petherick-Soames and she seems to return his feelings. One evening, just after Osbert kisses her, Mabel's cousin, intimidating explorer J. Bashford Braddock, appears. He also loves Mabel and privately threatens Osbert to stop spending time with Mabel. Afraid of Braddock, Osbert writes a letter of farewell to Mabel saying that he has been called away to Australia. The next day, Osbert is visited by Major-General Sir Masterman Petherick-Soames, Mabel's uncle. He will not allow Osbert to trifle with his niece's affections and tells him their engagement will shortly be announced. Osbert's valet Parker informs him that Braddock has heard about announcement and will shortly visit Osbert. To avoid Braddock's wrath, Osbert tells Parker that he will leave for India and no longer needs domestic staff. Osbert also disguises himself with a wig and false whiskers. He goes to the second-hand clothing establishment of the Bros Cohen for new clothes. Unfortunately for Osbert, both Braddock and the Major-General are there. Having spent years in India, the Major-General offers to see the disguised Osbert off to his ship. Osbert fears he will be recognized out in the sunlight, so he gives up on his plan to sail. Osbert decides to run away to a suburb, but first he returns to his now unstaffed house at South Audley Street. He hides behind some curtains when he realizes two burglars are there. The burglars, Harold and Ernest, drink Osbert's wine and get into an argument with each other about good manners. They knock each other out. Osbert calls the police. Braddock comes, intending to intimidate Osbert again, but is daunted when Osbert claims he overpowered the burglars. Braddock instead asks if Osbert would like a fish-slice for a wedding present. =\\"Unpleasantness at Bludleigh Court\\"= * UK: Strand, February 1929 * US: Liberty, 2 February 1929 ;Plot A poet staying at the Angler's Rest is made uneasy after a hunter with dead rabbits stops by. Mulliner is reminded of his niece, Charlotte Mulliner. Charlotte has an ample private income and writes \\"Vignettes in Verse\\" for artistic weekly magazines for no charge, merely because she likes to see her works published. At a literary luncheon, she meets Aubrey Bollinger, who writes \\"Pastels in Prose\\" under the name Aubrey Trefusis. Aubrey is compassionate towards animals and does not fit in with the rest of his family, who are enthusiastic about hunting. Charlotte sympathizes with Aubrey. His parents and two brothers live at Bludleigh Court in Bedfordshire, where Charlotte is supposed to visit soon since her mother was a friend of Lady Bassinger. Aubrey warns her that Bludleigh Court exercises a spell and somehow causes its inhabitants to want to hunt. Charlotte is confident she will not be affected. Regardless, Aubrey accompanies her to the house to help defend her from the influence of the house. Charlotte and Aubrey appear to have feelings for each other. Aubrey's gnu-hunting uncle, Colonel Francis Pashley-Drake, annoys Charlotte by talking to her about hunting and insulting Aubrey. Aubrey is about to propose to Charlotte when he suddenly tries to chase a rat with Charlotte's parasol. He then seems to wake from a trance and finishes proposing to Charlotte, but she refuses because he chased the rat. He tells her that the spell of the house overcame him, but she does not believe him. While staying in the house, Charlotte writes a poem for the Animal-Lovers' Gazette, but the editor rejects her poem \\"Good Gnus\\", which is about hunting gnus. Charlotte wonders why they rejected it, since she now thinks hunting is a good pastime. Followed by Aubrey, who is also eager to hunt, she takes a shot at Colonel Pashley-Drake with an air-gun while he is sunbathing and hits him in the leg. Pashley-Drake is unhappy about being at the other end of a hunt and flees into Lady Bassinger's garden party, surprising the guests. He hides behind a bishop. Charlotte and Aubrey come to their senses, and Charlotte believes the house affected both of them. They agree to leave the house immediately and get married. =\\"Those in Peril on the Tee\\"= * US: Liberty, 21 May 1927 * UK: Strand, June 1927 In addition to being a Mulliner story, \\"Those in Peril on the Tee\\" is also one of Wodehouse's golf stories. The story is told by the Oldest Member in the magazine versions. \\"Those in Peril on the Tee\\" was included in the 1973 Wodehouse collection The Golf Omnibus.McIlvaine (1990), p. 122, B14. ;Plot Mr Mulliner speaks to two young men in golfing attire and tells them he used to play golf before taking up the pastime of fishing. Despite their efforts to get out of listening to the story, Mr Mulliner tells them about the only Mulliner to have attained any real proficiency at golf, Agnes Flack, the daughter of a distant cousin of his. Two quiet, timid men, mystery writer John Gooch and cartoonist Frederick Pilcher, often call at Agnes Flack's house. The two men each have a handicap of eighteen. The hearty and athletic Agnes is more skilled and a scratch player (meaning she has a handicap of zero). Sidney McMurdo, a muscular golfer who was once a semi-finalist in the Amateur Championship, loves Agnes, but she merely laughs at him every time he proposes to her. After he proposes to her for the eleventh time, she tells McMurdo she wants to marry someone intellectual. She thinks both Gooch and Pilcher love her. Having been inspired by magazine stories about men playing a match of golf to decide who was to win the heroine, she plans a match of golf between Gooch and Pilcher to determine which one she will marry. Gooch and Pilcher do not actually love Agnes, and only called at her house to draw inspiration from her for their stories and cartoons respectively, but neither are willing to admit this to the intimidating McMurdo. Both Gooch and Pilcher hope to lose and plan to play badly in their match, but not obviously enough to be suspected by McMurdo, who will be the referee. Pilcher shows up wearing a glossy top hat and morning- coat, claiming he has to go into the city immediately after the match, and actually hoping the constrictive clothes will make him play worse. Gooch tries to influence Pilcher subconsciously by repeatedly telling him he will play well. However, their efforts backfire. Gooch only influenced his own subconscious and plays well, while the constrictive clothes help correct Pilcher's tendency to over-swing. Both men play better than usual, and begin to think that marrying Agnes is worth playing such a good game, when Agnes arrives and referees the rest of the match. Not wanting to marry her, Gooch and Pilcher manage to play badly. Pilcher picks up his ball, pretending to brush mud off it, and is disqualified. Gooch is irritated, and regrets he did not think of doing this himself. Fortunately for Gooch, Agnes is unwilling to marry anyone who plays golf as badly as he did and will marry McMurdo. =\\"Something Squishy\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, 20 December 1924 * UK: Strand, January 1925 ;Plot Mr Mulliner returns from visiting his cousin Lady Wickham at her home of Skeldings Hall in Hertfordshire. Lady Wickham is somewhat worried about her daughter, Roberta \\"Bobbie\\" Wickham, since she does not get married. Roberta is mischievous and gets her suitors into trouble. Sipping his usual hot Scotch and lemon, Mulliner tells the story of one of Roberta's suitors, Roland Moresby Attwater. Roland, an essayist and literary critic, attends his uncle's dinner with a mud-stained shirt, and is eager to recount how his shirt became muddy, but everyone is too polite to ask about it. His uncle, city magistrate Sir Joseph Moresby, thinks the quiet and sensible Roland should marry Lucy Moresby, who is also quiet and sensible. His uncle finally mentions the mud, and Roland tells him he got dirty by pulling a man out of the way of a car in Duke Street and saved his life. Roland does not want to marry Lucy because he loves Bobbie Wickham, whom Sir Joseph fined at court for speeding. Roland gave a positive review of one of Lady Wickham's books, though he dislikes it, and is rewarded with an invitation to the Wickham home, Skeldings Hall. At his flat, Roland discovers that the man he saved, who owns a bird-and-snake shop, sent him a box with something squishy inside as a gift. To Roland's surprise, it is a snake. Bobbie thinks Roland should use the snake for mischief, but Roland disagrees and wants the snake returned. At Skeldings, Roland has a rival for Bobbie's affections, the handsome and dignified Sir Claude Lynn. Bobbie tells Roland that she put the snake, which she named Sidney and had Roland's valet pack in his luggage, in Sir Claude's bed for the fun of it. Roland fears that the snake will be traced back to him, so he goes to Sir Claude's room to retrieve it. While he is in the room, he hears Sir Claude enter, and hides in a large cupboard. However, Sir Claude finds him. Thinking him drunk, he removes Roland from the room. Sir Claude then finds the snake, and alerts the household. Lady Wickham's butler, Simmons, is able to confirm that the snake belongs to Roland since the footman Thomas moved Roland's luggage, including the box with the snake. Roland hides in his room from Sir Claude and Lady Wickham. Simmons knocks on Roland's door, and returns the snake to him on a salver. Bobbie suggests that Roland sneak out and take an early train to London. The next day, Roland tells his new fiancée Lucy about how he saved a man's life in Duke Street. =\\"The Awful Gladness of the Mater\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, 21 March 1925 * UK: Strand, May 1925 ;Plot Mr Mulliner continues telling the patrons of the Angler's Rest about the unfortunate suitors of his cousin's daughter, Bobbie Wickham. The following story concerns Dudley Finch, a cousin of Roland Attwater. Dudley's godfather, Mr Sampson Broadhurst, has offered to take him to Australia to teach him sheep-farming. However, Dudley does not want to leave because he loves Bobbie Wickham, despite the disapproval of his cousin Roland. Bobbie says that Dudley can come to Skeldings. She will send her mother a wire, and states that Lady Wickham will be awfully glad to see Dudley. When Dudley first arrives at Skeldings, Lady Wickham mistakenly thinks he is an interviewer from Milady's Boudoir. He clarifies that he is a friend of Bobbie, who evidently forgot to send her mother a wire. Lady Wickham is not pleased that Dudley is there. To make things worse, he is unable to wear proper dinner clothes since he accidentally switched his suitcase with someone at the Drones Club who was going to a fancy dress party with a boyish sailor suit costume. Feeling discouraged, Dudley plans to leave and asks about the train schedule. Simmons informs Lady Wickham that Dudley apparently brought a disguise and inquired about the early morning train, and therefore is probably a burglar. Furthermore, Bobbie has not yet arrived, so Simmons thinks Dudley may be lying about being her friend. Simmons keeps watch with a gun and alerts Lady Wickham when Dudley goes to the dining room, not knowing he is merely looking for food. Dudley pretends he wanted a book to read. While talking about books, he insults the works of George Masterman, not knowing this is the pen name used by Lady Wickham. Embarrassed, Dudley returns to his room, and Simmons continues to keep watch. Finally, Bobbie appears. She got into an accident and is in trouble for ruining her car. She told her mother she did not know Dudley to avoid getting in more trouble. Following her directions, Dudley bribes Simmons with five pounds and sneaks out through the window. Dudley is far from the house when he gets shot in the fleshy part of his leg. The next day, Bobbie apologizes for this. She explains Simmons wasn't trying to hit him and just wanted Lady Wickham to hear a shot. Dudley retorts that he hopes Lady Wickham was pleased and that he is going to Australia. =\\"The Passing of Ambrose\\"= * UK: Strand, July 1928 * US: Cosmopolitan, August 1928 ;Plot Mr Mulliner remarks that few things are more painful than an argument between boyhood friends, and that such a situation occurred between Algy Crufts and Ambrose Wiffin. Algy and Ambrose planned a trip to Monte Carlo together. Although they have bought their tickets, Ambrose wants to put off their trip for a fortnight so he can court Bobbie Wickham. Algy, an old friend of Bobbie's, knows all too well that other fellows who come in contact with Bobbie end up in trouble and warns Ambrose, but Ambrose does not believe him. Algy refuses to wait and will go to Monte Carlo alone if Ambrose will not leave with him in two days. Bobbie Wickham wants to help her friend Jane Falconer choose cushions for her new flat, but her mother insists that she take her young cousin Wilfred and his friend, Esmond Bates (called \\"Old Stinker\\" by Wilfred), to the movies. Bobbie invites Ambrose to join them. The boys are annoying but Ambrose agrees so that he can spend time with Bobbie. They go to the Tivoli to see a lively film entitled Where Passion Lurks, based (obviously very loosely) on the poem \\"We are Seven\\". Bobbie leaves before the film starts, claiming to have just remembered an appointment, leaving Ambrose to look after the two boys. Before the film, Ambrose dropped his hat and it got stepped on, and the boys mock Ambrose for this repeatedly before and after the movie. Irritated, he smacks Wilfred on the head. A passing elderly lady rebukes Ambrose, embarrassing him. Then the boys want to eat oysters, and after the expenses of transportation and the movie, Ambrose regretfully does not have enough money to tip the waiter at the end of the meal. Next, they take an omnibus. While on the bus, Ambrose realizes that Bobbie lied about having an appointment and never intended to see the movie with him. Chaos ensues when a man is frightened by Esmond's white mouse. At this point, Ambrose has had enough and leaves the bus. The next day, he receives a letter from Bobbie, which expresses her disappointment in him for leaving the boys in London. A policeman brought Wilfred home. Ambrose picks up the telephone and tells Algy that he will meet him the next day for their trip to Monte Carlo.

This vehicle is sometimes called the A-40T or KT. Design and development TB-3 bomber carrying a T-27 tankette, 1935 Instead of loading light tanks onto gliders, as other nations had done, Soviet airborne forces had strapped T-27 tankettes underneath heavy bombers and landed them on airfields. In the 1930s there were experimental efforts to parachute tanks or simply drop them into water. During the 1940 occupation of Bessarabia, light tanks may have been dropped from a few meters up by TB-3 bombers, which, as long as the gearbox was in neutral, would allow them to roll to a stop. The biggest problem with air-dropping vehicles is that their crews drop separately, and may be delayed or prevented from bringing them into action. Gliders allow crews to arrive at the drop zone along with their vehicles. They also minimize exposure of the valuable towing aircraft, which need not appear over the battlefield. So the Soviet Air Force ordered Oleg Antonov to design a glider for landing tanks. Antonov was more ambitious. Instead of building a glider, he added a detachable cradle to a T-60 light tank bearing large wood and fabric biplane wings and a twin tail. Such a tank could glide into the battlefield, drop its wings, and be ready to fight within minutes. One T-60 was converted into a glider in 1942, intended to be towed by a Petlyakov Pe-8 or a Tupolev TB-3. The tank was lightened for air use by removing its armament, ammunition and headlights, and leaving a very limited amount of fuel. Even with these modifications, the TB-3 bomber had to ditch the glider during its only flight, on September 2, 1942, to avoid crashing, due to the T-60's extreme drag (although the tank reportedly glided smoothly). The A-40 was piloted by the famous Soviet experimental glider pilot Sergei Anokhin. The T-60 landed in a field near the airport, and after dropping the glider wings and tail, the driver returned it to its base. Due to the lack of a sufficiently-powerful aircraft to tow it at the required , the project was abandoned. The Soviet Union continued to develop methods to efficiently deploy airborne vehicles. By the mid-1970s they were able to para-drop BMD-1 fighting vehicles with their crew aboard.

Labor Day, 2007. Benny is a pejorative term used by year-round residents of the Jersey Shore to describe stereotypically rude, flashy, loud tourists from North Jersey and New York. Origin The origin of the term is disputed. One common theory says the term originates from an acronym that was stamped on the beachgoers' train tickets, representing the city in which they boarded the train to the Jersey Shore: Bayonne, Elizabeth, Newark, and New York City. The term \\"Benny\\" may also originate from the early 20th century practice of wealthy New Yorkers taking trips to the Jersey Shore as treatment for myriad maladies such as anemia, hemophilia, and hysteria. These therapeutic trips were called \\"beneficials\\" by doctors and patients. Often, visitors would claim to be at the Jersey Shore on a \\"beneficial\\", hence the term Benny. Another theory is that \\"Benny\\" was used to identify New Yorkers who came down the shore flashing wads of $100 bills. \\"Benny\\" refers to Ben Franklin, whose picture is on the $100 bill. Still another theory refers to off-shore boat racing during the 1970's sponsored by the restaurant chain \\"Benihana's\\". The term 'Shoobie' is used by residents of resort communities in the southern New Jersey Shore, from Long Beach Island to Cape May. The term shoobie was originally used to describe day-trippers who took the train to the shore. The train offered pre- packed lunches that came in shoe boxes; hence the term \\"shoobie.\\" However, over time the meaning has changed to include tourists who wear sneakers or shoes on the beach, as opposed to most locals who go barefoot on the sand.

History In 1902, the Amateur Fencing Association (AFA) was founded as the governing body for amateur fencing in the UK. The requirements for amateurism have now been dissolved, and professionalism is permitted in the UK, so in 1996 the name was changed to the British Fencing Association. (A membership body for professional fencing coaches, the British Academy of Fencing, was not founded in its current form until 1949). The AFA's had combined twin roles as both Home Country Governing Body for England and national governing body. In 2002 in response to public funding frameworks, a new, separate body - England Fencing - was formed specifically to carry out the certain governing body activities for England. Over time, the boundary between the two roles has eroded. In recent years, the 'Association' changed its legal status, and the organisation became British Fencing. In January 2011 British Fencing announced a five-year sponsorship deal worth £1 million with Beazley Group, the specialist Lloyd’s insurer. Beazley was the principal sponsor – as well as the official insurer – of British Fencing until the end of 2015. In 2016 a second major sponsor was announced, and Wilkinson Sword became British Fencing's new principal sponsor. Activities of British Fencing BF is responsible for all international fencing conducted while representing Great Britain. They control the selection criteria for all relevant competitions. They are responsible for any attendance by fencers at official FIE competitions, including the World Championships and World Cup competitions, and also at the Olympics under the IOC. BF is also responsible for all national domestic events. It runs British Championships in a variety of age categories and at all three weapons of fencing (foil, épée and sabre). BF licenses member clubs and competition organisers to run fencing competitions some of which earn participants ranking points. These points are used by the BFA to create national rankings at senior, junior (U20) and cadet (U17) level. BF is responsible for ensuring that the sport has a robust governance structure, appropriately insured, and that those operating within the sport are appropriately qualified. BF sets out the Safety Standards, rules and guidelines under which the sport operates. BF also runs coaching schemes, and other activities relating to the promotion of fencing in the UK. BF run a Talent programme (funded by Sport England) to support young fencers (14-23) demonstrating motivation and capability to represent GBR. BF publishes a magazine, The Sword. British Fencing currently receives funding from Sport England and UK Sport (international relations funding). BF collects membership fees on behalf of all the Home Country Associations - 40% of membership fees collected is passed to these associations. Sponsorship In December 2015, a five-year sponsorship deal worth £1million with Beazley Group, the specialist Lloyd’s insurer came to an end. During that time the investment from Beazley helped fund Great Britain teams (including Paralympic hopefuls), The National Academy, programs for increased grassroots participation to the sport, British Fencing run events, including World Cup events as well as marketing and promotion of the sport. BF is currently sponsored by Wilkinson Sword. World Class Performance Programme Until March 2017 BF operated a World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) which was a programme, funded by UK Sport, which helped British Fencing to fund those athletes who are likely to achieve podium success at the Olympic Games. Under this programme, the Men's Foil Team qualified for Rio 2016 which was the first time that a Fencing team had qualified under the system introduced by the FIE 20 years ago. The team achieved 6th - narrowly losing to Russia, the eventual winners - and Richard Kruse came 4th in the individual event - the best Olympic results in decades. In December 2016, UK Sport announced that they had withdrawn funding from fencing. In the funding review, Fencing was banded by UK Sport as Band 4. This means that Fencing was considered a 'possible' not 'probable' medal winning sport for Tokyo 2020. Along with all the other sports in Band 4, Fencing lost its WCP funding. Rankings Fencers are ranked by category (Cadet, Junior and Senior), weapon (foil, épée or sabre) and gender. Rankings are calculated from ranking points earned in competitions attended by the fencers. The number of points earned depends on the strength of the competition as well as how well the fencer did. Current rankings can be found on the British Fencing Website. Governance The Board of British Fencing (BF) is responsible for the overall governance, development and management of the sport of fencing in GB. The Board sets the strategic direction of the sport, appoints the CEO and monitors progress and results. The Board consists of twelve Board Directors, of whom eight are elected and four appointed by the Board (these four being the Chair of the Board and of British Fencing, an Additional Director and two Independent Directors). The Board’s quorum rules specify that the elected members must always be in the majority. In addition to these voting directors, Board meetings are attended by the BF President and Home Country and athlete representatives. Staff members attend some meetings, or parts of meetings, to brief/advise the Board. Subdivisions Under its auspices the six Home Nations (Wales, England, Northern Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey and Scotland) have their own governing bodies. The country is further subdivided into 'regions'. =Home Nations Governing Bodies= * Welsh Fencing * England Fencing * Northern Ireland Fencing *Guernsey Union d'Escrime * Scottish Fencing =Regions= * East Midlands * Eastern * Guernsey * Jersey * London * North East * North West * Northern Ireland * Scotland Central * Scotland East * Scotland North * Scotland West * South East * South West * Southern * Wales * West Midlands * Yorkshire Administration The British Fencing office is based at 1 Baron's Gate, 33-35 Rothschild Road, London W4 5HT.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Woodbridge north to the Chain Bridge across the Potomac River into Washington from Arlington. It goes by three local names. From its southern terminus to the Occoquan River Bridge, it is known as Gordon Boulevard. From the Occoquan River Bridge to the city of Fairfax it is known as Ox Road. From Fairfax to its intersection with I-495 in Tysons Corner it is known as Chain Bridge Road. East of Tysons, it is known as Dolley Madison Boulevard. SR 123 is a partial circumferential highway in Northern Virginia that connects Woodbridge in eastern Prince William County with the independent city of Fairfax and the Fairfax County communities of Vienna, Tysons Corner, and McLean, the last being the home of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Central Intelligence Agency. The state highway also connects all of the major highways that radiate from Washington, including Interstate 95, I-66, US 29, US 50, SR 267, and the George Washington Memorial Parkway. Furthermore, SR 123 crosses another pair of circumferential highways, I-495 and the Fairfax County Parkway, and SR 7, a major northwest- southeast highway through Northern Virginia. The state highway is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length. Route description SR 123 begins at an intersection with US 1 (Jefferson Davis Highway) between the Woodbridge Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express station and US 1's bridge over the Occoquan River in Woodbridge. The state highway heads north as Gordon Boulevard, a four- to six-lane divided highway. SR 123 meets I-95 at a partial cloverleaf interchange that contains a reversible ramp to and from the Interstate's HOV lanes in the direction of Washington. There is no access from southbound I-95 to southbound SR 123; that movement is provided indirectly via I-95's interchange with US 1 across the river in Fairfax County. The Route 123 and I-95 Commuter Lot, a park and ride facility, is located within the southeast quadrant of this interchange. Past the interchange, the route heads east of the Occoquan Commuter Lot park and ride. The state highway passes through the eastern edge of the town of Occoquan and crosses the Occoquan River on a six-lane bridge. Gordon Boulevard / Ox Road crossing of the Occoquan River at the Prince William–Fairfax County border SR 123 continues into Fairfax County as Ox Road, which passes through the western part of Lorton. The state highway passes by the former Lorton Reformatory and reduces to four lanes north of SR 611 (Furnace Road). SR 123 passes northwest along the edge of the suburban communities of Laurel Hill, Crosspointe, and South Run. The state highway serves the park surrounding Burke Lake, then veers north through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 286 (Fairfax County Parkway) to the west of Burke Centre. SR 123 crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Washington District rail line, which also carries the Manassas Line of Virginia Railway Express, at Springfield. North of its intersection with SR 620 (Braddock Road), SR 123 passes along the west side of the campus of George Mason University, which includes the EagleBank Arena. The university's athletic complex, including George Mason Stadium, lies to the west of the state highway south of its intersection with University Drive, which heads east onto the campus as SR 383. North of University Drive, SR 123 enters the city of Fairfax and its name changes to Chain Bridge Road. The highway becomes undivided north of Judicial Drive; the state highway passes the Barbour House, the Historic Fairfax County Courthouse, and the Fairfax County offices and judicial center. North of SR 236 (Main Street), SR 123 reduces to two lanes and passes through an S-curve, then heads through a residential area before expanding to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with US 29 and US 50 (Fairfax Boulevard).alt=SR 123 leaves the city of Fairfax at its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-66; the interchange includes a flyover ramp from westbound I-66 to southbound SR 123. The state highway curves northeast through Oakton, then enters the town of Vienna and becomes four-lane undivided Maple Avenue just south of its intersection with SR 243 (Nutley Street). SR 123 intersects the Washington and Old Dominion Trail adjacent to the Vienna Town Green. The state highway becomes a divided highway named Chain Bridge Road again on leaving the town limits and entering Tysons Corner, at the southwest edge of which SR 123 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 7 (Leesburg Pike). SR 123 expands to six lanes and begins to parallel Washington Metro's Silver Line and intersects SR 684 (International Drive) before passing between a pair of shopping malls: Tysons Galleria to the north and Tysons Corner Center to the south. At the eastern edge of Tysons Corner, SR 123 passes under Westpark Drive has a cloverleaf interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway). The state highway, now named Dolley Madison Boulevard, follows the Silver Line northeast through office parks to a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 267 (Dulles Toll Road), which leads west to the Dulles Access Road (unsigned SR 90004) and Washington Dulles International Airport and east to I-66. There is no access from northbound SR 123 to westbound SR 267; that movement requires using I-495. North of the interchange, in the hamlet of Lewinsville, the state highway reduces to four lanes and intersects SR 694 (Lewinsville Road), which provides access to the National Counterterrorism Center. SR 123 passes through McLean, the center of which is accessed via SR 309 (Old Dominion Drive). View south along SR 123 at SR 193 in McLeanEast of the center of McLean, SR 123 passes by the preserved Salona estate and close to Hickory Hill--a historic house on Chain Bridge Road that was home to Robert F. Kennedy--in Langley, where the state highway meets the eastern end of SR 193 (Old Georgetown Pike). That state highway provides access to the Claude Moore Colonial Farm on the campus of the George Bush Center for Intelligence, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. The agency's southern main entrance is on SR 123. East of its partial cloverleaf interchange with the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the state highway's name becomes Chain Bridge Road and reduces to two lanes as it descends into the valley of the Potomac River. SR 123 passes by the Marden House before entering the northwestern corner of Arlington County and meeting the northern end of SR 120 (Glebe Road). There, SR 123 turns north and crosses the Potomac River into Washington on the three-lane Chain Bridge, which leads to the Clara Barton Parkway into Maryland and Canal Road, which follows the river east to Georgetown. History left left SR 123, along with SR 120, was SR 25 until the 1933 renumbering and SR 9 from then until the 1940 renumbering. Fairfax County made proposals to upgrade the intersection between SR 123 and SR 620 to a full interchange. The designs considered were diamond, modified diamond, single-point urban interchange (SPUI), and tight SPUI.123 / Braddock Rd. Interchange Presentation March 4, 2009 Retrieved November 29, 2009 Ultimately, one left turn lane in each direction of SR 123 was added at the intersection, the left turn lane on eastbound SR 620 was extended, and new traffic signals were installed.https://relations.gmu.edu/Route-123-and-Braddock-Road- Presentation.pdf VDOT has drafted plans to create an interchange between SR 123 and US 1 in Woodbridge. However, due to budget cutbacks, the project has been put on hold.NoVA Phase Cuts - Cancelled and Unfunded Projects p. 1 Retrieved January 13, 2010  Future  = I-66 interchange = Due to work on I-66 in Fairfax County to add express lanes, SR 123 north's entrance to I-66 west has been temporarily changed from a loop ramp entrance to a left- turn entrance. VDOT is also working on reconstructing the interchange once the I-66 express lanes are complete. The existing interchange will be converted to a parclo-interchange for access to the I-66 express lanes, and a diamond interchange for access to the non-tolled I-66 lanes, with left exits and entrances for each direction of non-tolled I-66. The reconstruction is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. = Bridge over SR 7 = VDOT is currently working on improving the SR 123 bridges over SR 7. This would improve concrete-deck repairs, new asphalt overlay and paint jobs, and other repairs. The project is expected to cost $2.2 million and will be completed by end of 2020. VDOT started the project to help the bridge reach its expected lifespan, which is expected to be for 10-15 more years. Fairfax County planners are also researching possible new configurations of the intersection in the future. Options include a quadrant roadway intersection and a continuous flow intersection. Fairfax County DOT has also considered building pedestrian space over the intersection, such as a park, to improve walkability in Tysons Corner.

It is sometimes referred to as one of the tallest waterfalls in Europe. The falls are on the Mardøla river which flows out of a hanging valley into the lake Eikesdalsvatnet, about northwest of the village of Eikesdalen. The waterfall was depicted in the coat of arms of the old Nesset Municipality. The total fall is according to SSB,http://www.ssb.no/a/english/aarbok/kart/i.html according to World Waterfall Database (WWD). WWD reports that the SSB typically includes the head measurement for waterfalls that are situated within a hydroelectric system, resulting in a greater height estimate. Mardalsfossen is a tiered waterfall consisting of two large drops and several smaller ones lower down. It is on average wide, but it can reach up to wide. The highest vertical drop is one of the tallest in Norway. As with figures for the total height, discrepancies have been reported in the estimated height of each vertical drop. According to the SSB, the upper vertical drop is , while the WWD surveyed it as . The water, which has been tapped for hydroelectric use, flows over the falls during the summer tourist season of 20 June to 20 August. At other times the water is channeled through the hydroelectric scheme. The highest rate of flow ever recorded in the falls is . Summer flow is currently limited to less than . In 1970 Arne Næss, the Norwegian founder of the Deep Ecology movement, tied himself with 300 others in protest against the building of a dam and the subsequent removal of the waterfall.

Inconfidência Mineira (; \\"Minas Gerais Conspiracy\\") was an unsuccessful separatist movement in Brazil in 1789. It was the result of a confluence of external and internal causes in what was then a Portuguese colony. The external inspiration was the independence of thirteen of the British colonies in North America following the American Revolutionary War, a development that impressed the intellectual elite of particularly the captaincy of Minas Gerais. The main internal cause of the conspiracy was the decline of gold mining in that captaincy. As gold became less plentiful, the region's gold miners faced increasing difficulties in fulfilling tax obligations to the crown, the tax over gold was one-fifth. When the captaincy could not satisfy the royal demand for gold, it was burdened with an additional tax on gold, called derrama. Conspirators seeking independence from Portugal planned to rise up in rebellion on the day that the derrama was instituted. However, the conspirators lacked both well-formed plans and an overall leader. Some of the conspirators were republicans, others were monarchists. Some favored the abolition of slavery, while others judged abolition as impractical at that time. The conspirators did put forth a few economic and social ideas: the promotion of cotton production, the exploitation of iron and saltpeter reserves, a proposal to give incentives to mothers to have many children, and the creation of a citizens' militia. The conspiracy attracted a great number of military personnel, priests, and intellectuals, as well as the poets Cláudio Manuel da Costa and Tomás Antônio Gonzaga (1744–1807?). Among the best known participants were Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, best known as \\"Tiradentes\\"; José Álvares Maciel, philosopher and chemistry student; and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco de Paula Freire de Andrade (1756–1792) of the regiment of dragoons. Tiradentes, who came from Andrade's regiment, was the independence movement's most enthusiastic propagandist. Conspirators The Inconfidência was inspired by the ideals of the French liberal philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment and the successful American Revolution of 1776. The conspirators largely belonged to the white upper class of minerals-rich Minas Gerais. Many had studied in Europe, especially in the University of Coimbra, and some had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the ) was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. Many of the conspirators wanted to create a republic in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be São João del Rei, and Ouro Preto would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the right to property and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact. Eventually, three participants in the independence movement revealed the conspirators' plans to the government, and the rebels were arrested in 1789. Among the movement were the lawyer Alvarenga Peixoto, the poets Tomás Antônio Gonzaga and Cláudio Manuel da Costa, the priest José da Silva de Oliveira Rolim, and the alferes Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (a.k.a. \\"Tiradentes\\"). After Joaquim Silvério dos Reis (1756–1792), a member of the conspiracy, informed on the movement before it could take place, Peixoto was captured, arrested, and sent to exile in the city of Ambaca, in Portuguese Angola, another colony of the Portuguese Empire, where he remained until the end of his life. Aftermath Judicial proceedings against the conspirators lasted from 1789 to 1792. Lieutenant Colonel Freire de Andrade, Tiradentes, José Álvares Maciel, and eight others were condemned to the gallows. Seven more were condemned to perpetual banishment in Africa, the rest were acquitted. Following the trial Queen Maria I commuted the sentences of capital punishment to perpetual banishment for all except those whose activities involved aggravated circumstances. That was the case for Tiradentes, who took full responsibility for the conspiracy movement and was imprisoned in Rio de Janeiro, where he was hanged on 21 April 1792. Afterwards, his body was torn into pieces, which were sent to Vila Rica in the captaincy of Minas Gerais, to be displayed in the places where he had propagated his revolutionary ideas. The anniversary of his death is celebrated as a national holiday in Brazil. In 1948 the events were portrayed in a film Minas Conspiracy directed by Carmen Santos. In 1963, Minas Gerais incorporated as its state flag the one designed by the Inconfidência, with an equilateral triangle inspired by the Holy Trinity – albeit supposedly the inconfidentes wanted a green triangle, while Minas' flag uses a red one – and a Latin motto taken out of Vergil's Eclogues.Minas Flag , Minas Gerais Government See also * List of historical acts of tax resistance Further reading *Maxwell, Kenneth R., Conflicts and Conspiracies: Brazil & Portugal 1750–1808 (Cambridge University Press, 1973) *Furtado, Júnia Ferreira, Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century (Cambridge University Press, 2009) References Category:Rebellions in Brazil Category:Colonial Brazil Category:Minas Gerais Category:Rebellions in South America Category:Separatism in Brazil Category:Conflicts in 1789 Category:1789 in Brazil Category:Conspiracies ","title":"Inconfidência Mineira"},{"id":"2168030","text":"Boughton Monchelsea is a village and civil parishParish council website in the borough of Maidstone in Kent, England. The civil parish lies on a ragstone ridge situated between the North Downs and the Weald of Kent and has commonly been called Quarry Hills. The village itself is located south of the town of Maidstone. History The interior of St Peter's church The village name comes from a corruption of the name of the Norman family given the manor after the Conquest: Montchensie who held the manor until 1287The Kent Village Book Alan Bignell 1986 and the Anglo Saxon Boc Tun (Beech Tree settlement). The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Boltone, then Bouton, Bocton, and probably via Bocton de Montchensie to the current Boughton Monchelsea. The suffix using the family name seems to have been added in this area of Kent, possibly to differentiate multiple Boctuns.Village name origination Some of the earliest history of Boughton Monchelsea is in the Iron Age settlement at Quarry Wood Camp (Camp Field). There are traces of an outer rampart on Parsonage Farm (on the edge of Park Wood) constructed by the Belgae about 40 AD, possibly as a defence against the Roman invasion in 43 AD. The foundations of a Roman bathhouse were discovered in 1841 near Brishing Court, also a Roman villa at Brishing and a cemetery at Lockham. The quarries were worked extensively in Roman times and the villa and bathhouse could well have belonged to the quarry owner. Ragstone (a type of sandstone) was worked here; stone for the building of Westminster Abbey, the present-day Houses of Parliament and the repair of Rochester Castle came from here. The last quarry closed in 1960. The village church, dedicated to St Peter, was built around 1100. There is a notable fourteenth century Lych-gate at the Churchyard.How to Study an Old Church, A.Needham, pub Batsford. Page 8. Local amenities The village has a village green, a primary school, a village hall, a recreation ground, one public house and a post office among its amenities. The 16th- century Elizabethan stone-built former manor house, Boughton Monchelsea Place,Boughton Monchelsea Place is situated in a private deer park and remains a private dwelling although it is occasionally opened for commercial use as a venue for weddings and business conferences. A similar property at nearby Wierton Place has in recent years operated as a polo and country club as well as an exclusive out-of-town nightclub. Prior to that it was the official residence of judges when on circuit at Maidstone Crown Court. Other historic houses include the Grade II listed Tanyard, Brishing Court and Lewis Court.

Palinopsia is not a diagnosis, it is a diverse group of pathological visual symptoms with a wide variety of causes. Visual perseveration is synonymous with palinopsia. In 2014, Gersztenkorn and Lee comprehensively reviewed all cases of palinopsia in the literature and subdivided it into two clinically relevant groups: illusory palinopsia and hallucinatory palinopsia. Hallucinatory palinopsia, usually due to seizures or posterior cortical lesions, describes afterimages that are formed, long-lasting, and high resolution. Illusory palinopsia, usually due to migraines, head trauma, prescription drugs, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), describes afterimages that are affected by ambient light and motion and are unformed, indistinct, or low resolution. Presentation People with palinopsia frequently report other visual illusions and hallucinations such as photopsias, dysmetropsia i.e. Alice in Wonderland syndrome (micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, and pelopsia), visual snow, oscillopsia, entoptic phenomena, and cerebral polyopia. Cause  Posterior visual pathway cortical lesions (tumor, abscess, hemorrhage, infarction, arteriovenous malformation, cortical dysplasia, aneurysm) and various seizure causes (hyperglycemia, ion channel mutations, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, idiopathic seizures, etc.) cause focal cortical hyperactivity or hyperexcitability, resulting in inappropriate, persistent activation of a visual memory circuit. Pathophysiology Illusory palinopsia is a dysfunction of visual perception, resulting from diffuse, persistent alterations in neuronal excitability that affect physiological mechanisms of light or motion perception. Illusory palinopsia is caused by migraines, HPPD, prescription drugs, head trauma, or may be idiopathic. Trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, topiramate, clomiphene, oral contraceptives, and risperidone have been reported to cause illusory palinopsia. A patient frequently has multiple types of illusory palinopsia, which represent dysfunctions in both light and motion perception. Light and motion are processed via different pathways, suggesting diffuse or global excitability alterations. Diagnosis =Differentiation from physiological afterimages= Palinopsia is a pathological symptom and should be distinguished from physiological afterimages, a common and benign phenomenon. Physiological afterimages appear when viewing a bright stimulus and shifting visual focus. For example, after staring at a computer screen and looking away, a vague afterimage of the screen remains in the visual field. A stimulus consistently produces the same afterimage, which is dependent on the stimulus intensity and contrast, the time of fixation, and the retinal adaptation state. Physiological afterimages are usually the complementary color of the original stimulus (negative afterimage), while palinoptic afterimages are usually the same color as the original stimulus (positive afterimage). There is some ambiguity between illusory palinopsia and physiological afterimages since there are not concrete symptomatic criteria which determines if an afterimage is pathological. =Illusory versus hallucinatory= Illusory palinopsia is due to an abnormality in the original perception of a stimulus and is similar to a visual illusion: the distorted perception of a real external stimulus. Hallucinatory palinopsia is due to an abnormality after a stimulus has been encoded in visual memory and is similar to a complex visual hallucination: the creation of a formed visual image where none exists. External conditions such as stimulus intensity, background contrast, fixation, and movement typically affect the generation and severity of illusory palinopsia but not hallucinatory palinopsia. Illusory palinopsia consists of afterimages that are short-lived or unformed, occur in the same location in the visual field as the original stimulus, and are continuous or predictable. Hallucinatory palinopsia describes formed afterimages and scenes that are lifelike, high-resolution, long-lasting, occur anywhere in the visual field, and are unpredictable. Illusory palinopsia are caused by diffuse neuronal pathology such as global alterations in neurotransmitter receptors, while hallucinatory palinopsia is typically caused by focal cortical pathology. The clinical characteristics that separate illusory from hallucinatory palinopsia also help differentiate and assess risk in visual illusions and hallucinations. Complex (formed) visual hallucinations are more worrisome than simple visual hallucinations or visual illusions. Research Research needs to be performed on the efficacy of the various pharmaceuticals for treating illusory palinopsia. It is unclear if the symptoms' natural history and treatment are influenced by the cause. It is also not clear if there is treatment efficacy overlap for illusory palinopsia and the other co-existing diffuse persistent illusory phenomenon such as visual snow, oscillopsia, dysmetropsia, and halos. Future advancements in fMRI could potentially further our understanding of hallucinatory palinopsia and visual memory. Increased accuracy in fMRI might also allow for the observation of subtle metabolic or perfusional changes in illusory palinopsia, without the use of ionizing radiation present in CT scans and radioactive isotopes. Studying the psychophysics of light and motion perception could advance our understanding of illusory palinopsia, and vice versa. For example, incorporating patients with visual trailing into motion perception studies could advance our understanding of the mechanisms of visual stability and motion suppression during eye movements (e.g. saccadic suppression).

Located in the Amhara Region, it sits at a latitude and longitude of , with an elevation between 2,470 and 2,550 metres above sea level. Dessie is 400 km to the north of the capital Addis Ababa. It has a population of more than 200,000 people in over 30 districts.  History  = 16th-17th Century = Prior to Dessie's foundation, the major settlement in this area was Wasal, first mentioned in an early 16th-century Italian itinerary.O.G.S. Crawford, Ethiopian Itineraries, circa 1400-1524 (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1958), pp. 50-52. = 19th Century = Emperor Yohannes IV was camping in the highlands to the west of the Chefa Valley in 1882 on an expedition to forcefully convert the Amharan Muslims who lived in the region to Christianity. As he was looking for a place to centralize his power in the newly conquered region of Wollo, he stayed overnight in a pre-existing town that is now contained within Dessie. While there, he spotted a comet. He was so impressed by the sight of it that he interpreted it to be a sign from heaven to found his capital city there. Thus, he named it Dessie (Amharic \\"My Joy\\"), as a reference to the elation that the comet had made him feel.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 2 February 2008) = 20th Century = Dessie's location led to the telegraph line the Italians constructed between 1902 and 1904 from Asmara south to Addis Ababa passing through the city, and giving it a local telegraph office. Also in 1904, the Italian Giuseppe Bonaiuti took part in constructing a fair-weather road connecting the city to Addis Ababa. Dessie increased in importance when Ras Mikael Ali, son-in-law to Emperor Menelik II, made it his base. The city was where his son, would-be emperor Iyasus V, crowned Mikael negus around 1915. During his residence in Dessie, the Negus built a palace and the church Enda Medhane Alem, said to be placed on the site of a church destroyed by Imam Ahmed Gragn. The church is decorated with paintings which include portraits of Ras Mikael and his son. After the defeat of his father Negus Mikael, Lij Iyasu took refuge in Dessie beginning on 8 November 1916 while unsuccessfully seeking support from Ras Wolde Giyorgis and other major nobles of northern Ethiopia. However, Ras Wolde Giyorgis used these overtures to extract concessions from the central government, then marched on Dessie which Lij Iyasu fled 10 December.Harold Marcus, Haile Sellassie I: The Formative Years 1892-1935 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), pp. 25f During the Italian invasion, Dessie was first bombed 6 December 1935; the American Hospital was one of the buildings damaged in the attack. Emperor Haile Selassie was photographed personally machine-gunning the raiding planes. The city was occupied by the Italians 15 April 1936. Dessie became an important administrative center under the Italian occupation, and the Franciscans established in 1937 the Latin Catholic missionary Apostolic Prefecture of Dessié, which would be suppressed in 1957 after its only prefect's death. The Italian garrison of the city surrendered 26 April 1941 to Brigadier Pienaar's 1st South African Brigade and 500 arbegnoch, and after the Second World War, the town continued in importance as the capital of the province of Wollo until the province's abolition in 1995. In a decree of 1942, Dessie is listed as one of only six \\"Schedule A\\" municipalities in Ethiopia, while there were about a hundred in \\"Schedule B\\". Artist Essaye Gebre-Medhin Fikre was born in Dessie in 1949. He gained a B.A. in Addis Ababa and an M.A. in Paris but was self-taught as an artist. In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square which was used to re-broadcast announcements on Radio Addis Ababa to the public. In 1957, Dessie had one of 9 provincial secondary schools (excluding Eritrea) in Ethiopia, named after Woizero Sehine the daughter of Negus Mikael. In February 1973, a crowd of 1,500 peasants marched from Dessie to the capital to make the authorities notice the famine in Wollo. They were stopped by police on the outskirts of Addis Ababa and forced to return. Following the Ethiopian revolution, one of the few major encounters between rebels and government forces took place north-west of Dessie in October 1976. Instigated by the local landlord, a large group of peasants marched on the city; troops of the Derg fired into the crowd. Reports of the death toll vary widely, from several hundred to nearly a thousand. In October 1989 Dessie was almost captured by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The EPRDF took permanent control of the city on 18 May 1990, as part of Operation Wallelign.Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 306  Cityscape  Dessie is home to a museum, in the former home of Dejazmach Yoseph Birru.

While activities among Caddos, and other Southeastern Native American peoples certainly took place in the area that is now Marshall, no known settlement existed at Marshall, as was the case of the original location of neighboring Elysian Fields. In 1841 a new seat was sought for Harrison County, and a local settler named Peter Whetstone, offered some of his land in central Harrison County to build the new city on. He offered to build a church and a school on and the subsequently divide the remaining land into 190 lots. County commissioners were initially concerned that the water in the area would not be good--the reason from moving the county seat from sites on the Sabine River like Pulaski was that they had poor water, were prone to disease, and flooding. Whetstone is alleged to have convinced the commissioners that the water was good by pulling a jug of whiskey out from a hollow in an oak tree in what is now downtown Marshall. He passed around the jug, and convinced the commissioners to build on the site; either by convincing them that the whiskey (and water) were good, getting them drunk, or both. However it is important to note that some historians view this account as embellished or untrue. Whetstone's friend Isaac Van Zandt, laid out the city and named it in honor of John Marshall. The city was formally incorporated in 1841 by the Republic of Texas. The city quickly became a major city in the state, because of its position as a gateway to Texas on several major stage coach lines. The city's growing importance was strengthened when Marshall was linked by a telegraph line to New Orleans, becoming the first city in Texas to have a telegraph service. Several academies sprang up, many of them supported by Whetstone, who, ironically, was illiterate. Many African- Americans came to Marshall during Reconstruction; but the establishment of the White Citizens Party after the Union troops departed kept many former slaves locked into poverty. A former slave displays a horn formerly used to call slaves on the outskirts of Marshall in 1939. By 1860 the city was the fifth largest city in Texas, the \\"first metropolis of East Texas with a population of about 2,000\\", according to Randoph B. Campbell author of Gone to Texas, and the seat of the richest county. The county had more slaves than any other in the state, making it a hotbed of anti-Union sentiment. In the 1850s there were so many skilled slaves in Marshall, that white mechanics organized to protest that work was being taken away from \\"free\\" workers. When Gov. Sam Houston refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Marshall's Edward Clark was sworn in as governor. Marshall would also produce Texas' third Confederate governor, Pendleton Murrah. Marshall became a major Confederate city, becoming the capital of Missouri's Confederate government-in-exile, producing gunpowder and other supplies for the Confederate Army, and hosting three conferences of Trans-Mississippi and Indian Territory leaders. Marshall became the seat of civil authority and headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi Postal Department after the fall of Vicksburg. The city would remain influential in the Confederacy throughout the war, as a power center west of the Mississippi, which hosted Confederate governors during the Marshall Conferences in 1862, 1863, and 1865. The city may have been the intended target of a failed Union advance that was rebuffed at Mansfield, Louisiana. Towards the end of the Civil War Richmond had $9 million in Treasury notes and $3 million in postage stamps shipped to Marshall, possibly meaning that Marshall was the intended destination of a government preparing to flee from advancing armies. With high desertion among the Confederate army in the final days of the war, the Confederate powder mill at Marshall was abandoned to looters. Marshall was occupied by Union forces on June 17, 1865, two days before the force, made famous by Juneteenth, arrived at Galveston. During Reconstruction the city was home to an office of the Freedmen's Bureau and was the base for Union troops. In 1873 The Methodist Episcopal Church founded Wiley College to educate free men. African-Americans came to the city seeking opportunities and protection until 1878, when the Citizens Party, led by former Confederate General Walter P. Lane and his brother George, took control of the city and county governments and ran Unionists, Republicans and many African-Americans out of town. The Lanes ultimately declared Marshall and Harrison County \\"redeemed\\" from Union and African-American control. Despite this the African-American community would continue to progress with the establishment of Bishop College in 1881 and the certification of Wiley by the Freedman's Aid Society in 1882. Marshall's \\"Railroad Era\\" began in the early 1870s. Harrison County citizens voted to offer $300,000 bond subsidy, and the City of Marshall offered to donate land north of the downtown to the Texas and Pacific Railway if the company would move to Marshall. T&P; President Jay Gould accepted and located the T&P;'s workshops and general offices for Texas in Marshall. The city benefited immediately from a population explosion. By 1880 the city was one of the South's largest cotton markets. The city's new prosperity became apparent when the first department store in Texas, J. Weisman and Co., opened in 1878. Many Jews, too, moved to Marshall following the arrival of the railroad and a temple was erected in 1900.\\"Marshall, Texas\\" , found in the Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities, Maplecroft, as it appears today, stands at the corner of Travis and Grove Streets in Downtown Marshall, Texas. It is now the center piece of Starr Family Home State Historic Site. During this period of wealth many of the city's now historic homes were constructed. Homes such as Maplecroft, commissioned by James F. Starr. The 1871 Starr home is a two-story frame, late Greek Revival structure with some Victorian styling. Craftsmen, such as shipwrights, and building materials were shipped from New Orleans to Marshall. Marshall Pottery was founded by W. F. Rocker in Marshall in 1895. Rocker located the business in East Texas because of its abundant water and white clay deposits. Despite the prosperity of the railroad era, poverty continued to be a problem in the city among all races, but tensions between whites and African-Americans continued to worsen as segregation crystallized in the city. The rural areas of Harrison County saw greater interaction between white people and African-Americans. There, whites and blacks being neighbors was commonplace. Even though the areas surrounding Marshall were somewhat integrated, racism certainly was still apparent in everyday life. The fact that several planters divided up sizable tracts of land and gave them to their former slaves may also have contributed to these tensions. 20th century During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, children of both races were raised to accept the status quo of segregation. African American Marshall resident George Dawson later wrote about his childhood experiences with segregation in his book Life Is So Good. He described how, despite African American children's acceptance of segregation, in some instances, its demands were too outrageous to follow. For example, Dawson described how he had refused the demand of one employer who expected him to eat with her dogs. 1913-02-25: Two African Americans were lynched in Marshall on this date. Robert Perry was shot to death by a mob after being accused of horse stealing. Another African American, by the family name of Anderson, was hanged by a mob for unknown reasons.The Birmingham News, Birmingham, Alabama, February 27, 1913 1914-04-29: Charles Fisher, a young African-American resident of Marshall, was accused of hugging and kissing the daughter of a white farmer. News of the incident spread widely, and a lynch mob was formed. Fisher was found, kidnapped, and mutilated both physically and sexually, and then released. Fisher was later examined by Sheriff Sanders and County Health Officer Taylor, who found that the mob had sheared off Mr. Fisher's ears, slit his lips, and mutilated his genitals. Fisher survived, but never totally recovered. None of the mob was ever captured.Boston Guardian; Boston, Massachusetts; April 30, 1914 Other known victims of lynching from this time period include: *Walker Davis October 1, 1903, *James Hodges April 27, 1909, *Matthew Chase April 30, 1909, *\\"Mose\\" Creole April 30, 1909, *\\"Pie\\" Hill April 30, 1909, *1 unidentified black man October 29, 1911, *Mary Jackson February 13, 1912, *George Saunders February 13, 1912, *Unknown Anderson February 25, 1913, *Charles Jones August 22, 1917. In 1949, Marshall banned the movie Pinky from the city because it portrayed an interracial couple, a violation of the city's censorship code. The city was sued and the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned the city's censorship law. The community has developed in and around Whetstone Square, shown here in 1939. Guests lodged in the Capitol Hotel, right, and the taller Hotel Marshall directly behind it. In the 1960s the Harrison County Courthouse, center, hosted the first sit-ins in Texas. Three graduates of Wiley College, inspired by the teachings of Wiley professor Melvin B. Tolson, helped to dismantle Jim Crow at the county, state, and national levels. Fred Lewis, as the secretary of the Harrison County NAACP, challenged the oldest White Citizens Party in Texas and the Jim Crow laws it enforced, ultimately abolishing Jim Crow in the county with the Perry v. Cyphers verdict. Heman Sweatt tried to enroll in the University of Texas Law school, but was denied entry because of the color of his skin; he sued and the Texas Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of postgraduate studies in Texas in the Sweatt v. Painter decision. James Farmer became an organizer of the Freedom Rides and a founder of the Congress of Racial Equality. The progression of civil rights would continue into the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In the 1960s, students organized the first sit-ins in Texas in the rotunda of the county courthouse on Whetstone Square in a move to end segregation of public schools; in 1970, all Marshall public schools were integrated. Also in that year, Carolyn Abney became the first woman to be elected to the city commission. In April 1975, local businessman Sam Birmingham became the first African-American to be elected to the city commission and, in the 1980s, Marshall's first African-American mayor. Birmingham retired in 1989 for health concerns and was succeeded by his wife, Jean Birmingham, who became the first African-American woman to serve on the commission. During the first half of the 20th century, the Texas & Pacific Railroad experienced its height under the leadership of John L. Lancaster. Marshall's industry picked up with the discovery of what was then the largest oil field in the world at nearby Kilgore in 1930. Marshall's railroad industry subsequently declined with the dieselization of most trains, the proliferation of air travel, and the construction of the Interstate highway system after World War II. The T&P; Shops closed in the 1960s and T&P; passenger service ceased in 1970. The Texas oil bust of the 1980s devastated the local economy and the city's population declined by about a thousand between 1980 and 1990.

Known as Georgetown Pike, the state highway runs from SR 7 in Dranesville east to SR 123 in Langley. SR 193 passes through Great Falls and meets Interstate 495 (I-495) in McLean. The state highway was designated the first Virginia Byway for its scenic value in 1974. Route description View east along SR 193 at SR 7 in Dranesville Crossing of Difficult Run at Great Falls Park SR 193 begins at an intersection with SR 7 (Leesburg Pike) in Dranesville. The state highway heads east as a two-lane road and passes between many of the affluent residential subdivisions of Great Falls. After passing through the village center of Great Falls at Walker Road, SR 193 turns east-southeast and follows the edge of Great Falls Park. The state highway features many sharp curves as it drops into the stream valley of Difficult Run. SR 193 passes through several curves as the highway skirts residential subdivisions, passes the Madeira School, and crosses Bullneck Run and Scott Run. The state highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway around its interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway) in McLean. After passing Langley High School and Chain Bridge Road, the old alignment of SR 123, SR 193 reaches its eastern terminus at SR 123 (Dolley Madison Boulevard). History When first constructed, the Georgetown Pike continued through the District of Columbia's Alexandria County (now Arlington County, Virginia) to the banks of the Potomac. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The listing describes Georgetown Pike as located in both Fairfax and Arlington Counties, Virginia. Beginning at the boundary of the District of Columbia and Arlington County at Chain Bridge on the south bank of the Potomac River, it extends .4 miles to cross the Fairfax County line, then continues 14 miles in an approximately northwesterly direction to meet the Leesburg Pike near Dranesville in Fairfax County. After beginning the ascent from Chain Bridge, the river is never again visible from the road, although it passes so close to the river at Great Falls that the roar of the water can be heard. The Georgetown Pike roadbed is approximately 20- to 24-feet wide within a 50- to 60-foot-wide right-of-way as built in 1813-1827. A crowned and graduated stone highway, constructed according to a modified Tresauget system, the Georgetown Pike surpassed the standards of the enabling legislation of both the U. S. Congress and the Assembly of Virginia. John Mason, Jr., president of the Falls Bridge Turnpike Company, wrote to the Board of Public Works in 1820 that the roadbed was \\"paved with large stone, closely fitted together, 12 inches deep in the centre, falling off to 6 inches on the sides, and covered with broken stone 6 inches deep from side to side; making 18 inches stone in the centre, and twelve inches on the sides; the whole is covered with sand, gravel or clay, as was found most convenient.\\"1 This substantial method of construction has served the road well, as it has survived flooding, war, neglect, and adaptation for automobile traffic. The Georgetown Pike is a road built in conformance with the most advanced engineering expertise and construction resources of the early nineteenth century. Men using hand tools and horse- drawn equipment formed the roadbed, clearing, blasting, plowing, scooping, and filling the rough terrain. Stone retaining walls, culverts, arches, and bridges were built where necessary, working within the context of the natural terrain to the extent possible. An original road bridge with stone and brick viaduct at Bull Neck Run, and a massive stone retaining wall at Pimmit Run in Arlington County are notable survivors. John Templeman, builder of the Potomac Chain Bridge in 1808, served as superintendent of the road from December 1, 1817, to April 30, 1818. He designed and built an additional chain bridge to carry the Pike over Difficult Run. Though this bridge is not extant, it was described by Mason as \\"220 feet long, and 20 feet wide; it stands on two large stone abutments, and three stone piers 18 feet high; is further supported by three ranges of chains, extending from end to end, resting on the stone piers; and has supports of strong upright timbers between the piers where necessary.\\" From 1940 to 1963, Georgetown Pike's eastern terminus was at its intersection with Chain Bridge Road, which then continued east along the Pike's alignment to the Potomac. In 1963, Virginia completed the Dolley Madison Boulevard bypass in the McLean area, as an alternative to widening both the existing Chain Bridge Road and Georgetown Pike. John F. Kennedy, who owned the Hickory Hill property at the intersection of the two roads, requested the alignment south of his property. Georgetown Pike was then extended east along its previous alignment to the new boulevard, which kept the name Chain Bridge Road from there to the Potomac.

History and profile Die Presse was first printed on 3 July 1848 as a liberal (libertarian)-bourgeois newspaper within the meaning of the revolutions of 1848 by the entrepreneur August Zang. Its staff split in 1864 under the leadership of Max Friedländer, Michael Etienne and Adolf Werthner to form the Neue Freie Presse, which later was aryanized by the Nazis in 1938 and effectively closed in 1939. In 1946, after the Second World War, resistance fighter Ernst Molden, who had been vice-editor-in-chief of the Neue Freie Presse from 1921 until 1939, reestablished the newspaper as Die Presse. The \\"Presse\\" had been struggling for financial survival for a long time, until during the 1960s, the Austrian Chamber of Commerce became the main shareholder. Since 1999 it has been owned by the Styria Medien AG, a conservative-liberal media group founded by the Catholic Church. Its publisher is Die Presse Verlag GmbH. The paper covers general news topics. It is frequently quoted in international media concerning news from Austria. Since March 2009 it has also been operating a weekly newspaper under the name \\"Die Presse am Sonntag\\". The daily covers half-page science news each day. The political position of the \\"Die Presse\\" can be described as classical liberal, with a strong emphasis on free-market economy and small government, traditionally opposing Austria's grand coalition and its neocorporatist tendencies. It therefore stands in contrast to other Austrian newspapers of quality including the more conservative Wiener Zeitung and the social-liberal Der Standard. Emphasis is put on the 1848 revolutions as the beginning of its tradition as a liberal newspaper, citing it in its slogan \\"Free since 1848\\". Despite its liberal free-market orientation, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote a series of articles on the American Civil War for Die Presse in the early 1860s, which were later collected into the book The Civil War in the United States. In 2007 the editor-in-chief of Die Presse was Michael Fleischhacker who had been appointed to the post in 2004. Next year the paper was named Best Editorial Team in Austria. Circulation In 2002 Die Presse was one of four quality daily newspapers with nationwide distribution along with Der Standard, Salzburger Nachrichten, and Wiener Zeitung. The same year its circulation was 120,000 copies. In 2004 the paper had a circulation of 115,000 copies. The 2007 circulation of Die Presse was 121,000 copies. The circulation of the daily was 120,363 copies in 2008 and 102,598 copies in 2009. It was 97,091 copies in 2010. The paper had a circulation of 74,032 copies in 2011. Its circulation was 80,000 copies in 2013. Incidents In 2009, reports claimed that the \\"Presse\\"'s long-time editor, Otto Schulmeister, had been working for the CIA in the 1960s and 1970s, and the CIA was already describing it internally as “CIA-subsidized” as early as 1951, when it was used to distribute Animal Farm in the Soviet Zone of Vienna.

The royal residence at Bonga was not as elegant as those in Gomma, Gera, and Limmu-Ennarea. Capuchin monks founded a mission there in 1845 and discovered some medieval churches which remained as evidence of the early infiltration of Christian influence before the invasion of the Oromo. When Paul Soleillet visited Bonga in the 1880s, he described its trade as primarily slaves, coffee, civet cat oil, coriander and ivory, the turnover amounting between 200,000 and 300,000 dollars a year.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 448 Following the conquest of Kaffa by the generals of Menelik II in 1897, Bonga was deserted; governor Ras Wolde Giyorgis made neighboring Anderaccha his capital. Bonga was occupied 13 December 1936 by the Italians under General Malta, who died there the next year on 30 May. He and his successor Colonel Corrado refounded Bonga as a local administrative and commercial center for the production of coffee, hides, wax, maize, tea, etc. By 1938, there were about 3,000 inhabitants in the town, of whom about 200 were Italians, and it was equipped with a post office, telegraph, hospital, pharmacy, and spacci. There were few remains of early constructions, but the new settlement was well built from brick and tufa, covered by clay tiles or corrugated iron. Generals Bortello and Tosti, commanders of the Italian forces south of the Didessa River acknowledged their weak position and along with 2,850 troops on 28 June 1941 surrendered to Lt. Col. McNab of the King's African Rifles. Telephone service reached Bonga between 1954 and 1967. Around 1970, there lived in Bonga one Idebe Godo who was the chief priest of a spirit possession cult. The high priesthood was hereditary to the family of the former high priests to the King of Kaffa.

It is southwest of Merthyr Mawr, former Glamorgan, Wales, now Bridgend county borough and just northwest of Ogmore Castle, separated by the River Ogmore. Candleston's original long and narrow rectangular structure lay across the western end of a low narrow promontory, suggesting a defensive position. The castle is believed to be named after the Norman family of Cantilupe, thought to be its first feudal tenants. Geography The ruins of Candleston, which had been part of a medieval settlement, stand on the Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes, on the edge of the Merthyr Mawr Warren. They are east of Porthcawl off of Swansea Bay. History =12th – 14th centuries= In the 12th century, Candleston manor passed to the St Quintin lords of Talyfan and Llanbleddian; The Cantilupe family are considered Candleston's first tenants. Although there are no records to show that the de Cantilupes were at the site in the 12th century, it is believed that the name Candleston is derived from their name, variously spelled Cantulupo, Cantilupo, Cantelo. In 1596 it was called Cantelowstowne and in 1635 Cantloston. It was Tregantlow in Welsh, Tref or Tre meaning town. Candleston Castle, a fortified manor, was built in the 14th century. An enclosure, in the shape of a D, surrounded the structure. The late-medieval manor may have been constructed on the site of a previous building, based upon the presence of remnants of an earlier wall. The castle may have been built by Robert de Canteilupe III, who owned one ploughland at Candleston in 1320 according to the Despenser Survey of Glamorgan of that year. Robert III, who is not recorded after 1320, may have been succeeded by John de Cantilupe, who may have been the Abbot of Margam in 1315. Robert de Cantilupe III's daughter Joan, heiress of Candleston, married Sir William Horton of Tregwynt, Pembrokeshire. Sands from the dunes shifted starting in the late 14th century and encroached on nearby Kenfig Castle, resulting in its evacuation. The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales reported that Candleston's \\"elevated position was just sufficient to save it from the encroaching sand dunes on the northern fringe of the Merthyr Mawr Warren, which entirely surrounded the promontory and formed a relatively stable margin close to the southern wall of the castle.\\" =15th – 19th centuries= The ruins Candleston passed through Joan Cantilupe Horton and Sir William Horton's son Jenkin, who may not have resided at Candleston, to Jenkin's daughter Jennet or Janet. The manor then went to the Cradocks when Janet married Richard Cradock about 1468. Nicholas Horton briefly resided at Candleston and paid a small quit rent in 1411 for what is believed to be Candleston to the lord of Merthyr Mawr. Joan Robert, reported to be the daughter of Margaret Cantilupe, married John Eyre. In 1412 and 1429, Eyre is recorded as Candleston's landholder. Janet Horton and Richard Cradock received Candleston, possibly because the Eyres did not have children or due to the nature of their tenure. Janet and Richard Cradock's son, Sir Mathew Cradock (about 1468–1531) inherited the property. During his career, he was steward of Gower, Chancellor of Glamorgan and constable for life of the Kenfig and Caerphilly castles. In the late 15th century the manor was refurbished and modified; It is believed that Mathew Cradock was responsible for the construction. His only child, Margaret, was heiress of the manor. Sir Richard Herbert married Margaret. He was from Ewyas, Hereford. In around 1500 alternations were made to the Hall range. It had a four-centred, local green sandstone ogee arch, pointed and chamfered arch tower, parapet corbelling of the roofs, and an \\"impressive perpendicular chimneypiece\\". George Herbert of Swansea inherited Candleston from Margaret and Sir Richard Herbert. Mathew Herbert, George's son then held Candleston. Brothers, grandsons of Sir George Herbert, had the manor next. First, Sir William Herbert had the manor in 1598, then Sir John Herbert inherited the manor after his brother's death in 1609. Sir John died in 1617 and Mary, his daughter and heiress, married Sir William Doddington. Robert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke of Warwick married Doddington's granddaughter. His brother inherited the property upon his death in 1676. Francis Greville, great-grandson of the brother, was Earl of Warwick and 8th Baron Brook. The manor was held by the Grevilles, who visited only occasionally, made only minor modifications, and sold it to the Franklen family in the 18th century. Between 1806 and 1808, Sir John Nicholl resided at the manor while his manor was built. Candleston Castle was sold by Richard Franklen to Nicholl in 1830, when it was said to have included a drawing room, dining room, breakfast rooms, four bedrooms and a coach house. It was evacuated in the 19th century, after having operated as a farm house. In the early 19th century modifications included construction of a stable, the castle was crenellated for ornamental purposes and a defensive tower was built. The stepped base of a Calvary cross, of unreported date, with the fallen cross itself lying alongside, was found near the windmill uncovered by sand in 1823. Candleston Castle =20th – 21st centuries= In the 21st century, the castle is an \\"ivy covered ruin\\". Wildfowl, butterflies, moths, autumn gentian, violets and orchids are seen in the area. The area around the castle is woodland and farm land. The nearby Merthyr Mawr dunes are among northwestern Europe's \\"highest and most voluminous\\" sand dunes, and it is the \\"second highest mobile sand dune system in Europe.\\" The dunes west of Candleston Castle are more than above sea level and are now fairly stabilised.

History  Gore was founded in the nineteenth century, growing up around Ras Tessema Nadew's palace. The Russian explorer Alexander Bulatovich stopped here 21 November 1896, expecting to meet Ras Tessema, who was away campaigning against the Mocha; Ras Tessema had not returned when Bulatovich left on 31 December.From Entotto to the River Baro (1897), translated by Richard Selzer, Ethiopia through Russian Eyes: Country in Transition, 1896-1898 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 2000) (accessed 2 November 2009) With the growing prosperity of the port town of Gambela, and the growth of the Baro River route to Sudan, Gore likewise prospered, holding two market days a week.

Papageorgiou coffee and wax merchant from Artemision Greece 1930 since 1968 , one Syrian, one British and one German\\"—engaged in the export of coffee, wax, and to a lesser extent animal hides, and the import of cotton cloth, salt, and other manufactured goods. Civet cat oil was also a significant export at the time, Pankhurst noting that Ras Tessema exported 42 kilos in 1910. On 9 July 1927, the Greek nationals T. Zewos and A. Donalis were awarded a contract to link the town and Gore by road with Gambela, a distance of 180 kilometers.Pankhurst, Economic History, pp. 290f However, the road from Jimma to Gore was not yet built by 1935. A trip to Addis Ababa took 20–22 days for pack mules and 14–15 days for riding mules. The mail transport from Gore to the capital departed every Monday at 17.00 while the government telephone line was used also as telegraph connection. Later Ras Imru Haile Selassie attempted to use Gore as his base to resist the forces of the occupying Italian forces, but hostility from the local Welega Oromo forced him to move from the town late in October, 1936.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), pp. 163-166 On 26 November 1936, the Italian 1st Eritrean Brigade occupied the town.

It is located south of Gondar on the north shore of Lake Tana, in the Semien Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region. Gorgora has a latitude and longitude of .  Overview  Gorgora refers to a small peninsula jutting into Lake Tana as well as to a small village hosting a harbor. The peninsula was important in the past as the site of an important Jesuit residence: \\"Old\\" Gorgora was located 5 km northeast, inland from Maryam Gimb, which was called [New] Gorgora, and 5 km west of Debre Sina and its churches (usually not considered a town in its own right).Andreu Martinez, \\"Gorgora\\", in Siegbert Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, vol. 2, Wiesbaden: Harrasowitz, 2005, pp. 853-4. Other notable landmarks include the monastery of Mandaba, located at the headlands of Gorgora peninsula. R.E. Cheesman visited Mandaba in 1932 and described the monastery as being enclosed by a high wall and no woman is allowed inside its gate. There are 150 residents, monks, the monastery is governed by an Abbot who has the power of putting refractory monks in chains, and is all powerful in his own monastery. Cheesman was told that if a man fleeing from justice rings the monastery bell and is given sanctuary, he is safe from even the highest person in the land.R.E. Cheesman, \\"Lake Tana and Its Islands\\", Geographical Journal, 85 (1935), pp. 499f Ferries sail from the port to Bahir Dar via Kunzela and Dek Island.  History  Gorgora served as one of the early capitals of Ethiopia during the reigns of Emperor Susenyos I and his son Fasilides before Fasilides founded Gondar. It was selected as a capital as it started with the letter \\"gʷa\\" (Ge'ez: ጐ), as dictated by a prophecy of the time (the same prophecy led to the rise of Gondar). Gorgora is the Ethiopic bastardization of the Greek name \\"Γρηγόριος\\" (Gregorios). The city is named after the 4th-century Saint & Church Father Gregory the Illuminator, who is a prominent figure in Ethiopian Orthodox Theology. Ruins of the structures the Jesuits built can still be seen, although most of the buildings fell following an earthquake in the 1950s. Their construction is credited to the missionary Pedro Paez, who also succeeded in converting Emperor Susenyos to Catholicism.David Buxton, Travels in Ethiopia, second edition (London: Benn, 1957), p. 115 The town is known for the Debre Sina church (built in 1608), its many monasteries, the palace of the Emperor Susenyos located nearby, and the Portuguese cathedral that was abandoned after Emperor Fasilides expelled the Jesuits. Gorgora formed part of the defenses of the Italian last stand, under General Guglielmo Nasi, around Gondar. In October 1941, the Italians had one battalion at Gorgora; within a month the garrison was 1500 strong. In 1960 the public health service set up a center in this town, one of the first four in the countryside of Ethiopia. Gorgora was selected due to its proximity to the Public Health College in Gondar.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 19 March 2008)  Demographics  Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Gorgora has an estimated total population of 4783, of whom 2283 are men and 2500 are women.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table B.4 The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 2,768 of whom 1,201 were men and 1,567 were women.

Despite determined Ethiopian resistance, by 3 March the Italians had resumed their advance and shortly afterwards crossed the Tekezé River. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1941, Shire served as the capital of the Shire sub-region until the administrative reorganization of the nation following the adoption of the 1995 Ethiopian Constitution. Shire once again became a battlefield during the Ethiopian Civil War. The first clash of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) with government forces occurred 5 August 1975, after Mehari Tekle (\\"Mussie\\"), a member of the TPLF leadership, was arrested in Addi Daero by government militiamen and taken to prison in Shire. Before he could be transported to a more secure facility in Mek'ele or Addis Ababa, a squad of eleven men burst into the prison, wounding one policeman and scattering the rest, freeing their comrade and 60 other prisoners, and spiriting him away to safety.Aregawi Berhe, A Political history of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (1975-1991) (Los Angeles: Tsehai, 2009), pp. 76f. (Aregawi states in a footnote that he was a member of the eleven-man squad.) During the latter part of the war, following the massive Ethiopian army defeat at the Battle of Afabet in March 1988, the TPLF launched a series of offensives, in which they destroyed government forces stationed at Rama, Adwa, Seleh Leha, and Shire. Only about 200 soldiers of the 17th Army Division were able to evacuate Shire and fall back to Gondar. This led to the raising of the Third Revolutionary Army, composed of the 603rd, 604th and 605th core armies. Between 19 June and 3 July 1988 the 604th was able to regain control over 12 districts, and entered Shire with no significant resistance from TPLF forces. However, due to unrest amongst the government soldiers at Addi Hageray, which permitted the TPLF to attack and occupy that town, the 604th was unable to advance again until 28 December. This led to the Second Battle of Shire, which ended on 19 February 1989 as a victory for the TPLF. Although Shire had been the headquarters of the Third Revolutionary Army at the beginning of the battle, at the end the remaining units were retreating towards Enda Aba Guna.Tekeste Melake, \\"The Battle of Shire\\", Ethiopian Review, 24 September 2008 (accessed 30 July 2009) The third edition of Lonely Planet guide to Ethiopia notes that \\"war relics\\" could still be seen near Shire.Matt Philips and Jean-Bernard Carillet, Ethiopia and Eritrea, third edition (n.p.: Lonely Planet, 2006), p. 131  Climate  Shire has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) with average rainfall reaching 905 mm.

Established in 2001, the band is known for their atmospheric and almost entirely instrumental style. They have released six studio albums and six EPs. History and style The band is known for dense combinations of different melodies and extended track lengths. It may be classified as stoner rock, doom metal, or post-rock. Larry Herweg, Trevor de Brauw, and Laurent Schroeder-Lebec are also three members of the band Tusk. Pelican previously signed to Hydra Head Records but is currently signed with Southern Lord Records roster. Pelican toured with Wolves in the Throne Room to support their first EP for Southern Lord, Ephemeral, released on June 6, 2009. What We All Come to Need was released on October 27, 2009. Greg Anderson and Aaron Turner both appeared on the album. In celebration of the new album, the \\"Pelican Burger\\" was served at Kuma's Corner for one night. In 2012 Pelican announced a new EP, Ataraxia/Taraxis. In April 2012, they began a European tour, playing in England, Italy, Germany, Finland, the Dunk Festival in Belgium and the Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands. The support bands for this tour included Bo Ningen and Tacoma Narrows Bridge Disaster in the UK, and Tombs in continental Europe. In June 2012, the band announced an amicable split with guitarist and founding member Laurent Schroeder-Lebec. Schroeder-Lebec had not been touring with the band for the prior two years, with Dallas Thomas of The Swan King performing live in his stead, but not participating in the writing process. On October 15, 2013, Pelican released its fifth studio album and first without Schroeder- Lebec, Forever Becoming. Pelican announced three new upcoming releases in February 2019. The first of which was a remixing/remastering of Forever Becoming. While Pelican was satisfied with the original recordings, Chris Common mixed the tracks in a makeshift studio with \\"less-than-ideal circumstances\\" that \\"varnished the incredible tones generated during tracking\\". Southern Lord described the deluxe reissue as bringing \\"a new level of low-end depth, atmospheric clarity, and tight, punchy heaviness to the album\\". Pelican also announced new album was coming in 2019, and slated a new single from that album \\"Midnight and Mescaline\\"/\\"Darkness on the Stairs\\" for release on Record Store Day. Months later in April 2019, Pelican released the track \\"Midnight and Mescaline\\" for online streaming and formally announced their sixth studio album would titled Nighttime Stories and would be released on June 7, 2019 through Southern Lord. Genre Regarding the band's genre, de Brauw said, \\"I think people use genres and tags to serve a purpose – it gives people a frame of reference to understand music by – but I don’t think any artist feels comfortable being tagged as anything. I have an affinity for metal, but I don’t think of Pelican as a metal band. So when people call us ‘instrumetal’, or post-metal, or metalcore or whatever, I can see why they say that, but it's not something that I feel a close connection with. I feel we’re part of a community with some bands – Mono are good friends of ours, but I don't feel that we’re that similar musically. Their music is more similar to classical music, whereas I feel ours has more in common with punk and hardcore. I feel like we’re part of a trajectory of Midwest bands that kind of blend aggression with a pop sensibility, so while it's easy to classify us with instrumental bands, we’re not instrumental by design. We just didn't know how to put vocals in our music and for it to sound right. When you start a band, you don't have it in mind to be an instrumental band – these things are afterthoughts when your music's out there.\\" Speaking on the plethora of labels used to describe Pelican's genre, bassist Bryan Herweg states that \\"it's flattering, really\\", and that \\"I take that as nobody being able to classify what we're doing. I really don't want to be fixed in one genre.\\" As for the instrumental nature of the band, Herweg states that \\"I think there are limitations that come with having a vocalist. If we had some big burly man in front screaming, we'd be classified as metal. If we had some scrawny guy we'd be emo. As it is, no one can pin us down.\\" Touring has evolved the band's style from \\"drawn-out... slow-building\\" to \\"more direct and faster, and straight to the point\\" material to provide more energy on stage.

History The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation Building, formerly the Union Industrial Bank Building, in Flint, Michigan In June 1926, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation was founded by C.S. Mott. Starting in 1928, the foundation made annual gifts to the Flint Institute of Arts. With the establishment of the Flint Cultural Center in 1958, this annual contribution was shifted to the cultural center. In 1968, the Genesee County park system was started with the purchase of vacant land funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation with a stipulation that a parks commission be formed. Mott transferred U.S. Sugar shares to the foundation. In 1969 with a law passed limiting private family foundations could hold of a corporation, the foundation gave a large number of shares to the Mott Children’s Health Center, a Flint charitable medical organization founded in 1939, to be below the 35% limit. In June 2017, the foundation's 91st year, the Mott Foundation had surpassed over $1 billion in grants dispersed. In November 2018, the CEO , William White announced his immediate retirement and replacement by Ridgeway White as successor. White died in October 2019, aged 82.

Its adjacent museum burned to the ground in 1997; however a new one has since opened.Matt Philips and Jean-Bernard Carillet, Ethiopia and Eritrea, third edition (n.p.: Lonely Planet, 2006), p. 237  History  Addis Alem was founded in 1900 by Menelik II as a new capital city; Empress Taytu Betul picked the name. Although at one point he had 20,000 members of the Welega Oromo busy in constructing buildings in the new city, by 1903 he decided to keep the capital at Addis Ababa. However, it was used by the Emperor as his summer palace during the following years.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 25 March 2008) The first paved road in Ethiopia was constructed between Addis Alem and the capital, the work beginning in 1903, and reported in quite usable condition the next year.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (1800 - 1935) (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), pp. 288f. Around 1930, most of the wood for the buildings and furniture in Addis Ababa was sawn from the forests near Addis Alem. During the Italian occupation, a factory for the production of slaked lime was established during the Italian time, and in its first year of production it turned out 30,000 hundredweights of the material. On 2 December 1936 the Arbegnoch, led by Admiqe Besha, attacked the Italian garrison. The Italians lost 78 men, and 2,007 rifles, cannons and hand grenades. On 3 April in the following year, the Italians sent a cavalry regiment 450 strong to recapture Addis Alem; it was promptly cut to ribbons by the Arbagnoch, and only 50 men escaped with their lives. A number of notable artists are associated with this town. The church has some art work by Abebe Wolde Giorgis (1897-1967), who studied in France for 18 years, has contributed to the art work of the church of St. Maryam. Worku Mammo Dessalegn, born in Addis Alem in 1935, lost both hands in an accident while playing with a bomb at the age of twelve; he attended the Art School in 1960-1962, later studied in the USSR and then returned to the Art School in Addis Ababa as a teacher.

It is located in the Misraqawi Zone at longitude and latitude , with an elevation of above sea level and below a high ridge to the west. Adigrat is the last important Ethiopian city south of the border with Eritrea, and is considered to be a strategically important gateway to Eritrea and the Red Sea. Adigrat was part of Ganta Afeshum woreda before a separate woreda was created for the city. Currently, Adigrat serves as the capital of the Eastern Tigray zone. Adigrat is one of the most important cities of Tigray, which evolved from earlier political centers and camps of regional governors. Antalo, Aläqot and Adigrat were a few of them. The decline of Antalo was followed by the rise of Adigrat as another prominent, yet short- lived, capital of Tigray. It used to serve as the capital of Agame.  History  = Origins = Tradition attributes the origin of the name Adigrat, which means \\"the country of farmland\\", to the then popular Tigrayan chief Akhadom. Adigrat seems to have been under cultivation for a long time. It has a settlement history dating back at least to the 14th century. Adigrat appears on indigenous maps of the northern Horn of Africa in the 15th Century under the name Agame.Nyssen, J., Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes, Hailemariam Meaza, Dondeyne, S., 2020.

Sabagadis set up some palaces, churches and markets. This increasingly attracted both natives and foreigners to establish permanent residences and a few shops in the town. Adigrat was an important market-center for salt, which was mined in the Afar districts of Areho and Berale in eastern Tigray. However, it declined after the death of its patron, Sabagadis, in 1830. It was repeatedly attacked, sacked and plundered by the lowlanders and political rivals of Sabagadis. Samuel Gobat had joined countless Ethiopians in fleeing there for safety in the days immediately after Sabagadis' death.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 16 December 2007) When the missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf passed through Adigrat in April 1842, \\"almost the whole is in ruins\\", and observed that a nearby village, Kersaber, was \\"much larger than Adigrat.\\"Journals of the Rev. Messrs. Isenberg and Krapf, Missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, Detailing their proceedings in the kingdom of Shoa, and journeys in other parts of Abyssinia, in the years 1839, 1840, 1841 and 1842, (London, 1843), p. 513 In the late 1860s the town had a rural appearance and much of it is still under cultivation today. During the First Italian-Abyssinian War, the Italians occupied Adigrat on 25 March 1895, and used it as a base to support their advance south to Mek'ele. General Antonio Baldissera refortified the settlement after the Italian defeat at the Battle of Adowa, but Emperor Menelik II insisted on its surrender at the beginning of the peace talks that concluded the war; Baldissera was ordered to evacuate Adigrat, which he did 18 May 1896. Augustus B. Wylde a few years later described Adigrat as having a Saturday market of medium size.Augustus B. Wylde, Modern Abyssinia (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 494 = 20th Century = Lazarists introduced perhaps the first modern school of northern Ethiopia in Adigrat at the turn of the 20th century. However, like most Ethiopian towns, Adigrat increased its commercial and administrative importance during the period of the Italian occupation. The Italians introduced the first elements of modern infrastructure, including stronger fortresses, restaurants, residential houses, a health center, schools, roads, piped water, an electric generator, etc. The Italians again occupied Adigrat at the beginning of the Second Italian-Abyssinian War 7 October 1935. The Italians were met there on the 11th by Ras Haile Selassie Gugsa, who had been courted by the Italians to ignite a widespread defection of the Tigrayan aristocracy; instead, he had been soundly defeated a few days before by Dejazmach Haile Kebbede of Wag, and presented himself to the invaders with only 1200 followers. Anthony Mockler notes that despite the fact the young Ras shook Ethiopian morale, \\"this was the first and last open defection to the Italians of an important noble and his men.\\" In 1938, there were shops and hotel-restaurants (“Bologna”, “Piemontese”, “Centrale”). There was also a post, telephone and telegraph office, a health post and a Catholic Apostolic Prefecture. Adigrat was captured by rebels in the Woyane rebellion 25 September 1943, forcing the Ethiopian government administrators to flee to neighboring Eritrea. By 1958 the city was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as a First Class Township. Street scene. During the 1970s, Agazi Comprehensive High School, and together with the town's Catholic junior high school, they became centers of anti- government dissent. The presence outside of town of a large military base, served as a focus for protesting students, and also as a source for their hopes of a military coup. Adigrat's dependence on merchandising and trade meant that the Derg's imposition of commercial and transport restrictions were strongly felt and resented. Under the Derg business licenses became progressively more difficult to get, and traders' trucks were requisitioned for the transport of war-related materials to army bases in Eritrea. Permits of travel were required; convoys were introduced by 1976; and the road links to Asmara were virtually broken, largely by the ELF, by the late 1970s. During the first years of the Ethiopian Civil War, the fledgling Tigrayan People's Liberation Front drew support from these groups. Derg forces took Adigrat during their Operation Adwa in summer 1988. The same day that the Third Revolutionary Army was crushed at Battle of Shire, 19 February 1989, government troops and officials evacuated Adigrat.Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 284 According to Africa Watch they caused widespread destruction in the town before they left. A pharmaceutical factory which became operational in 1997, was set up in the town.  Main sights  There are different sights near Adigrat can be visited by tourists like:- Debre Damo is the name of a flat- topped mountain, or amba, and a 6th-century monastery in northern Ethiopia. The mountain is a steeply rising plateau of trapezoidal shape, about 1000 by 400 m in dimension. It is north-west of Adigrat, in the Mehakelegnaw Zone of the Tigray Region, close to the border with Eritrea. Gunda Gunde is an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo monastery located to the south of Adigrat in the Misraqawi (Eastern) Zone of the northern Tigray Region in Ethiopia. It is known for its prolific scriptorium, as well as its library of Ge'ez manuscripts. This collection of over 220 volumes, all but one dating from before the 16th century, is one of the largest collections of its kind in Ethiopia. Cityscape Cathedral of the Holy Saviour Adigrat, the capital of the Agamé district, has a rich aristocratic and political history. In town are the remnants of two castles from the Zemene Mesafint (\\"Era of Princes\\"),(ዘመነ መሳፍንት) one owned by Dej Desta, the other by the Ras Sebhat Aregawi. Other sites of interest: *19th century Adigrat Chirkos - was strategically built on a hill near Dej Desta's castle, so that Desta could see the church from his bedroom balcony. *A few years after World War II land was obtained in the center of Adigrat at a site called \\"Welwalo\\". In view of the possibility that one day it might become a church, the \\"Holy Saviour\\" was built and used regularly as a parish church. After the establishment of the Ethiopian Catholic hierarchy in 1961 that church was destined to become the cathedral of the Eparchy of Adigrat. After appropriate modifications were made the formal and official consecration of the Cathedral Catholic of the Holy Saviour took place on 19 April 1969. It has an Italian design, but incorporates work by Ethiopian artist Afewerk Tekle.Frances Linzee Gordon, Jean Bernard Carillet Ethiopia and Eritrea (Lonely Planet, 2003) pp. 168f. *Italian War cemetery commemorates some 765 Italian soldiers who died between 1935 and 1938. *Adigrat also hosts a market, and a newly constructed community park.

Biography Kadishman, 1954 Menashe Kadishman was born in Mandate Palestine. His father died when he was 15 years old. He left school to help his mother and provide for the family.\\"The Times of Israel, 13 Oct, 2016 From 1947 to 1950, Kadishman studied with the Israeli sculptor Moshe Sternschuss at the Avni Institute of Art and Design in Tel Aviv, and in 1954 with the Israeli sculptor Rudi Lehmann in Jerusalem. In 1950–1953, Kadishman worked as a shepherd on Kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch. This experience with nature, sheep and shepherding had a significant impact on his later artistic work and career. In 1959, Kadishman moved to London to study at Saint Martin's School of Art and the Slade School of Art. In 1959-1960 he also studied with Anthony Caro and Reg Butler. He had his first one-man show there in 1965 at the Grosvenor Gallery. In 1972, he returned to Israel. On May 8, 2015 Kadishman died at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer. Art career \\"Suspense,\\" Israel Museum, Jerusalem In the 1960s, Kadishman's sculptures were Minimalist in style, and so designed as to appear to defy gravity. This was achieved either through careful balance and construction, as in Suspense (1966), or by using glass and metal so that the metal appeared unsupported, as in Segments (1968). The glass allowed the environment to be part of the work. The first major appearance of sheep in his work was at the 1978 Venice Biennale, where Kadishman presented a flock of colored live sheep as living art.The Old Master Of Tel Aviv In 1995, he began painting portraits of sheep by the hundreds, and even thousands, each one different from the next.

Mordechai Abir states that it was founded by Ras Ali I;Mordechai Abir, Ethiopia: Era of the Princes (London: Longmans, 1968), p.30. however, Richard Pankhurst gives a detailed account of its foundation by Ras Gugsa, and includes the tradition that the location was selected with supernatural help.Richard P.K.

In either case, Debre Tabor was the seat of the Regents of the Emperor in the 18th and 19th centuries, from which periods several churches and the ruins of two palaces survive. Debre Tabor was the capital of Ethiopia under two Emperors: Tewodros II, before he moved the capital to Magdala; and Yohannes IV. As a result, in the 19th century the population of this town varied depending on whether the emperor was in residence. If he was present, the population could reach 30,000 as it did under Emperor Yohannes; if he was not, it would be around 5,000 people.Richard P.K.

Ras Ali built four churches in Debre Tabor: Iyasus on the mountain to the southeast, Ennatitu Maryam and Legitu Maryam to the east, and Tegur Mikael to the north. A second palace was built for his mother, the Empress Menen Liben Amede, which was not as large as Ras Ali's.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Towns, pp. 271ff. Debre Tabor in El Museo Universal, 1868. Although he burnt the town in May 1853, following Ras Ali's defeat, Emperor Tewodros used Debre Tabor as his capital until his situation weakened so badly that he was forced to abandon the town (October 1867) for his stronghold on Maqdala.Sven Rubenson, King of Kings: Tewodros of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1966), pp. 43,82 The Emperor Yohannes IV often resided at Debre Tabor, and during his reign Heruy Giyorgis church was built. Here the Emperor met with General Gordon in October 1878, who was representing the Egyptian government, about Ethiopian demands for access to the Red Sea. It was also in Debre Tabor that Tekle Haymanot was crowned Negus of Gojjam in January 1881.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 9 May 2008) = 20th Century = thumb When the Bank of Ethiopia was created in 1931 it opened a branch office with two employees at Debre Tabor. During the Second Italian-Abyssinian War, Debre Tabor was occupied by unit which advanced from Bahir Dar on 28 April. During the occupation, a telegraph office was opened in the town and postal service restored. The Italians also constructed a road from Gondar via Debre Tabor to Dessie. The first mosque in Debre Tabor was constructed and eucalyptus planting extended. Despite these improvements, as early as August 1937, there were almost simultaneous but apparently uncoordinated attacks by arbegnoch on garrisons near Debre Tabor and near Bahir Dar. After several months of attacks, the British convinced Colonel Angelini to surrender the town 6 July 1941, allowing the British to advance towards the organized Italian resistance around Gondar under the command of Guglielmo Nasi, who by this point was the acting Viceroy and Governor-General of Italian East Africa. In 1958, Debre Tabor was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. Near the beginning of Derg rule, Debre Tabor was seized by a group of local landlords and their followers in opposition to the government September 1975, killing the provincial governor and expelling both a Chinese road-building team and missionaries of the Seventh Day Adventist Church who ran a local hospital. Government control was reestablished within a month. In late December 1989, Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) forces captured Debre Tabor, claiming that they killed or wounded more than 8,000 government troops. Around 20 January 1990, the Ethiopian News Agency announced that government forces had recaptured Debre Tabor. A few days later, the clandestine radio of the TPLF claimed a major victory in battles near Debre Tabor on 22–24 January 1990, claiming their soldiers had killed 3,914 government troops and captured 270. Although the town was retaken by government troops a few days later, the TPLF, announced the recapture of the town after a three-day battle in late February. About a year later, on 23 February 1990, the town was used as the jumping-off point for Operation Tewodros.Gebru Tareke notes that this military action \\"has come to be known as the second battle of Debre Tabor\\" despite the fact it \\"was not one big, decisive engagement but a series of skirmishes.\\" (The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa [New Haven: Yale University, 2009], p. 302) Demographics Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town has a total population of 55,596, of whom 27,644 are men and 27,952 women.

As a witness of the Hvar Rebellion in 1510, he was forced to flee to Trogir and Split due to his disparaging stance towards the lower rebel peasantry. He referred to them as \\"a bunch who have no thought\\". His early literary work became associated with the translations of Ovid's work (Croatian:\\"iz latinske odiće svukavši u našu harvacku priobukal\\"http://www.poezija-gedichte.com/Content-pid-218.html ). His writings are primarily recorded to be written in the Southern Čakavian dialect. He wrote drama (Robinja, the first secular-themed play in history of Croatian literature) and love poetry, under heavy influence of Francesco Petrarca, but the Croatian folklore is also included in his work. His admiration towards the feminine figure plays an important role in most of his poems. He was prone to self-criticism and had most of his work burned; the rest was salvaged and later published by his son Antonij.

Seiken Shukumine and Kunihiko Tosa among others worked together on establishing the Genseiryū organization. Seiken Shukumine switched to Taidō in 1962, but Kunihiko Tosa continued promoting Genseiryū in Japan as well as internationally. The Ōizumi Gakuen, Tokyo honbu dojo (supreme headquarters) was established in 1959 by Kunihiko Tosa. This dojo was named Butokukai and became the honbu dojo of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation that same year. In 1965 an additional dojo was built in Asaka, Saitama Prefecture. Although the Ōizumi Gakuen, Tokyo dojo still exists today, the supreme headquarters was moved from Ōizumi Gakuen, Tokyo to the new Asaka building in 1965. The Genseiryū organisation founded by Seiken Shukumine in 1953 was dissolved in late 1961 or early 1962. This is also partly the reason for Kunihiko Tosa to establish the new headquarters of the GKIF in Asaka (Japan) in 1965. This building is the official headquarters and honbu dojo of the GKIF.

The book contains pictures and detailed descriptions of the nine official advanced kata of Genseiryū (a total of 23 kata are taught and practiced in Genseiryū as part of the official curriculum).

Due to the costs of issuing two volumes at that time (early 1980s), Kunihiko Tosa decided to first issue the sequel considering, that a book containing the advanced kata was much more needed than a book about the basics. Kunihiko Tosa is planning to publish the first volume at a later date, thus completing the Genseiryū volumes 1 and 2.

He is generally acknowledged as the father of the modern round brilliant diamond cut. Many of his family have gone on to become noted diamond cutters, including his cousin Lazare Kaplan and his great nephew Gabi Tolkowsky. Tolkowsky, as part of his PhD topic at the University of London, systematically studied the grinding of diamonds.M. Tolkowsky, Research on the Abrading, Grinding or Poliching (sic) of Diamond, Thesis for the Degree of Doctor of Science (Engineering). Note that the thesis does not define the \\"Tolkowsky cut\\", contrary to what is claimed in some third-party references, such as his NY Times obituary. Around the same time, in his book Diamond Design, he published the specifications of what would later be called the American Standard (also known as the American Ideal Cut, Tolkowsky cut, and Tolkowsky Brilliant), which is the diamond-cutting benchmark in North America. It was derived from mathematical calculations that considered both brilliance and fire of the stone. Marcel Tolkowsky found that if a diamond was cut too deep or shallow then light would escape out the sides or bottom of the diamond resulting in a loss of brilliance (white light reflected up through the top of a diamond), fire (colored light reflected from within a diamond), and sparkle (combination of fire and brilliance).Diamond Design, A Study of the Reflection and Refraction of Light in a Diamond, 1919, M. Tolkowsky, The original model was intended to be a set of general guidelines; several aspects of a diamond's cut had not been accounted for or explored.

Life Dominiko was the most famous member of the Zlatarić noble family from Dubrovnik. Dinko was born in 1558 as the son of Žimun (Simone Slatarich) Zlatarić and Frana, daughter of a very wealthy nobleman by the name of Dominik Kladurobović. Dinko's brother Mihajlo Zlatarić served as a major-lieutenant in the forces of Juraj IV Zrinski, while history didn't remember his other brothers Cvijeto and Nikola. His only sister Kata died by 1597. Dominiko had one son the name Žimun Zlatarić. Learning Italian and Latin from a young age and writing his first poems when still a child, Dinko showed his talent early. Because of that, his father sent him to Padua, where after completing the famous Gymnasium, he entered the local University, where he learned rhetoric, philosophy and civil law. In 1579 he funded the printing of Italian poems of his close friend Caesar Simonetti and dedicated them to Cvijeta Zuzorić. He also studied Greek in Padua. Because of his knowledge and seriousness, the students elected him rector on 13 August 1579. For keeping the peace and order at the university, he was rewarded by the Republic of Venice with the title of \\"Golden Knight\\" (). In 1580, a plaque was put at the university in his honor and he returned to his home Dubrovnik. In 1587 he married Mara, the daughter of Pero Gomović. He shared his time between writing and running his estates in Cavtat and Konavle. He had friends among poets from Italy and Dubrovnik and admired the famous Renaissance beauty Cvijeta Zuzorić. Zlatarić wrote in Croatian and Italian – love poems, epitaphs and poetic meditations – but his greatest achievements are his translations. He held an important place in the historiography of Croatian literature, as he explicitly declared the language of his works under its Croatian name, \\"iz veće tuđijeh jezika u hrvacki izložene\\". Translations and poems He translated Tasso's manuscript of the pastoral drama Aminta in Padua in 1580. Later, dissatisfied with his translation, Zlatarić changed it, reworked it and adapted it to a Croatian setting, so it became Ljubmir. Then he published Electra, a Tragedy, and Ljubmir, a Pastoral History (a collection of his translations) and Love and Death of Pyramus and Thisbe, Translated into Croatian from Several Foreign Languages, in Venice in 1597. Zlatarić dedicated Electra to Juraj Zrinski, Ljubmir to Miho Matufić, and Pyramus and Thisbe to Cvijeta Zuzorić. His translations from Greek, Italian and Latin included 26 original pjesni u smrt od razlicijeh (poems about various people's deaths). After his death, his son Miho Zlatarić collected and published 137 lyrical poems of his father under the title Pjesni razlike (Various Poems). Most of them are love poems. Zlatarić was one of the most prolific epitaph writers of the Croatian Renaissance. The most effective one is his short epitaph to Dinko Ranjina (Nadgrobje Dinku Ranjini), followed by the epitaph to Bartolomeo Pescionio, the husband of Cvijeta Zuzorić. Zlatarić's poems are included in the Zadar Collection. Analysis He wrote under the influence of the first generation of Croatian Petrarchists and Italian Petrarchist schools. His strong links with the local Petrarchist tradition are shown by his rich style. His varied expression, mastery of verse and sound, put Zlatarić among the best Croatian lyrical poets of his time. Zlatarić is also renowned as the best translator of the Croatian Renaissance. He translated Tasso's Aminta literally, with the necessary changes forced by a different meter. The second version, Ljubmir, is even more refined, literary and pure, with a richer language. His translation of Sophocles' Electra reveals not only Zlatarić's education, taste and versifying ability, but also his poetic gift. Love of Pyramus and Thisbe is closer to a prose translation. In general, Zlatarić's translations can be considered independent poetic achievements, widening the range of Croatian Renaissance literature.

Its juxtaposition of science and superstition is a frequent theme in Kneale's work; in particular, his 1952 radio play You Must Listen, about a haunted telephone line, is a notable antecedent of The Stone Tape. The play was also inspired by a visit Kneale had paid to the BBC's research and development department, which was then located in an old Victorian house in Kingswood, Surrey. Critically acclaimed at time of broadcast, it remains well regarded to this day as one of Nigel Kneale's best and most terrifying plays. Since its broadcast, the hypothesis of residual haunting – that ghosts are recordings of past events made by the natural environment – has come to be known as the \\"Stone Tape Theory\\". Plot summary Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the selfish and petulant head of a research team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment of one of the rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries. Curious, the researchers explore the room and hear the sounds of a woman running followed by a gut-wrenching scream. Jill Greeley (Jane Asher), an emotionally sensitive computer programmer, has a vision of a woman running up the steps in the room and falling, apparently to her death. Inquiring of old records, Collinson finds records of a young maid who had died in the room in 1890 and that an unsuccessful exorcism had previously been performed on the property. Brock and Jill briefly meet with a local Vicar, who is also an archivist, but he fails to turn up records of the exorcism. Brock hypothesises that it is not a ghost, but that somehow the stone in the room has preserved an image of the girl's death—this \\"stone tape\\" may be the new recording medium they have been seeking. Their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of the phenomena the team experience, and different team members experience different phenomena: most are able to hear sounds, Jill can also see images, but another member of the team experiences no sensory input. Jill hypothesises that the \\"tape\\" does not produce actual sound or light, but instead interfaces with the human nervous system during playback to create the sensory impression of sound and vision, and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others. She surmises that the recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion, like a kind of telepathy. Excited by the possibilities presented by a recording medium which uses a person's own senses as the means of recording and playback, Brock and his team move into the room. They bombard it with their technology, hoping to find the secret of the \\"stone tape\\" and have it play on demand. Brock is certain that the secret is connected to the walls, but he fails to develop a predictable method of triggering. Under mounting pressure to succeed, Brock uses every available instrumentation, only to be told, by Jill, that the presence she had felt earlier was now gone, apparently meaning that the \\"tape\\" has been erased. Brock's failures are compounded when his superiors signal their lost confidence in him, requiring him to share Taskerlands with a rival research team working on a new washing machine. Embittered, Brock no longer wants anything to do with the stone tape. He disregards Jill's insistence that there is still more to learn about the room and her mounting concerns that it is dangerous to stop their research. As Brock directs the team to resume its past projects, the Vicar reappears claiming to have found records of the unsuccessful exorcism, not in 1892, but much earlier, in 1760, before the house even stood. Realizing that the phenomenon occurring in the room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research. Returning to the room one last time, Jill's senses are besieged by a powerful, malevolent presence from the much-degraded older recording. Like the maid before her, she dies while frantically trying to escape it. During an inquest, Brock tries to save face by denouncing Jill as having been mentally unstable. Afterwards he orders that all of Jill's research be destroyed without reviewing it. The \\"haunted\\" room has been declared of historical importance by a preservation society, prohibiting development, destruction, or commercial use. He makes a final visit to the room and discovers to his horror that the stone tape has made a new, crystal-clear recording—that of Jill screaming his name as she dies. Background Nigel Kneale was a Manx television playwright who had first come to prominence in the 1950s thanks to his three Quatermass serials and his controversial adaptation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, all of which were produced by the BBC. Going freelance in the nineteen-sixties, Kneale had produced scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films. In the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC, writing such plays as The Year of the Sex Olympics, Wine of India and, for the anthology series Out of the Unknown, The Chopper.Murray, Into the Unknown, passim. In the middle of 1972, Christopher Morahan, who was Head of Drama at BBC2 and who had directed Kneale's 1963 play The Road and the 1965 remake of Kneale's adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four, approached Kneale asking him to write a play to be broadcast over the Christmas period. Accepting the commission, Kneale quickly decided that, in keeping with Christmas tradition, he would write a ghost story, but with a difference – ancient spirits would come into collision with modern science. The concept of mixing the supernatural with high technology had long been a feature of Kneale's work – most notably, his 1952 radio play You Must Listen, which concerned a telecommunications engineer who discovers that a telephone line has somehow preserved the final conversation between a woman and her lover before her suicide, was an important antecedent of The Stone Tape.Pixley, Fantasy Flashback – The Stone Tape, p. 57. The science and supernatural theme is also present in Kneale's Quatermass and the Pit which, in addition, shares similar elements with The Stone Tape such as an abandoned house with a reputation for hauntings; the collection of documentary evidence of the haunting (also a trademark of M. R. James, a writer much admired by Kneale)Kneale & Newman, The Stone Tape DVD Commentary. and the sensitivity of certain characters to the supernatural.Abery, The Stone Tape, p. 22. In addition, the relationship between the scientists and the local villagers echoes that seen in Quatermass II.Abery, The Stone Tape, p. 23. For the research facility at \\"Taskerlands\\", Kneale was influenced by a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, the researchers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal of the members of the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape. Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, \\"The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, which is a very clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research ... They were nice chaps – and so we got some very nice chaps for the TV version\\".Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 115. Kneale delivered his script, initially titled Breakthrough and later renamed The Stone Tape, in September 1972. Because of its subject matter, it was felt that the play would be best handled as an instalment of Dead of Night, a supernatural anthology series produced by Innes Lloyd. In the end, The Stone Tape was broadcast as a standalone programme but production was handled by the Dead of Night team under Lloyd. Selected as director was Hungarian Peter Sasdy whose credits included adaptations of The Caves of Steel and Wuthering Heights for the BBC and Taste the Blood of Dracula and Hands of the Ripper for Hammer. Cast as Peter Brock was Michael Bryant, who had starred in the BBC's 1970 adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre's Roads to Freedom and had a reputation for playing \\"bad boy\\" roles.Pixley Fantasy Flasback – The Stone Tape, p. 58. Jane Asher, playing Jill Greeley, had, as a child, appeared in Hammer's The Quatermass Xperiment, the film adaptation of Kneale's BBC serial The Quatermass Experiment. Iain Cuthberston, playing Roy Collinson, was well known for his role in Budgie and would go to become the star of Sutherland's Law while Michael Bates, cast as Eddie Holmes, had appeared in Patton and would later become known for his roles in the sitcoms Last of the Summer Wine and It Ain't Half Hot Mum. Recording of The Stone Tape began on 15 November 1972 with the exterior scenes of the house, \\"Taskerlands\\". These were shot at Horsley Towers, East Horsley in Surrey. This was once owned by Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and sponsor of computer pioneer Charles Babbage. Production then moved to BBC Television Centre between 20 November 1972 and 22 November 1972. Not all scenes were recorded in time and a remount was required on 4 December 1972. Michael Bates was not available on this day and his lines had to be redistributed among the other cast members. Incidental music and sound effects were provided by Desmond Briscoe of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and these proved significant in setting the mood of the play – sections were later used in a BBC educational programme on the effectiveness of incidental music. The Stone Tape aired on 25 December 1972 on BBC2 to an audience of 2.6 million. The Evening Standard praised the play, describing it as \\"one of the best plays of the genre ever written. Its virtues aren't just the main spine of the story, but the way the characters shift, as in real life, the bitter comic conflict between pure and impure science\\".Abery, The Stone Tape p. 24. Viewers were similarly impressed: a panel questioned for an audience report praised The Stone Tape as \\"thoroughly entertaining\\" and \\"both gripping and spine- chilling\\". The Stone Tape was one of the last plays Nigel Kneale wrote for the BBC. He had become increasingly disenchanted with the organisation, mainly as a result of the rejection of several scripts such as Cracks, a proposed Play for Today, and a fourth Quatermass serial.Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 117-122. Moving to Independent Television, he wrote and created series such as Beasts and Kinvig and succeeded in getting his rejected Quatermass scripts produced in 1979.Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 123-148. He died in 2006. The script of The Stone Tape was published, along with the scripts of The Road and The Year of the Sex Olympics in 1976 by Ferret Fantasy under the title The Year of the Sex Olympics and Other TV Plays. Cultural significance One of the first to promulgate the hypothesis of residual haunting, that ghosts may be recordings of past events made by the physical environment, was T. C. Lethbridge in books such as Ghost and Ghoul, written in 1961.Green, Nigel Kneale/Peter Sasdy: The Stone Tape. Since the broadcast of the play, this hypothesis has come to be known as the \\"Stone Tape Theory\\" by parapsychological researchers.Wood, Stone Tape Theory: An Explanation. The Stone Tape was a significant influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which a group of scientists investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered in the basement of a church.Newman, The Stone Tape – DVD sleeve notes. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym \\"Martin Quatermass\\", and included a reference to \\"Kneale University\\".Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 160. This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, \\"For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it. It sounds pretty bad. With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [a reference to Halloween III for which Kneale wrote an early draft] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust\\".Brosnan, The Primal Screen, p. 283. The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial \\"Ghost Zone\\", a character refers explicitly to the \\"Stone Tape theory\\" as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is \\"replaying\\" scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama. The Stone Tape remains well- regarded to this day. Roger Fulton, writing in The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, calls it \\"arguably the most creepy drama ever seen on television\\".Fulton, The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, p. 670. The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as \\"one of the masterpieces of genre television, an authentic alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics\\". Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape \\"strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it just has this impact on you, rather like being in the room itself. Extraordinary piece of work\\".Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 117. Writer Grant Morrison recalled The Stone Tape as \\"really creepy and very memorable. Just brilliant images. That scared the hell out of me!\\". Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that \\"The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his (Nigel Kneale's) finest single work in the genre\\".Angelini, The Stone Tape (1972). Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as \\"one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today\\".Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 126. A BBC radio play was produced in 2015 written by Matthew Graham and Peter Strickland. It features a cameo from Jane Asher.

As First Vice President of Domingo Díaz Arosemena he became President of Panama on July 28, 1949 and served until November 20, 1949, when he was forcibly ousted by police chief José (\\"Chichi\\") Remón. He was succeeded by Díaz Arosemena's Second Vice President, Roberto Chiari. He belonged to the Liberal Party. Early life Chanis earned his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1917, practicing medicine in both Panama and Scotland. Chanis published a paper in the American Urological Association's Journal of Urology in 1942 titled \\"Some Aspects of Hermaphroditism: Report of a Case of Female Pseudohermaphroditism\\" in 1942. He also served as General Council of Panama in Liverpool and London, and as Treasury Minister. First Vice-President National police forces, under the command of Remón, were called in ostensibly to maintain the monitor the elections, though in reality their presence was intended to sway the voting to Diaz Arosemena, the preferred candidate of the United States. Chanis ran as the First Vice-Presidential candidate with Díaz Arosemena. Though Arias appeared to have 1,500 more votes than Díaz Arosemena following the May 9 election, the Panamanian national elections jury declared Díaz Arosemena the winner on August 6 by a margin of approximately 2,400 votes. Arias fled to Costa Rica following the decision. Chanis assumed the duties of First Vice=President on October 1, 1948. President Chanis was sworn in as acting chief executive on July 28, 1949, when then president Domingo Diaz Arosemena took a six-month leave for health reasons. Chanis became president following Arosemena's death on August 23, 1949. 1949 Coup d'état Chanis's presidency came to an end on November 20, 1949. Panamanian Police Chief José Remón led a coup d'état in response to Chanis's refusal to overturn a Panama Supreme Court decision invalidating a contract between an abattoir that was \\"part of Remón's business empire\\" and several powerful Panamanian families. Chanis had asked for Remón's resignation previously, and, when Remón refused, tendered his own resignation in protest. Whether this resignation was voluntary or forced by Remón is unclear, although it would appear that foreign diplomatic pressure, not wanting to see full out bloodshed, encouraged the resignation. Chanis was replaced by Second Vice-President, and Remón's cousin, Roberto Chiari. Coup Aftermath Shortly after his resignation, Chanis had a change of heart and withdrew his resignation, claiming it came under duress, and delivered a \\"blistering attack\\" on Remón before the General Assembly. The Assembly, at the behest of former president Harmodio Arias, supported Chanis, and prepared for confrontation with the national police. Chiari forced his hand, however, and demanded the Panama Supreme Court rule on who, he or Chanis, was the constitutional president; the Supreme Court came back in favor of Chanis by a 4-1 vote. This misstep, and his desire to avoid violence, led Remón to replace him with his former \\"bitter political enemy\\" Arnulfo Arias, with the approval of the Panama Congress. To legitimize the presidency, the national election jury, who had in 1948 ruled against Arias, \\" found pro-Arias votes it had been unable to find in weeks after the 1948 balloting\\".

Career  In the late-1980s, he played in many New York hardcore bands, most notably Youth of Today and Gorilla Biscuits, where he was also the songwriter and lyricist. After Gorilla Biscuits broke up, he formed the short-lived Moondog. In October 2006, the band's self-titled EP was officially released for the first time ever on Anthology Recordings. It was previously available only as a bootleg 7\\" record. Moondog would transition into the more metal-oriented post-hardcore band Quicksand. He also collaborated with his former Gorilla Biscuits bandmates in the melodic hardcore band CIV, writing much of their first LP and one song on their follow-up LP despite not actually playing on the record. He went on to start World's Fastest Car, a relatively short-lived project. The band recorded a demo and an EP, neither of which have been officially released. The EP was supposed to be released by Revelation Records, but that never came to fruition due to their breakup. Later, he helped create the melodic indie rock-styled band Rival Schools. After Rival Schools' dissolution, he went on to form Walter and the Motorcycles, who recorded but never released a self-titled LP and played a few shows but quickly broke up. Walking Concert, his next project, was heavily influenced by classic British acts such as Elvis Costello, The Kinks, Syd Barrett, David Bowie and The Smiths. In addition to a new solo acoustic LP scheduled for release in 2008, Schreifels reformed Rival Schools in June 2008 with plans to release a new album. In October 2009, he appeared on \\"Memoria : A Tribute to the Alternative 90s\\" (Yr Letter Records) with \\"When You Sleep\\", a My Bloody Valentine cover. In 2014, Schreifels joined a blues rock band that would come to be known as Dead Heavens. On November 16, 2010, Rival Schools released the deluxe single for \\"Shot After Shot\\" on iTunes from the forthcoming record Pedals, which was released in March 2011.http://www.myspace.com/rivalschoolsunitedbyfate As a producer, he has worked with such hardcore-related bands as Hot Water Music, Sinch , The First Step and Title Fight. He produced the EP Deer Strutter, the first from the UK band Cars As Weapons, and a full length titled Days Above Ground from Australian post-hardcore band, Paper Arms. He is also part owner of the record label Some Records. He produced hardcore/pop punk act Title Fight's first full length titled Shed. = Solo = Walter Schreifels, Groezrock 2013 On May 4, 2010, Schreifels released his first solo album, An Open Letter to the Scene on Big Scary Monsters Recording Company (UK), Academy Fight Song (U.S.), Dine Alone Records (Canada) and Arctic Rodeo (Europe). In support of the album release, Schreifels announced a 12-date UK tour. The album features 10 tracks on CD and 11 on vinyl, including covers of songs by Agnostic Front, CIV, and My Bloody Valentine (vinyl version only). The CIV song he covered, \\"Don't Gotta Prove It\\", was written by Schreifels. In an interview with Alter The Press!, Schreifels confirmed his follow-up solo record was 85% complete and would be titled Jesus Is My Favorite Beatle.

Biography Emilie Smith grew up in the archipelago of Bohuslän. Her father, Rutger Smith, was a retired sea captain who had settled down as a small merchant, and she often accompanied him on the voyages he made along the coast. She thus came in frequent contact with the seafaring folk, fishermen, and smugglers who were to populate her later stories. At the age of twenty, she married a local physician, Axel Flygare, and went with him to live in the province of Småland. She was widowed in 1833, returned to her old home, and decided to devote herself to literature. She moved to Stockholm some years later, and in 1841 she married a lawyer, publicist and poet of that city, Johan Gabriel Carlén (1814–1875). Her house became a meeting place for Stockholm men of letters, and for the next twelve years she produced one or two novels annually. The premature death of her son Edvard Flygare (1829–1853), who had already published three books, showing great promise, was followed by six years of silence, after which she resumed her writing until 1884. She founded charitable endowments in aid of students and of teachers, and of fishermen and their widows. She is best known by the hyphenated name Flygare-Carlén. Her daughter, Rosa Carlén (1836–1883), was also a popular novelist. Publications Her first novel, Valdemar Klein, was published in 1838. In that and several later novels, such as Rosen på Tistelön (1842; Eng. trans. The Rose of Tistelön, 1842), Pål Värning, Enslingen på Johannisskäret (1846; Eng. trans. The Hermit, 4 vols., 1853), Jungfrutornet, and Ett köpmanshus i skärgården (1859; The Merchant's House on the Cliffs), she wrote about life in the archipelago and the sea, while the stories of novels such as Fosterbröderna, Fideikommisset, Ett år, En nyckfull kvinna, Kamrer Lassman, and Vindskuporna take place in the middle or upper classes. Her novels were collected into 31 volumes (Stockholm, 1869–1875). In 1878, she published an autobiography, Minnen af svenskt författarlif 1840–1860 (Reminiscences of Swedish Literary Life). She was translated into Danish, Norwegian, German, Russian, French, English, Italian, Dutch, Hungarian and Czech, and was the most widely read Swedish novelist of her time. In 2007, Valancourt Books released a new scholarly English edition of The Magic Goblet (Kyrkoinvigningen i Hammarby, 1841), edited by Amy H. Sturgis.

He is the only child of Frances Teresa Bernadette McLaren and Lawrence Omand McLaren, from Canada. McLaren's early family life was working-class until his father, a Second World War war veteran with the Royal Canadian Engineers, returned from battle in Europe and began work as a television salesman, eventually rising to the rank of General Manager of Phillips Electronics, Eastern Canada. McLaren's mother was a homemaker before working as telephone operator. McLaren used to read voraciously in literature, philosophy, poetry, social theory, and literary and art criticism, was making creative 35 mm movies at 16, and dreamt of being an artist or film director. McLaren's father had one sister, Bonnie, who married Terry Goddard, a Second World War Royal Airforce pilot who is credited with helping to sink the German battleship, Bismark. McLaren's mother had four sisters and two brothers. McLaren compensated for being an only child by spending time with his many cousins, and with engaging in creative writing. McLaren's first writing award was during middle school where he won top writing honours by producing a science fiction story. At 19, McLaren hitchhiked throughout the US, met with Black Panthers in Oakland, lived in San Francisco and Los Angeles where he participated in anti–Vietnam War protests, met with Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg and began writing poetry and short stories. His first commercial publication was about his great Aunt, Irma Wright, who won the competition of the world's fastest typist in 1928. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English literature at University of Waterloo in 1973 (specializing in Elizabethan drama), attended Toronto Teachers College and went on to earn a Bachelor of Education at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Education, a Masters of Education at Brock University’s College of Education, and a PhD at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto (where he worked with the late Richard Courtney, a leading international authority in children's drama). McLaren taught elementary and middle school from 1974-1979. Most of that time was spent teaching in Canada's largest public housing complex located in Toronto's Jane- Finch Corridor. Cries from the Corridor, McLaren's book about his teaching experiences, made the Canadian bestseller list and was one of top ten bestselling books in Canada in 1980 (Maclean's magazine, the Toronto Star), initiating a country-wide debate on inner-city schools. (Later McLaren would harshly criticize this book and go on to transform it into the highly acclaimed pedagogical text, Life in Schools.)Peter McLaren, revolutionary activist and professors of critical pedagogy After earning his doctorate in 1983, he served as Special Lecturer in Education at Brock University where, as a one-year sabbatical replacement, he specialized in inner city education and language arts. After the Dean did not follow through on his promised extension of McLaren's contract, McLaren decided to pursue an academic appointment in the United States. However, he remains on good terms with faculty at Brock University, with whom he remains in a relationship of solidarity and friendship. McLaren left Canada in 1985 to teach at Miami University's School of Education and Allied Professions where he spent eight years working with colleague Henry Giroux during a time when the epistemology known as critical pedagogy was gaining traction in North American schools of education. McLaren also served as Director of the Center for Education and Cultural Studies, and held the title of Renowned Scholar-in-Residence at Miami University before being recruited by the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California, Los Angeles, in 1993. In 2013, McLaren was appointed Distinguished Fellow in Critical Studies at Chapman University, Orange, California. In 2019, The Griffith Journal of Law and Human Dignity, affiliated with the top-ranked law school in Australia, published an extensive interview with McLaren.https://griffithlawjournal.org/index.php/gjlhd/article/view/1173/1035 And the same year the OC Weekly featured commentary on two articles featured by McLaren on the fight against fascism in the United Stateshttps://ocweekly.com/take-a-wild-ride-into-chapman-professor-peter- mclarens-mind/, https://ocweekly.com/chapman-professor-mclaren-reflects-on- fascism-in-orange-county/, and McLaren published a graphic novel of his life with an artist Miles Wilson. Career =First phase, 1980–1993= The theoretical orientations of the first ten years of McLaren's research and writing can be traced to his early undergraduate work in Elizabethan drama, theater arts, and from there to his graduate studies in symbolic anthropology, critical ethnography and social semiotics. As a young man, McLaren had always admired the life and work of William Morris author, poet, artist and craftsman, printer and calligrapher, formidable socialist and activist, businessman and private individual. At the time that he enrolled in doctoral studies at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (Institut d'Etudes Pedagogiques de L'Ontario), Victor Turner, the world-renowned symbolic anthropologist, was conducting path breaking transdisciplinary work at the University of Virginia, bringing dramaturgical theory and anthropology into close collaboration, particularly as this applied to the study of ritual. McLaren soon became a scholar of Turner's work. After auditing a course at the Toronto Semiotics Institute taught by philosopher Michel Foucault, and another by Umberto Eco, McLaren began to develop a transdisciplinary approach to the study of ritual. He found a rich transdisciplinary milieu in which to conduct his studies at Massey College, University of Toronto. Modeled after Balliol College, Oxford University, England, Massey College facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration among high achieving graduate students from various departments on campus. Looking back at his educational experiences at Massey, it is not surprising that the work of performance theorists, political economists, anthropologists, dramaturgical theorists, literary critics, and symbolic interactionists informed the theoretical basis of his first major scholarly publication, Schooling as a Ritual Performance Towards a Political Economy of Educational Symbols and Gestures (first edition, Routledge, 1986; revised editions, 1994, 1997) which was based on his PhD dissertation. McLaren's early work from 1984 to 1994 spanned diverse intellectual and empirical terrains. He remained steadfast in his interest in the contemporary themes of the Frankfurt School: social psychology in the context of a lack of revolutionary social protest in Europe and the United States; a critique of positivism and science; developing a critical theory of art and representation; an interrogation of the mass media and mass culture; investigating the production of desire and identity; and the globalization of capitalism and forms of integration in neoliberal societies. In other words, when viewed against the major themes of the Frankfurt School, there was a fundamental coherence to his work as a whole. Further, each of McLaren's scholarly projects attempted to explore the construction of identity in school contexts within a neo-liberal society. This meant engaging in numerous critical projects: exploring the debilitating effects of logical positivism in the social sciences and the assault on critical theory and critical ethnography; exploring the increasing colonization of the lifeworld by the mass media and developing a critical pedagogy of media literacy and a political aesthetics of pedagogical experience; analyzing the decline of critical rationality in postmodern societies and the development of critical literacies; advancing in specific pedagogical terms the struggle to redefine the meaning of liberation and empowerment in an age of despair and cynicism; investigating the politics of post-liberal societies with specific reference to the practices of cultural racism and sexism, and developing an analysis of the production, distribution, consumption, and exchange of cultural objects in schools and larger social sites with an emphasis on the social construction of subjectivity. In this early period, McLaren's research emphasized the development of a critical emancipatory consciousness, self-conscious reason, and the centrality of nonidentity thinking towards a non essentialist view of revolutionary consciousness grounded in a theory of intersubjective understanding through language. Practically, his work attempted to create an oppositional cultural politics that enabled teachers and students to analyze how the dominant and negotiated meanings that inform classroom texts were produced and to uncover the ideological and political meanings that circulated within them. McLaren attempted through critical reading strategies to illuminate the dominant pedagogical codes of teachers as well as the normative codes within classroom cultures of students. His purpose was to create alternative readings as well as new pedagogical practices. In this sense, critical pedagogy, as McLaren was formulating it, attempted to re engage a social world that operates under the assumption of its collective autonomy and so remains resistant to human intervention. In his early work, McLaren engaged four main strands in educational theory and studies: critical ethnography, critical pedagogy, curriculum studies and critical multiculturalism. =Second phase, 1994–present= McLaren work during the past several decades is not so much a break from his early work, as an extension of it. A discernible shift occurred in the sense that he now focuses more on a critique of political economy. But his early work also included a critique of capitalism, except during that time McLaren operated from primarily a Weberian understanding of class and was concerned at that time with the politics of consumption and lifestyle/identity. McLaren's new turn saw him focus on the social relations of production and its relation to the production of subjectivity and protagonist agency. Between 1994 up to the present, McLaren's work is less directed at the classroom per se, and more focused on issues such as a critique of political economy, cultural contact and racial identity, anti- racist/multicultural education, the politics of white supremacy, resistance and popular culture; the formation of subjectivity, the coloniality of power and decolonial education; revolutionary critical pedagogy informed by a Marxist humanist analysis and liberation theology. During this time McLaren began spending time in Latin America – working with Chavistas in Venezuela and with labor and union leaders in Mexico and Colombia and becoming more interested in Marxist critique of political economy. McLaren came to believe that postmodern theory could be quite a reactionary approach in so far as it failed to challenge with the verve and sustained effort that is demanded of the times the social relations of capitalist production and reproduction. While McLaren adopted the term, critical postmodernism, or resistance postmodernism, to describe his work up until the late 1990s, he recognized that he needed to engage the work of Karl Marx and Marxist thinkers. The more McLaren began engaging in the work of Marx, and meeting social activists driven by Marxist anti-imperialist projects throughout the Americas, he no longer believed that the work on \\"radical democracy\\" convincingly demonstrated that it was superior to the Marxist problematic. It appeared to McLaren that, in the main, such work had despairingly capitulated to the inevitability of the rule of capital and the regime of the commodity. That work, along with much of the work in post-colonialist criticism, appeared to McLaren as too detached from historical specificities and basic determinations. McLaren believed that Marxist critique more adequately addressed the differentiated totalities of contemporary society and their historical imbrications in the world system of global capitalism. Rather than employ the term critical pedagogy, McLaren now uses the term that the British educator Paula Allman has christened revolutionary critical pedagogy. McLaren describes his current work as Marxist humanist, a term developed by Raya Dunayevskaya, who once served as Trotsky's secretary in Mexico and who developed the tradition of Marxist humanism in the US. McLaren's work constitutes counterpoint to the way social justice is used in progressive education by inviting students to examine critically the epistemological and axiological dimensions of democracy in the light of a Marxist critique of political economy and the coloniality of power (a term developed by Anibal Quijano). McLaren's work today comprises poetry, reflections on his activist work in Venezuela, Mexico, and other countries, contributions to critical theory, and Marxist analysis as applied to current educational policy and reform initiatives. =McLaren's critical pedagogy= McLaren's work has broken new ground in education. He is considered one of the architects of critical pedagogy, having been influenced early in his career by Paulo Freire and Henry Giroux. He also has been credited with laying the groundwork for performance studies in education with the publication of his book, Schooling as a Ritual Performance. The Peter McLaren Upstander Lecture was recently announced as part of the Annual International Critical Research in Applied Theater Symposium, Auckland, New Zealand. The lecture is to be presented each year by a graduate student in education from the School of Critical Studies in Education at the University of Auckland. Currently McLaren is known as one of the leading exponents of revolutionary critical pedagogy, an approach to everyday life influenced by Marxist humanist philosophy, also known as a “philosophy of praxis.” McLaren's work is controversial for its uncompromising politics of class struggle. McLaren is also a gifted orator and social activist, and his academic writing has been both praised and criticized for its unique blend of poetry and literary tropes and cutting-edge theoretical analysis. At least one documentary is in the planning about McLaren's life. McLaren approaches critical pedagogy as a praxiological effort to develop a politics of everyday life in a number of ways. First, it situates its critical analyses within the realms of popular culture. Secondly, it pays close theoretical attention to the ways in which everyday discourses and social practices both constitute and reinforce relations of power as well as serve as sites for struggle, resistance, and transformation. Thirdly, critical pedagogy as developed by McLaren attempts to seize opportunities to make links between new social movements and the networks of power associated with \\"school life\\". It does this by attempting to link the micropolitical (everyday lives of teachers and students) with the macropolitical (larger economic, cultural, social, and institutional structures). The school building (in La Escuela Normal Superior de Neiva) named after Peter McLaren in Neiva, Colombia Critical pedagogy, as McLaren develops it, seeks to analyze the possibilities for the resistance and transformation of social life, both individual and collective, personal and macropolitical. It engages in such an analysis by attempting to understand how wider relations of power are played out in the agential spaces of classroom and community life but also by attempting to investigate how wider structures of mediation at the level of the economy are able to \\"take root\\" in the everyday lives of students and teachers who operate at the level of common sense actions. This means constantly reflecting on the cultural construction of the identities of teachers, students, researchers and also connecting such critical reflection to a wider terrain of political action and class struggle. McLaren takes critical pedagogy beyond a discursive politics that sees politics as merely a text to be deconstructed and interpreted. Instead, McLaren approaches cultural politics as a terrain that operationalizes the textuality of political life by linking textuality to materiality. That is, McLaren seeks to make connections between the texts that we read (cultural artifacts) and those that read us (the realm of language and discursive structures in general) in light of current modes and social relations of production and the political consequences that these connections bring about in our pedagogies, curricula, and policies. Since 1994, McLaren revised and extended some of his earlier insights in Schooling as a Ritual Performance, and Life in Schools, and other works, through an engagement with Marx and leading Marxist philosophers and theorists. While anti-capitalist struggle and Marxist analysis has an indistinct and relatively undigested place in the field of educational theory, there is some movement towards Marx in the social sciences here in North America. Marx is being revisited by social scientists of all disciplinary shapes and sizes – even, and perhaps most especially and urgently today, when capitalism is in a state of severe crisis. While hardly on their way to becoming entrenched and pervasive, Marx's ideas are taking their significance most strikingly from the particular and varied contexts in which his ideas are being engaged. Thank to McLaren's work, Marx's ideas are gaining traction in education. In McLaren's post-1994 phase, Marxist theory has provided McLaren with an approach to praxis that is fundamentally necessary to better contextualize changes in the socio-political and economic sphere as it relates to education. Through McLaren's current reengagement with Marx, and the tradition of historical materialism, McLaren supports the work of colleagues whose work is paving the way for new generations of educationalists to encounter Marx. Marx is being reevaluated on numerous fronts today: sociology, political science, philosophy, economics, ethics, history, and the like.Career section is based on the following sources: ; ; ; ; .

Žižek comments McLaren's book Che Guevara, Paulo Freire and the Pedagogy of Revolution as follows: \\"Che Guevara is usually perceived as a Romantic model whom we should admire, while pursuing our daily business as usual – the most perverse defense against what Che stood for. What McLaren's fascinating book demonstrates is that, on the contrary, Che is a model for our times, a figure we should imitate in our struggle against neoliberal global capitalism.\\" Allman notes that the book is \\"brilliant blend of passion, commitment, and critical analysis and insight. ... It is also one of the most important books on critical education, and thus also education and social justice, to have been written in the twentieth century.\\"https://awestruckwanderer.wordpress.com/category/communism/ Recent developments =Honorary doctorates= Peter McLaren was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Lapland, Finland, in 2004 and by Universidad del Salvador, Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2010 and by the Universidad Nacional de Chilecito in La Rioja, Argentina.http://www.elindependiente.com.ar/pagina.php?id=100525 He also received the Amigo Honorifica de la Comunidad Universitaria de esta Institucion by La Universidad Pedagogica Nacional, Unidad 141, Guadalajara, Mexico. =La Fundacion McLaren de Pedagogía Critica= In 2005, a group of scholars and activists in Northern Mexico established La Fundacion McLaren de Pedagogía Critica to develop a knowledge of McLaren's work throughout Mexico and to promote projects in critical pedagogy and popular education.

It is the first book in French's Dublin Murder Squad series. The novel won several awards such as the 2008 Edgar Award for Best First Novel by an American Author, the 2008 Barry Award for Best First Novel, the 2008 Macavity Award for Best First Mystery Novel, and the 2008 Anthony Award for Best First Novel. In the Woods and The Likeness, the second book of the Dublin Murder Squad series, are the inspiration for the BBC and Starz's 2019 Dublin Murders, an eight-episode series. Plot Twenty-two years prior to the novel's events, twelve year-old Adam and his two best friends failed to come home after playing in the familiar woods bordering their Irish housing estate. The Gardaí find Adam shivering, clawing the bark of a nearby tree, with blood in his shoes and slash marks on his back. His friends are never found. He is unable to say what happened to them. Now using his middle name, Rob, he is a detective with the Murder Squad. His amnesia holds to the present day. The plot of the novel circles around the murder of a twelve-year-old girl, Katy Devlin, whose case Rob and his partner Cassie Maddox are assigned to investigate. The body is found in the same woods where Rob's friends disappeared, at an archaeological dig site; and the coincidence is enough to make Rob nervous, though he insists to his partner that he is fine. Cassie and Rob have been partners for a few years and get along famously, teasing one another and completing one another's thoughts. Cassie is one of the few people who knows the truth about Rob's past. There are many rumours that they are romantically involved, though both of them scoff at the idea, despite the fact that they live almost like a married couple, spending a lot of time at Cassie's cooking dinner for one another, drinking wine, and having Rob crash on Cassie's couch across the room. Katy's murder takes the pair along many lines of investigation. Her death might be related to her father's protests against the new motorway meant to go straight through the dig site, or one of the students on the dig might have attacked her. She might have been abused by her father or someone else (her mother, twin sister, or older sister) in the family. She might have been previously poisoned over time. Or it might be related to the disappearance of Rob's friends, as a hair clip that one of his friends was wearing that day appeared near the crime scene. These possibilities are investigated, but the detectives come up frustratingly empty-handed at every turn. The case messes with Rob's psyche as he tries to remember details about the two previous disappearances in case it would help. He tries spending the night in the woods, but freaks out and calls Cassie to pick him up. He's afraid to sleep again, thinking that he'll just have nightmares, so Cassie allows him into her bed, where they make love. Rob feels immensely awkward after and can't go back to their normal jokey-insult ways, but he also feels that he can't start a relationship with her. Their partnership deteriorates just as they start to uncover new leads in the case, and they are unable to discuss the case and get along the way they used to. Rob goes back to the dig site alone, where all the students are frantically digging before the site is shut down for the construction of the motorway. He comes to a realisation and calls in the forensics team again, who discover the location of the murder in a shed to which only three people have the key. After some heavy interrogation, one of the suspects confesses, though his motive is far from clear. It becomes clearer when the suspect contends that he had been dating Katy's older sister, Rosalind. When questioned by Cassie, Rosalind denies it and any involvement in Katy's death, but she also makes a comment that Cassie is obviously sleeping with Rob. Cassie takes it in stride; but, after the interrogation, she has an idea of how to get a confession out of Rosalind: Go to her and admit sleeping with Rob and promise to keep her updated on the case if she promises not to tell. Rosalind’s psychopathic tendencies get the better of her; and, once she knows that she has Cassie in her debt, she brags about the whole thing and how she got the murderer to come up with the idea by telling him that all three girls were being sexually abused by their father, but that Katy liked it and was therefore their father’s favourite. Rosalind also told him that Katy told their father lies to make him beat them and would watch and laugh and that, if Katy were gone, then they would be happy. She also admitted to Cassie that Katy was strong-willed and wouldn’t always do as Rosalind told her, so she had poisoned her to make her sick. After this confession, recorded on a wire, Cassie arrests her and takes her in; but, because Rosalind was a few months from turning 18 (though she had told Rob previously that she was already 18), the confession is invalid. She is released with a smug smile. The Murder Squad Superintendent has learned that Rob is actually Adam Ryan and transfers him to menial desk work in the General Unit. He never returns to the Murder Squad. Cassie starts dating another member of the squad and eventually becomes engaged. Rob is heartbroken and calls her, but it's too late. He goes to the dig site to see the motorway construction has begun and thinks that he'll never regain his lost memories of that night. Reception Thomas Gaughan of Booklist gave In the Woods a starred review and hailed it as “...a superior novel about cops, murder, memory, relationships, and modern Ireland. The characters of Ryan and Maddox, as well as a handful of others, are vividly developed... Equally striking is the picture of contemporary Ireland, booming economically and fixated on the shabbiest aspects of American popular culture. An outstanding debut and a series to watch for procedural fans.\\" Publishers Weekly praised author French, saying she “... expertly walks the line between police procedural and psychological thriller in her debut\\" and that \\"Ryan and Maddox are empathetic and flawed heroes, whose partnership and friendship elevate the narrative beyond a gory tale of murdered children and repressed childhood trauma.\\" Kirkus Reviews said of the novel, \\"When not lengthily bogged down in angst, a readable, non-formulaic police procedural with a twist. It's ultimately the confession of a damaged man.\\" Characters * \\"Dublin Murder Squad\\" (DMS) employees : **O'Kelly - Superintendent **Rob Ryan - 35yrs old, Education in a boarding school in England and thus carries a 'perfect BBC accent', passed out from Templemore College, rookie with some experience (2yrs as floater + 2yrs in Domestic Violence), absorbed in DMS at age 31yrs.

Described as medium height, dark curls and a boyish, slim, square-shouldered build. **Sam O'Neill - 'stocky, cheerful, unflappable guy', influentially promoted as a member of the squad at only 27yrs of age because of his politician uncle. **Quigley - \\"wackiest\\" in the squad, often described as a \\"cretin\\", who sounded like Daffy Duck with a Donegal accent.

The Ecclesiastical coup is the name given to the events staged by three bishops of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus against the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios III, in the period from March 1972 to July 1973. Background At the session of the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus held on 2 March 1972, Metropolitan Gennadios (Machairiotis) of Paphos, Metropolitan Anthemos (Machairiotis) of Kition and Metropolitan Kyprianos (Kyriakides) of Kyrenia tabled a motion proposing that Archbishop Makarios III resign the Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus. They held that the holding of secular office by a cleric was against the canons of the Church. The Synod released an announcement reporting the position of the bishops, and stating that the Archbishop would announce his response at a later time. Makarios issued his response on 19 March. In it he accused the three bishops of having conspired among themselves and with other people outside the church, hinting at the Junta of the Colonels ruling Greece at the time, and at George Grivas, leader of the EOKA guerrilla organization, who had secretly returned to Cyprus. Makarios argued that the office of President of the Republic of Cyprus could not be called secular at a time when the Orthodox Greeks of Cyprus were struggling for their national survival, and that in the circumstances the holding of secular office did not confer on the Archbishop any personal reward, but was an onerous and bitter duty which he could not shirk. The bishops maintained their position and the crisis continued. It finally came to a climax after the unopposed re-election of Makarios to the Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus on 8 February 1973. The three bishops summoned Makarios to account for himself before an extraordinary session of the Holy Synod which they called for 7 March 1973. Makarios replied on 6 March, stating that the Synod the three bishops had called was unconstitutional and therefore any decision it reached would be invalid. The three bishops met among themselves and decided to defrock Makarios. Makarios called a Major Synod comprising representatives from all Orthodox Patriarchates. They all responded, except the Church of Greece and the Ecumenical Patriarchate whose seat is in Istanbul, Turkey. The Major Synod convened on 5–6 July 1973. It decided to annul the defrocking of Makarios, and to call the three bishops to audience so they could express their views. The three bishops refused to attend the Major Synod, which convened again on 14 July and defrocked them. Return of the bishops in the 1974 secular coup When Makarios was forced to flee the island after the military coup of 15 July 1974, the three defrocked bishops entered the limelight again. The coup leaders, having appointed Nikos Giorgades Sampson as President of the Republic, also installed Gennadios as the new Archbishop of Cyprus. Sampson was sworn in as president in a ceremony conducted by Gennadios in the presence of Kyprianos and Anthemos. However, the coupist government collapsed on 23 July as a result of the Turkish military invasion of Cyprus on 20 July. Glafkos Klerides, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, constitutionally took over the powers of the President in the absence of Makarios, but agreed to be sworn in as President before Gennadios, an action which Klerides's detractors suggest was indicative of a pro-coupist orientation on his part at the time. With the return of Makarios to the Presidency and the Archbishopric in December 1974, the three defrocked bishops faded from the political scene.

Setsuko was a sister-in- law of Emperor Shōwa and an aunt of the Emperor Akihito. Early life Setsuko Matsudaira was born on 9 September 1909 in Walton-on-Thames, England, into the prominent Matsudaira family. Her father, Tsuneo Matsudaira, was a diplomat and politician who later served as the Japanese ambassador to the United States (1924) and later to Great Britain (1928), and still later, Imperial Household Minister (1936–45, 1946–47). Her mother, Nobuko Nabeshima, was a member of the Nabeshima family. Her paternal grandfather, Katamori Matsudaira, was the last daimyō of the Aizu Domain and head of the Aizu- Matsudaira cadet branch of the Tokugawa. Her maternal grandfather, Marquis Naohiro Nabeshima, was the former daimyō of the Saga Domain. Her mother's elder sister, Itsuko (1882–1976), married Prince Morimasa Nashimoto, an uncle of Empress Kōjun. Despite her prestigious heritage, Setsuko was technically born a commoner, but both sides of her family maintained kinship with distinguished kazoku aristocratic families close to the Japanese Imperial Family. From 1925 to 1928, Setsuko was educated at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. while her father was ambassador to the United States.Roosevelt, Eleanor (May 28, 1953) \\"My Day\\". The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Digital Edition Setsuko was fluent in English and was sometimes considered to be a Kikokushijo. Upon her return to Japan, Setsuko was chosen by Empress Teimei to marry her second son, Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, despite the fact she was a commoner. Setsuko married the Prince after her uncle, Viscount Morio Matsudaira, formally adopted her, thus removing the status incongruity between the prince and his bride. Marriage The Prince and Princess Chichibu on their wedding day. On 28 September 1928, aged 19, Setsuko wed Prince Chichibu, and became Princess Chichibu. The bride and groom were eighth cousins, thrice removed, as both were descended from Nabeshima Katsushige, the first lord of Saga. Prince and Princess Chichibu had no children, as Princess Chichibu's only pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. However, by all accounts their marriage was filled with love and happiness for each other. In 1937, the prince and princess were sent on a tour of Western Europe which took several months. They represented Japan at the May 1937 coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey and subsequently visited Sweden and the Netherlands as the guests of King Gustav V and Queen Wilhelmina, respectively. Princess Chichibu stayed in Switzerland while her husband met Adolf Hitler in Nuremberg at the end of the trip. Princess Chichibu felt a great love for the United States and for England and, as an anglophile, was greatly saddened by Japan's entry into the Second World War on the side of the Axis powers. Widowhood After the Prince's death of tuberculosis in 1953, Princess Chichibu became president of the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, honorary president of the Britain-Japan Society, the Sweden-Japan Society, and an honorary vice president of the Japanese Red Cross. The Princess made several semi-official visits to Great Britain and Sweden. Death Princess Chichibu died from heart failure in Tokyo on 25 August 1995, shortly before her 86th birthday. Princess Chichibu's autobiography, which was published posthumously as The Silver Drum: A Japanese Imperial Memoir, was translated in English by Dorothy Britton.

At the end of 2003, De Niro purchased the theater at 54 Varick Street which had housed the recently closed Screening Room, an art house that had shown independent films nightly, renaming it the Tribeca Cinema. It became one of the venues of the festival. In an effort to serve its mission of bringing independent film to the widest possible audience, in 2006, the festival expanded its reach in New York City and internationally. In New York City, Tribeca hosted screenings throughout Manhattan as the festival's 1,000-plus screening schedule outgrew the capacity downtown. Internationally, the Festival brought films to the Rome Film Festival. As part of the celebrations in Rome, Tribeca was awarded the first-ever \\"Steps and Stars\\" award, presented on the Spanish Steps. A total of 169 feature films and 99 shorts were selected from 4,100 film submissions, including 1,950 feature submissions—three times the total submissions from the first festival in 2002. The festival featured 90 world premieres, nine international premieres, 31 North American premieres, 6 U.S. premieres, and 28 New York City premieres. In 2009, Rosenthal, Hatkoff and De Niro were named number 14 on Barron's list of the world's top 25 philanthropists for their role in regenerating TriBeCa's economy after September 11. In 2011, L.A. Noire became the first video game to be recognized by the Tribeca Film Festival. In 2013, Beyond: Two Souls, featuring Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe, became only the second game to be premiered at the festival. The 19th Tribeca Film Festival, originally scheduled for April 15–26, 2020, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the weeks and months that followed, Tribeca launched several digital offerings to highlight filmmakers and creators who had hoped to premiere their latest works at the spring gathering. It provided a secure digital platform for 2020 Festival films seeking distribution to be viewed by press and industry and hosted a virtual gathering space for Tribeca N.O.W. Creators Market. In response to the global pandemic, Tribeca organized We Are One in partnership with YouTube, a free,10-day digital festival that provided entertainment and connection for audiences at home and raised international COVID-19 relief funds. The program was co-curated by 21 of the top international film festivals including Cannes, Sundance, TIFF and Venice and showcased over 100 hours of shorts, features, talks and music to an audience of 1.9 million people in 179 countries. In July 2020, Tribeca launched one of the first large scale pop-up drive-in series across the country to provide audiences with entertainment in a safe, socially-distanced environment. Screenings took place at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA, Dallas Cowboys AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, TX, Orchard Beach in the Bronx neighborhood of New York and Nickerson Beach in Nassau County, NY. The series employed local production staff and partnered with small food businesses who had been impacted by the lockdown. On August 7, 2020, organizers announced that the 20th anniversary edition of the festival will be held from June 9 to June 20, 2021, with a dedicated space to celebrate films whose premieres were not able to take place in the festival that was cancelled in 2020.

A sham marriage or fake marriage is a marriage of convenience entered into without intending to create a real marital relationship. This is usually for the purpose of gaining an advantage from the marriage. Definitions of sham marriage vary by jurisdiction, but are often related to immigration. The essential point in the varying definitions is whether the couple intend to live in a real marital relationship, to establish a life together. A typical definition by the UK Home Office in 2015: :\\"A sham marriage or civil partnership is one where the relationship is not genuine but one party hopes to gain an immigration advantage from it. There is no subsisting relationship, dependency, or intent to live as husband and wife or civil partners.\\" While referred to as a \\"sham\\" or \\"fake\\" because of its motivation, the union itself is legally valid if it conforms to the formal legal requirements for marriage in the jurisdiction. Arranging or entering into such a marriage to deceive public officials is in itself a violation of the law of some countries, for example the US. After a period, couples often divorce if there is no purpose in remaining married. Marriage fraud Sham marriages are sometimes considered distinct from a marriage fraud, which is a type of romance scam, in which one spouse is unwittingly taken advantage of by the foreign spouse who feigns romantic interest, typically in order to obtain a residence permit or for money.  Background  Common reasons for sham marriages are to gain immigration, residency, work, or citizenship rights for one of the spouses. There have been cases of people entering into a sham marriage to avoid suspicion of homosexuality or bisexuality. For example, Hollywood studios had allegedly requested homosexual actors, such as Rock Hudson, to conceal their homosexuality in a so-called lavender marriage.  Fraud  Since the introduction of stricter modern immigration laws in First World countries, sham marriages have become a common method to allow a foreigner to reside, and possibly gain citizenship, in the more desirable country of the spouse. The couple marries with knowledge that the marriage is solely for the purpose of obtaining the favorable immigration status, and without intending to live as a couple. This is frequently arranged as a business transaction with payment of a sum of money, and occurs more commonly with foreigners already in the country. In the UK the Border Agency issued guidance to clergy in April 2011 to help prevent sham marriages intended only to gain the right to reside. English and Welsh clergy may perform a marriage, according to the law there. They have been advised not to offer to publish banns for any marriage where one partner is from outside the European Union. Instead, the couple were to be asked to apply for a licence; if a member of the clergy is not satisfied that a marriage is genuine, they must make that clear to the person responsible for granting the licence. Since the Home Office hostile environment policy started in 2012, there has been criticism in the UK of heavy-handed action affecting genuine marriages. Genuine weddings have been interrupted, and dawn raids have been made to check whether couples are sharing a bed. People have been detained for months on wrongly being accused of being in a sham marriage. In 2018, 1,618 marriages reported by registrars as being suspicious were investigated; the Home Office refused to say how many were found to be sham. In August 2010, a senior registrar in Ireland estimated that 15% of civil marriages were bogus, for the purpose of gaining residency.  Legislation and investigation  In United States immigration law, marriage not made in good faith and for purposes of immigration fraud is a felony, subject to a penalty of a US$250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence on the citizen, and deportation of the foreigner. The INS and the Justice Department said that they did not have accurate numbers on the rate of attempted marriage fraud.(Manwani v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 736 F. Supp. 1367 (W.D.N.C. 1990)). In the 2009 fiscal year, 506 of the 241,154 petitions filed were denied for suspected fraud, a rate of less than 0.09%. In Canada, legislation on sham marriages was strengthened in 2012. Continuous controversy arose regarding the issue; Canadian officials have been accused both of being too harsh and harassing couples and of being too lenient in deciding what is a genuine relationship. In addition, there have been objections to the policy from women's organizations, which argued that the new policy which requires the sponsor and the new spouse to live in a \\"genuine relationship\\" for two years endangers women who are victims of domestic violence. Although there is an exception to this rule in cases of abuse, the policy has been accused of being too weak (as abuse is difficult to prove).

She was named for Ioway Chief Mahaska. Mahaska was built at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, for $130,001.68; launched 10 December 1861 and commissioned 5 May 1862, Lt. Norman H. Farquhar in command. Mahaska sailed from Portsmouth 15 May 1862, reporting shortly thereafter for duty in the rivers flowing into Chesapeake Bay. On 20 June she engaged the Confederate batteries along the Appomattox River and on 1 November destroyed entrenchments at West Point, Virginia. Continuing her patrols into the next year, she captured the schooner General Taylor in Chesapeake Bay 20 February 1863. Moving south later in the year, she joined in the blockade of Charleston and participated in the attacks on the forts and batteries in that harbor: Fort Wagner, 8 and 18 August; Morris Island, 13 to 17, and 20 August; and Fort Sumter, 21 August 1863. The following year she took part in the joint expedition against Jacksonville, Florida, 5 February to 4 April, remaining on picket and patrol duty in the St. Johns River until 16 August when she returned to Charleston, South Carolina. She then steamed north to Boston, Massachusetts for overhaul. Overhaul completed 16 January 1865, Mahaska returned to Florida waters, capturing the schooner Delia, near Bayport, 17 February. After the end of the Civil War, the steamer continued to cruise in southern waters until decommissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana on 12 September 1868. She was sold 20 November 1868 to John Dole of Boston.

Awaash Subac Kiiloh Magaalah Xiinisso Center of Awash town Awash Subah' Town Administration is a market town in central Ethiopia. Located in Administrative Zone 3 of the Afar Region, above a gorge on the Awash River, after which the town is named,Philip Briggs praises this gorge, noting \\"the drama of which is accentuated by a row of low volcanic hills above the opposite cliff. (Ethiopia: the Bradt Travel Guide, third edition [London: Bradt, 2002], p. 339) the town lies on the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway, which crosses the gorge by a bridge there. It is the largest settlement in Awash Fentale woreda. Awash lies outside the Awash National Park, which is known for its wildlife, for the Mount Fentale caldera and for the Filwoha Hot Springs. Its market is held on Mondays, where Afar and Kereyu crafts can be found.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\", The Nordic Africa Institute website. Archived at the Wayback Machine on February 28, 2008.  History  An iron bridge over the Awash had been built at the present location of Awash by Emperor Menelik II's favorite, Alfred Ilg, around 1890; this bridge replaced an earlier wooden one. The construction had to face the great difficulty of transporting the girders from Djibouti, but once the material had arrived, the structure had been finished in ten days; however Emperor Menelik had used for other purposes the cement imported from Europe to build the bridge with. When Count Gleichen encountered the bridge in 1897, during his mission to Emperor Menelik, he found \\"the bridge would be too weak to stand anything but ordinary pack-animal traffic. For nine months in the year it is blocked at each end by a broad abattis of thorn-bush, - to prevent people from using it when the river is fordable, - but during the rains it is left open.\\" Awash grew up around the railroad station, which was opened not long after 1917 when the railway had reached this far into Ethiopia. A hotel for passengers was built in Awash about that time.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 334. The fourth post office in Ethiopia (after Harar, Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa) was established in Awash on 1 September 1923, but it may not have been much of a point of origin and arrival but rather a place on the line between the capital and the coast. During the Italian occupation, Awash still provided a post office, a telegraph station, the hotel, and restaurant. The town was occupied in April 1941 by the 22nd East African Brigade of the King's African Rifles, who had advanced for three days from Dire Dawa. Elements of this brigade afterwards continued their advance across the Awash at this point on 3 April 1941, although the road and rail bridge had been demolished by the retreating Italians. By 1953, the bridge had been rebuilt. One of the five camps to train conscripts of the People's Militia (reconstituted in the spring of 1977 as the \\"Red Army\\") was located at Awash. =Rail disaster = On January 13, 1985 a train derailed at Awash on the Ethio-Djibouti Railways plunging four of its five carriages into a ravine; the crash was estimated to have killed at least 428 and injured 500 of the estimated 1,000 on board. It was the worst rail accident in African history. It is believed that the cause of the crash was the excessive speed of the train round a curve on a bridge across the ravine. The derailment happened at 13:40 between Arba and Awash.  Demographics  Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Awash has an estimated total population of 11,053, of whom 5,748 are men and 5,305 were women.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table B.3, which calls the town Awash Sebat Kilo. According to the 1994 national census, the town had a population of 8,684.

These neurotransmitters are released at a location known as the synapse, which is a junction point between the axon of one nerve cell and the dendrite of another. The neurotransmitters are first released from the axon and then bind to the receptor site on the dendrite. Adrenergic nerve terminals are found in the secondary neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, one of two deviations of the autonomic nervous system which is responsible for the fight-or-flight response. This system increases heart rate, slows digestion, dilates pupils, and also controls the secretion of apocrine sweat glands in the dermal layer of skin, in addition to other responses.Junqueira's Basic Histology : Text and Atlas,13th. ed,c2013 Composition The nerve fibre is a thread-like extension of a nerve cell that includes the axon which may or may not be encased in a myelinated sheath. The androgenic nerve fibre when myelinated increases the speed of transmission for an action potential across the length of the cell. The gaps in the sheath along the axon are call the node of ranvier. Receptor site =Molecular level= There are several types of adrenergic receptors which are identified by their differing sensitivities to various drugs. Neurons in the central nervous system contain α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors and β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. All four kinds of receptors are also found in the various organs of the body aside from the brain. They are responsible for the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine when they act as hormones outside the central nervous system. In the brain, all autoreceptors appear to be of the α2 type. (The drug idazoxan blocks α2 autoreceptors and hence acts as an antagonist.) All adrenergic receptors are metabotropic, coupled to G proteins that control the production of second messengers. Adrenergic receptors can produce both excitatory and inhibitory effects. In general, the behavioral effects of the release of norepinephrine are excitatory. In the brain the α1 receptors produce a slow depolarizing (excitatory) effect on the postsynaptic membrane, while α2 receptors produce a slow hyperpolarization (inhibitory) effect. Both types of β receptors increase the responsiveness of the postsynaptic neuron to its excitatory inputs, which presumably related to the role this neurotransmitter plays in vigilance. =In the Body= Adrenergic fibres innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, visceral glands, and various central nervous system structures and sense organs. Their function is enhancing, compared to the inhibiting action of the cholinergic fibres of the parasympathetic system. Peripheral adrenergic neurons integrate signals from other nerves of the central nervous system and peripheral sense organs. An adrenergic nerve impulse is triggered when one nerve fires repeatedly or when several nerves fire simultaneously which can cause an additive effect leading to a greater stimulus.

The album develops the strong sci-fi/post-hardcore sound of the group from their first mini album, All Roads to Fault. Upon its release despite not being a commercial success, it was well received by critics. A striking feature of the album is the cover artwork, which was produced by renowned designer Storm Thorgerson (with Peter Curzon and photographer Rupert Truman), who has also produced artwork for such memorable albums as The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd (with Hipgnosis) and recently Frances the Mute by The Mars Volta. The photograph is of a distressed man sitting in a room lit by a bare lightbulb. The walls are covered in hundreds of light switches (the theme of the rest of the album's artwork), with a girl dressed in red seen to be lying, lifeless, in an adjacent and similarly decorated room.

He belonged to the Liberal Party. Dr. Alfaro was born in Panama. Early career He began a career in the diplomatic service in 1905 as under-secretary for foreign affairs. He was first assigned to the U.S. in 1912 as legal counselor of the Panamanian legation for the Panama-Costa Rica border dispute. Dr. Alfaro was also involved in settling numerous disputes arising from the construction of the Panama Canal. From 1915 to 1918, he was judge of a joint commission between Panama and the United States for settling claims relating to expropriations for the construction of the Canal. Later, in 1934 to 1936 and again, in 1953, Dr. Alfaro was involved in critical negotiations relating to Panama-U.S. relations concerning the Canal. From 1922 to 1930, and from 1933 to 1936, Dr. Alfaro was Panamanian envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the U.S.. In 1946, he was appointed Panama's minister of foreign relations; however, he resigned in 1947 to protest a proposed agreement with the U.S. relating to the Panama Canal. He was elected as the first presidential designate by the National Assembly for the term 1928-1930. In 1931, after a revolution in Panama, Dr. Alfaro was invited to become his country's president, a position he accepted and held from January 16, 1931 through June 5, 1932. In 1940, he was defeated in the presidential election; however continued to serve his country by helping to draft a new constitution for Panama in 1944. Working for the United Nations A significant portion of Dr. Alfaro's service to his country related to his work in the United Nations. In 1945, he headed the U.N. Relief and Recovery Administration mission to ten Latin American republics. He was also Panama's delegate to the U.N. conference on international organization in San Francisco and chairman of the special committee that drafted the Spanish text of the United Nations Charter of 1945. In 1949, Dr. Alfaro was chairman of the legal committee of the third session of the U.N. General Assembly that drew up the text of the Convention on Genocide. From 1949 to 1953 served as member of the International Law Commission. In that capacity, he promoted the Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States,Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1949, pp. 61ff and his draft became the basis of the version eventually approved by the commission.Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States with Commentary On June 3, 1949, he was appointed by that commission as rapporteur on the desirability of establishing a permanent court to try persons guilty of genocide.Yearbook of the ILC, 1949, p. 238 Academic career In addition to his governmental and diplomatic experience, Dr. Alfaro's professional acumen derives from a background in law. He was formerly a professor of civil and international law in Panama universities. He was also a member of the subcommittee that drafted treaties and arbitrated for the Inter-American Conference on Conciliation and Arbitration held in the U.S. in 1929. From 1959 to 1964, Dr. Alfaro was a judge in the International Court of Justice, serving his last three years as vice-president. In 1964, Dr. Alfaro retired from his official duties. Dr. Alfaro was the author of many articles and books on Panama, and was the recipient of numerous awards and citations for a career dedicated to improving conditions both in his country and globally. Dr. Alfaro died in his eighty-ninth year in Panama City on February 23, 1971. He was survived by his wife, Amelia Lyons de Alfaro; three sons, Dr. Victor Ricardo of Washington, Ivan Jose of Lima, Peru, and Rogelio Edwin of Panama City; two daughters, Mrs. Frank H. Weller (née Amelia or Amelita Victoria) of Potomac, Maryland, and Mrs. H. Cabell Maddux (née Yolanda Maria) of McLean, Virginia; and many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, among them the singer Nancy Ames, and attorney and TV personality Elbert Alfaro in Miami Lakes, Florida. Alfaro's legal philosophy Throughout his activities as professor of law and member of various judicial bodies, Alfaro promoted the notion of universal criminal jurisdiction and government accountability at all levels. An example to that effect can be seen in that during the deliberations on the law of treaties at the ILC, he opposed the notion that an international agreement reached by exchange of notes did not require ratification by the state legislature of the contracting states.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1, p. 68 He held the Nuremberg Principles in high esteem and viewed them as an integral part of the principles of world order and world peace.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1, p. 150 References Category:1882 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Panama City Category:National Liberal Party (Panama) politicians Category:Presidents of Panama Category:Vice Presidents of Panama Category:Panamanian judges Category:International Court of Justice judges Category:Panamanian lawyers Category:Panamanian academics Category:Panamanian diplomats Category:Panamanian judges of United Nations courts and tribunals Category:Panamanian expatriates in the United States Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Ricardo J.

It revolves around the plight of two German refugees in the opening months of World War II. One of the refugees relates their story during the course of a single night in Lisbon in 1942. The story he recounts is mainly a romantic one, and also contains a lot of action with arrests, escapes and near-misses. The novel is realistic, Remarque was himself a German refugee (although the novel is fictional and only loosely based on the experience of Remarque's friend, novelist Hans Habe), and provides insight into refugee life in Europe during the early days of the war. The book completed what was known as Remarque's \\"emigre trilogy\\" along with Flotsam and Arch of Triumph. It was Remarque's last completed work. Plot summary The story takes place in the opening months of World War II. Josef Schwarz is a refugee who offers his visa and tickets for America to another refugee desperate to leave Lisbon. He does this in exchange for keeping him company throughout one night, a night in which he relates the story of his and his wife's frantic flight from Nazi Germany to Lisbon. Reception The Night in Lisbon became an immediate bestseller in America and Britain when published in English in 1964, remaining on the New York Times Top Ten list for five months. In his review for the Times, Maxwell Geismar called it a \\"most brooding and thoughtful novel… it may not quite be a great novel, but it is surely one of the most absorbing and eloquent narratives of our period.\\" In a 1964 book review, Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"limp with romantic despair and frayed cynicism making the experience of dislocation and the concentration camps more acceptable to an audience which has avoided it before... Remarque's old following will find that it has a certain urgency without perhaps pausing to wonder whether it is as real as it is readable.\\" Charles Poore wrote in his review for The Times; \\"It is a brilliant novel and a strange one, not completely successful but hauntingly moving.\\"  Film  With an expected release during October, 2020, a film based on The Night in Lisbon is being produced.

He became well known in 1944 through his series of paintings depicting some of the great famines in Bengal during its British colonial period. After the Partition of Indian subcontinent he moved to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In 1948, he helped to establish the Institute of Arts and Crafts (now Faculty of Fine Arts) at University of Dhaka. The Indian Express has described him as a legendary Bangladeshi painter. Like many of his contemporaries, his paintings on the Bengal famine of 1943 are viewed as his most characteristic works. His homeland honored him with given the title “Shilpacharjo” () “Great teacher of the arts\\" for his artistic and visionary attributes. He was the pioneer of the modern art movement that took place in Bangladesh and was rightly considered by Syed Manzoorul Islam as the founding father of Bangladeshi modern arts, soon after Bangladesh earned the status of an independent republic. Early life and education Abedin was born in Kishoreganj on 29 December 1914. Much of his childhood was spent near the scenic banks of the Brahmaputra River. The Brahmaputra would later appear in many of his paintings and be a source of inspiration all throughout his career. Many of his works framed Brahmaputra and a series of watercolors that Abedin did as his tribute to the river earned him the Governor's Gold Medal in an all-India exhibition in 1938. This was the first time when he came under spotlight and this award gave Abedin the confidence to create his own visual style. In 1933, Abedin was admitted to the Government School of Art in Calcutta (now Government College of Art & Craft, Kolkata, India). Here for five years he learned British/ European academic style and later he joined the faculty of the same school after his graduation. He was the first Muslim student to obtain first class distinction from the school. He was dissatisfied with the oriental style and the limitations of European academic style and this led him towards realism. In 1948, with help from a few colleagues, he founded an art institute in Dhaka. Back then, there were no art institutes in the city. Soon after, it went on to be considered the best art institute in Pakistan during its early years. He worked in the Pakistani government for a while. He taught at the institute and among his students was Pakistani artist Mansur Rahi. He also taught Bangladeshi artists such as Monirul Islam and Mohammad Kibria. After completing his two years of training from Slade School of Fine Art in London, he began a new style, the 'Bengali style', where the main features were: folk forms with their geometric shapes, sometimes semi- abstract representation, and the use of primary colors. But he lacked the sense of perspective. Later he realized the limitations of folk art, so he went back to the nature, rural life and the daily struggles of man to make art that would be realistic but modern in appearance. Paintings Jainul Abedin Gallary Among all the contemporary works of Abedin, his famine sketches of the 1940s are his most remarkable works. His famine painting set which, exhibited in 1944, brought him even more critical acclaim. The miserable situation of the starving people during the Great Famine of Bengal in 1943 touched his heart. He made his own ink by burning charcoal and used it on cheap, ordinary packing paper. He depicted those starving people who were dying by the road- side. Abedin not only documented the famine, he also revealed the famine's sinister face through the skeletal figures of people fated to die of starvation. Abedin depicted this inhuman story with very human emotions. These drawings became iconic images of human suffering. These sketches helped him find his way in a realistic approach that focused on the human suffering, struggle and protest. He was more socially aware focusing on the working class and their struggles. The Rebel Cow marks a high point of that style. This particular brand of realism combines social inquiry and the protest with higher aesthetics. He was an influential member of the Calcutta Group of progressive artists and was friends with Shahid Suhrawardy and Ahmed Ali of the Progressive Writers' Movement. He made modernist paintings of Santhal people. Notable among them is \\"Two Santhal Women\\". He visited Palestinian camps in Syria and Jordan in 1970 and made 60–70 paintings of the refugees there. He also painted the 1970 Bhola cyclone that devastated East Pakistan. Liberation movement Abedin's tomb He was involved in the Bengali Language Movement of East Pakistan. Abedin was involved in the Bangladesh liberation war movement. He was at the forefront of the cultural movement to re-establish the Bengali identity, marginalized by the Pakistan government. In 1969, Abedin painted a scroll using Chinese ink, watercolor and wax named Nabanna. This was to celebrate the ongoing non-cooperation movement. Post-independence era In 1974 he received Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Delhi, India. In 1975, he founded the Folk Art Museum at Sonargaon in Narayanganj, and Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala, a gallery of his own works in Mymensingh. In 1982, 17 of the 70 pictures housed in Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala were stolen. Only 10 were later recovered. His famous painting \\"Study of a Crow\\" (Ink Wash) in the collection of Professor Ahmed Ali is listed in the book Arts in Pakistan by Jalaluddin Ahmed, 1952, including an exclusive monologue on him published by FOMMA, Karachi, along with his many Famine Series paintings of 1943. Personal life and death Abedin was married to Jahanara Abedin. He developed lung cancer and died on 28 May 1976 in Dhaka. Two faces was his last painting, completed shortly before his death. He was buried beside the Dhaka University Central Mosque.

His birthday was celebrated in Bangladesh, with a festival in Dhaka University and children's art competition in Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala (art gallery). His sketch was auctioned at auction house Bonhams. Zainul Abedin Museum in Mymensingh, Bangladesh is dedicated to his work. On December, 2014, Bangladeshi various socio-cultural organisations have arranged elaborate birth centenary programmes throughout the country. On December 29, 2019, Google celebrated his 105th birthday with a Google Doodle.

History  Yabelo was entered by the Italian Laghi Division on 11 July 1936, but more formally occupied on 6 August 1936 by troops under the command of Giorgio Pollera. 15 tanks from the Yabelo garrison attempted to break through the Allied defenses around Mega, but failed; Yabelo was occupied by the Allies two days after the armored assault on 22 February 1941. The hangar the Italians had built at Yabelo was dismantled in 1952, and transported to Debre Zeyit by air, where it was re-erected to house the newly acquired Fairey Firefly airplanes from Canada. The Norwegian Lutheran Mission started a missionary station at Yabelo in 1950, although the staff was reported to have made little headway in converting the locals, similar to the other Christian missionaries. In 1992, Yabelo was the site of a feeding station to combat a local famine. Conditions had grown so severe that the local Borena Oromo decided to eliminate competition from their neighbors the Gabbra. The Gabbra were killed, their livestock was stolen, and the survivors were moved from the area by CARE. In June 2004, a Rally of Pastoral Clans was held under the acacia trees of the SARDU compound in Yabelo, which included representatives from the Borena, Guji, Gabbra, Arsi and Marian clans in Dire, Liben and Moyale woredas; other attendees included government officials such as Obbo Kibre Jimmera, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Pastoralist Affairs Standing Committee.

As of January 25, 2010 over 150 people, mostly affiliated with the Oromo People's Congress, were said to be still incarcerated in Yabello jail.

In addition, it was reported that of the two boreholes only one was functional, and the town had 7 water points at different locations.

Sometimes referred to as the don of Nangarhar, he was also a shrewd politician who wielded considerable power behind the scenes during one of the most turbulent and violent periods in his country’s history. After the overthrow of Mohammad Zahir Shah by Mohammad Daoud in 1973, Khalis fled to Pakistan and joined Hekmatyar's Islamic Party (Hezb-e Islami). After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Khalis broke with Hekmatyar and established his own party (Hezb-e Islami Khalis). Khalis reportedly entered Afghanistan many times to join his forces in waging war against the Soviets and their local proxies. Many prominent mujahideen commanders including Abdul Haq, Amin Wardak Faisal Babakarkhail and Jalaluddin Haqqani were affiliated with Hezb-e-Islami Khalis. After the fall of the Communist regime in 1992, Khalis participated in the Islamic Interim Government. He was a member of the Leadership Council (Shura-ye Qiyaadi), but held no other official post. Instead of moving to Kabul, he chose to remain in Nangarhar. His party controlled major parts of this politically and strategically important province. The Taliban brought Nangarhar under their control in September 1996 and Khalis was supportive of the Taliban movement and had a close relationship with Taliban commanders. Khalis resided in Pakistan in the late 1990s. After the fall of the Taliban, his supporters regained their stronghold in Jalalabad where Khalis exerted considerable influence, although he held no official post. Two of his close associates, Haji Abdul Qadir and Haji Din Mohammad served as governors of Nangarhar Province after the fall of the Communist regime. According to a statement from his son Anwar ul Haq Mujahid, leader of the insurgent group Tora Bora Military Front, Khalis died on 19 July 2006.\\"Leader of Afghan mujahideen dies\\", BBC.co.uk, Monday, 24 July 2006.

Biography Born in Brist near Makarska, he became a Franciscan friar. He was educated in Zaostrog monastery and Buda. He used to teach philosophy in Zaostrog and Sumartin on Brač. His most important work is Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog (Pleasant Conversation of Slavic People, 1756), a history in verse, in which Kačić Miočić, influenced by the ideals of the Enlightenment, tried to spread literacy and modern ideas among common people. It was the most popular book in the Croatian-speaking lands for more than a century. It also played a key role in the victory of the Shtokavian dialect as the standard Croatian language. It contain poems about Skanderbeg which were basis for tragedy Skenderbeg written by Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski in the 19th century. They were also basis for Život i viteška voevanja slavnog kneza epirskog Đorđa Kastriota Skenderbega written by Jovan Sterija Popović in 1828. Statue of Andrija Kačić Miošić in Makarska Using the ten-syllable verse of folk poetry and relying on Mavro Orbini and Pavao Ritter Vitezović, Kačić Miošić narrates and sings about the history of the Slavic peoples from the antiquity to his age. He, like Ivan Gundulić, describes the Slavic peoples from the Adriatic to the North Sea as one people. The book exalts many heroes from the famous Croatian families of the age of the Ottoman wars. His most important work also contained a lot of references and praise for the Bosniak nation and its historical events. Since the book includes some important folk poems, many readers considered it a folk songbook. Pleasant Conversation is mostly didactic in tone and of little artistic value, but later it served as a valuable source of historic data. It gave inspiration for future Croatian writers. His other works are a philosophical study in Latin and a chronicle called Korabljica (1760), where he used passages from other writers, including Vitezović.

His son, also named Mahaska, was better known as Francis White Cloud. Early life and education Mahaska was born into the Iowa tribe. He became chief at an early age after killing several enemy Sioux to avenge his father's death by them. Later Mahaska supposedly killed a French trader in an argument; he was arrested and imprisoned in St. Louis, Missouri. After he escaped, he led a raid against the Osage. Afterward, he decided that his father's death was finally avenged. Mahaska lay down his arms and adopted the lifestyle of the European-American settlers, building a log home and farming. He refused to let his braves avenge the death of an Iowa chief named Crane at the hands of Omaha Indians in 1833. When several Iowa killed six Omaha warriors, Mahaska assisted in their arrest. The next year one of the Iowa escaped from Fort Leavenworth and killed Mahaska by shooting him in the back as he sat by his campfire. He was buried along the Nodaway River in Edna Township, Cass County, Iowa. Mahaska became a symbol to settlers of the virtues of his native lifestyle, and of the possibility of peace between natives and settlers. Legacy and honors * Mahaska County, Iowa was named for him. * USS Mahaska was named in his honor. Sculptor Sherry Edmundson Fry's earliest public commission was a bronze statue of Mahaska.

Returning to Paris, he began on a clay scale model, which he first showed at the Paris Salon in 1907. A year later, he exhibited the final full- sized sculpture, for which he was awarded the Rome Prize. Soon after, it was shipped to the U.S., and arrived in Oskaloosa by railroad.

In the early 1730s, Mahtama Selassie Walda Mesqal, who had studied agriculture in France and Spain, started an agricultural station near the town.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 208 By 1933, Ambo had started to be a recreation place with the construction of some bath cabins with cisterns of concrete, and a couple of European-type hotels, as well as simple villas for the Emperor and important persons. By 1938, the Guida described improvements to Ambo which included a post office, telephone service, a clinic for outpatients, restaurants, and a hotel under construction. Two Italian forts were constructed, and in a cave the Italians had erected a monument for casualties of the Pusteria Division. The approach to Ambo was still over an old bridge, and below it a natural bridge used by caravans. When the Allies reached Ambo with a South African armored car patrol in early 1941, they had to evacuate 140 \\"utterly panicked Italians\\". The British operated an improvised camp for prisoners-of-war at Ambo until 1942. At least as early as 1955, there was a 170 kW hydro-electric power station in the town; by 1965 the installed electrical capacity was 210 kVA, with annual production of 132,000 kWh. In 1958 Ambo was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. That same year, the Ambo Agricultural School and Ambo Forestry School had 150 students.

His funeral was attended by thousands of Oromos in Ambo; police arrested more than 37 people, stating that they were supporters of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) on 3 September. In the following February, 70-year-old Oromo elder Dandana Gurmu was arrested on the accusation that he was a supporter of the OLF. On 24 April 2003, a Tigrayan student was shot and killed and two others injured in a clash between Oromo and Tigrayan students at the Ambo Agricultural College.

It was formerly known as Debre Zeyit (Amharic: ደብረ ዘይት) however since the late 1990s it has been officially known by the Oromo name, Bishoftu, which was its name until 1955.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 7 December 2007) Bishoftu is located southeast of Addis Ababa along its route 4 highway.  Overview  Lake Hora, one of five crater lakes in Bishoftu. Nearby points of interest include Mount Yerer, Green Crater Lake and Lake Hora Kiloli. It is a resort town, known for five crater lakes: Lake Bishoftu, Lake Hora (a base for watersports, many water birds and an annual festival), Lake Bishoftu Guda, Lake Koriftu and the seasonal Lake Cheleklaka. Bishoftu is also home to the Ethiopian Air Force and the Harar Meda Airport (ICAO HAHM, IATA QHR), as well as a station on the Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway. It has had telephone service since 1954. The city is home for the National Veterinary Institute of Ethiopia, established in 1963, the leading veterinary vaccine research and production center currently producing more than 20 livestock vaccines. Next door to the national veterinary institute is the scholl of veterinary medicine of Addis Ababa University. The Gafat Armament Engineering Complex is located here. According to the Nordic Africa Institute website, other major businesses in Bishoftu include the Ada Flour and Pasta Factory, the Pasqua Giuseppe PLC, the Salmida Leather Products Manufacturing, Ratson (Women Youth Children Development Programme), and Winrock International Ethiopia. The Debre Zeyt Research Center, founded in 1953, is run by the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, specializing in agricultural research, which includes acting as the national center for research to improve the yield of teff, lentils, chickpeas, and poultry.EARI list of research centers (accessed 30 April 2009) In 2007 Bishoftu became the new home of Meserete Kristos College, a Christian college owned by the Meserete Kristos Church.  History  Bishoftu, as a definite entity, did not come into existence until after the Second World War. Accounts of earlier travelers call the region \\"Adda\\", although one Swedish memoir from 1935 mentions a village named \\"Bishoftu\\"; the future minister Makonnen Habte- Wold was born in this village. At about from Adda, on land that had been owned partly by Emperor Haile Selassie I, the Italians started Azienda Agraria di Biscioftu dell'Opera Nazionale per i Combattenti on 15,000 hectares, intending to create a center of colonization as well as an experimental agricultural station. The first foundation stone for the houses was laid 9 December 1937, but only 21 dwellings were ready by May 1938. Various administrative and service buildings were also built. The history of the Ethiopian Air Force is tightly woven with the history of Bishoftu. In 1946, the beginnings of what would become the Ethiopian Air Force was moved from Lideta airport in Addis Ababa, which was needed by Ethiopian Airlines, to Bishoftu. The initial group of 19 Swedes under Count Carl Gustaf von Rosen, who were to train the pilots and support personal, arrived there after leaving Sweden between 9 January and 16 July 1946. Both Ethiopian cadets and the Swedish instructors took part in constructing the first buildings on the base. Six Saab 91 Safir training airplanes were bought in Sweden and flown to the new airbase 24 December 1946, and on 10 November 1947 a fleet of 16 Saab-built B-17s were landed at Bishoftu by Swedish pilots. Bishoftu Technical High School was established in 1958 with a 5-year course for boys 12–15 years of age. An Evangelical College had been founded two years before, which was a joint undertaking of Swedish, Norwegian, and German Evangelical missions. The Evangelical College's first headmaster was Sven Rubenson. The Animal Health Assistants Training School was established in Bishoftu in 1963, with financial support by the United Nations Special Fund. The artist Lemma Tesefa Kesime was born (1956) in Bishoftu. He studied at the Art School 1972-1974 and received his M.A. from the Soviet Union in 1983. Returning to Ethiopia, Lemma Tesefa became a teacher at the art school in Addis Ababa. Bishoftu was also the favored weekend retreat of Emperor Haile Selassie, who built a palace in the town, named \\"Fairfield\\" after his wartime home in exile in the town of Bath, England. Armed forces of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front bypassed the capital and occupied Bishoftu in May, 1991, bringing order to the area after the collapse of the Mengistu government, taking control of what remained of the Soviet- supplied Air Force. The airbase was also used to detain several dozen senior military officers after the capture of the capital. On 2 October 2016 at Irreechaa celebration security forces fired tear gas at protesters forcing them to panic and as a result 52 people lost their lives after falling into ditches around Lake Hora. On 10 March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed near the town of Bishoftu.  Demographics  The 2007 national census reported a total population for Bishoftu of 99,928, of whom 47,860 were men and 52,068 were women.

Biography Benkestok was born around 1495 (or before 1500) in Bergen to nobleman Torleiv Trondson Benkestok and Adelus Eriksdotter Kruckow. In 1532, he actively supported Johan Kruckow, who wanted Frederick I of Denmark rather than King Christian II of Denmark on the Norwegian throne. In July 1532, Christian was captured and imprisoned.

He founded the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) and was an emeritus professor at Université de Montréal and a professor at McGill University . Genest was best known for founding and leading several organizations related to clinical research in Québec and for his work on arterial hypertension. Life and career Born in Montreal, Quebec, Genest received his medical degree from the University of Montreal. He completed his residency in internal medicine and pathology at the Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal before heading to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland for a research fellowship. He was then a research associate and assistant physician at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, which later awarded him an honorary degree in 1986. Upon returning to Quebec, he was asked by the provincial government to perform a study of the state of research in the province. Following his visits to major universities and research institutions of the United States and Europe, he concluded that Québec lagged behind in this sector. He therefore founded the first department of clinical research at Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal in 1952. Though he had the confidence on the administration, this move was poorly received by his colleagues, who disapproved of a physician being salaried and freed from clinical tasks to devote himself to the study of hypertension. However, the lack of financing and of laboratory space complicated the growth of the department. In 1955 the department was recognized by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada for basic science training, leading to an improvement in his colleagues' opinions. The department became the only place offering both clinical and research education for physicians. Jacques Genest acceded to the presidency of the medical council of Hôtel-Dieu in 1958. Furthermore, he created the Club de Recherches Cliniques du Québec (CRCQ), a place for discourse between francophone researchers. Now more firmly established, the department recruited dozens of researchers between 1952 and 1967. The department established close ties with J.S.L. Browne, director of the department of Investigative Medicine at McGill University, who offered interns the opportunity to round out their clinical studies with a solid theoretical foundation. In 1964, Jacques Genest was named director of the Department of Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Montréal. He continued at the same time to work towards the elaboration of a council of medical research in Québec which would permit governmental finance of research. Indeed, today the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec (FRSQ) awards scholarships and grants to researchers in the health sciences. Also in 1964, McGill offered Genest the post of Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. This position offered him support sufficient to lay the cornerstone for a research institute. With the help of noted lawyer Marcel Piché, they founded the Claude Bernard Medical Center, which is known today as the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM). The provincial minister of health Alphonse Couturier allocated critical funds towards the foundation of this institution. Genest guided this foundation from 1967 through 1984. He also contributed to the establishment of a center for the study of bioethics within the IRCM. He died on 5 January 2018 at the age of 98.In memoriam: Dr Jacques Genest Sr (1919-2018) Scientific research His interests in arterial hypertension led him to uncover the role of sodium, aldosterone, and angiotensin II in the renin-angiotensin system. He established tests for renin activity in plasma, which were important for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension and as a predictor of the efficacy of surgical intervention. Additionally, he worked on the natriuretic factor present in heart atria.

Lotti rose to fame in the skateboarding world in the late 1980s while riding for H-Street Skateboards. He is known for his fluid skateboarding style and inventing the \\"Bigspin\\" skateboard trick. Professional skateboarding Lotti's popularity peaked in the early 1990s while he was sponsored by skateboard company Planet Earth and appeared in the 1991 Planet Earth video Now N' Later. After moving on to ride for Blind Skateboards, Lotti left the world of professional skateboarding and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii. Following his return to the skateboarding industry, Lotti completed filming a part in the 2007 Santa Cruz Skateboards \\"Legends\\" video. In 2009 Lotti founded his own company, Telegraph Skateboards, and all of the skateboard decks featured original design work by Lotti and his associates. However, as of March 2014, the brand is no longer operational—its web-site is nonexistent and its products are no longer sold. =Bigspin= As one of the originators of today's technical street-skating, Lotti brought several tricks to the forefront of skateboarding such as the frontside bluntside. He also invented the backside tailslide flip-out and the Bigspin. The Bigspin was done by skateboarders before Lotti but the catchy name caught on. The name was derived from a Californian lottery at the time with the name Bigspin. The person who named the trick the Bigspin saw Lotti do one and chose the name because his last name sounds like the word lottery. Visual art Following his initial departure from professional skateboarding, Lotti became an attendant for Roshi Robert Aiken at the Palolo Valley sangha. There he studied Buddhism and went on to further his education at the University of Hawaii. Lotti then moved back to the mainland and attended California State University at San Francisco, where he graduated with a degree in art. Following university, Lotti moved to Northern California to concentrate on his art career. After a few years of living on the San Juan Ridge, he moved to Los Angeles. Lotti has designed board graphics for skateboard companies and brands, such as Cartel, Cliche, Listen, Stereo, Death Skateboards, Almost, and the now-defunct Adio Skateboards. In early 2016, Lotti participated in \\"The Art of a Political Revolution,\\" an event in Los Angeles which showcased art that supported the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. Lotti designed new cover artwork for the 10-year anniversary reissue of Midlake's album The Trials of Van Occupanther. In September 2018, Lotti collaborated with Adidas Skateboarding to reissue the brand's Campus 80s sneakers with his label and apparel.

The names derive from the combined forms of Latin pater and Greek patḗr (father). The period is generally considered to run from the end of New Testament times or end of the Apostolic Age () to either AD 451 (the date of the Council of Chalcedon) or to the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.  Key persons  Prominent early Church Fathers whose writings form the basis for patristics comprise * Ignatius of Antioch () * Pope Clement I () * Polycarp of Smyrna () * Justin Martyr () * Irenaeus of Lyons () * Clement of Alexandria () * Tertullian () * Origen () * Cyprian of Carthage (d. 258) * Athanasius () * Basil of Caesarea ( – 379) * Gregory of Nazianzus (329 – 389) * Gregory of Nyssa () * Jerome (347 – 430) * Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430) * Vincent of Lérins (d. bef. 450) * Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444) * Maximus the Confessor (580 – 662) * Isaac of Nineveh (d. 700) * John of Damascus (d. 749)  Key theological developments  Major focuses for these theologians during the period are, in chronological order, Christianity's relationship with Judaism; the establishment of the New Testament canon; apologetics (the 'defense' or 'explanation' of Christianity); and doctrinal discussions that sought to achieve consistency of faith, in particular within the Christianised Roman Empire.McGrath. op.cit. Ch. 1. Following the scholar of Christianity Alister McGrath (1998), several major areas of theology can be seen to have developed during the Patristic Period: the extent of the New Testament canon, the role of tradition, the fixing of the ecumenical creeds, the two natures of Christ, the doctrine of the Trinity, the doctrine of the Church, and the doctrine of divine grace.McGrath. op.cit. pp. 27–37.  Eras of the church fathers  The church fathers are generally divided into the Ante-Nicene Fathers, those who lived and wrote before the Council of Nicaea (325) and the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, those who lived and wrote after 325. Also, the division of the fathers into Greek and Latin writers is also common. Some of the most prominent Greek Fathers are Justin Martyr, Athanasius of Alexandria, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, John Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, and Maximus the Confessor. Among the Latin Fathers are Tertullian, Cyprian, Jerome, Ambrose of Milan, Augustine of Hippo, and Gregory the Great. There were also church fathers who wrote in languages other than Greek or Latin, such as Coptic, Syriac, Ge'ez, and Armenian, among others.Alopen, a key patristic-era figure in the Church Of The East, wrote in Chinese. Historically, Chalcedonian Christians have had less interest in these authors since the associated churches ended up rejecting the councils of Chalcedon (becoming Oriental Orthodox), or Ephesus (becoming the Church of the East). Recently this has begun to change, with the cooling of tensions between these branches of Christianity and the Western and Byzantine ones. There are Eastern Catholics who follow Oriental rites while remaining in communion with Rome, and at least one organization argues that Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christians now share the same faith.  Locations  The major locations of the early Church fathers were Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and the area of western north Africa around Carthage. Milan and Jerusalem were also sites.McGrath. op.cit. pp. 20–22.  Obstacles to 21st-century understanding  Alister McGrath notes four reasons why understanding patristics can be difficult in the early 21st-century:McGrath. op.cit. pp. 23. # Some of the debates appear to have little relevance to the modern world # the use of classical philosophy # the doctrinal diversity # the divisions between East and West, i.e., Greek and Latin methods of theology, the extent of use of classical philosophy. The terms neo-patristics and post-patristics refer to recent theologies according to which the Church Fathers must be reinterpreted or even critically tested in light of modern developments since their writings reflected that of a distant past. These theologies, however, are considered controversial or even dangerous by orthodox theologians.Dr. Triantafyllos Sioulis, «Πατερικός φονταμενταλισμός» ή «μετα-πατερική θεολογική θολούρα» Metropolitan of Nafpaktus ΝΕΟΠΑΤΕΡΙΚΗ ΚΑΙ ΜΕΤΑΠΑΤΕΡΙΚΗ \\"ΘΕΟΛΟΓΙΑ\\"  Patrology vs. patristics  Some scholars, chiefly in Germany, distinguish patrologia from patristica. Josef Fessler, for instance, defines patrologia as the science which provides all that is necessary for the using of the works of the Fathers, dealing, therefore, with their authority, the criteria for judging their genuineness, the difficulties to be met within them, and the rules for their use. But Fessler's own Institutiones Patrologiae has a larger range, as have similar works entitled Patrologies, for example, that of Otto Bardenhewer (tr. Shahan, Freiburg, 1908). Catholic writer Karl Keating argues that patrology is the study of the Early Fathers and their contemporaries as people, and the authenticity of the works attributed to them. Patristics, on the other hand, is the study of their thought. On the other hand, Fessler describes patristica as that theological science by which all that concerns faith, morals, or discipline in the writings of the Fathers is collected and sorted. The lives and works of the Fathers are also described by a non- specialized science: literary history. These distinctions are not much observed, nor do they seem very necessary; they are nothing else than aspects of patristic study as it forms part of fundamental theology, of positive theology, and of literary history.  Availability of patristic texts  Most patristic texts are available in their original languages in Jacques Paul Migne's two great patrologies, Patrologia Latina and Patrologia Graeca. For Syriac and other Eastern languages the Patrologia Orientalis (Patrologia Syriaca earlier) is less complete and can be largely supplemented by the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium. Noted collections containing re- edited patristic texts (also discoveries and new attributions) are the Corpus Christianorum, Sources Chrétiennes, Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, and on a lesser scale Oxford Early Christian Texts, Fontes Christiani, and Études Augustiniennes. English translations of patristic texts are readily available in a variety of collections.

It was established in 1993 after an intensive campaign by Canadian and American conservation organizations to halt mining exploration and development in the area, and protect the area for its strong natural heritage and biodiversity values. The park is situated in the very northwestern corner of British Columbia, bordering the American state of Alaska and the Canadian Yukon Territory. Nestled between the Yukon's Kluane National Park and Reserve in the Yukon and Glacier Bay & Alaska's Wrangell–St. Elias National Parks and Preserves, the park includes all land in British Columbia west of the Haines Highway. It is part of the Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek park system, and in 1994 was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Over the centuries, numerous indigenous peoples lived in this area, including the historic Tlingit and Southern Tutchone, who built fishing villages along the rivers. The eastern edge of the park follows an ancient trade route used by the Chilkat (a Tlingit people) to barter with the Tutchone. In the mid-19th century, the sudden breakup of a natural dam on the Alsek River caused a severe flood. The dam had been formed by the advance of a glacier across the entire Alsek River channel; the obstructed river formed a large temporary lake upstream of the blockage. A wall of water high and wide swept an entire Tutchone village into the sea at Dry Bay, killing all the inhabitants. Tatshenshini-Alsek was one of the last areas of British Columbia to be mapped and explored. In the 1960s the first geological exploration for minerals took place in the area. Significant copper deposits were found in the vicinity of Windy Craggy Mountain, in the middle of the Tatshenshini region. In the mid-1970s two companies began rafting the Tatshenshini (aka \\"the Tat\\", a term also used to refer to the region) and Alsek rivers for the first time. In the mid-1980s a proposal surfaced to develop Windy Craggy peak into a huge open-pit mine. In 1991 Tatshenshini International was established, linking together the top 50 conservation organisations in North America. An extremely intensive campaign followed in Canada and in the United States, particularly the U.S. Congress and eventually the White House, when the active involvement of then Vice-President Al Gore was enlisted. Eventually, BC Premier Mike Harcourt responded by undertaking a review of the issues surrounding Tatshenshini-Alsek by the Commission on Resources and the Environment (CORE). BC government under Premier Harcourt decided in June 1993 to protect Tatshenshini-Alsek as a Class A park. The owners of the Windy-Craggy mineral claims were given a $103.8 million settlement. In combination with the adjoining national parks, this completed protection of the world's largest international park complex. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) proposed the area for protection as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias- Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek transfrontalier park system comprising Kluane, Wrangell-St Elias, Glacier Bay and Tatshenshini-Alsek parks, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 for the spectacular glacier and icefield landscapes, in addition to the importance of its habitat for grizzly bears, caribou and Dall sheep. In 1999, a party of sheep hunters found artifacts and remains of a young male at the foot of a glacier in the park; he was later called Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi, or \\"Long Ago Man Found\\". The well-preserved frozen body turned out to be between 300 and 550 years old. Representatives of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations were consulted for this find on their historic territory, and they named the young man. In addition, they agreed to scientific and DNA testing of the remains. Researchers recruited volunteers to see if people could be found who were genetically related to the \\"iceman\\". Some 241 volunteers were tested from the area Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, and related peoples in Yukon, British Columbia and Alaska. Seventeen living relatives, including two sisters, were found in the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations who are related through a mitochondrial DNA match of the direct female line. Fifteen of these 17 identify as Wolf clan, suggesting the young man also belonged to that clan.Judith Lavoie, Canwest News Service, \\"Iceman's DNA Linked To Coastal Aboriginals (Canada)\\", Leader Post, 26 April 2008, accessed 5 October 2014 In the matrilineal kinship system, children are considered born into their mother's clan, and descent is figured through the mother's line. Wildlife Tatshenshini-Alsek Park The Alsek and Tatshenshini rivers flow through the park in glacier-carved U-shaped valleys. These valleys through the coastal mountains allow cool, moist ocean air into the cold interior. The quick change from ocean to interior environment, frequent floods, landslides and avalanches, a varied geology and great elevation changes have together created an exceptionally diverse range of habitat conditions. Tatshenshini-Alsek Park supports a large grizzly bear population. A green area that cuts through a barrier of mountain and ice connects coastal and interior grizzly bear populations and provides a perfect habitat. The park is the only Canadian home of the glacier bear. This extremely rare blue-grey colour phase of the black bear is found only within the park and just over the border into the United States. As well as bears, Tatshenshini-Alsek Park also supports Dall's sheep, and exceptional numbers of mountain goats, Kenai moose, grey wolves, eagles (bald and golden), falcons (peregrine and gyr), and trumpeter swans. Along the coastline, sea lions and humpback whales can be seen. Alsek Ranges are situated there and Mount Fairweather, at is the province's highest peak. The Tatshenshini-Alsek area lies in a region of high earthquake activity. Slippages along the Fairweather and Hubbard/Border Faults to the west and the Denali Fault to the north cause regular quakes.

It currently includes all of Cleveland, Gaston, Lincoln, Polk, and Rutherford counties, and part of Catawba, Iredell, and Buncombe counties. Republicans have won the district continuously since 1969. Republican Patrick McHenry has represented the district since 2005. Jeff Gregory (D) was defeated in the 2010 election to represent this district. The 10th district was part of the controversial statewide redistricting by the Republican-led state legislature in 2011. The district's northwest border was redrawn to include most of heavily Democratic Asheville, long the heart of the 11th district. At the same time, some heavily Republican areas in the 10th were shifted to the 11th. While this made the 10th approximately seven points more Democratic, it was not nearly enough to overcome the heavy Republican tilt in the western Charlotte suburbs.

She is also known as the Safflower Princess. In some English translations she appears as Princess Hitachi. Prince Genji was briefly attracted to her, until she lowered her fan to reveal her nose. However, he eventually felt sorry for her and helped support her. The incident with the Safflower Princess's nose has always been a source of comic relief for readers of the \\"Tale of Genji\\". In the manga comics, the extremely shy princess is always depicted as being quite unattractive, the amorous prince having fallen in love first because of her voice and the way she plays the koto. The arrangements of her jūnihitoe robes were, however, described as fitting those of an older lady. (She was hidden in the beginning behind the sudare screen, however, as part of the courtly Heian rituals, the 12-layered sleeves were allowed to peek from under the screen. Based on the colour-arrangements, the suitor could see what kind of taste and status his lady had.) Modern scholars, however, speculate that Suetsumuhana's nose, which was described in the \\"Genji\\" as being red and that of an elephant, probably resembles today's European noses. The ideal of female beauty in Heian was to have very fine, thin noses, as depicted in the painted scrolls. Anything that fell outside this courtly beauty ideal must have been seen as utterly obscene.

Nekemte (; ), also called Nakamti, is a market town and separate woreda in western Ethiopia. Located in the East Welega Zone of the Oromia Region, Nekemte has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation of 2,088 meters. Nekemte was the capital of the former Welega Province, and is home to a museum of Wollega Oromo culture. It is a burial place of Onesimos Nesib, a famous Oromo who translated the Bible to Oromo Language for the first time, in collaboration with Aster Ganno. It is also the seat of an Apostolic Vicariate of the Roman Catholic Church.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 27 January 2008) Nekemte is host city to the newly built Wollega University as of 2007. It is served by an airport that is not currently open to commercial flights. Some places in Nekemte city. Some places in Nekemte city. Nekemte is at the center of the road network for south-western Ethiopia. The first major road dates to the early 1930s, with a road that extended from the capital Addis Ababa west through Addis Alem, although the road was passable only by lorries for the 255 kilometers between Addis Alem and Nekemte.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University, 1968), p. 293. Pankhurst later notes in his book that this road had five toll-gates (p. 522). A road connecting Nekemte to Gimbi, 110 kilometers in length, was part of the first stage of the Third Highway Program in 1963. Postal service for this city has been present as early as 1923. A branch of the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority began providing electricity to the city by 1960. By 1957, phone service extended to the city.  History  Nekemte like most of the towns of the Welega Province grew as a result of the rise of agricultural surplus after the Oromo became permanently settled in the early in the late 16th-century. Its rise was also closely connected with the rise of the Oromo institution of gada, a system where every 8 years leadership in the community was transferred to a new age class of leaders.[Ta'a, Tesema. \\"The Process of Urbanization in Wollega, Western Ethiopia: The Case of Neqemte.\\" Journal of Ethiopian Studies 26, no. 1 (1993): 59-72. Accessed April 29, 2020. www.jstor.org/stable/41966012. Nekemte was formerly overshadowed by nearby Lieka and Bilo, the former regional markets. Nekemte acquired some importance when Bekere Godana in 1841 extended his rule of Nekemte over more area to form a new polity.[Ta'a, Tesema. \\"The Process of Urbanization in Wollega, Western Ethiopia: The Case of Neqemte.\\" Journal of Ethiopian Studies 26, no. 1 (1993): 59-72.

Under Mereda's son Kumsa Moroda (Gebregziabher Moroda after converting to Christianity), the town continued in its importance as it submitted to Shewan rule. The Russian explorer Alexander Bulatovich visited Nekemte 13 March 1897; in memoirs he describes its marketplace as \\"a very lively place and presents a motley mixture of languages, dress, and peoples\\", and carefully described the paintings in the town's newly constructed Ethiopian Orthodox church.From Entotto to the River Baro (1897), translated by Richard Selzer, Ethiopia through Russian Eyes: Country in Transition, 1896-1898 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 2000) (accessed 2 November 2009) In 1905, a central government customs office was officially opened in Nekemte. Construction on a hospital began in 1927, and was completed in 1932 with Swedish funds as well as contributions from Ras Tafari (who later became Emperor Haile Selassie). It formally opened 16 February 1932, although it had already been in operation for eight months. The artist Daniel Twafe was born in 1934 in or near Nekemte. He studied in the United States in 1955-1957 and in Paris in 1971. He made more sculptures than paintings and became employed at the National Museum in Addis Ababa. Another from in this area was Mamo Tessema, who was born in 1935. He was trained at the Handicraft School in the school and went to the US for higher studies in 1958. He designed ceramics and also wrote some publications. By 1935 Nekemte had become the most important town in Welega. There were nearly 70 foreign residents before the Italian occupation, mostly merchants and missionaries. 23 importers-exporters had agencies there, most of whom were Indians, but these also included two Greeks, a Lebanese, and an Armenian.Pankhurst, Economic History, p. 450 The British explorer Dunlop, who spent four days of the same year in that town, noted that its central location on the main trade route between Addis Ababa and the Anglo-Sudan led to it having \\"developed enormously during the preceding few years, as the new school, warehouses, stores, and hospital testified\\".A. Dunlop, \\"The Dadessa Valley\\", Geographical Journal, 89 (1937), p. 512 During the Italian invasion, Nekemte was bombed by the Italians 5 July 1936; this included dropping 19 bombs on the recently constructed school complex of the local Swedish mission. Dejazmach Habte Maryam, governor of Welega, accepted the Italians and received Colonel A. Marone who arrived by air on 14 October and the troops of Colonel Malta who reached the town on 24 October, after having marched by foot and mule for twelve days from Addis Alem, which weakened Ras Imru Haile Selassie's attempts as Prince Regent to establish a center of resistance at Gore. After his successful return to Ethiopia, on 20 May 1941 Emperor Haile Selassie visited Welega where fighting still continued and where Kebede Tesemma was in charge of the Arbegnoch. When he attempted to visit Nekemte, his party came under artillery fire. A public address system was installed in the central square in Nekemte (and in ten other towns) in 1955, used for receiving transmission from Radio Addis Ababa and re- broadcasting it. In 1957 Haile Sellasie I School was opened, one of nine provincial secondary schools in Ethiopia and outside Eritrea. At that time Nekemte was still the end point of the telephone line westward. The Tafari Makonnen Leprosarium (founded that year) also had a home-school for children of leprous parents. Head of State Mengistu Haile Mariam visited Nekemte during a formal tour in March–May 1979. In that same year, over 300 Evangelical Christians had been imprisoned for political reasons. Early in 1991, the Ethiopian Fourth Revolutionary Army had its headquarters at Nekemte. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front captured Nekemte on 2 April 1991, as part of Operation Freedom and Equality (Duula Bilisummaa fi Walqixxummaa). In response, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) said in a broadcast on the Radio Voice of Oromo Liberation (Frankfurt am Main) on 15 April 1991: \\"The OLF strongly opposes the phrase: liberating Wellega or the Oromo nation. It is false for any alien force to say that it will liberate the Oromo nation.\\" After the Ethiopian trade mission in the Somaliland city of Hargeisa was hit by a suicide bomb attack, which killed at least four Ethiopian civilian lives on 29 October 2008, three human rights activists working for the Ethiopian Human Rights Council in Nekemte were arrested, but were released by 27 November.\\"Ethiopia: Charge or Free Ethnic Oromo Terrorism Suspects\\", Human Rights Watch website, 27 November 2009 (accessed 17 March 2009)  Climate  The city has a mil highland subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwb). With a higher elevation less than Adis Ababa, Nekemte has a slightly higher average temperature, differing mainly in the low averages. The average annual temperature is 18.3 °C (high: 24 °C and low: 12.6 °C), although to the north of Equator March is the warmest month and July the coldest month. It has one of the highest rainfall in Ethiopia in a short time. With more than 2080 mm, it is one of the rainiest places in the country. Nekemte is on an imaginary line where the western winds give places to the orient winds. It is one of the seven rainiest cities in the country. Recently in the last decade the annual average temperature of single meteorological station had a reduction of the average annual temperature to the value of the beginning of the decade of 1990, but are still higher than since the beginning of the record: around the year of 1970. The last few years of record had a greater precipitate at the same time as during a period of the 1980s there was one of the most sealed years of record history.

While his early works have Romantic tendencies, in later years he was influenced by Realist literature. His stories and novels often had strong satiric overtones and represent harsh criticism to injustice in Croatian society of his time. One of his novels, Među žabari, remained unfinished because citizens of Karlovac protested after reading its first paragraphs in a local newspaper. left The best known work of Ante Kovačić is semi-autobiographic novel U registraturi (1888). In it he expressed great deal of sympathy for common Croatian people, most notably peasants whom he saw as superior to snobbish citizenry. Kovačić was known as a staunch supporter of Ante Starčević and his Croatian Party of Rights. As such he was bitterly opposed to Ivan Mažuranić and wrote literal travesty of Mažuranić's poem The Death of Smail-aga Čengić.Death of Smail-aga Čengić In his later years, Kovačić began to show symptoms of mental disorder which gradually affected his work, including the last chapters of U registraturi. U registraturi, combining biting social satire, naturalist descriptions of Croatian bureaucracy and peasantry, as well as fascination with the supernatural inherited from Romanticism, nevertheless remained the most powerful 19th century Croatian novel and one of the most enduring novels in Croatian history.

The beer has been produced in a number of varieties. Grain Belt Golden was the original style introduced in 1893.Grain Belt History grainbelt.com. Retrieved: December 12, 2013. The current offerings are: Grain Belt Premium, first introduced in 1947; Grain Belt Premium Light; Grain Belt Nordeast, introduced on April 7, 2010; and the newest offering, Grain Belt Lock & Dam, introduced in 2016. It was originally produced by the Minneapolis Brewing Company which formed with the merger of four smaller brewers in 1891. Soon after introduction, Grain Belt became the company's flagship product. It was brewed at the original Grain Belt brewery in Minneapolis, Minnesota until 1976. A series of other owners followed, and Schell took over the product line in 2002. History =Name and logo= The name refers to the \\"Grain Belt\\" of the American Midwest where much of the world's supply of barley, corn, soybeans and other grains are produced. The diamond-shaped logo was introduced early on, though it wasn't until the late 1930s that a rendering of a bottlecap was added in the background. =Early history= Grain Belt Golden, a traditional golden German-style lager, was popular, but Prohibition halted production from 1920 until 1933. The company temporarily changed its name to Golden Grain Juice Company and, like many other brewers, turned to making near beer and soft drinks until repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. Grain Belt Beer returned to taverns in October 1933 with bottled beer reappearing in December 1933. World War II brought rationing, and the company briefly had to drop cans altogether and resort to using green glass in its bottles, rather than the standard amber color which offered better protection from light. Sale of beer in bottles and cans had become dominant over draft sales in drinking establishments, so the brewer experimented with all sorts of packaging innovations, expanding the line after the war ended. A premium beer, called Grain Belt Premium, entered production in 1947. Conetop cans sealed with caps disappeared in the 1950s in favor of flat-top steel cans. =Grain Belt Breweries= Minneapolis Brewing company officially changed its name to Grain Belt Breweries in 1967 after purchasing the Storz Brewing Company of Omaha, Nebraska, United States, which marketed Storz Beer and Storz Tap Beer in bottles, cans and draft. Grain Belt also took over the line of the New Ulm, Minnesota-based Hauenstein Brewery two years later. The company's main slogan — intoned by a deep male voice on TV ads — was, \\"Been a long time a-brewing.\\" Eventually Grain Belt introduced a new beer called GBX Malt Liquor. For many years, the company also brewed Grain Belt Bock Beer for limited release in the spring. Grain Belt billboard signs could be seen on the scoreboard at Minnesota Vikings games and the beer was a popular choice in the stands at Minnesota Twins games. The label featured the image of a bubbling water fountain, which had been built on the park-like grounds of the brewery to tout the pure water used in the brewing process. Another ad slogan was, \\"From perfect brewing water....\\" At the end of the 1960s, Grain Belt was the 18th-largest brewing company in the US, and a major force in the Midwest. Primary competitors up to this point had been local rivals, Theodore Hamm and Jacob Schmidt, both in St. Paul, Gluek Brewing Company, in Minneapolis, Cold Spring Brewing Company in Cold Spring, Minnesota and a few other regional brewers. Business began to decline as better- capitalized national brewing companies such as Anheuser-Busch, Schlitz and Miller began targeting the markets of regional brewers like Grain Belt. These companies swooped into markets, often advertising heavily, dropping prices and forcing regional brands like Grain Belt into the background since the smaller regional brewers were unable to match the big brewer's advertising and promotional budgets. In 1975, stockholders decided to sell the Grain Belt company to area businessman Irwin Jacobs, and operation ceased by the end of the year. =Decline= In 1976 the remains were sold to G. Heileman Brewing Company (based in La Crosse, Wisconsin), which closed the original Minneapolis brewery and moved production to the former Jacob Schmidt brewery in St. Paul, Minnesota, which Heileman had purchased only a few years before. At the St. Paul facility, former rivals Grain Belt and Schmidt were brewed side by side with Heileman stablemates Old Style and Special Export for many years. Heileman also launched a low calorie version of Grain Belt called Grain Belt Light. =Changes= In 1989, G. Heileman, citing over-capacity, closed the St. Paul brewery and moved production of Grain Belt to its La Crosse, Wisconsin brewery, taking production of the Grain Belt (and Schmidt) brands out of the Twin Cities for the first time. G. Heileman found itself faltering within a decade because of many of the same market pressures Grain Belt Breweries had faced in the 1970s. A group of investors was formed to purchase the Schmidt plant from Heileman. They also negotiated with Heileman to obtain the Schmidt brand, but Heileman declined to sell it. Instead, it offered the investors the rights to the Grain Belt brand. The investors accepted the counter offer, as it was a recognizable, established Twin Cities brand which it could market. The new company was called the Minnesota Brewing Company 1991. It thrived during the 1990s with sales peaking in 1996. Minnesota Brewing also performed extensive contract brewing for other beverage companies to improve efficiency and keep the plant operating closer to capacity. A Grain Belt beer can New Ownership In 2001, the company launched a line of specialty craft beers under the \\"Brewer's Cave\\" and \\"Grain Belt Archive Series\\" brand names. These beers were high quality, all-malt products brewed without adjunct grains such as corn or rice. Most were highly hopped and very flavorful to appeal to the new breed of craft beer drinkers. Unfortunately, in a classic case of \\"too little, too late\\", these fine Grain Belt beers came a bit late to save the company, which was facing financial problems. History repeated itself yet again, and by 2001 sales were off 50% from their 1996 highs. The company's debt deepened, and Minnesota Brewing filed for bankruptcy in February 2002. On June 24, 2002 the brewery's doors were closed. The Grain Belt brand was bought in August 2002 by a longtime rival Minnesota brewer, the August Schell Brewing Company of New Ulm. Schell's brews and packages Grain Belt Premium, Grain Belt Premium Light, Grain Belt Nordeast, and Grain Belt Lock & Dam, primarily for the Minnesota market. Grain Belt Premium has since become Schell's most popular brand, and has earned an especially strong following in the younger demographic of the region. On February 16, 2018, Schell's announced that it would be adding to the Grain Belt family by canning its Grain Belt BLU variety (previously a Minnesota State Fair and limited release variety).https://twitter.com/GrainBeltBeer/status/964583425322733569 Starting in 2015, Grain Belt released limited-edition 12 packs featuring football-themed labels and bottle cap games.https://beta.thedieline.com/blog/2015/9/21/new-grain-belt-beer-for- football-season Architectural legacy =The former brewery= The former brewery building in Northeast, Minneapolis, located north of Broadway Street Northeast on the east bank of the Mississippi River, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.Minneapolis Brewing Company Historic District minneapolis.mn.us.

The 1964 addition to the warehouse will be demolished as part of the development of Sheridan Memorial Park. =Sign on Nicollet Island= In 1941, a 48-foot-high sign with the Grain Belt logo, illuminated by a mix of neon tubes and incandescent bulbs, was placed on the roof of the Marigold Ballroom in downtown Minneapolis. In 1950, the sign was moved to Nicollet Island, next to the Hennepin Avenue Bridge, and an illuminated green frame added around the logo. The sign sits on Nicollet Island, an island in the Mississippi, and is part of the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District.https://historicminneapolissigns.wordpress.com/signs/grain-belt-beer/ The sign was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. The sign's illumination failed sometime after 1966; it was restored in 1989 and the sign lit intermittently until 1996. On December 30, 2017, the sign was again relit following a 15-year restoration campaign and the replacement of all the neon tubes and incandescent bulbs with LEDs.

It is home to an English-speaking congregation which is affiliated to the Church of Scotland and to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (formerly Dutch Reformed Church). It comes under the Church of Scotland's International Presbytery, and is also known as the Scots Kirk in Amsterdam. The current minister is Rev. Lance Stone. Visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the English Reformed Church History The address of the church, Begijnhof 48, indicates its origins. The Begijnhof, an enclosed courtyard, was a 14th-century residence for the sisterhood of the Catholic Beguines, and the church was originally established as their chapel. It was confiscated from the Catholic lay sisterhood during the Reformation. For this reason, the church is invisible from the street and can only be discovered by entering the courtyard through an inconspicuous archway. As with other city churches, the keys of the chapel were surrendered to the Municipality when Amsterdam sided officially with the Prince of Orange and formally adopted Calvinist doctrines in 1578. The church, controlled by the Beguines, was taken by the city council and closed. In 1607, the church was re-opened for worship when the Municipality presented it to the English- speaking Protestants living in the city. Since then, services in English have continued practically without interruption to the present day. The Catholic Beguines, deprived of their former oratory and daily Mass, who continued to live in several houses of the Begijnhof, refused to re-enter the chapel as they considered it \\"desecrated by heresy\\". The dissenting English Protestants in Amsterdam in the early days of the English Church included a number, who, within a few years of their arrival in the city, left to form a separate congregation in Leiden and to sail via Delfshaven and Plymouth (in England) on the Mayflower to the New World in 1620. These Pilgrim Fathers are remembered in stained glass and memorials both within and outside the church. In 1817—in the immediate aftermath of Napoleon's defeat and the restoration of rule by the House of Orange—ownership of the building was formally passed to the congregation, by then known as the English Reformed Church (\\"ERC\\"). It holds a regular Sunday morning service as well as other services and activities in the church. The ERC currently has 320 members from 30 nationalities. The church can seat 385 and attracts congregations of over 250 on a regular basis. Since the late 1970s, the church has provided Amsterdam with an important platform for the performance of chamber music of all periods and styles with over 70 concerts a year. In particular, it has given many young artists the opportunity to launch their careers. The Academy of the Begijnhof, founded by a former church organist, is now one of Amsterdam's premier baroque orchestras. To mark the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the English Reformed Church Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited the church on 5 February 2007. She attended a normal church service, accompanied by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.

Alternatively the term Isopet-Avionnet indicates that the fables are drawn from both Aesop and Avianus. The fables of Marie de France A miniature from a mediaeval book of hours The origin of the term 'Ysopet' dates back to the twelfth century, where it was first used by Marie de France, whose collection of 102 fables, written in Anglo-Norman octosyllabic couplets, she claims to have translated from an original work by Alfred the Great. Since there is no evidence of any such Old English material, this has been disputed.Martin, Mary Lou: The Fables of Marie de France: an English translation, Birmingham AL, 1979, pp.22-24 The fables come from a variety of sources and feature not simply animals (and insects) but human beings as well. The first forty correspond to one of the Romulus collections of Aesop but even here there are variations. The story she calls \\"The Dog and the Cheese\\" differs from Classical versions of The Dog and its Reflection precisely in the detail that it is cheese rather than a bone or piece of meat that it is carrying. Many other stories make their first appearance in the Ysopet, particularly those featuring human beings. One at least, The Mouse Takes a Wife, only appears for the first time in the West but has earlier eastern analogues. Others still fit into well established categories of folk tale and suggest an oral transmission. The morals It is in drawing moral conclusions from the behaviour of the characters involved that Marie is at her most individual, reflecting the realities of 12th century feudal society at the same time as concern for the individual welfare of those within it. While she accepts its stratification, her criticism of those who abuse their position is sharp and her sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden is obvious. In particular she criticizes the inequalities of the legal system (The Wolf and the Lamb, The Dog and the Sheep), injudicious choice of deputy and betrayal of faith. Marie's portrayal of women in particular is two-edged and not always consistent. In the tale of The Wife and her Husband, where a resourceful wife persuades the husband that he has not really seen her in bed with another man, Marie remarks that 'good sense and imagination are more valuable and useful to many people than their money or their family'. But in the similar situation of The Wife and Her Husband in the Forest she concludes that 'for this reason women are criticized for their deceptiveness: these lying tricksters have more art than the devil.' The humorous ending of the otherwise horrifying story of The Man and the Wife Who Quarreled, in which a husband cuts out the tongue of his wife only to have her continue their quarrel in sign language, draws from Marie the wry comment that 'This fable shows what one can often see: if a fool talks foolishness and someone else comes along and speaks sense to him, he won't believe it but gets angry instead. Even when he knows he is absolutely in the wrong, he wants to have the last say, and no one can make him shut up.' The change of gender at the end indicates that for Marie, as for Jean de la Fontaine five centuries later, 'Many men are women too' (Fables VI.6). Her main concern is not gender politics but, as throughout the Ysopet, the wise, foolish or vicious use of the tongue.

The band consists of Takaakira \\"Taka\\" Goto (electric guitar, glockenspiel), Hideki \\"Yoda\\" Suematsu (electric guitar, glockenspiel), Dahm Majuri Cipolla (drums), and Tamaki Kunishi (bass guitar, electric guitar, piano, glockenspiel). Mono have released nine studio albums. The band spent their early years, from 1999 to 2003, touring Asia, Europe, and America continuously, and released two studio albums, Under the Pipal Tree (2001) and One Step More and You Die (2002) on the Tzadik Records and Music Mine Inc. record labels, respectively. From 2004 to 2007, Mono signed to Temporary Residence Limited, released two more studio albums, Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined (2004) and You Are There (2006), and toured worldwide in their support. In 2008, the band took a break, returning one year later with a new studio album, Hymn to the Immortal Wind (2009), also on Temporary Residence Limited. During the tour that followed they recorded a live album, Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra which was released in 2010. In October 2016 the band released their ninth studio album, titled Requiem for Hell. Their most recent effort, 'Nowhere Now Here' was released on January 25, 2019 through Pelagic Records, and was produced by the band's longtime friend Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago. It also contains Tamaki's first vocals for the band on the track 'Breathe'. The band have cited a variety of experimental, avant-rock and classical music artists as inspirations but stated that their aim is to transcend genre, rejecting the post-rock label which has often been applied to them. Mono's sound is characterised by the lead and rhythm guitars of Goto and Yoda respectively, both of whom make extensive use of reverb, distortion and delay effects. The band's live performances are noted for their intensity, both in the playing and in the dynamics. History Electric guitarist \\"Yoda\\" in 2007 =Formation and early years: 1999–2000= In January 1999, Tokyo native electric guitarist Takaakira \\"Taka\\" Goto began composing music and spent the remainder of the year searching for other musicians with which to form an instrumental rock band; eventually recruiting long-time friend and fellow electric guitarist Hideki \\"Yoda\\" Suematsu on rhythm guitar. By December 1999, Tamaki Kunishi and Yasunori Takada had joined Mono on bass guitar and drums, respectively. The band played their first show in late January 2000, at Club 251 in Setagaya, Tokyo. In May 2000, the band entered Rinky Dink Studio in Tokyo and recorded their first extended play with engineers Tetsuya Morioka and Toshiro Kai, which was later self-released in September 2000: a Japan-only release titled Hey, You on their own independent record label, Forty-4. The band spent the bulk of the year composing more music and performing at various houses around Tokyo, in the neighbourhoods of Setagaya, Shimokitazawa, and Shibuya. Mono also travelled to the United States to play a one-off show in November at the Mercury Lounge in New York City; a show which was later described by Paul Wheeler of rockofjapan.com as having a \\"big beautiful sound that [...] naturally [expanded] through each song.\\" =Under the Pipal Tree: 2001= Following the release of the Hey, You extended play, Mono spent the next year playing shows throughout their native Japan, as well as playing several shows in New York City and Sweden. The band also made an appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. Between performing in Japan, Mono recorded their first studio album, Under the Pipal Tree at Studio Take-1 and Forty-4 in Tokyo. The majority of the tracks were recorded live (a trend which the band would adopt for all subsequent studio albums) in one day, the recording session of which was funded by experimental American musician John Zorn, with the band handling production duties. The album featured two previously released tracks (from the Hey, You extended play), as well as six original compositions. The album was released worldwide through New York City record label Tzadik, owned and operated by John Zorn. =One Step More and You Die: 2002–2003= After the release of Under the Pipal Tree, the band spent the next year touring Japan and the United States, also visiting Germany and Taiwan in support of the album, as well as composing new material inspired by the tour. In June 2002, between shows in Japan, the band recorded their second studio album, One Step More and You Die at Little Bach and Sound City studios in Tokyo, with Mono again handling production duties. The album was released in Japan in October of that year on Japanese record label Music Mine Inc. The band spent most of 2003 touring in support of the album, returning to Japan, the United States, Sweden, and visiting Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom for the first time. =Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined: 2004= Mono's next release was a collaboration with Japanese musician Aki Onda; whom the band met while touring New York in 2002. The band, Onda, and several notable members of the New York experimental music scene (including DJ Olive, Jackie-O Motherfucker, and Loren Connors) remixed One Step More and You Die. The album, titled New York Soundtracks, was released in February 2004 on Human Highway, Mono's own record label, and a successor to Forty-4. In January 2004, the band began a long partnership with Chicagoan recording engineer Steve Albini, recording their third studio album at Electrical Audio Engineering in Chicago, Illinois. The album, titled Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined was released in April 2004 on Human Highway in Japan, and on Rykodisk in Europe and Temporary Residence Limited in the United States later in the year. After the album's release, the band embarked upon a year-long tour of America, Asia, and Europe. =You Are There: 2005–2007= Mono in Stockholm, Sweden, May 2005 The band also spent 2005 touring Asia, America, and Europe composing music, and eventually returning to Electrical Audio Engineering in February and September to record their fourth studio album with Steve Albini. The album, titled You Are There was released in Japan in March 2006 on Human Highway, and on Temporary Residence Limited in the United States and Europe. Mono also collaborated with Japanese musician World's End Girlfriend in 2005, releasing a collaboration studio album in December of that year, on Human Highway, and with American band Pelican, releasing a split album with the band through Temporary Residence Limited in October 2005. In February 2007, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted their split with World's End Girlfriend Palmless Paryaer / Mass Murder Refrain No. 7 on their 2006 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame. Mono spent 2006 and 2007 touring Asia, America and Europe in support of You Are There. In October 2006, the band returned to Electrical Audio Engineering and recorded a four-track extended play, which was released in April 2007 as part of Temporary Residence Limited's Travels in Constants series, titled The Phoenix Tree. In November 2006, the band released a two- track extended play titled Memorie dal Futuro through Vinyl Films, and also contributed a track to a Temporary Residence Limited compilation album, Thankful. In September 2007, the band released their first compilation album, compiling material from all previous extended plays, split albums, and compilations, titled Gone: A Collection of EPs 2000–2007, as well as the music documentary DVD, The Sky Remains the Same as Ever, documenting the worldwide tours of 2006 and 2007 and the recording of The Phoenix Tree extended play. =Hymn to the Immortal Wind: 2008–2011= Mono in Prague, Czech Republic, April 2010 In 2008, the band took a year-long break from touring, spending the time composing new music and playing a handful of shows throughout the year, including an appearance at All Tomorrow's Parties in Somerset, England, curated by Explosions in the Sky in May. Mono returned to Electrical Audio Engineering in June and November 2008 to record their fifth studio album, Hymn to the Immortal Wind, which was later released in March 2009, and followed by a year-long tour of America and Eurasia. The band played a ten-year anniversary show at the Society for Ethical Culture Hall in New York, United States on 8 May 2009, accompanied by the 24-piece Wordless Music Orchestra. The performance was recorded and later released as both a live album and a DVD, named Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra, through Temporary Residence Limited in Europe and America, and Human Highway in Asia. The band then took another year-long break and went into \\"hibernation mode\\", returning to Japan to work on songs for a new album. =For My Parents: 2012–2014= Mono spent early 2012 recording a new album at Waterfront Studios in Hudson, New York, with recording engineers Henry Hirsch, accompanied by the Wordless Music Orchestra. The album was mixed by Fred Weaver at his studio, Apocalypse the Apocalypse, in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. For My Parents was MONO's first record in eight years not to be recorded by Steve Albini at Electrical Audio Studios in Chicago. For My Parents, was released on 4 September 2012, through Temporary Residence Limited. The band's press release for For My Parents states \\"We hope that this album serves as a gift from child to parent. While everything else continues to change, this love remains a constant throughout time.\\" =The Last Dawn/Rays of Darkness: 2014–2016= Mono released a double album on 24 October 2014, two contrasting records: The Last Dawn, being a more traditional Mono record; and Rays of Darkness, some of their heaviest material, even more notable for the first use of vocals on The Hand That Holds The Truth. The two were released on Temporary Residence Limited in North American and Pelagic Records elsewhere. =Requiem for Hell: 2016–2019= Mono announced the forthcoming release of Requiem For Hell on 19 July 2016, their ninth studio album. It reintroduces strings to their sound. It was also their first full album under the newly formed label Pelagic Records. Prior to the full release of Requiem For Hell they did a split album with The Ocean (Transcendental) to commemorate this event. Later it was known that it was actually a sneak peek of the first two songs of their upcoming album. On December 9, 2017 they announced via their social media pages that Yasunori Takada (drum kit, glockenspiel, synthesizer), who has been a member since the start, will leave the band due to \\"personal reasons.\\" He was replaced by Dahm Majuri Cipolla beginning with the band's live performance on August 9, 2018. Starting in August 2018, they worked on their next project with Steve Albini at Electrical once again. On September 25, 2018, the new album was revealed to be called Nowhere Now Here, their first with Cipolla, it was released January 25, 2019. = Hymn to the Immortal Wind (10 Year Anniversary Edition):2019-present = To commemorate the 20th anniversary of MONO, and the 10th anniversary of Hymn to the Immortal Wind, Temporary Residence Ltd. released Hymn to the Immortal Wind - Anniversary Edition. Featuring remastered versions of the original. Musical style Although Mono's musical style has developed throughout their career, it has primarily been characterised by dynamic, guitar-based instrumental soundscapes, the majority of which are composed by lead guitarist Takaakira Goto, in an attempt to channel and express the emotions of joy and sorrow. The band's style of music originally featured elements of minimalism and noise, and later developed to integrate more complex, orchestral arrangements and instrumentation. Mono's music has been categorised as both contemporary classical and post-rock, but Goto has stated: Goto performing in 2007; the band provides an emotional live performance Mono has toured worldwide several times. Their live show tends to feature intense and emotional playing by the band members, as well as using extreme dynamics (in crescendos as well as diminuendos) in their attempt to create an \\"unforgettable\\" live performance. When recording their music, the band has always played live in the studio and, from 2004's Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined to 2009's Hymn to the Immortal Wind, worked with Chicagoan recording engineer Steve Albini, whom they feel accurately captured a live band's \\"raw emotion to [magnetic] tape.\\" =Influences= Mono has drawn influence from various musical and non-musical sources throughout their career. When the band first formed, their main influences were American experimental rock band Sonic Youth and Anglo-Irish shoegaze band My Bloody Valentine when making Under the Pipal Tree and One Step More and You Die. As the band broadened their musical tastes, starting with the album, Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined, they began to be influenced by music from sources such as German classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven, Italian film score composer Ennio Morricone, and later Polish minimalist composer Henryk Górecki, among others. Lead guitarist Takaakira Goto has also acknowledged Danish film director Lars von Trier (in particular the 1996 film, Breaking the Waves) as a major influence since the band's formation, in terms of expressing the different depths and heights of emotion. =Instrumentation= Instruments of the band (2007 at the Crocodile Cafe) In terms of instrumentation, Mono is a four-piece instrumental rock band. Goto, the group's lead guitarist, uses a 1966 Fender Jazzmaster through Boss, Danelectro, SiB, and Morley effects pedals, into a Fender Twin, a Marshall JCM 2000 head, and a Marshall cabinet for amplification. Yoda, the rhythm guitarist, uses a 1974 Fender Stratocaster through Boss, Tech 21 and Pro Co effects pedals, into a Fender Twin for amplification. Kunishi, the group's bass guitarist, pianist and occasional guitarist uses a 1966 Gibson EB-3 through Boss, TC Electronic, and Tech 21 effects pedals, into an Ampeg B2-R head and a Sunn bass cabinet, as well as a Fender Rhodes, and a Fender Jazzmaster. Takada, the drummer, uses a four-piece 1970s Ludwig drum kit, with Zildjian, Sabian, and Paiste cymbals, as well as a Korg microKORG synthesizer. As the band's career has progressed, they have incorporated string sections on record, beginning with Under the Pipal Tree, which featured use of cello, continuing with One Step More and You Die and Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined which both featured string quartets, and You Are There, which featured a string quintet. On Hymn to the Immortal Wind, the band made use of a 28-piece chamber orchestra.

Their main product was a flavored liquid containing aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide, which acts to neutralize or reduce stomach acid, for the purpose of relieving the symptoms of indigestion, heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and also stomach or duodenal ulcers. In large doses, it can act as a laxative. The trademark is owned by Novartis International AG, and was first produced commercially in 1949. The acronym ‘MAALOX’ refers to the solution’s compositional elements: MAgnesium and ALuminium as OXides of hydrogen, in an anionic, aqueous hydroxide solution. This reacts with cationic, aqueous hydrochloride found in the gut, resulting in ion-exchange neutralisation of the acid base into water and/or salt. Some may find certain Maalox medications, such as Maalox Multi-Action, to be a successful anti-diarrhea treatment due to the aluminium hydroxide content, which in normal situations has a tendency to result in constipation. Maalox may also be used to treat nausea and stomach cramps associated with dyspepsia, diarrhea, or constipation. History Alison Howe Price, M.D. Maalox was developed in a collaboration between William H. Rorer, Inc., and a medical doctor and researcher specializing in gastrointestinal issues, Alison Howe Price from Philadelphia. The collaboration occurred after World War II when Claude Newhart, a salesman and pharmacist for the company, had an idea that he thought might change the company's fortunes. According to the Rorer family, he suggested that instead of selling pain relievers manufactured by others, they should create their own products. Gerald Rorer, then President of Rorer, told Newhart to \\"go and find something.\\" Newhart took up the challenge and contacted an old acquaintance from his student days working at a Philadelphia drugstore, Martin H. Rehfuss, who happened to be chief of medicine at Thomas Jefferson Hospital. It was Rehfuss who introduced Newhart to Price. Soon thereafter, Newhart convinced Price to become a consultant for the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania based Willam H. Rorer, Inc. In the end, Maalox became the first product the partnership produced.Wallace, Andy. \\"Claude Newhart, 87; helped develop Maalox\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, 20 May 1995, p.C7 Maalox eventually became the world's best selling antacid and forever changed the company's fortunes. Ingredients =Liquid= Liquid Maalox contains aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and simethicone. =Tablets= Maalox Regular Strength chewable tablets contain 600 mg of calcium carbonate. Maalox Extra Strength + Anti-Gas tablets contain 1000 mg of calcium carbonate and 60 mg of simethicone. Uses Maalox is used to treat moderate dyspepsia, which includes symptoms of a burning sensation in the stomach or chest area, bloating, and/or gas pain, especially occurring after meals. It is used in combination with oxycodone to treat esophageal pain in cancer therapy patients. It is also a common component of a GI cocktail used in emergency rooms. Maalox is used in scientific research to simulate for silt/mud/soil in water, along with other dissolved particulates. The particulate size exceeds 11 micrometres. Maalox can be used as a standalone antacid treatment or in conjunction with prescription strength medication such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers. Activists in the United States, the Czech Republic, Venezuela, and Turkey have reported using Maalox or other antacid solutions diluted with water as a home remedy for tear gas attacks. Side effects Maalox generally doesn’t produce serious side effects in individuals who use it for less than two weeks, but some mild side effects may appear. Possible side effects of Maalox include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and headaches. These symptoms generally go away without further treatment. It may be necessary to contact a doctor if these symptoms become severe or persist for long periods of time. Maalox has been linked to phosphate deficiencies in some individuals as a result of the aluminum binding to phosphate in the stomach. This causes the body to flush out this important chemical which can lead to a deficiency. Pregnancy Women who are pregnant can, with the permission of a health care provider, use this product as the aluminum content is deemed safe for the developing or nursing child. Individuals who suffer from kidney issues, however, should not take this product unless advised to do so by a doctor. Manufacturing suspension 2012 In February 2012, Novartis Consumer Health announced that they were temporarily, voluntarily suspending operations at the Novartis Consumer Health Lincoln facility that produces Maalox as well as suspending shipments. The shutdown was a result of inspections in 2011. \\"Two FDA inspections that year, about five months apart, noted numerous instances of the company not addressing consumer complaints and, in some cases, ignoring them.\\" At that time, Novartis decided to stop manufacturing Maalox at their Lincoln plant and to have third parties produce it. The problems at the Lincoln plant included the possibility of chipped particles from one medication being mixed into the bottles of other medications as well as 1,300 other consumer complaints. In August 2013, there was a recall of Maalox products. \\"The recall encompasses 9 different types of its Maalox chewable tablets, including more than 3.4 million bottles of Maalox Advanced Maximum Strength Antacid & Antigas.\\" They planned to restart production on a line-by-line basis, but the Maalox line had not by then been restarted. As at 2014, Novartis's Maalox brand was to be merged, along with other consumer brands, with the consumer brands of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). This was part of a $20 billion exchange of business units between the two companies.

Town is known as a tourist destination in the Aukštaitija National Park. Also, Ignalina is famous for the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in nearby Visaginas.  Legend  It is said that Ignalina has got its name from two lovers Lina, daughter of duke Budrys, and Ignas, captive of the crusaders, that people cursed and drowned in Ilgis Lake. Lina and Ignas are quite popular Lithuanian names. History Archeological findings and artefacts - mounds show that people lived in the territory of Ignalina already in 9th century. It is supposed that the territory of Ignalina earlier belonged to the ancient land of Nalšia, which was mentioned in 1229–1298. The toponyms and hidronyms demonstrate that it was inhabited by the Baltic tribe Selonians. Even though there is archeological evidence that people lived in Ignalina area in the Stone Age, Ignalina was mentioned only in 1810. It started to grow only after the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway was built in 1866. It is regarded as one of the new industrial cities. After World War I, the area was disputed between Poland and Lithuania. It was occupied by troops of Lucjan Żeligowski, and internationally recognized as part of the Second Polish Republic in 1923. Nonetheless, Lithuania continued to claim this territory. Before September 1939, Ignalina (Ignalino) was situated in the Wilno Voivodeship. Following the invasion of Poland, Ignalina became the capital of Ignalina eldership. More than half of the population was Jewish, 1200 people before the Holocaust. During World War II, in 1941, Jews were imprisoned in a ghetto and exploited through forced labour. They are later murdered in mass executions. In 1950 city become a capital of Ignalina District Municipality in Vilnius County. In 1995 Ignalina District Municipality become a part of Utena County.

Thus, an act is illegal without extrinsic proof of any surrounding circumstances such as lack of scienter (knowledge) or other defenses. Acts are made illegal per se by statute, constitution or case law. Drunk driving Many drunk driving laws make driving with a blood alcohol content over a certain limit (such as 0.05% or 0.08%) an act which is illegal per se. Antitrust In the United States, illegal per se often refers to categories of anti-competitive behavior in antitrust law conclusively presumed to be an \\"unreasonable restraint on trade\\" and thus anti competitive. The United States Supreme Court has, in the past, determined activities such as price fixing, geographic market division, and group boycott to be illegal per se regardless of the reasonableness of such actions. Traditionally, illegal per se anti- trust acts describe horizontal market arrangements among competitors. The illegal per se category can trace its origins in the 1898 Supreme Court case Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. U.S., 175 U.S. 211 (1898). A number of cases have subsequently raised doubts about the validity of the illegal per se rule. Under modern Antitrust theories, the traditionally illegal per se categories create more of a presumption of unreasonableness.See, for example, Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1 (1979); Nat's Collegiate Athletic Assn v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 98 (1984); Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 289 (1985); and FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447 (1986). The court carefully narrowed the per se treatment and began issuing guidelines. Courts and agencies seeking to apply the per se rule must: # show \\"the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output\\"; # show that the practice is not \\"one designed to 'increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive'\\"; # carefully examine market conditions; and # absent good evidence of competitiveness behavior, avoid broadening per se treatment to new or innovative business relationships.

It was the first half-hour Garfield TV special. It is directed by Phil Roman and features Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield the house cat, as well as the voices of Sandy Kenyon, Henry Corden and Gregg Berger. The special was first broadcast October 25, 1982 on CBS. It was a Nielsen ratings success and was nominated for two Emmy Awards. It was accompanied by a soundtrack album and a children's book adaptation and has been released on VHS and DVD. This was the first of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.  Plot  Garfield and Odie are outside harassing a neighbor's dog when the owner, Hubert, angrily calls the pound to capture them. When the dogcatcher arrives at the scene, Garfield flees, but Odie is too stupid to flee and is captured. Garfield decides to go home, but he is unable to tell Jon Arbuckle that Odie is in peril. Garfield soon realizes how boring life is without Odie around, so that night, Garfield decides to rescue him from the pound. Although Garfield successfully makes it to the pound, the dogcatcher captures him and later puts him behind bars, where Garfield learns from another cat, Fast Eddie, that Odie is going to be euthanized the next day. During the night, Garfield has a series of flashbacks of all the good times that he and Odie had playing together. The next day, Garfield tearfully watches the dogcatcher taking Odie down the hall to be euthanized. Meanwhile, a girl arrives at the pound for a pet and chooses Garfield. Garfield himself manages to see his chance to escape and when the cell finally opens, he runs out the cell and past the girl. The rest of the animals flood out of the cell, rescue Odie, and breaks down the pound door, with the knocked-out dogcatcher on it. As the animals run to freedom, Garfield and Odie return to Jon's house, where they knock down its front door while Jon tries to fix it. Jon bets that Garfield and Odie were having fun during the night while he was worried about them, and Garfield and Odie are bemused and indicate this is correct. At breakfast time, things return to normal as Garfield derides Odie's begging at the table, but decides to try it himself after seeing Odie get a steak from Jon. All Garfield gets from Jon is a plate of bacon and eggs, which he angrily throws back in to Jon's face before admitting: \\"I'm only human\\".  Voice cast   Soundtrack  Lou Rawls performed for the Here Comes Garfield soundtrack, inspired by Bill Cosby's Fat Albert cartoons. A soundtrack album for Here Comes Garfield was released on LP and cassette on Epic Records in 1982. It featured songs from and inspired by the television special, composed by Ed Bogas and Desirée Goyette and performed by Goyette and Lou Rawls. Some of these songs were released in re-recorded versions on the 1991 Am I Cool or What? album. = Track list = # \\"Here Comes Garfield\\" (Lou Rawls) # \\"Move Me\\" (Desirée Goyette) # \\"Foolin' Around\\" (Lou Rawls and Desirée Goyette) # \\"Long About Midnight\\" (Lou Rawls) # \\"Big Fat Hairy Deal\\" (Lou Rawls) # \\"Up On a Fence\\" (Desirée Goyette) # \\"Life Is Just a Roller Coaster\\" (Lou Rawls) # \\"So Long Old Friend\\" (Desirée Goyette) # \\"Together Again\\" (Lou Rawls and Desirée Goyette) # \\"Here Comes Garfield (Reprise)\\" (Desirée Goyette)  Production  Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz advised Jim Davis on the animation in Here Comes Garfield. Here Comes Garfield was Garfield creator Jim Davis' first television special, coming after his 1980 book Garfield At Large topped The New York Times bestsellers list. For the opening sequence, Garfield dances to the theme song. In 1981, Davis was working in a California studio on how to convincingly depict this, as in previous comics, the fictional cat always walked on all four feet. Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz was in the same studio that day, and redrew Davis' work, advising him, \\"The problem is, you've made Garfield's feet too small. Little tiny cat feet\\". Peanuts TV special producers Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelson also produced Here Comes Garfield, a consequence of the two comics sharing the same syndicate, United Media. Lou Rawls, who had just completed a USO tour at army bases, joined the Garfield franchise with this project, and finished recording the soundtrack in the summer of 1982. He explained his decision, \\"I figured if Bill Cosby could do Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids and live forever on the earnings, why can't I do Garfield?\\" Besides her contribution to the music, Desirée Goyette was also the performance model for Garfield's dance during the title song.  Broadcast and release  Here Comes Garfield was first aired by CBS, on October 25, 1982, along with the 1966 Peanuts special It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It was viewed by an audience of 50 million people. This was considered a good rating, leading to speculation CBS could launch a successful series of Garfield specials similar to the Peanuts specials. Ballantine Books published a 64-page illustrated book adaptation in September 1982. In July 2004, Here Comes Garfield was released on the DVD Garfield as Himself, along with Garfield on the Town (1983) and Garfield Gets a Life (1991).  Reception  At the 35th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1983, Here Comes Garfield was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and Phil Roman was nominated for the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animated Programming. In 2004, DVD Talk critic Randy Miller judged the Garfield as Himself specials to be \\"quite enjoyable,\\" highlighting \\"a daring dog pound rescue\\". The DVD debuted 35th in sales.

To the north, the Himalaya or lower parallel ranges beyond form the Ganges-Brahmaputra divide. On the west the Ganges Basin borders the Indus basin and then the Aravalli ridge. Southern limits are the Vindhyas and Chota Nagpur Plateau. On the east the Ganges merges with the Brahmaputra through a complex system of common distributaries into the Bay of Bengal. Its catchment lies in the states of Uttar Pradesh (294,364 km²), Madhya Pradesh (198,962 km²), Bihar (143,961 km²), Rajasthan (112,490 km²), West Bengal (71,485 km²), Haryana (34,341 km²), Himachal Pradesh (4,317 km²), Delhi, Arunachal pradesh(1,484 km²), the whole of Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. Several tributaries rise inside Tibet before flowing south through Nepal. The basin has a population of more than 500 million, making it the most populated river basin in the world. Description The basin comprises semi-arid valleys in the rain shadow north of the Himalaya, densely forested mountains south of the highest ranges, the scrubby Shiwalik foothills and the fertile Gangetic Plains. Central highlands south of the Gangetic Plain have plateaus, hills and mountains intersected by valleys and river plains. The important soil types found in the basin are sand, loam, clay and their combinations such as sandy loam, silty clay etc. The annual surface water potential of the basin has been assessed as 525 km³ in India, out of which 250 km³ is utilisable water. There is about 580,000 km² of arable land; 29.5% of the cultivable area of India. Water-related issues of the basin are due to both high and low flows. In India, the states of Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal are affected by floods. Bangladesh – at the confluence of Brahmaputra River and Ganges River – suffers from severe floods almost every year. Northern Ganges tributaries such as Kosi, Gandak and Mahananda are the most flood-prone, but southern tributaries also contribute. Low flows are caused by scarcity of rainfall outside the summer Monsoon, and sometimes by failure of this monsoon to develop to its normal extent. The Ganges is joined by Kosi, Ghaghra, Gandak from the Himalayas and by Chambal, Betwa, Son from the peninsular region. Culture and Ganges: The River Ganges (also referred to as Ganga) is a symbol of faith, hope, culture and sanity, as well as a source of livelihood for millions since time immemorial. She is the centre of social and religious tradition in the Indian sub-continent and particularly sacred in Hinduism. The very special faith and respect for the River Ganges in India are as old as Indian culture itself. These are amply reflected in such ancient Indian scriptures as: Vedas, Puranas, Mahabharata, Ramayana and several others. In fact, respect for Ganga is a part of Indian identity and the very symbol of Indian culture. The history of Ganga in nurturing culture and civilizations is appreciated through fostering native culture in its basin, shifting of the Indus-Sarasvati basin civilization into its fold, and promoting integration of cultures to develop Indian civilization.

Compared with other pasteurization processes, it maintains color and flavor better, but some cheeses were found to have varying responses to the process.The Effects of Flash Pasteurization of Milk upon the Flavor and Texture of Cheddar Cheese Flash pasteurization is performed to kill spoilage microorganisms prior to filling containers, in order to make the products safer and to extend their shelf life compared to the unpasteurised foodstuff. For example, one manufacturer gives the shelf life of its pasteurized milk as 12 months. It must be used in conjunction with sterile fill technology (similar to aseptic processing) to prevent post-pasteurization contamination. The liquid moves in a controlled, continuous flow while subjected to temperatures of 71.5 °C (160 °F) to 74 °C (165 °F), for about 15 to 30 seconds, followed by rapid cooling to between 4 °C (39.2 °F) and 5.5 °C (42 °F). The standard US protocol for flash pasteurization of milk, 71.7 °C (161 °F) for 15 seconds in order to kill Coxiella burnetii (the most heat-resistant pathogenic germ found in raw milk), was introduced in 1933, and results in 5-log reduction (99.999%) or greater reduction in harmful bacteria. An early adopter of pasteurization was Tropicana Products, which has used the method since the 1950s.press release, 10 December 1996 The juice company Odwalla switched from non-pasteurized to flash-pasteurized juices in 1996 after tainted unpasteurized apple juice containing E. coli O157:H7 sickened many children and killed one.Questions of Pasteurization Raised After E.

Windows Vista is the first version of Windows NT to include a version of Sysprep that was independent of the hardware abstraction layer (HAL), in the \\"out of box\\" installation. Purpose Desktop deployment is typically performed via disk cloning utility. Sysprep can be used to prepare an operating system for disk cloning and restoration via a disk image. Windows operating system installations include many unique elements per installation that need to be \\"generalized\\" before capturing and deploying a disk image to multiple computers. Some of these elements include: * Computer name * Security Identifier (SID) * Driver Cache Sysprep seeks to solve these issues by allowing for the generation of new computer names, unique SIDs, and custom driver cache databases during the Sysprep process. Administrators can use tools such as SetupMgr.exe (Windows XP) or the Windows Automated Installation Kit (Windows Vista/7/Server 2008) to generate answer files that Sysprep will process on new computer deployments. Alternatives to Sysprep Mark Russinovich of Sysinternals created a partial alternative to Sysprep, named NewSID, in 1997.

In 2008 the Festival was described as a \\"diverse, varied programme of events that underscores the organisers' desire to provide something for everyone\\", as well as a \\"showcase for Protestant tolerance and openness\\". Events included Bluegrass on the Walls, Children's Heritage Visual Art Workshops, drumming events, including some with members of the north west's African community, music of all kinds at the Verbal Arts Centre, Foyle Ulster Scots Highland Gathering, firework display, the fifth Annual Scottish Dance Competition, historical walks and talks, with the finale being the Relief of Derry Pageant (the Apprentice Boys of Derry 319th Relief of Derry Celebrations) on 9 August 2008. The Festival commemorates the actions of Protestant Apprentice Boys who shut the city gates against the forces of the Catholic King James in December 1688. King James laid siege to the city from December to August 1689 until the Protestant forces of William of Orange relieved the city. Festival co- ordinator Billy Moore described the Festival (in 2008) as \\"the way in which the Protestant community of Derry, a minority community, is able to make a contribution to the life of the city and to the diversity of expression of culture. From the outset we have themed the Maiden City Festival as a showcase for the Protestant culture of tolerance and openness, and a means of showcasing the heritage that is entrusted to the Apprentice Boys of Derry\\". Funding The festival had begun in a small way in 1998 but had been interrupted in 2006 and 2007, due to funding and organisational issues. Billy Moore, of the Apprentice Boys, was able to confirm the return of the Festival in 2008 thanks to funding from the Irish Government's Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as from Derry City Council and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. The Department of Foreign Affairs was the largest sponsor of the event, which costs approximately £50,000 to run, paying £27,000 towards the costs. Brochures for the festival, featured the logo of sponsors, including \\"Department of Foreign Affairs, An Roinn Gothic Eachtracha\\". Northern Ireland Government Departments funded the Festival to the tune of £100,000 in 2001–02, £155,000 in 2002–03 and £100,800 in 2003–04.

Construction and operations The 1600 class was a pure GWR design but all 70 were built by the Western Region of British Railways.

First published in the United Kingdom on 27 September 1927 by Herbert Jenkins, and in the United States on 2 March 1928 by Doubleday, Doran.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 53–54, A38. The short stories were originally published in magazines, mainly The Strand Magazine in the UK and Liberty in the US. The collection introduces the irrepressible pub raconteur Mr. Mulliner, who narrates all nine of the book's stories. The last story, \\"Honeysuckle Cottage\\", was not originally a Mr. Mulliner story; it was given a Mulliner frame for the book, and is the only one of the stories which is not explicitly narrated from the bar-parlour of the Angler's Rest public house.

Mulliner is inspired to tell the following story, which he claims also shows that you can never tell what will happen in the end and that it is always darkest before the dawn. Mr Mulliner's nephew Lancelot Bassington Mulliner wants to be a poet, though Lancelot's maternal uncle Jeremiah Biggs, the proprietor of Briggs' Breakfast Pickles, wants him to work in the pickle business. Lancelot falls in love with Angela, the beautiful daughter of the Earl of Biddlecombe, who has little money. While they are dancing, Lancelot says he wants to marry her. Angela admires Lancelot's excellent dancing, but her father wants her to marry someone wealthy, so she is thinking of marrying Slingsby Purvis, of Purvis's Liquid Dinner Glue. Hooping to get a job from his uncle, Lancelot writes a poem praising Briggs's pickles for advertising. Lancelot goes to his uncle's Putney house and reads his poem to his uncle. The poem, titled \\"Darkling (A Threnody)\\", is extremely somber, and Briggs has his butler throw Lancelot out. Lancelot goes to Lord Biddlecombe's residence in Berkeley Square, and asks for Biddlecombe's consent to marry her daughter. Biddlecombe sells some things to Lancelot to make some money, then has his butler throw Lancelot out. A stout man with horn-rimmed spectacles tries to talk to Lancelot, but Lancelot ignores him. Having been unsuccessful with Biggs and Biddlecombe, Lancelot heads to Angela's club, the Junior Lipstick Club (also mentioned in \\"The Reverent Wooing of Archibald\\"), in order to plead with Angela to marry him even though he is not rich. She is unwilling to marry a poor poet and says she will marry Purvis. She tells the club's hall-porter to throw Lancelot out. Lancelot is dejected, but the stout man with horn-rimmed spectacles from before appears again and knows all about Lancelot's situation because he has read everything in Lancelot's expressive face. The man, Isadore Zinzinheimer, represents a motion picture company in Hollywood and wants to hire Lancelot as an actor since he registers emotion so well. Lancelot no longer loves Angela and happily agrees to go to Hollywood. =\\"The Story of William\\"= * US: Liberty, 9 April 1927 (as \\"It Was Only a Fire\\") * UK: Strand, May 1927 ;Plot An American gentleman visits the Angler's Rest. He speaks highly of California, where he is from. Mr Mulliner remarks that California is fine except for the earthquakes. The American asserts that California is perfect and free of earthquakes. Mr Mulliner argues the contrary, and says that his uncle, William Mulliner, experienced the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. He tells the following story about his uncle'x experience, despite the American insisting that what happened in 1906 was only a fire. William Mulliner loves Myrtle Banks, but she is impressed with the bravery of William's rival, Desmond Franklyn, who claims to have killed sharks and lions. She and Franklyn get engaged. William tries to argue that Franklyn is cruel to animals, but Myrtle is not swayed. William is disappointed, and a hall-porter at the hotel he is staying at suggests he get a drink at a local establishment called Mike's Place. William, until now a teetotaler, follows the hall-porter's advice. He ends up drinking too much and gets thrown out after starting a fight. He falls asleep outside a boarding house for theatrical performers. When he wakes up, he looks inside and sees some unusually small men eating a meal. William, unaware that these men belong to a performing group called Murphy's Midgets, believes he is hallucinating due to the alcohol. Back at his hotel, William goes to bed. He sees a part of the ceiling fall and hears shouts and crashes, but assumes he is still hallucinating. He falls asleep, and when he wakes up, he sees that the room has in fact largely fallen apart. Myrtle, who was staying at the same hotel, notices William from the exposed hallway and is surprised that he is still in bed. He tells her he noticed the walls falling at night and went to sleep anyway. She calls him the bravest man in the world. She already ended her engagement to Franklyn, who hastily fled when the earthquake started without stopping to help Myrtle. William and Myrtle get married, and name their first son John San Francisco Earthquake Mulliner. =\\"Portrait of a Disciplinarian\\"= * US: Liberty, 24 September 1927 * UK: Strand, October 1927 ;Plot Mr Mulliner, just returned from visiting his old nanny, remarks that a nanny will always view a boy she looked after as a boy even after he becomes an adult. He tells the following story about his nephew, Frederick Mulliner. Frederick Mulliner's brother, Dr George Mulliner, wants Frederick to visit their old nanny, 85-year-old Nurse Wilks. Frederick is reluctant, remembering how she once shut him up in a cupboard for stealing jam. George remarks that she is still inclined to be autocratic. However, her heart is weak. For the sake of her health, Frederick must agree to do whatever she wants him to, including eat boiled eggs, though Frederick tries to protest. She has already been visited by George and the Oliphants, who were also looked after by Nurse Wilks as children. Frederick was recently engaged to Jane Oliphant but she ended the engagement without explanation and got engaged to a man named Dillingwater. Frederick arrives at Nurse Wilks's house in Bingley-on-Sea. She initially seems frail, but soon orders Frederick to take off his boots and makes him feel like a small child. To Frederick's surprise, Jane Oliphant is at the house. Frederick and Jane argue with each other. Nurse Wilks tells Frederick to apologize to Jane and give her a kiss. He apologizes though he refuses to kiss her. Nurse Wilks orders him to go into the cupboard and stay there until he is good. Frederick hesitates, but he remembers George's warning about Nurse Wilks's heart, so he obeys and goes into the cupboard. Shortly afterward, Jane is sent into the same cupboard for smoking a cigarette. After they argue more, Jane reveals that she ended their engagement because she knew Frederick lied to her about having lunch with another woman. Frederick explains that he was buying the woman's Pekingese dog, which Jane had adored, as a surprise gift for Jane. He still has the dog, which is now in his flat. Jane is delighted. She already broke up with Dillingwater, since she did not love him and only got engaged to him to score off Frederick. They happily embrace. From outside the cupboard, Nurse Wilks asks if Frederick will be good now and kiss Jane. Frederick replies that he will do so, and also bravely faces Nurse Wilks's boiled eggs. =\\"The Romance of a Bulb-Squeezer\\"= * UK: Strand, March 1927 * US: Liberty, 12 March 1927 ;Plot Mr Mulliner is inspired by a photograph in an illustrated weekly paper to tell the following tale about his cousin Clarence. The mayor of Tooting East, Jno. Horatio Biggs, O.B.E., wants aspiring photographer Clarence Mulliner to take his photograph. However, the mayor is ugly and Clarence refuses to take his picture. Clarence makes Biggs leave his studio by prodding him with a tripod, for which Biggs sues him. Clarence's lawyer successfully defends him in court and the jury decides in Clarence's favour. The publicity of the trial makes Clarence a famous and fashionable photographer. Mr Mulliner hears of Clarence's success and visits his studio, but finds Clarence listless and moody. Many beautiful women have had him take their picture and he is now tired of seeing beautiful women. In a traffic jam at the top of Whitehall, Clarence sees a girl in another cab. She does not have a conventionally attractive face. Clarence falls in love with her on sight, but soon the traffic jam clears and she disappears. Clarence is upset about losing her, which makes him seem like a more solemn, profound photographer and enhances his prestige further. The doors of Society open to anyone photographed by him. However, Clarence does not care about his fame and only wants to see the girl in the cab again. One night, he is visited by a man with a black mask who claims to be a British agent and asks Clarence to come with him to take a photograph of an important visiting dignitary. Clarence follows him but is kidnapped and tied up. The man in the mask was actually the secretary of Biggs, the Mayor of Tooting East, who had Clarence kidnapped. He has given up on having his own photograph taken by Clarence, but insists that Clarence take his daughter's photograph. Clarence breaks free and is also helped by Biggs's daughter, Gladys, who disapproves of her father kidnapping Clarence. Clarence is stunned to see that she is the girl from the cab. She had also seen Clarence in his cab and loves him. Clarence declares that he will take a photograph of her and her father, which makes the mayor sob with joy. Clarence happily retires from commercial photography. Clarence and Gladys's wedding is attended by many important people and they walk out of church under an arch of crossed tripods. =\\"Honeysuckle Cottage\\"= * US: Saturday Evening Post, 24 January 1925 * UK: Strand, February 1925 See \\"Honeysuckle Cottage\\".

Its capital is Vĩnh Long. Its population is 1,046,390 and its area is . Administrative history Modern-day Vĩnh Long was part of Long Hồ dinh (barrack, 營) established by the Nguyễn lords in 1732, comprising the provinces of Bến Tre, Trà Vinh, and parts of Cần Thơ. The area saw some of the heaviest fighting between the Tây Sơn brothers and the Nguyễn lords in the late 18th century; in 1784 Nguyễn Huệ defeated Siamese forces aiding Nguyễn Ánh at the Mang Thít River. In 1951, the Southern Resistance Administrative Committee of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam merged Vĩnh Long and Trà Vinh provinces into Vĩnh Trà Province. Vinh Tra existed until 1954 (however, as North Vietnam never administered the area for a significant period of time, this arrangement was not enforced). In 1957, the South Vietnam formed Vĩnh Long Province, consisting of six districts: Châu Thành, Chợ Lách (now part of Bến Tre Province), Tam Bình, Bình Minh, Sa Đéc, and Lấp Vò. In 1961, Cái Nhum District was split from Chợ Lách. Đức Tôn District and Đức Thành District were added in 1962, but joined the newly formed Sa Đéc Province in 1966. As of 1975, the province had seven districts: Châu Thành, Chợ Lách, Tam Bình, Bình Minh, Minh Đức, Trà Ôn, and Vũng Liêm. After the fall of South Vietnam, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam merged Vĩnh Long with Trà Vinh Province, forming Cửu Long Province in 1976. In 1991, Cửu Long was again split into Vĩnh Long and Trà Vinh. At the time of the split, Vĩnh Long Province consisted of one city (Vĩnh Long) and five districts: Long Hồ, Vũng Liêm, Bình Minh, Tam Bình, and Trà Ôn. In 1992, Mang Thít District was re-split from Long Hồ District. In 2007, Bình Tân District was created. Geography Lying between the Hau and Tien rivers in the center of the Mekong Delta, Vĩnh Long is a province well known for fishing. =Administrative divisions= Vĩnh Long is subdivided into eight district-level sub-divisions: * 6 districts: ** Bình Tân ** Long Hồ ** Mang Thít ** Tam Bình ** Trà Ôn ** Vũng Liêm * 1 district-level town: ** Bình Minh * 1 provincial city: ** Vĩnh Long (capital) They are further subdivided into five commune-level towns (or townlets), 94 communes, and 10 wards. Economy Prawns and the Basa and Tra catfish are among the many types of fish that exist in abundance in the waters of Vĩnh Long. Its rich, fertile soil makes Vĩnh Long an ideal location for the growing of many exotic and delicious fruits, including the strange-looking mangosteen, the spikey rambutan and the pungently fragrant durian. Because of Vĩnh Long's extensive network of waterways, these fruits and many other items can be purchased for mere pennies from the huge water-based squadron of floating merchants. Traveling by water is a common practice here for such mundane tasks as grocery shopping as well as getting to restaurants and tourist attractions located on small islets accessible only by boat. Tourist infrastructure is still in its infancy here, but comfortable lodging and great food can be had for very reasonable prices. Transportation Located approximately southwest of Hồ Chí Minh City, Vĩnh Long is easily accessible by bus, van or car using National Route 1A and the Mỹ Thuận Bridge.

She was later appointed director of both the Institute of Statistics of the Consolidated University of North Carolina and the Statistics Research Division of North Carolina State University. Her most important and influential research dealt with experimental design; In 1950 she published the book Experimental Designs, on the subject with W. G. Cochran, which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards. In 1949 Cox became the first woman elected into the International Statistical Institute and in 1956 was President of the American Statistical Association. Early life and education Gertrude Cox was born in Dayton, Iowa on January 13, 1900. She studied at Perry High School in Perry, Iowa, graduating in 1918. At this time she decided to become a deaconess in the Methodist Church and worked towards that end. However, in 1925, she decided to continue her education at Iowa State College (which was renamed Iowa State University in 1959) in Ames where she studied mathematics and statistics and was awarded a B.S. in 1929 and a Master's degree in statistics in 1931. From 1931 to 1933 Cox undertook graduate studies in psychological statistics at the University of California at Berkeley, then returned to Iowa State College to assist in establishing the new Statistical Laboratory. Here she worked on the design of experiments. Academic career In 1939 Cox was appointed assistant professor of statistics at Iowa State College. In 1940 Cox was appointed professor of statistics at North Carolina State College (now North Carolina State University) at Raleigh. There she headed the new department of Experimental Statistics, the first female head of any department at this institution. In 1945 she became director of the Institute of Statistics of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and the Statistics Research Division of the North Carolina State College which was run by William Gemmell Cochran. In the same year of 1945 Cox became the editor of Biometrics Bulletin and of Biometrics and she held this editorship for 10 years. When prolific statistician and eugenicist Ronald Fisher founded the International Biometric Society in 1947, Cox was one of the founding members. In 1960 she took up her final post as Director of Statistics at the Research Triangle Institute in Durham, North Carolina. She held this post until she retired in 1965. After retirement, then worked as a consultant to promote the development of statistical programs in Egypt and Thailand. Book In 1950 she published a joint work with William Cochran, Experimental Designs, which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards. Recognition Cox received many honors. In 1949 she became the first woman elected into the International Statistical Institute. In 1956 she was elected President of the American Statistical Association while in 1975 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She was also a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. The University of North Carolina system named her an O. Max Gardner Award recipient in 1959. North Carolina State University honored Cox by naming Cox Hall in her honor in 1970, and awarding her a Watauga Medal in 1977. The Caucus of Women in Statistics also established a Gertrude M. Cox Scholarship fund in recognition of her work in 1986.

It runs in a generally north-south direction through Liberty and Independence townships, then turns more east-west in Allamuchy Township north of the Interstate 80 (I-80) crossing. South of I-80 it runs alongside Jenny Jump State Forest and offers access to it at several points. The road is the subject of folklore and numerous local legends. According to Weird NJ, these rumors have drawn more visitors to the area, to the annoyance of residents, who have in the past gone so far as to smear the pole holding the street sign (pictured) at the road's southern end with grease or oil to prevent theft (Other signs along the road are in vertical type on poles and thus harder to remove and less desirable to display).Sceurman, Mark and Moran, Mark; \\"Shadowy Past: The Long and Winding Story of Shades of Death Road\\" in Weird NJ: Your Travel Guide to New Jersey's Local Legends and Best-Kept Secrets, Barnes & Noble Books, New York, 2003, , 182. The road in New Jersey is not the only one with this unusual name. Another Shades of Death Road exists in Washington County, Pennsylvania north of Avella between Bethel Ridge Road and Cole School Road. Location and route Shades of Death's southern end is at County Route 611 (CR 611), or Hope Road, in Liberty Township one mile (1.6 km) north of the junction with CR 617 (Mountain Lake Road) and two miles (3.2 km) north of where Hope splits off from U.S. Route 46 (US 46) at Marble Hill, just west of Great Meadows. From that point it meanders along between the base of the Jenny Jump ridge and the low-lying flatlands of the Pequest River valley. About half a mile (almost 1 km) north of the interstate, in Allamuchy, it turns to the east and enters those flatlands, continuing all the while to weave back and forth through some sharp turns, until it reaches its northern terminus at Long Bridge Road. Legends and folklore Weird NJ suggests several theories for the road's macabre name. :*Some focus on the road's southern half, where the adjoining forest with its aged trees provides much actual shade from the sun on even the brightest days. Highwaymen or other bandits would supposedly lay in wait for victims in these shadows, then often cut their throats after taking what they had, or they would engage in fights to the death among themselves over women.Ibid., 180-81 :*Or, it is said, the local populace would take revenge against these highwaymen by lynching them and leaving the bodies dangling from low-hanging tree branches as a warning to others criminally inclined. :*In the 1920s and 1930s, there were three brutal murders along the road, one was a robbery in which a man was hit over the head with a tire jack over some gold coins, a second in which a woman beheaded her husband and buried the head and the body on different sides of the street, and lastly one in which a local resident, Bill Cummins, was shot and buried in a mudpile. It was never solved. :*The twists and turns of the road have led to suggestions that it has led to an inordinate number of fatal car accidents, and supposedly the reflective guard rails along the road indicate where that has happened. However, the road had earned its name well before automobile use became common in the area. :*Bear Swamp nearby was known as either Cat Hollow or Cat Swamp, because of packs of vicious wild cats that lived there who frequently and lethally attacked travelers along the road. :*A final explanation points to the Pequest lowlands and nearby Bear Swamp, used today for sod farming. In 1850, malaria-carrying insects were discovered nesting in a cliff face along the road. They flourished in the nearby wetlands of Bear Swamp, causing annual outbreaks of the disease. The high mortality rates due to the remoteness of the area from effective medical treatment cut a swath through so many families that a street once called merely Shade or Shades Road due to its tree cover took on the name Shades Of Death out of black humor. The problem was so widespread, that in 1884 a state-sponsored project drained the swamps, ending the threat. =Reputed paranormal activity= According to Weird New Jersey, ghosts or other supernatural phenomena are said to have been reported at points along the road. Ghost Lake Ghost Lake Ghost Lake (unnamed on U.S. Geological Survey maps) is just off the road, in the state forest south of the I-80 overpass. It was created in the early 20th century when two wealthy local men dammed a creek that ran through the narrow valley between houses they had just built. They gave it its name from the wraithlike vapor formations they often saw rising off it on cooler mornings. They further named the pass Haunted Hollow. Weird NJ writes that visitors have told them that no matter what time of night they visit the lake at, the sky above it always seems as bright as if it were still twilight and several have reported ghosts in the area, especially in a deserted old cabin across the lake from the road, supposedly victims of the murders once believed to have given the road its name. The Fairy Hole To the right of Ghost lake, there is a small cave, once used by the Lenape. Weird NJ says that though the cave is now easily accessible, and also covered in graffiti, archaeologists who surveyed the area in 1918 found pottery shards, flint, and broken arrow heads. From their findings, the archaeologists concluded that \\"The Fairy Hole\\" was not often visited. It may have been used as a simple resting point for traveling or hunting Lenape, but with its close proximity to several known burial sites, it is said to be a sacred or religiously important site. This survey was conducted before the creation of Ghost Lake. Lenape Lane Lenape Lane is an unpaved one-lane dead-end street about three-quarter mile (1.1 km) in length running eastward off Shades just north of I-80. It ends at a farmhouse for which it is little more than a driveway, but halfway down there is space to park or turn around next to a wooden structure described as looking like an abandoned stable.Ibid., 180. Weird New Jersey writes that visitors to this stable site at night have reported extremely local fogs surrounding it and seeing apparitions in it, or sometimes even in clear weather, and also claimed the air is sometimes unusually chilly, and feeling general unease in the area for no immediately apparent reason. An additional legend claims that sometimes nocturnal visitors to Lenape see an orb of white light appear near the end of the road which chases vehicles back out to Shades Of Death, and if it turns red in the process, those who see it will die. This may be due to an old tree near the end of Lenape that was never cut down when the road was built. As a result, the road forks right before the tree, and a big red reflector has been nailed to the tree to warn drivers. Another legend says that if one circles around the tree and drives down the road again at midnight, a red light will shine and the driver will never survive. Others There are some legends concerning a Native American spirit guide who supposedly takes the shape of a deer and appears at various points along the road at night. If drivers see him and do not slow down sufficiently enough to avoid a collision, they will soon get into a serious accident with a deer.Ibid., 183 Another legend tells of a bridge where, if drivers stop past midnight with their high beams on and honk their horns three times, they will see the ghosts of two young children who were run over while playing in the road. This legend actually refers to a bridge over the Flatbrook on Old Mine Road, not far from Shades of Death. The bridge is no longer accessible by car as a newer, larger bridge has been built next to it. The original bridge can still be reached on foot. Polaroids Weird NJ published correspondence from two anonymous readers who said they found hundreds of Polaroid photographs, some of them showing the blurred image of a woman, possibly in distress, scattered in woods just off the road during the 1990s. The magazine claims the local police began an investigation but the photos \\"disappeared\\" shortly afterward.Ibid., 184.

In mathematics, specifically in category theory, F-algebras generalize the notion of algebraic structure. Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of morphisms eliminates all references to quantified elements from the axioms, and these algebraic laws may then be glued together in terms of a single functor F, the signature. F-algebras can also be used to represent data structures used in programming, such as lists and trees. The main related concepts are initial F-algebras which may serve to encapsulate the induction principle, and the dual construction F-coalgebras. Definition If C is a category, and F: C → C is an endofunctor of C, then an F-algebra is a tuple (A, α), where A is an object of C and α is a C-morphism F(A) → A. The object A is called the carrier of the algebra. When it is permissible from context, algebras are often referred to by their carrier only instead of the tuple. A homomorphism from an F-algebra (A, α) to an F-algebra (B, β) is a C-morphism f: A→B such that f ∘ α = β ∘ F(f), according to the following commutative diagram: center Equipped with these morphisms, F-algebras constitute a category. The dual construction are F-coalgebras, which are objects A* together with a morphism α* : A* → F(A*).  Examples  = Groups = Classically, a group is a set G with a binary operation m : G × G → G, satisfying three axioms: :*associativity: ∀ x∈G, ∀ y∈G, ∀ z∈G, m(m(x, y), z) = m(x, m(y, z)), :*identity element: ∃ 1∈G, ∀ x∈G, m(1, x) = m(x, 1) = x, :*inverse element: ∃ 1∈G, ∀ x∈G, ∃ x−1∈G, m(x−1, x) = m(x, x−1) = 1. Note that the closure axiom is included in the symbolic definition of m. To treat this in a categorical framework, we first define the identity and inverse as morphisms e and i respectively. Let C be an arbitrary category with finite products and a terminal object *. The group G is an object in C. The morphism e sends each element in * to 1, the identity element of the group G. The morphism i sends each element x in G to its inverse x−1, satisfying m(x−1, x) = m(x, x−1) = 1. Then a group G can be defined as a 4-tuple (G, m, e, i), which describes a monoid category with only one object G. Each morphism f in this monoid category has an inverse f−1 that satisfies f−1 ∘ f = f ∘ f−1 = Id.Section I.2, III.6 in It is then possible to rewrite the axioms in terms of morphisms: :* ∀ x∈G, ∀ y∈G, ∀ z∈G, m(m(x, y), z) = m(x, m(y, z)), :* ∀ x∈G, m(e(*), x) = m(x, e(*)) = x, :* ∀ x∈G, m(i(x), x) = m(x, i(x)) = e(*). Then remove references to the elements of G (which will also remove universal quantifiers): :* m∘(m, Id) = m∘(Id, m), :* m∘(e, Id) = m∘(Id, e) = Id, :* m∘(i, Id) = m∘(Id, i) = e. Which is the same as claiming commutativity for the following diagrams:The vertical arrows without labels in the third diagram must be unique since * is terminal. File:Group associative categories.svg File:Group identity categories.svg File:Group inverse categories.svg Now use the coproduct (the disjoint union of sets) to glue the three morphisms in one: α = e + i + m according to ::\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha: {1}+G+G \\\\times G & \\\\to & G,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\mapsto & 1,\\\\\\\\\\\\ x & \\\\mapsto & x^{-1},\\\\\\\\\\\\ (x,y) & \\\\mapsto & x \\\\cdot y. \\\\end{matrix} This defines a group as a F-algebra where F is the functor F(G) = 1 + G + G × G. Note 1: The above construction is used to define group objects over an arbitrary category with finite products and a terminal object *. When the category admits finite coproducts, the group objects are F-algebras. For example, finite groups are F-algebras in the category of finite sets and Lie groups are F-algebras in the category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps. = Algebraic structures = Going one step ahead of universal algebra, most algebraic structures are F-algebras. For example, abelian groups are F-algebras for the same functor F(G) = 1 + G + G×G as for groups, with an additional axiom for commutativity: m∘t = m, where t(x,y) = (y,x) is the transpose on GxG. Monoids are F-algebras of signature F(M) = 1 + M×M. In the same vein, semigroups are F-algebras of signature F(S) = S×S Rings, domains and fields are also F-algebras with a signature involving two laws +,•: R×R -> R, an additive identity 0: 1 -> R, a multiplicative identity 1: 1 -> R, and an additive inverse for each element -: R -> R. As all these functions share the same codomain R they can be glued into a single signature function 1 + 1 + R + R×R + R×R -> R, with axioms to express associativity, distributivity, and so on. This makes rings F-algebras on the category of sets with signature 1 + 1 + R + R×R + R×R. Alternatively, we can look at the functor F(R) = 1 + R×R in the category of abelian groups. In that context, the multiplication is a homomorphism, meaning m(x + y, z) = m(x,z) + m(y,z) and m(x,y + z) = m(x,y) + m(x,z), which are precisely the distributivity conditions. Therefore, a ring is an F-algebra of signature 1 + R×R over the category of abelian groups which satisfies two axioms (associativity and identity for the multiplication). When we come to vector spaces and modules, the signature functor includes a scalar multiplication k×E -> E, and the signature F(E) = 1 + E + k×E is parametrized by k over the category of fields, or rings. Algebras over a field can be viewed as F-algebras of signature 1 + 1 + A + A×A + A×A + k×A over the category of sets, of signature 1 + A×A over the category of modules (a module with an internal multiplication), and of signature k×A over the category of rings (a ring with a scalar multiplication), when they are associative and unitary. = Lattice = Not all mathematical structures are F-algebras. For example, a poset P may be defined in categorical terms with a morphism s:P × P -> Ω, on a subobject classifier (Ω = {0,1} in the category of sets and s(x,y)=1 precisely when x≤y). The axioms restricting the morphism s to define a poset can be rewritten in terms of morphisms. However, as the codomain of s is Ω and not P, it is not an F-algebra. However, lattices in which every two elements have a supremum and an infimum, and in particular total orders, are F-algebras. This is because they can equivalently be defined in terms of the algebraic operations: x∨y = inf(x,y) and x∧y = sup(x,y), subject to certain axioms (commutativity, associativity, absorption and idempotency). Thus they are F-algebras of signature P x P + P x P. It is often said that lattice theory draws on both order theory and universal algebra. = Recurrence = Consider the functor F: \\\\mathrm{\\\\bf{Set}} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{\\\\bf{Set}} that sends a set X to 1+X. Here, \\\\mathrm{\\\\bf{Set}} denotes the category of sets, + denotes the usual coproduct given by the disjoint union, and 1 is a terminal object (i.e. any singleton set). Then, the set \\\\mathbb{N} of natural numbers together with the function [\\\\mathrm{zero},\\\\mathrm{succ}] : 1+\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}—which is the coproduct of the functions \\\\mathrm{zero} : 1 \\\\mapsto 0 and \\\\mathrm{succ} : n \\\\mapsto n+1—is an F-algebra.  Initial F-algebra  If the category of F-algebras for a given endofunctor F has an initial object, it is called an initial algebra. The algebra (\\\\mathbb{N}, [\\\\mathrm{zero},\\\\mathrm{succ}]) in the above example is an initial algebra. Various finite data structures used in programming, such as lists and trees, can be obtained as initial algebras of specific endofunctors. Types defined by using least fixed point construct with functor F can be regarded as an initial F-algebra, provided that parametricity holds for the type.Philip Wadler: Recursive types for free! University of Glasgow, June 1990. Draft. See also Universal algebra.  Terminal F-coalgebra  In a dual way, a similar relationship exists between notions of greatest fixed point and terminal F-coalgebra. These can be used for allowing potentially infinite objects while maintaining strong normalization property. In the strongly normalizing Charity programming language (i.e. each program terminates in it), coinductive data types can be used to achieve surprising results, enabling the definition of lookup constructs to implement such “strong” functions like the Ackermann function.Robin Cockett: Charitable Thoughts (ps and ps.gz)  See also  * Algebras for a monad * Algebraic data type * Catamorphism  Notes   References  * *  External links  * Categorical programming with inductive and coinductive types by Varmo Vene * Philip Wadler: Recursive types for free!

(ADARF) American Diabetes Association Property Title Holding Corp. (ADARTHC) In 2018, the ADA's total revenue was $161.267,000  Historical background  The ADA was formerly founded in 1940. It was founded by six physicians − including Dr. Herman O. Mosenthal, Dr. Joseph T. Beardwood Jr., Dr. Joseph H. Barach, and Dr. E. S. Dillion − at their annual meeting of the American College of Physicians. Each year the ADA hosts, Scientific Sessions, a meeting for diabetes professionals. The ADA has nearly 20,000 members. In the early 2000's, the ADA struck a three-year, $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Cadbury-Schweppes, the world’s largest confectioner products including Diet-Rite sodas, Snapple unsweetened tea and Mott’s Apple Sauce.

To work towards achieving this mission, the organization places effort into funding research projects that help minority groups navigate diabetes. The ADA works with various colleges, local governments, and companies to promote healthy lifestyles. They also fund research looking to control risk factors associated with diabetes, as seen in a recently published article discussing the role of microglia immune cells in diet-induced obesity. 96% of ADA funded researchers remain dedicated to careers in diabetes science, every $1 the ADA invests in diabetes research leads to $12.47 in additional research funding.  Advocacy efforts in policy, law, and education  Tracey Brown, CEO of the ADA, delivers remarks on protecting seniors with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States The ADA has had several accomplishments in the policy arena, including gathering advocates at Call to Congress (a lobbying event on Capitol Hill) to raise awareness for ADA's legislative priorities, calling for regulations on insulin prices, and helping to improve Medicare's coverage policy for the National Diabetes Prevention Program. On the legal front, the ADA has supported appellate litigation regarding employer discrimination of employees with diabetic conditions, including cases involving both government employers (Atkins v. Salazar) and private companies (Darnell v. Thermafiber). The ADA has provided diabetes education to the workforce of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), raised funding for diabetes prevention programs throughout the United States, and taken steps to prevent diabetes discrimination through developing materials on the care of students with diabetes to be used in educational institutions.

It is owned by the California State Park System which since acquiring the land in 2001 has stated that the land is being held for possible use as a state park. Point Lobos Ranch is located south of Carmel by the Sea and east of Point Lobos State Reserve. It contains one of the world's largest stands of native Monterey Pines, endangered Gowen cypress, and rare maritime chaparral plant community.  History  The Ohlone people harvested shellfish including abalone from the waters around Point Lobos. Evidence has been found of seasonal camp sites on the San Jose Creek for about 2,500 years. The village, named Ichxenta, was occupied until the end of the Carmel Mission era, when the native population was decimated by disease and forced assimilation. In about 1770, Spanish Vaqueros from the nearby Carmel Mission ran cattle on Point Lobos. Governor Juan Alvarado granted two square leagues of land named Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito in 1839 to Marcelino Escobar. It was briefly owned in turn by Doňa Maria Josefa de Abrego, who may have held it for her husband, Monterey Alcalde José Abrego. In 1843, Doňa Abrego deeded the land to a group of about 10 soldiers from the Monterey Presidio. It appears that the soldiers paid nothing, and a legend attached to the transfer says a gambler lost a rancho in a card game.Aubrey Drury, 1954, Point Lobos Reserve, California State Park, Department of Natural Resources, Sacramento, p. 78–85 On June 7, 1844, the soldiers turned the Rancho over to their superior officer, Colonel José Castro, former Governor Alvarado's brother-in-law. When Mexico ceded California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. But the Land Act of 1851 required owners to prove their ownership, and Castro filed a claim for Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito with the Public Land Commission in on February 2, 1853. While waiting for his case to be decided, Castro sold his 8,876 acres of land in 1854 to Joseph S. Emery and Abner Bassett for $700, leaving to them the legal fight for ownership. The litigation lasted for 38 years, during which thirty-two others eventually asserted that they owned a portion of the land. Thirty-five years later, in 1886, Castro's successors finally obtained clear title, forcing all other claimants out. In 1874, a seam of low grade bituminous coal was found in upper Malpaso Canyon. On September 6, 1888, shortly after the patent for Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito was approved, almost all of the claimants banded together to form the Carmelo Land and Coal Company. But by 1896, the coal mine was unprofitable. In 1862, Antonio Victorine, a Portuguese whaler from the Azores, arrived at Point Lobos, following the whale population. Other whaler's from the Azores followed him. Some built cabins on land east of Point Lobos, and old houses on the ranch property still bear Portuguese names, like Victorine and Morales. Alexander MacMillan Allan, a successful race track architect and real estate developer from Pennsylvania, purchased 640 acres of Point Lobos from the Carmelo Land and Coal Company in 1898. He preserved Point Lobos and established the Point Lobos Dairy at the mouth of San Jose Creek which was operated from 1903 until 1954.  Acquisition The land was acquired by the Big Sur Land Trust in 1993 for $4.25 million. It held onto the land until 2003, when it sold the land to California State Park System for $3 million in funds from Proposition 117 funds and a $1 million grant from the Coastal Conservancy. Although owned by a public agency and purchased with public funds, the public is not allowed to access the property.  In popular culture  Point Lobos Ranch was seen in an episode of Bay Area Backroads.

Hassan is often referred to in Bangladesh as Potua, a word usually associated with folk artists, due to his down to earth style yet very modern in nature as he always added Cubism other than the folk style to his artworks. In addition to his artistic legacy, two of Hassan's work have come to be part of Bangladesh's political history. The first of this is a monstrous rendition of Yahya Khan, the Pakistani president who ordered genocide in Bangladesh. The second was just before his death, mocking the then dictator of Bangladesh, Hossain Mohammad Ershad. This sketch was titled Desh aaj bisshobeheyar khoppre (Our land is now in the hand of the champion of shamelessness). Early life Hassan was born in Kolkata on 2 December 1921. His father, Muhammad Hashim, was superintendent of the a local Graveyard. He belonged to a conservative family and his father always opposed to his involvement in paintings. But Quamrul's determination and love for painting made his father enroll Quamrul to Government Institute of Arts (now Government College of Art & Craft), in 1938, under the condition that Quamrul had to pay for his own tuition fee. After his enrollment to the school, Quamrul kept himself busy with not only arts but with other activities such as sports and the Bratachari movement in 1939 and he also joined ARP during the Second World War. He developed connections with the Forward Block, Gononatya Andolon (People's Theatre) and even with several leaders of the Communist Party, got involved with the task of teaching of children and teenagers and contributed to illustrations in publications. As a result of his involvement in social and cultural activities, he finished his six-year course in the Art School in nine years. He graduated in 1947. He secured first position in the B Group of the Inter College Bodybuilding competition in 1945. He had become a 'Nayak' of the Bratachari movement. After the partition of India, Quamrul, who was still a student, along with his mother and siblings moved to Dhaka, the then capital of East Pakistan. He was involved in the non- cooperation movement of March 1971 and was nominated the chairman of the Resistance Committee of the Hatirpul area. On 23 March, he put up at least ten propaganda posters portraying a monstrous face of Yahya Khan which inspired the freedom Fighters. On 25 March 1971, trenches were dug out late night at Hatirpul area under his leadership. Then he left for Kolkata in the first week of April where he arranged an art exhibition in favor of the liberation war. He came back to Dhaka during the last half of December to help develop the newly liberated Bangladesh. He also designed state monogram of Bangladesh, Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust, Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, Bangladesh Bank, and Biman Bangladesh Airlines. Career After the Partition of India, together with Zainul Abedin, he established the Government Institute of Fine Arts (at present, the Faculty of Fine Arts) in 1948. During liberation war he served as the Director of the Art Division of the Information and Radio Department of the Bangladesh Government in exile. Art Uki, gouache. Getting inspired from Zainul Abedin, Jamini Roy, Quamrul Hassan chose to give the folk art tradition a breath of life by incorporating modern ideas in it. He always borrowed the two-dimensionality of pata paintings of fork art in his work, he also attempted to give the quality of three-dimensionality in it. Instead of using mixed colours, in most of his paintings he used primary colors like pata painters. Sometimes, like folk artists, he applied flat colors without creating tonal variations. However, he has attempted to create color perspective by using various colors in one plane, so that a sense of height, distance can be created in the image. This technique was inspired from Henri Matisse. Patriotism was born in him due to his involvement in folk art. Some of his notable works are: Goon Tana, The Happy Return, Biral, Nabanna, Gorur Snan etc. All of these paintings highlight the lives of lower-class people which has been the topmost priority of his paintings. Hassan was a versatile artist working in practically all media-oil, gouache, watercolors, pastel, etching, woodcut, linocut, pen and pencil. He also worked with woodcuts, specially after the famine of 1974, works that expressed his rage and anger. Quamrul used snakes, jackals and owls to portray the evil in humans, both in his political work and his famine work. Rural women and their plight is another theme Hassan has repeatedly worked on. His treatment of women emphasize the bond between them, most of his paintings of women are of a group of women, only rarely a solo painting can be found. However, he mixes romanticism with realism; the strong curved lines and the contrasted use of color contribute to a sensuous appeal that blunts the edges of harsh reality. His paintings of women can be divided into three phases: the 50s Love and Premarital stage, the end of 50s and the beginning of 70s the happy conjugal life, and the 70s and the 80s the time of marital separation. First stage marks the memories of his late mother. The paintings of the stage were made simply from the painters memories of his lost mother but in an abstracted form. Like the painting three women gossiping over a topic. It was actually his mother gossiping to two other women. Second stage marks the time when he was in love with his wife and they together had a daughter. The notable works of the period can be Afterbath, Jalkeli (waterplay), Loneliness etc. And the third stage marks the time when he and his wife were separated due to some reasons and at this period instead of highlighting some emotions that are visible in his other paintings, he kept on drawing female nudes. His political paintings reflected his political understanding and patriotism. Some of his notable works under the category are: Freedom Fighters, Female Freedom Fighters, Gonohatyar Agey O Gonohatyar Porey ( Before and after the mass killing) etc. His series titled Image'74 shows his political view which portrays the tendency of sacrificing morals and ethics over some personal gains among politicians, bureaucrats and the businessmen of Bangladesh. Death Tomb of Quamrul Hassan Hassan died on 2 February 1988 after suffering a massive heart attack while attending the National Poetry Festival. He was buried beside the central mosque of the University of Dhaka.

The New Testament notes that the Apostle Peter's accent gave him away as a Galilean (Matthew 26:73 and Mark 14:70). The Galilean dialect referred to in the New Testament was a form of Jewish Aramaic spoken by people in Galilee from the late Second Temple period through the Apostolic Age . Later the term was used to refer to the early Christians by Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius, among others. The Galilee up until the time of Jesus After some early expeditions to Galilee to save the Jews there from attack, the Hasmonean rulers conquered Galilee and added it to their kingdom. The Galilean Jews were conscious of a mutual descent, religion and ethnicity that they shared with the Judeans. However, there were numerous cultural differences.Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: A Re-examination of the Evidence, A&C; Black, 1 May 2002, By Jonathan L. Reed, page 55 The Pharisaic scholars of Judaism, centered in Jerusalem and Judea, found the Galileans to be insufficiently concerned about the details of Jewish observance – for example, the rules of Sabbath rest. The Talmud says that Yohanan ben Zakkai, a great Pharisee of the first century, was assigned to a post in Galilee during his training. In eighteen years he was asked only two questions of Jewish law, causing him to lament \\"O Galilee, O Galilee, in the end you shall be filled with wrongdoers!\\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 16:7, 15d The Pharisaic criticism of Galileans is mirrored in the New Testament, in which Galilean religious passion is compared favorably against the minute concerns of Judean legal scholars, see for example Woes of the Pharisees. This was the heart of a \\"crosstown\\" rivalry existing between Galileans and Jewish Pharisees. The material culture of the 1st century Galilee indicates adherence to the Jewish ritual purity concerns. Stone vessels (which were required by Jewish dietary purity laws) are ubiquitous and mikvehs have been uncovered in most Galilean sites, particularly around synagogues and private houses.Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: A Re- examination of the Evidence, A&C; Black, 1 May 2002, By Jonathan L. Reed, page 56 During the Great Rebellion (66-70 CE) the Galileans and Idumeans were the most adamant fighters against Rome; they fought the Romans to the death when many Judeans were ready to accept peace terms. Unlike the Judeans and the Idumeans, the Galileans survived until the 1930s in the village of Peki'in, after which the Jews were expelled to Hadera by the Arab riots. Until 500 years ago, Peki'in had a Jewish majority and in Medieval times, Galilean Jews had presence in many villages such as Kafr Yassif, Biriyya, Alma, and more. Other meanings Galileans (or Galilæans) were also the members of a fanatical sect (Zealots), followers of Judas of Galilee, who fiercely resented the taxation of the Romans, and whose violence contributed to induce the Romans to vow the extermination of the whole Galilean race. Galileans was also term used by some in the Roman Empire to name the followers of Christianity, called in this context as the Galilaean faith. Galilean, as an adjective, describes some aspects of mathematics or astronomy associated with Galileo: see for example Galilean moons and Galilean transformation. Galileans are also a fictional race of living planets in the Ben 10 universe that possess the ability to manipulate gravity. The most notable member of this species is Gravattack.

It depicts the face of an uncredited DeVeren Bookwalter as he apparently receives fellatio from an unseen partner. While shot at 24 frames per second, Warhol specified that it should be projected at 16 frames per second,Blow Job slowing it down by a third. Despite the salacious title, the film shows only the expression on the young man's face; the implied sexual act itself is not seen. Whether it is a male or a female performing the act is not stated, and the viewer must assume that fellatio is occurring. The salaciousness has also been speculated to be entirely in the title with no fellatio actually being performed. Making The identity of the person performing the act is disputed. Warhol states in his book Popism: The Warhol Sixties (1980) that five different boys performed the fellatio. In this book, Warhol writes that he originally asked Charles Rydell, the boyfriend of filmmaker Jerome Hill, to star in the film, promising that there would be \\"five beautiful boys\\" to perform the act.Andy Warhol, POPism, (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1980) pp 64, 65 However, when Warhol set up the film shoot at The Factory on a Sunday, Rydell failed to show up. Warhol phoned Rydell at Hill's suite at the Algonquin Hotel and asked where Rydell was. Rydell replied that he thought Warhol was kidding, and had no intention of appearing in such a film. When he declined Andy used \\"a good-looking kid that happened to be hanging around the Factory that day\\", who was later identified as Bookwalter. By that time, the five boys had departed, but Warhol's notoriously poor memory kept the five boys in place for the version given in the much later book POPism. Commentary According to Peter Gidal, the film distances the viewer from the experience it purportedly depicts, \\"Sometimes the young actor looks bored, sometimes as if he is thinking, sometimes as if he is aware of the camera, sometimes as if he is not.\\"Peter Gidal, Andy Warhol - Blow Job, Afterall Books, 2008, blurb. Douglas Crimp states that after a few minutes, \\"it becomes clear that we will see nothing more than the repetition, with slight variations, of what we've already seen\\". This frees the mind to look in a different way. Likewise, the sexual act has the effect of distracting the actor from the presence of the camera, creating a unique kind of unself-consciousness. The film becomes \\"a lesson in how to produce a really beautiful portrait without saying 'cheese'!\\"Douglas Crimp, Our Kind of Movie: The Films of Andy Warhol, MIT Press, 2012, p.4 Critic Roy Grundmann argues that \\"Blow Job‘s self-reflexive devices create a new kind of spectatorial address that dislodges audiences from their contemplative positions in a number of ways. Blow Job‘s reflexivity makes spectators intensely aware that seeing a film makes projecting onto and investing into an image a part of oneself which is also a socialized acculturated act\\". Grundmann further claims that \\"viewers oscillate between an awareness of their contingency on larger scheme and the promise of ocularcentric mastery of the image\\".Roy Grundmann, Andy Warhol's Blow Job, Temple University Press, 2003, p.19 Sequel: Eating Too Fast In 1966, Warhol filmed a sequel, Eating Too Fast (originally titled Blow Job #2) which runs 67 minutes with sound.

Some of its species are known as table coral, elkhorn coral, and staghorn coral. Over 149 species are described. Acropora at Encyclopedia of Life Acropora species are some of the major reef corals responsible for building the immense calcium carbonate substructure that supports the thin living skin of a reef.  Anatomy and distribution  µCT image stack of an Acropora coral from three views; the \\"arms\\" are mostly hollow. This coral had been hot glued onto a stone and later grew over it. Depending on the species and location, Acropora species may grow as plates or slender or broad branches. Like other corals, Acropora corals are colonies of individual polyps, which are about 2 mm across and share tissue and a nerve net. The polyps can withdraw back into the coral in response to movement or disturbance by potential predators, but when undisturbed, they protrude slightly. The polyps typically extend further at night to help capture plankton and organic matter from the water.  Threats  Flight around a three-dimensional object created from the data above Symbiodinium, symbiotic algae, live in the corals' cells and produce energy for the animals through photosynthesis. Environmental destruction has led to a dwindling of populations of Acropora, along with other coral species. Acropora is especially susceptible to bleaching when stressed. Bleaching is due to the loss of the coral's zooxanthellae, which are a golden-brown color. Bleached corals are stark white and may die if new Symbiodinium cells cannot be assimilated. Common causes of bleaching and coral death include pollution, abnormally warm water temperatures, increased ocean acidification, sedimentation, and eutrophication. In 2014 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has listed 10 Acropora species as Threatened. The species are distributed in the Indo-Pacific (over 100 species) and Caribbean (3 species). However, the true number of species is unknown: firstly, the validity of many of these species is questioned as some have been shown to represent hybrids, for example Acropora prolifera; and secondly, some species have been shown to represent cryptic species complexes.  Reef-keeping  Close-up of a network of Acropora polyps Most Acropora species are brown or green, but a few are brightly colored, and those rare corals are prized by aquarists. Captive propagation of Acropora is widespread in the reef-keeping community. Given the right conditions, many Acropora species grow quickly, and individual colonies can exceed a meter across in the wild. In a well-maintained reef aquarium, finger-sized fragments can grow into medicine ball-sized colonies in one to two years. Captive specimens are steadily undergoing changes due to selection which enable them to thrive in the home aquarium. In some cases, fragments of captive specimens are used to repopulate barren reefs in the wild. Acropora species are challenging to keep in a home aquarium. They require bright light, stable temperatures, regular addition of calcium and alkalinity supplements, and clean, turbulent water. Common parasites of colonies in reef aquariums are \\"Acropora-eating flatworms\\" Amakusaplana acroporae, and \\"red bugs\\" (Tegastes acroporanus).

businessman and the former President of the Canadian National Railways from 1950 to 1966. Born in Oldmeldrum, Scotland, Gordon came to Canada at an early age. At 15, he joined the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, becoming assistant chief accountant and assistant manager of the Toronto branch. In 1935, he was appointed Secretary of the newly formed Bank of Canada and later became deputy governor. At the outbreak of war, Gordon was appointed Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Control Board, and then from 1941 to 1947, he was Chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. He became a national figure in Canada during these years, as the WPTB had control over all wages and prices in Canada, and touched the lives of all Canadians. He was also asked to meet with United States economic experts as the USA came into the war, and the U.S. modelled much of its price policy on the Canadian experience. After the war, Gordon was the Canadian representative on the newly formed International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. From 1950 to 1966, he was Chairman and President of the Canadian National Railways. During his colourful career at this post, he re-organised the company, and brought an ailing and bankrupt company into profit. Gordon was involved in the controversy over naming the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, after its founding in Montreal. Quebec nationalists wanted it called Château Maisonneuve in honour of Montreal's founder, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve. Gordon decided it should be named for Queen Elizabeth II, who had unexpectedly come to the throne in 1952 while the hotel was still on the drawing boards. He was also involved in a controversy in 1962 when he said that no French-Canadian was competent enough to be vice-president of the Canadian National Railway. This statement was ironic because he himself had left high school in grade 10. The febrile atmosphere of the time seized upon these words to imply that he was anti-French, so he proceeded to justify this statement in a more defendable way in the extensive interviews and television appearances made afterwards. He remained a figure of controversy for Quebec nationalists for whom he represented a certain type of English-speaking businessman. In 1944, he was made a Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. And, in 1968, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario has honoured Gordon, naming a university residence Donald Gordon House, and its conference centre Donald Gordon Centre. He is a member of the Canadian Business Hall of Fame. He was given honorary degrees by several Canadian Universities, including McGill University. He was also a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem.

It emerged from Persian miniature painting (itself partly of Chinese origin) and developed in the court of the Mughal Empire of the 16th to 18th centuries. The Mughal emperors were Muslims and they are credited with consolidating Islam in South Asia, and spreading Muslim (and particularly Persian) arts and culture as well as the faith. Mughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures. Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums, and were more realistically depicted. Although many classic works of Persian literature continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the Padshahnama genre of official histories. Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles. The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image (mostly trimmed in the images shown here) was continued, as was a modified form of the Persian convention of an elevated viewpoint. The Emperor Shah Jahan standing on a globe, with a halo and European-style putti, c. 1618–19 to 1629. The Mughal painting style later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh, and was often used to depict Hindu subjects. This was mostly in northern India. It developed many regional styles in these courts, tending to become bolder but less refined. These are often described as \\"post-Mughal\\", \\"sub-Mughal\\" or \\"provincial Mughal\\". The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate, and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkish dynasties, such as the Ghaznavids. Subjects =Portraits= Abu'l Hasan, Emperor Jahangir at the Jharoka window of the Agra Fort, c. 1620, Aga Khan Museum From fairly early the Mughal style made a strong feature of realistic portraiture, normally in profile, and influenced by Western prints, which were available at the Mughal court. This had never been a feature of either Persian miniature or earlier Indian painting. The pose, rarely varied in portraits, was to have the head in strict profile, but the rest of the body half turned towards the viewer. For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or concubines; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like Jahanara Begum and Mumtaz Mahal, and others attribute miniatures, for example from the Dara Shikoh album or the Freer Gallery of Art mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.Crill and Jariwala, 23-30Abid. Reign of Shah Jahan, portrait by Abid dated 1628; assembled late 17th century. Mirror Case With Portrait of Mumtaz Mahal. Freer Gallery of Art. F2005.4 The single idealized figure of the Riza Abbasi type was less popular, but fully painted scenes of lovers in a palace setting became popular later. Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular. Akbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were. Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.Crill and Jariwala, 66 There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors Jahangir and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.Crill and Jariwala, 27–39, and catalogue entries From the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.Crill and Jariwala, 68 Another new type of image showed the Jharokha Darshan (literally \\"balcony view/worship\\"), or public display of the emperor to the court, or the public, which became a daily ceremonial under Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, before being stopped as un-Islamic by Aurangzeb. In these scenes, the emperor is shown at top on a balcony or at a window, with a crowd of courtiers below, sometimes including many portraits. Like the increasingly large halos these emperors were given in single portraits, the iconography reflects the aspiration of the later Mughals to project an image as the representative of Allah on earth, or even as having a quasi-divine status themselves.Hansen, Waldemar, The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India, 102, 1986, Motilal Banarsidass Other images show the enthroned emperor having meetings, receiving visitors, or in durbar, or formal council. These and royal portraits incorporated in hunting scenes became highly popular types in later Rajput painting and other post-Mughal styles. =Animals and plants= Nilgai by Ustad Mansur (fl. 1590–1624), who specialized in birds and animal studies for albums. Another popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; the text of the Baburnama includes a number of descriptions of such subjects, which were illustrated in the copies made for Akbar. These subjects also had specialist artists, including Ustad Mansur. Milo C. Beach argues that \\"Mughal naturalism has been greatly overstressed. Early animal imagery consists of variations on a theme, rather than new, innovative observations\\". He sees considerable borrowings from Chinese animal paintings on paper, which seem not to have been highly valued by Chinese collectors, and so reached India.Beach, 32–37, 37 quoted =Illustrated books= In the formative period of the style, under Akbar, the imperial workshop produced a number of heavily illustrated copies of established books in Persian. One of the first, probably from the 1550s and now mostly in the Cleveland Museum of Art, was a Tutinama with some 250 rather simple and rather small miniatures, most with only a few figures. In contrast the Hamzanama Akbar commissioned had unusually large pages, of densely woven cotton rather than the usual paper, and the images were very often crowded with figures. The work was \\"a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts\\", supposedly telling the life of an uncle of Muhammad.Beach, 61 Akbar's manuscript had a remarkable total of some 1400 miniatures, one on every opening, with the relevant text written on the back of the page, presumably to be read to the emperor as he looked at each image. This colossal project took most of the 1560s, and probably beyond. These and a few other early works saw a fairly unified Mughal workshop style emerge by around 1580. Other large projects included biographies or memoirs of the Mughal dynasty. Babur, its founder, had written classic memoirs, which his grandson Akbar had translated into Persian, as the Baburnama (1589), and then produced in four lavishly illustrated copies, with up to 183 miniatures each. The Akbarnama was Akbar's own commissioned biography or chronicle, produced in many versions, and the tradition continued with Jahangir's autobiography Tuzk-e-Jahangiri (or Jahangirnama) and a celebratory biography of Shah Jahan, called the Padshahnama, which brought the era of the large illustrated imperial biography to an end, around 1650. Akbar commissioned a copy of the Zafarnama, a biography of his distant ancestor Timur, but though he had his aunt write a biography of his father Humayun, no illustrated manuscript survives. Volumes of the classics of Persian poetry usually had rather fewer miniatures, often around twenty, but often these were of the highest quality. Akbar also had the Hindu epic poems translated into Persian, and produced in illustrated versions. Four are known of the Razmnama, a Mahabharata in Persian, from between 1585 and c. 1617. Akbar had at least one copy of the Persian version of the Ramayana. Origins Babur Receives a Courtier by Farrukh Beg c. 1580–85. Opaque watercolor and gold on paper, painted and mounted within borders, from a Rawżat aṣ-ṣafāʾ. Still using the style of Persian miniature. Mughal court painting, as opposed to looser variants of the Mughal style produced in regional courts and cities, drew little from indigenous non-Muslim traditions of painting. These were Hindu and Jain, and earlier Buddhist, and almost entirely religious. They existed mainly in relatively small illustrations to texts, but also mural paintings, and paintings in folk styles on cloth, in particular ones on scrolls made to be displayed by popular singers or reciters of the Hindu epics and other stories, performed by travelling specialists; very few early examples of these last survive. In contrast Mughal painting was \\"almost entirely secular\\",Harle, 372 although religious figures were sometimes portrayed. Realism, especially in portraits of both people and animals, became a key aim, far more than in Persian painting, let alone the Indian traditions.Harle, 372 There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan Sultanate of Delhi which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. These paintings were painted on loose-leaf paper, and were usually placed between decorated wooden covers. Although the first surviving manuscripts are from Mandu in the years either side of 1500, there were very likely earlier ones which are either lost, or perhaps now attributed to southern Persia, as later manuscripts can be hard to distinguish from these by style alone, and some remain the subject of debate among specialists.Titley, 161–166 By the time of the Mughal invasion, the tradition had abandoned the high viewpoint typical of the Persian style, and adopted a more realistic style for animals and plants.Titley, 161 No miniatures survive from the reign of the founder of the dynasty, Babur, nor does he mention commissioning any in his memoirs, the Baburnama.Losty, 12 Copies of this were illustrated by his descendents, Akbar in particular, with many portraits of the many new animals Babur encountered when he invaded India, which are carefully described.Titley, 187 However some surviving un-illustrated manuscripts may have been commissioned by him, and he comments on the style of some famous past Persian masters. Some older illustrated manuscripts have his seal on them; the Mughals came from a long line stretching back to Timur and were fully assimilated into Persianate culture, and expected to patronize literature and the arts. The style of the Mughal school developed within the royal atelier. Knowledge was primarily transmitted through familial and apprenticeship relationships, and the system of joint manuscript production which brought multiple artists together for single works. In some cases, senior artists would draw the illustrations in outline, and more junior ones would usually apply the colours, especially for background areas. Where no artist names are inscribed, it is very difficult to trace Imperial Mughal paintings back to specific artists. Development Princes of the House of Timur, attributed to the Persian Abd as-Samad, c. 1550–1555, with additions in the next century under Jahangir.Crill and Jariwala, 50 After a tentative start under Humayun, the great period of Mughal painting was during the next three reigns, of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, which covered just over a century between them. =Humayun (1530–1540 and 1555–1556)= Emperor Jahangir weighs Prince Khurram by Manohar Das, 1610–15, from Jahangir's own copy of the Tuzk-e-Jahangiri. The names of the main figures are noted on their clothes, and the artist shown at bottom. British Museum When the second Mughal emperor, Humayun was in exile in Tabriz in the Safavid court of Shah Tahmasp I of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there (or in Kabul), an unusually large painting on cloth of Princes of the House of Timur, now in the British Museum. Originally a group portrait with his sons, in the next century Jahangir had it added to make it a dynastic group including dead ancestors.Crill and Jariwala, 50 When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists Abd al-Samad and Mir Sayyid Ali with him. His usurping brother Kamran Mirza had maintained a workshop in Kabul, which Humayan perhaps took over into his own. Humayan's major known commission was a Khamsa of Nizami with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent.Grove Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members,Grove a type of subject that was rare in Persia but common among the Mughals.Beach, 58 =Akbar (r. 1556–1605)= During the reign of Humayun's son Akbar (r. 1556–1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under Abd as- Samad, though it is not clear how far these studies went.Beach, 49 Between 1560 and 1566 the Tutinama (\\"Tales of a Parrot\\"), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art was illustrated, showing \\"the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage\\".Grove Among other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the Hamzanama consisting of 1,400 cotton folios, unusually large at 69 cm x 54 cm (approx. 27 x 20 inches) in size. This huge project \\"served as a means of moulding the disparate styles of his artists, from Iran and from different parts of India, into one unified style\\". By the end, the style reached maturity, and \\"the flat and decorative compositions of Persian painting have been transformed by creating a believable space in which characters painted in the round can perform\\".Losty, 15 Sa'di's masterpiece The Gulistan was produced at Fatehpur Sikri in 1582, a Darab Nama around 1585; the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208) followed in the 1590s and Jami's Baharistan around 1595 in Lahore. As Mughal-derived painting spread to Hindu courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu epics including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes. Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between 1570–1585, Akbar hired over one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.Eastman Akbar's rule established a celebratory theme among the Mughal Empire. In this new period, Akbar persuaded artist to focus on showing off spectacles and including grand symbols like elephants in their work to create the sense of a prospering empire. Along with this new mindset, Akbar also encouraged his people to write down and find a way to record what they remembered from earlier times to ensure that others would be able to remember the greatness of the Mughal empire. Ebba Koch, Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor Pādshāhnāma Revisited =Jahangir (1605–1625)= Jahangir had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further. Brushwork became finer and the colours lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The Tuzk-e-Jahangiri (or Jahangirnama), written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders. Mughal paintings made during Jahangir's reign continued the trend of Naturalism and were influenced by the resurgence of Persian styles and subjects over more traditional Hindu. =Shah Jahan (1628–1659)= During the reign of Shah Jahan (1628–58), Mughal paintings continued to develop, but court paintings became more rigid and formal. The illustrations from the \\"Padshanama\\" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The \\"Padshahnama\\" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three-quarter view or the frontal view. Themes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.Britannica Even though this period was titled the most prosperous, artists during this time were expected to adhere to representing life in court as organized and unified. For this reason, most art created under his rule focused mainly on the emperor and aided in establishing his authority. The purpose of this art was to leave behind an image of what the Mughal's believed to be the ideal ruler and state. Later paintings durbar scene with the newly crowned Emperor Aurangzeb in his golden throne. Though he did not encourage Mughal painting, some of the best work was done during in his reign. Aurangzeb (1658–1707) was never an enthusiastic patron of painting, largely for religious reasons, and took a turn away from the pomp and ceremonial of the court around 1668, after which he probably commissioned no more paintings. After 1681 he moved to the Deccan to pursue his slow conquest of the Deccan Sultanates, never returning to live in the north.Losty, 147, 149 Mughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in. Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf.Commentary by Stuart Cary Welch There was a brief revival during the reign of Muhammad Shah 'Rangeela' (1719–48), but by the time of Shah Alam II (1759–1806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of Rajputana, Rajput painting and in the cities ruled by the British East India Company, the Company style under Western influence. Late Mughal style often shows increased use of perspective and recession under Western influence. Artists Khamsa of Nizami manuscript in the British Library, made for Akbar, 1610 The Persian master artists Abd al-Samad and Mir Sayyid Ali, who had accompanied Humayun to India in the 16th century, were in charge of the imperial atelier during the formative stages of Mughal painting. Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded. Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one (generally the most senior) to decide and outline the composition, the second to actually paint, and perhaps a third who specialized in portraiture, executing individual faces.Losty, 31; Crill and Jariwala, 27; Britannica This was especially the case with the large historical book projects that dominated production during Akbar's reign, the Tutinama, Baburnama, Hamzanama, Razmnama, and Akbarnama. For manuscripts of Persian poetry there was a different way of working, with the best masters apparently expected to produce exquisitely finished miniatures all or largely their own work.Losty, 31 An influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was Kesu Das, who understood and developed \\"European techniques of rendering space and volume\\". Conveniently for modern scholars, Akbar liked to see the names of the artists written below each miniature. Analysis of manuscripts shows that individual miniatures were assigned to many painters. For example, the incomplete Razmnama in the British Library contains 24 miniatures, with 21 different names, though this may be an especially large number.\\"Razmnamah: the Persian Mahabharata\\", British Library Asian and African studies blog, by Ursula Sims-Williams, April 2016 - see table near bottom Other important painters under Akbar and Jahangir were:Diamind, Maurice. \\"Mughal Painting Under Akbar the Great\\" Metropolitan Museum of Art *Farrukh Beg (c. 1545– c. 1615), another Persian import, in India from 1585–1590, perhaps then in Bijapur, returning north from around 1605 to his death. *Daswanth, a Hindu, d. 1584, who worked especially on Akbar's Razmnama, the Mahabharata in Persian * Basawan a Hindu active c. 1580–1600, whose son Manohar Das was active c. 1582–1624 * Govardhan, active c. 1596 to 1640, another Hindu, especially good at portraits.

The sub-imperial school of Mughal painting included artists such as Mushfiq, Kamal, and Fazl. During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son Dalchand. Mughal style today Mughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect. The skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.

It is a subsidiary of the Rethmann Group. History Rhenus Logistics Mercedes-Benz Atego in Berlin Rhenus Logistics distribution centre in Son en Breugel, Netherlands On 13 November 1912 Badische Actiengesellschaft für Rheinschiffahrt und Seetransport and Rheinschiffahrts Actiengesellschaft established a joint company with headquarters in Frankfurt. It was named Rhenus adopting the Latin word for the Rhine. Branch offices were established in Antwerp, Mainz, Mannheim and Rotterdam. In 1929 Rhenus merged with Badische Actiengesellschaft, Rheinschiffahrts Actiengesellschaft and other shipping companies. In 1934 Hibernia Bergwerksgesellschaft, a subsidiary of VEBA, acquired a majority shareholding in the company.History 1912-1934 Rhenus Group In 1969 VEBA restructured. Hugo Stinnes AG taking over the transport activities of VEBA. In 1971 Hugo Stinnes AG restructured its inland waterway shipping activities. The Fendel-Stinnes-Schiffahrt company was set up near Duisburg.History 1956-1988 Rhenus Group In 1976 Rhenus merged with Fendel-Stinnes-Schiffahrt and WTAG to form Rhenus-WTAG with company headquarters moving to Dortmund. At this stage, Rhenus-WTAG had 40 branch offices throughout Germany. The CCS Combined Container Service was founded at the same time. In 1984 Rhenus-WTAG merged with Westfaelische Transport-AG and resumed under the name Rhenus. In 1988 Rhenus was restructured into three companies: Rhenus Weichelt handled road freight transport, Rhenus Lager und Umschlag took on warehousing, transhipment and inland waterway shipping and Rhenus Transport International was responsible for international freight forwarding and air freight. In 1990 Stinnes AG (1979 change of name from Hugo Stinnes AG) entered into a strategic alliance with Schenker AG, acquiring a 25% stake in this subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn. In 1991 Stinnes purchased Schenker AG outright and the three Rhenus divisions were restructured again. Rhenus Transport International became part of the newly formed Schenker International; Rhenus Lager und Umschlag then operated under the former name of Rhenus, and Rhenus-Weichelt was merged with Schenker Eurocargo. In 1996 the three divisions were merged under the umbrella of Schenker-Rhenus AG company.History 1991-1998 Rhenus Group In 1993, a 60,000 m² logistics centre opened in Berlin. Other logistics centres were opened in the following years in Langgöns, Giessen, Mannheim, Stuttgart, Hanover and Prague. In 1998 Rethmann & Co took over Rhenus. In 2000 Rhenus acquired Schweizerische Reederei und Neptun and rebranded it Rhenus Alpina. In the same year, Rhenus started operating the Ikea central warehouse in Salzgitter and launched the International Consolidation Centre in Giessen. In 2002, Rhenus Alpina took over Cargologic and began handling air freight at Bern, Geneva and Zurich Airports. A new logistics centre was built near Paris and an external supplier warehouse for Daimler-Benz opened in Stuttgart. In 2003, Rhenus set up a joint venture with Kerry Logistics in Asia. In 2004 Polish logistics provider Polta was purchased.

Directed, co-written and co-produced by Menahem Golan, the film features Martin Balsam, Joey Bishop, Robert Vaughn, Steve James, Robert Forster, Shelley Winters, George Kennedy, and an uncredited Liam Neeson in an early role. Two sequels were produced, entitled Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection and the direct-to-video Delta Force 3: The Killing Game. The Delta Force was \\"inspired\\" by the hijacking of TWA Flight 847.  Plot  In 1980, Operation Eagle Claw is aborted after a fatal helicopter crash, with the U.S. Delta Force evacuating to their C-130 transports. Among them is Captain Scott McCoy, who, against orders, rescues his wounded comrade, Peterson, from the burning helicopter before the team finally evacuates. McCoy expresses his disgust for the politicians and the military hierarchy that forced the mission to launch despite the risks, and announces his resignation. Five years later, a group of Lebanese terrorists hijack American Travelways Airlines Flight 282, a Boeing 707 flying from Cairo to New York City via Athens and Rome. Taking all 144 passengers and crew hostage on the Athens-Rome leg, the pro-Khomeini New World Revolutionary Organization (based on Hezbollah), led by two terrorists named Abdul Rafai and Mustafa, force Captain Roger Campbell and his crew to fly the 707 to Beirut, where they make demands to the United States government that, if not met, will result in the death of each of the hostages. During the crisis, they segregate the Jewish passengers from the Americans by forcing a reluctant flight purser of German heritage named Ingrid Harding to identify them. A Catholic priest, William O'Malley, joins the Jews in solidarity. Unbeknownst to the authorities, the Jewish hostages are then taken off the plane and transported to a militant-controlled area of Beirut, while a dozen additional henchmen are brought on board. The flight departs for Algiers, where the terrorists release the female hostages and children. Meanwhile, Delta Force, led by Colonel Nick Alexander and a recalled-to-duty and newly promoted-to-Major McCoy are deployed to resolve the crisis. Once the female hostages are evacuated, they launch their assault, only to discover too late that there are additional hijackers on board. When the Delta Force blow their cover, Abdul kills a U.S. Navy Diver named Tom Hale. He then forces the pilots to return to Beirut and takes the remaining male passengers with him. Upon returning to Beirut, the terrorists transport the passengers to a separate location, while the pilots remain in the 707. Working with a sympathetic Greek Orthodox priest, Israeli Army Intelligence prepares an operation to free the hostages. McCoy and a colleague are able to enter into Lebanon disguised as a Canadian television crew. In a prolonged campaign against the terrorists, the Delta Force bide their time to identify the terrorist leaders and locate the hostages. Once the hostages are located, Delta Force assaults the terrorist holdouts, freeing the hostages and evacuating them to the airport. During the battle, McCoy, Peterson, and their team hunt for Abdul and the Jewish hostages. They kill most of the militants but Abdul gravely injures Peterson and flees. While the commandos tend to Peterson, McCoy chases Abdul and tracks him down to an abandoned home. He then engages him into a vicious hand-to-hand fight, breaking Abdul's arm. As the terrorist leader prepares to shoot McCoy, he is killed when McCoy launches a rocket into his car. With the hostages and rescue teams secured, the team seizes Flight 282 by secretly infiltrating the airfield through a cotton plantation. Using silenced weapons, Alexander and the Delta team kill the terrorist guards and save the crew. They board the 707 with all of the hostages, taking off to Israel just as McCoy storms the runway on his motorcycle; managing to board after destroying several terrorist jeeps. On board, the team tends to the wounded passengers and the dying Peterson. After having confirmed the hostages are safe and en route home, Peterson says his farewells to McCoy before succumbing to his wounds. In the main cabin the ex- hostages and Delta commandos join together in a rousing rendition of \\"America The Beautiful\\", not knowing about Peterson's death, except for Alexander, Bobby, McCoy, and O'Malley. In Israel, the Boeing 707 lands safely and the hostages are greeted by their families, while Delta Force disembarks with Peterson's body in tow to their C-130. The team concludes their operation and departs for the United States amidst celebrations by the people.  Cast  Chuck Norris on the film set. = Delta Force = * Chuck Norris as Maj.

The Delta Force was entirely shot in Israel. Pentagon scenes were shot at the GG Israel Studios facility near Jerusalem, owned by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus. The Athens, Beirut, Algiers, and Tel Aviv airport scenes were filmed at Ben Gurion International Airport and its military portion, Lod Air Force Base, although one Athens airport scene where an accomplice of the hijackers exits a taxi, was filmed at the eastern terminal of Ellinikon International Airport while the Athens airport concourse (interior) scenes were filmed in Ben Gurion's main terminal, which at present, is terminal 1. Jaffa was used for scenes of the siege and hostage rescue in the Beirut countryside including midnight oceanic scenes. The film's budget was $9 million. =Vehicles= The Lockheed C-130H Hercules in the film actually belonged to the Israeli Air Force, registered as 89–9106. It was lent to the Golan-Globus company for filming after it was given a false registration, 14X-FBB and U.S. Air Force designs. Its lease arrangement was similar to Iron Eagle, wherein the United States Air Force refused to participate due to a long-standing policy about not cooperating on any film involving the theft of an aircraft, causing the filmmakers to turn to the Israeli Air Force for the necessary aerial sequences. The army vehicles for the military and terrorists came from the U.S. Army and Israel Defense Forces. The Boeing 707-139(B) with the registration N778PA, was operated by several airlines including Olympic Airways, Aer Lingus, Saudia, Turkish Airlines, Pan American World Airways, which operated it as Clipper Skylark from 1962 to 1976. Prior to filming in 1985, the aircraft had been operated by Israeli charter-operator MAOF Air and was retired from commercial service in December 1984. The aircraft was then leased to Golan-Globus Productions in late 1985 while in storage at Tel Aviv (just after the TWA-847 hijacking) and repainted with the fake airline name \\"American Transworld Airlines\\" while retaining the MAOF livery, but later changed to \\"American Travelways Airlines\\" to avoid confusion and legal action. Upon completion of the film, it was sold to Jet Avionic Systems Incorporated on May 28, 1985. Aerocar Aviation acquired it in January 1986 and sold it to Boeing Military Aircraft Company on March 20, 1986 to be used as a source of spares for the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker program. The U.S. Air Force acquired it later on and parted its vertical stabilizer and engines for the Boeing KC-135E Stratotanker. N778PA was destroyed by fire in a welding accident while in storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 1992. Portions of the airframe may still exist. The 1985 Suzuki SP600 motorcycle used by Chuck Norris was designed by Suzuki specifically for the film. After modifying it and adding the weaponry, Suzuki America gave the bike to Golan- Globus production in Israel prior to filming. =Music= Alan Silvestri's electronic score gained a new life when ABC Sports used it to intro their Indianapolis 500 broadcasts from 1988–1998 and again in 2001. It was also used for the intro of the Brickyard 400 until ABC lost the race rights to NBC Sports in 2001. According to famous Indianapolis 500 anchor Paul Page, he does not want any ESPN/ABC anchor to use this music in intros for the Indianapolis 500 and Brickyard 400 unless he narrates the intros himself. It is now used on the XM Satellite broadcasts of IndyCar racing events, of which Paul Page is the announcer. The soundtrack album was initially released by Enigma Records, and later by Milan Records (minus \\"The Rescue\\") on an album paired with Jerry Goldsmith's King Solomon's Mines; in 2008 Intrada Records issued a limited edition CD with the entire score. Quartet Records released a two-disc set in 2013 featuring the Intrada album programme on disc one and the Enigma album listing on disc two; all are now OOP. Release Marvin did publicity for the film, which was rare for him. He said the movie was \\"a good flick\\" and admitted \\"but I guess I might be protecting myself, keeping the doors open\\" with Cannon. \\"There aren't too many firm film offers these days that guarantee money up front.\\" Marvin was considering doing a sequel where Delta Force would rescue hostages after a terrorist skyjacking of a luxury liner.LEE MARVIN: THE 'FORCE' IS WITH HIM Beck, Marilyn. Philadelphia Daily News ]11 Feb 1986: 45. =Box Office= The Delta Force opened in 1,720 theaters and debuted as #3 in the box office losing to The Color Purple and Down and Out in Beverly Hills; it beat A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge and Youngblood. The Delta Force earned $5,959,505 on its opening weekend and had a total gross of $17,768,900 in the United States. The film was released on DVD on September 28, 2000. The Delta Force has been released on Blu-ray in the US, and more recently in the UK by video label Arrow Films. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports as of December 2019 that 18% of eleven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". In a positive review for the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and called it \\"a well-made action film that tantalizes us with its parallels to real life.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that it \\"will be the 1986 film all others will have to beat for sheer, unashamed, hilariously vulgar vaingloriousness.\\" Variety described it as \\"an exercise in wish fulfillment for those who favor using force instead of diplomacy.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote in his review: \\" ...of so big a project, The Delta Force is drawn out and complicated.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star out of four and called it \\"a prime example\\" of \\"second-rate action pictures\\" and added, \\"The action in Beirut is more appropriate for a bad James Bond film than for a subject that has been all too real lately. Norris gets off shooting rocket launchers from his specially built motorcycle, and we sit there stunned at the movie industry's ability to make money off any tragedy.\\"Siskel, Gene (February 14, 1986). \\"'Delta Force' creates terror: Wasted actors, wasted topic\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 7, Page F. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post called the film \\"one of those disaster movies that Hollywood was churning out 10 years ago,\\" which \\"doesn't even deliver on its own sordid level. There isn't any action till 70 minutes into the film—and that's a pallid car chase, immediately deflated by composer Alan Silvestri's idiotic disco fanfare. After the car chase, it's another 30 minutes till you can watch Chuck do any karate.\\"Attanasio, Paul (February 14, 1986). \\"Hijack Chutzpah\\". The Washington Post.

Jack Shaheen listed The Delta Force in his \\"Worst List\\" of films with anti-Arab stereotypes. Historical resemblances The film, although fiction, draws inspiration from two real- life events; the flight 847 hijacking and Operation Entebbe. Below are a key elements from both real-life and film. =TWA Flight 847= * The hijacked TWA 847 took off from Athens on 14 June 1985; the film's ATW likewise departed Athens, on 19 July 1985. * The abbreviation of airline in the film, American Travelways Airlines, is ATW and is an anagram of Trans World Airlines. The film portrays the plane as a Boeing 707 while TWA used a Boeing 727 for flight 847. * The airline's route is Cairo-Athens-Rome. While TWA 847 has stopovers in Boston and Los Angeles and ending in San Diego, the film's flight terminates in New York City. * Two terrorists hijack the flight; the third is arrested in Athens in both real-life and film. * The flight is managed by a German American flight purser, who is forced by the hijackers to segregate Jewish passengers from the non-Jews by identifying them through collected passports. The film's purser is partially based on Uli Derickson. * A member of the U.S. Navy is shot and dumped off the plane into the tarmac. The film depicts the setting as Algiers at night as opposed to Beirut during daytime hours in real-life. * Additional henchmen board the plane along with the released hijacker. =Operation Entebbe= * The hostage rescue scene when the commandos raid the terrorist quarters * A pregnant woman is on the flight.

FINAL REPORT.http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/s1931/2384.pdf was built. Probably this pier was damaged in the second World War and had to be repaired. The ferry services between the Wanchai Pier and Jordan Road, Kowloon was in operation as early as 12 November 1949.https://industrialhistoryhk.org/the- hongkong-and-yaumati-ferry-company-ltd-1923-1973-timeline/ Because the ferry line mainly catered to passengers on the Hong Kong Island to the east of Wanchai, the China Motor Bus company rerouted its bus route no. 2 so that it passed near the Wanchai Pier. At the same time the bus company started the auxiliary bus route no. 8. The Wanchai Pier was not where it is today. It was located on Gloucester Road, near Tonnochy Road. The bus route no. 8 then and the route no. 11, which entered service later, both had stops on Tonnochy Road. On 1 June 1956 the Stewart Pier commenced operation and the ferry service to Jordan Road was rerouted to this pier. On 3 July 1956 a new ferry line to Kowloon City started operation at the Tonnochy Road Pier. This ferry line was terminated on 24 June 1967. On 12 November 1963 the ferry service between Hung Hom and Wanchai commenced operation. Second generation (1968 to 2014) Second Generation Pier Pier Entry Gate From 1965 to 1972 Wanchai underwent more land reclamation. The coastline moved north from Gloucester Road to today's Convention Avenue and Hung Hing Road. In April 1988 the Jordan Road <-> Wanchai ferry line was terminated and replaced by the new line between Tsim Sha Tsui and Wanchai. On 1 April 2011 the Hung Hom <-> Wanchai line was terminated. The Wanchai<->Tsim Sha Tsui line has since been the only remaining ferry service at the Wanchai Pier.

The Star Ferry Company that has been operating the Wanchai<->Tsim Sha Tsui ferry line objected to the demolition in 2007.「天星反對拆灣仔碼頭」, The Sun (HK), 31 July 2007 The new pier commenced operation on 30 August 2014. It has an area of about 2,200 sq m, about 150 sq m less than the previous pier. The facilities are more or less the same as the Central Star Ferry Pier (Piers no. 7 & 8). The second floor of the new pier will be used for food and catering. 中環碼頭擬加高一層半 Apple Daily (HK) 30 August 2011 However, the second floor reserved for food and catering will have to wait at least half a year to have electricity connection after the pier's operation commenced. Passengers questioned that the new walkway to the new pier was too narrow and insufficient for the passenger flow during peak hours. The Civil Engineering and Development Department replied that the new passenger walkway was designed to accommodate the passenger flow generated by the current ferry line.新灣仔碼頭行人路過窄, The Sun (HK), 23 August 2014 Transport interchange terminus Wan Chai Ferry Pier Public Transport Interchange (Demolished) There was a bus terminus right across the Convention Avenue from the Wanchai Pier. The bus terminus commenced operation on 10 March 1968. The China Motor Bus routes 8 and 11 were rerouted there at the same time. As space for a bus terminus was in short supply in Wanchai, the bus terminus was expanded and routes were modified in the 1970s and 80s. After Convention Avenue and Hung Hing Road opened to traffic, a footbridge connecting the Pier and the terminus was built. The terminus was constantly highly saturated and it had been a very important terminus. As the Wanchai North Reclamation Area became more developed, the terminus was never short of passengers. Bus routes operated by the Kowloon Motor Bus, First Bus, Citybus as well as some non-franchised bus companies could be found. Those franchised bus routes provided connections between the pier and other areas in Hong Kong. Bus routes at the bus terminus included: 2A, 2X, 8, 8P, 40, 40M, 905, 960. In the 1970s to 90s, this bus terminus also served as the terminus for Green Minibuses. The first generation Hong Kong Island route 14 (terminated in 1980), route 33 (terminated in 1985) and the current route 36 (relocated to Stewart Road in 1995) minibuses all used this terminus. On 6 February 2012, the cross-harbour bus route 930A's morning service to Hong Kong Island was extended to this terminus. On 29 July 2012, the end station of the route 930 was relocated from Admiralty (East) to this terminus. The start station of route 930A's return ride was also relocated to here. These two routes were the first two routes to Tsuen Wan from this terminus. The route 40M used this terminus as the end station. To accommodate the reroute of routes 930 and 930A, the end station of 40M was relocated to the Tamar Central Government Complex and ceased to pass through the Wanchai Pier Terminus. According to the current Sha Tin to Central Link project, the site of the Wan Chai Ferry Pier Public Transport Interchange will be used as the construction site of the Exhibition MTR Station. The terminus is relocated to a site near the coast, a newly reclaimed area to the north of Hung Hing Road, the entrance of which is at the junction of Hung Hing Road and Marsh Road. After the completion of the Exhibition Station, the original site of the bus terminus will be rebuilt into a sheltered transport interchange terminus with 9 single pits, 2 double pits, 1 taxi stand and 2 positions for loading and unloading of goods.

(See also trousers.) The old plural form of \\"hose\\" was hosen. In German these terms (Hose, singular, and Hosen, plural) remained in use and are the generic terms for trousers today. The French equivalent was chausses. History Early wool hose were fitted to the leg, and 15th century hose were often made particolored or mi-parti, having each leg a different colour, or even one leg made of two colors. These early hose were footed, in the manner of modern tights, and were open from the crotch to the leg. When very short doublets were in fashion, codpieces were added to cover the front opening. By the 16th century, hose had separated into two garments: upper hose or breeches and nether hose or stockings. From the mid-16th to early 17th centuries, a variety of styles of hose were in fashion. Popular styles included: *Trunk hose or round hose, short padded hose. Very short trunk hose were worn over cannions, fitted hose that ended above the knee. * Slops or galligaskins, loose hose reaching just below the knee. ::Trunk hose and slops could be paned or pansied, with strips of fabric (panes) over a full inner layer or lining. Pansied slop is a round hose characterized by the addition of a layer of panes, or strips of fabric running from the waistband to the leg band. These are commonly referred to as \\"pumpkin\\" pants. * Pluderhosen, a Northern European form of pansied slops with a very full inner layer pulled out between the panes and hanging below the knee.Arnold (1986), pp. 16–18. Originating in Germany, Pluderhosen soon spread to central and Eastern Europe. * Venetians, semi-fitted hose reaching just below the knee.

At the end of the series, he is approximately 500 years of age. His outward appearance is that of a beautiful adolescent boy, 5’6, with curly auburn hair, large brown eyes and slender fingers. His features are at times compared figuratively to those of Cupid or a Botticelli angel. Fictional biography =As a human= Armand is born in 1481 in the former Kiev Rus to the acclaimed hunter Ivan. Armand's original name is Andrei. As a child he has the ability to paint vivid pictures of Jesus Christ, Madonna, and the Eastern Orthodox Saints. His astonished parents eventually reveal his gift to the monks in the Monastery of the Caves, who live an ascetic life buried beneath earth, sustained only by water and small amounts of food. Both the monks and Andrei believe he is destined to live such a life, while his father is appalled by the idea. When their ruler, Prince Michael, orders Andrei to paint an icon and bring it to the castle of his brother, the supposedly dead Prince Feodor, Andrei is captured by Tartars and brought as a slave to Constantinople and subsequently sold to a Venetian brothel. There, he is subjected to horrific sexual abuse and develops amnesia. Marius, a 1500-year-old vampire then living as a painter in Venice, rescues Andrei, giving him an education and a luxurious life. Marius renames him Amadeo. Marius is in love with a courtesan named Bianca Solderini, yet cannot bring himself to turn her into a vampire. Instead, he chooses Amadeo for his beauty, youth and painting skills (apparently lost, along with his memories) to educate 'in the way of the blood', so as to eventually make him a vampire. Amadeo loves Marius single- mindedly and is eager to become a vampire. He does not understand Marius' hesitation to turn him, and in an act of rebellion and anger he seduces an English Lord, whom he eventually abandons after a few nights. However, the English Lord becomes obsessed with Amadeo and enraged by his betrayal, wounds him with a poisoned blade. In doing this, he forces Marius to turn Amadeo into a vampire to save his life. Amadeo is 17 years old at the time of his transformation. =As a vampire= Shortly after Amadeo becomes a vampire, Marius' Palazzo is attacked by a Satanic cult of vampires, led by the vampire Santino. They set Marius on fire and kidnap Amadeo and the other children at the Palazzo and take them to Rome. Santino tortures Amadeo by burning his friends to death right in front of him and starving him in a cellar until he is forced to feed on his best friend and innocent children. After five months of such psychological torture, Amadeo is ready to believe everything the cult said in exchange for their love and to forget all he has known before. Because of his strength, he is named the leader of the Parisian coven in 1580, and renamed Armand, since a name with the word 'God' (Deo) in it seemed unfit for the leader of a satanic coven. Roughly two hundred years later the coven tries to capture Lestat (turned vampire by Magnus, another old target of the coven) and considers destroying him, but Lestat is stronger than Armand, and declares them ridiculous and unfit for the times in which they lived. He disproves their beliefs that they could not look upon crosses, walk into churches, or live in places of light. Realizing that Lestat is right about the coven's obsolescence, Armand falls into despair and destroys most of his own followers. He tries to persuade Lestat to take him along on his journeys, but Lestat refuses. Instead, Armand joins the Théâtre des Vampires and learns to move among mortals. In the late 19th century, Lestat's fledglings Claudia and Louis happen upon the theater. Armand sees Louis as a new possibility of integrating into the modern world. When he cannot persuade Louis to leave Claudia, he manages to get rid of her by burning her to death in the sun, and then lets Louis burn the theater with the vampires in it so they can leave together. They stay together until around the 1920s, then part because Louis has never fully recovered from the loss of Claudia, and knows that Armand is at least partly responsible for her death. After the incidents in Interview with the Vampire, Daniel Molloy tries to find Lestat, but is instead found by Armand. Daniel provides a link for Armand to the new time, and they form a relationship. However, Daniel grows more and more impatient, longing to be turned to a vampire, and he and Armand become estranged. By 1985, Daniel manages to destroy his health to such a degree that he is near death, so Armand finally turns him into a vampire. Daniel is Armand's only fledgling to date, and they can no longer stay together afterward. When Lestat brings back Veronica's Veil from his journey in Memnoch the Devil, Armand is struck by the sight of it; his religious fervor revived, he goes into the sun in an attempt to destroy and redeem himself. He not only survives, however, but manages miraculously to save a girl named Sybelle from her abusive brother. Sybelle and her protector, Benji, restore Armand with the blood of a drug dealer, and the three of them become very close. When Armand dictates the book The Vampire Armand to David Talbot, former head of the Talamasca and by then Lestat's fledgling, he leaves Sybelle and Benji in Marius' care. The latter then turns them into vampires.  Vampire family  Portrayal in other media In the 1994 film Interview with the Vampire, Armand was portrayed by Antonio Banderas. Contrary to his book description, this version of Armand was a fully-grown adult (of Spanish origin instead of Russian) when he was turned into a vampire. In the 2002 film Queen of the Damned, Armand was portrayed by Matthew Newton. In the 2006 musical, Lestat, Armand was first portrayed by Jack Noseworthy, who left the role a week after the pre-Broadway performance began, and was then replaced by his understudy Drew Sarich, who went with the production onto Broadway.

It is located in the Meyerland area of Houston, Texas. The school has 553 students and 111 faculty members. It is accredited by the Southwestern Association of Episcopal Schools and is a member of the Houston Association of Independent Schools (HAIS) and the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS). Starting in 2020, STES will embark on a $29,000,000 construction project to restore and enhance the school campus. Construction is set to finish in the fall of 2021. History The school opened in September, 1955, with the founder T. Robert Ingram, five teachers, and eighty-five students in kindergarten and primary grades. Its first high school class graduated in 1967. Since then, many graduates have gone on to universities and trade schools throughout the nation and abroad. In the wake of the killing of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, a group of STE alumni asked the school leadership to acknowledge the deceased founder's segregationist writings and to take measures against racism. Founding principles The school's mission is \\"to form honorable men and women through a classical education grounded in a Christ-centered world view.\\" Starting at the kindergarten level, the school offers a structured, classical education. Curriculum =Lower school= The lower school curriculum includes formal instruction in grammar and composition, phonics and spelling, and reading comprehension. The earlier years are largely foundational: students are taught to think about language as a logical, hierarchical progression. In later years, students sharpen these skills and apply them to reading literature, both secular and sacred, and writing short essays. In addition to language, students also receive instruction in arithmetic and mathematical reasoning throughout their entire course of study. =Middle school= Language arts The middle school curriculum continues the study of language arts: grammar, vocabulary acquisition, writing, and literature. The faculty maintains a largely prescriptionist approach to the study of grammar and syntax and, to this end, grammar is approached in a rigorous, systematic way. Sentence parsing and diagramming are frequently employed to demonstrate the organization of grammatical constructs. As the curriculum progresses, students will be expected to write longer essays about a variety of topics incorporating a more varied lexicon and complex grammatical forms. They will be graded on both style and content. Additionally, students will apply all of their language arts skills to analyzing and criticizing great English language works. Mathematics Students will also continue their study of mathematics, building on the foundation set in the lower school curriculum. The six and seventh grade are largely devoted to the study of pre-algebra and elementary algebra concepts: fractions, integers, square roots and exponents, decimals, and the Cartesian coordinate system, among others. Eighth graders will undertake a formal study of Algebra I to prepare them for the rigors of upper school mathematics. Enrichment and electives Middle school students take a variety of other courses and have a selection of electives available to them. Social studies include investigation of the major political, economic, and social events that shaped the ancient and classical world and provides context for a deeper appreciation of Biblical history. The scientific method is presented through a detailed study of physical and life sciences, wherein students will have the opportunity to participate in exciting demonstrations and experiments that elucidate core concepts. The study of Latin and a modern Romance language (either French or Spanish) is also an important part of the curriculum as is development of basic technology competency critical to navigating the Information age. Finally, electives like choir, strings, band, highland dancing, art, speech, and theater help students to develop important skills and, in many cases, find a lifelong passion. =Upper school= The upper school curriculum is primarily intended to prepare students for higher education and to this end students take core, college-preparatory courses and electives based on their individual interests. Advanced Placement Program The School has an exceptionally well-developed Advanced Placement (AP) program, wherein students take classes that closely parallel university- level courses in the same subject. These classes follow a strict syllabus and are graded more rigorously than non-AP courses. They culminate in a standardized, comprehensive exam each spring, a passing score on which may earn the student college credit. Most St. Thomas students take at least one AP course throughout their four years and many take two or more. English Students are required to take English for all four years, and each course is organized along a thematic axis: 9th grade- Epic Literature, 10th- American Literature, 11th- British Literature, 12th- Comparative Literature. Eleventh and Twelfth grade English are each offered with an AP option for well-prepared students intending to sit the national exams in Language and Literature. Each year, upper school students are required to write a comprehensive research paper in addition to the variety of shorter analysis papers they prepare. Central to the English curriculum is a required summer reading program for all students: these carefully selected fiction and non-fiction works are intended to inculcate a lifelong love of reading for pleasure. Finally, students will continue to refine their grammar, syntax, and vocabulary through drills and weekly quizzes in anticipation of standardized tests like SAT and ACT. Mathematics All students take four years of mathematics to include the studies of geometry, algebra II, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, and differential equations. In recent years, students have been divided into an “Accelerated” or “Level” track. The course of study is largely the same, but the “Accelerated” track includes a more in-depth analysis of theoretical topics whereas the “Level” track takes a more applied approach. The culmination of the “Accelerated” track is usually AP Calculus or differential equations whereas “Level” students can choose between calculus, statistics, and finite math. Science Upper school students are required to take a minimum of three years of natural science. These courses include biology, chemistry, and physics, some of which includes a weekly, mandatory after- school laboratory section. Upon completion of first year courses in each subject, students may elect to take the corresponding AP course. During certain years, based on student demand, geology and AP Environmental Science are available as natural science electives. Social science Required social sciences classes are: two years of American/Texas history, one year of American politics and economics, and one year of history of western philosophy. Well-prepared students may opt to take AP US History during 10th grade and AP US Government & AP Macroeconomics during 11th grade. These courses are substantially more rigorous than their non-AP counterparts and follow the College Board's AP syllabus closely. A variety of social science electives are also typically offered to upperclassman: AP Modern European History, AP Comparative Politics, AP Human Geography, and AP Psychology. Classics The study of Latin is an integral part of the Upper School curriculum and is also divided into two tracks: Accelerated and Level. The Level course is intended for students with little or no previous experience with Latin and includes two years study of basic grammatical forms and vocabulary to be applied to translation of simple works. Following the first two years, students will take two “Topics” courses that cover Roman and Greek culture and society and analysis of works in translation. The Accelerated course is for students with a strong foundation in elementary Latin grammar and vocabulary. During the foundational years, students will learn more complex grammatical constructs and build their lexicon. They will apply the aforementioned to translating increasingly complex Latin prose and poetic works in many cases in their original form. Seneca, Cicero, and Horus are several of the writers typically covered. The Accelerated course culminates in AP Latin Virgil, wherein students translate and analyze substantial portions of Virgil's Aeneid. Well-prepared students often complete the Accelerated course by the end of their junior year. In past years, these students could then prepare to sit the AP Latin Literature exam, however this exam has recently been discontinued. Accelerated students who wish to continue their study of the Latin language may do so by engaging in a course of self-study directed by a faculty mentor. Both Level and Accelerated students are encouraged to compete in annual Latin competitions put on by the American Classical League. National Junior Classical League(NJCL) is a youth organization of secondary school students sponsored by the American Classical League.

Personally, Magoffin adhered to a states' rights position, including the right of a state to secede from the Union, and he sympathized with the Confederate cause. Nevertheless, when the Kentucky General Assembly adopted a position of neutrality in the war, Magoffin ardently held to it, refusing calls for aid from both the Union and Confederate governments. In special elections held in June 1861, Unionists captured nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats and obtained two-thirds majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Despite Magoffin's strict adherence to the policy of neutrality, the Unionist legislature did not trust him and routinely overrode his vetoes. Unable to provide effective leadership due to a hostile legislature, Magoffin agreed to resign as governor in 1862, provided he could choose his successor. Lieutenant governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and Magoffin refused to allow Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk to succeed him as governor. Accordingly, Fisk resigned and the Kentucky Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, as speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson ascended to the governorship, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate. After the war, he encouraged acceptance of the Union victory and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. He died February 28, 1885. Magoffin County, Kentucky was named in his honor. Early life Beriah Magoffin was born on April 18, 1815 in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.\\"Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin\\" He was the son of Beriah and Jane (McAfee) Magoffin.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 603 His father was an immigrant from County Down, Ireland, and his mother was the daughter of Samuel McAfee, a prominent pioneer in early Kentucky.Powell, p. 52 Magoffin's early education was obtained in the common schools of Harrodsburg. In 1835, he graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and in 1838, he earned a law degree from Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. Afterward, he moved to Jackson, Mississippi where he began his legal career. From 1838 to 1839, he served as Reading Clerk for the Mississippi state senate. Magoffin returned to Kentucky in 1839 due to an illness. He continued his legal practice in Harrodsburg, and was appointed police judge of Harrodsburg by Governor Robert P. Letcher in 1840. On April 21, 1840, he married Anna Nelson Shelby. Shelby was the granddaughter of Kentucky's first and fifth governor, Isaac Shelby. Ten of the couple's children survived infancy. Magoffin became active in the Democratic Party, serving as a presidential elector in 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856 and as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1848, 1856, 1860, and 1872. He served one term in the Kentucky Senate in 1850, but declined his party's nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1851. In 1855 was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, running on a ticket with Beverly L. Clarke, who was defeated by Know Nothing candidate Charles S. Morehead. Governor of Kentucky Magoffin was elected governor of Kentucky by a vote of 76,187 to 67,283 over Joshua Fry Bell, taking office on August 30, 1859. He supported states' rights and the institution of slavery. Although he believed in the right of states to secede from the union, he hoped to avoid this outcome by reaching an agreement between the southern and northern states. To that end, he wrote a circular letter to the governors of the slave states on December 9, 1860 detailing a plan to save the Union.Harrison in Register, p. 92 Magoffin's plan was to unite the slave states around a set of minimum concessions to see if the North would accept them as an alternative to war. The concessions included a constitutional amendment repealing any state law that interfered with enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, passage of amendments to the Fugitive Slave Act ensuring that any state that would not return a fugitive slave or obstructed a slave's return would compensate the owner of the slave, passage of a law requiring extradition of anyone indicted by a grand jury for enticing the escape of a slave, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing slavery in all current and future territories south of 36 degrees north latitude, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing all states the right of using the Mississippi River, and provide protection for southern states in the U.S. Senate from oppressive slavery legislation.Harrison in Register, p. 93 After the slave state governors refused Magoffin's plan, he endorsed the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden. Jeff Davis) kills off his chickens.\\" In January 1861, Magoffin called the state legislature into special session and asked them to call a convention to determine Kentucky's course in the Civil War. The Unionist majority in the legislature feared that the vote of the convention would be to take Kentucky out of the Union; consequently, they refused to call the convention.Harrison in Kentucky's Governors, p. 79 In response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops on April 15, 1861, Magoffin defiantly declared by telegram, \\"I will send not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister Southern States.\\" Encouraged by Magoffin's rebuff of Lincoln, Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Pope Walker requested Kentucky troops for the southern cause a week later, but Magoffin similarly refused him.Dues, p. 23 Magoffin called another special session of the legislature in May 1861. Again, the legislators refused to call a convention to determine the state's course in the war. Instead, they approved a resolution of neutrality, and Magoffin proclaimed this position on May 20, 1861. Later that month, Magoffin sent a letter to Confederate President Jefferson Davis asking that he recognize and honor Kentucky's neutrality. In August, he sent an identical letter to President Lincoln. Although Magoffin pledged \\"to abide by the will of the majority of the people in the state\\" and to uphold the state and federal constitutions, Unionists in the legislature did not trust Magoffin. In the state's special elections in June 1861, Unionist candidates swept nine of Kentucky's ten congressional districts and obtained two-thirds majorities in both houses of the General Assembly. From then on, they routinely overrode Magoffin's vetoes. In early September 1861, both federal and Confederate troops entered Kentucky.Harrison in Register, p. 106 Magoffin declared both sides equally guilty of violating Kentucky's neutrality and demanded that both sides withdraw. A resolution calling for immediate withdrawal by both Union and Confederate forces was defeated in the legislature. Instead, the legislature passed a resolution ordering only the Confederate troops out of the state. Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 604 Despite his southern sympathies, Magoffin denounced the actions of this convention. Magoffin and the legislature continued to clash throughout the remainder of 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden.Harrison in Kentucky's Governors, p. 80 Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating the civil rights of states' rights advocates, even if they did not advocate secession. Calls by the legislature for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared his willingness to resign on the condition that he be allowed to choose his successor.Harrison in Register, p. 108 Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next in line for the governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as his successor, so Fisk resigned as speaker and the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, and Robinson assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term. Later life and death The Beriah Magoffin Monument in Harrodsburg After the war, Magoffin returned to his legal practice and engaged in agricultural pursuits in Harrodsburg. A series of land speculation ventures near Chicago, Illinois made him very wealthy. He encouraged his fellow Kentuckians to accept the results of the war. He advocated for civil rights for blacks and urged passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. In his last act of public service, Magoffin represented Mercer County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1867 to 1869. He died at home on February 28, 1885 and was buried in Spring Hill Cemetery in Harrodsburg. In 1900, a monument was erected in the cemetery in Magoffin's honor.Brent, p. 6 Magoffin County, Kentucky was created in 1860 and also named in his honor.

With locations in almost every city in the country, including 18 in Stockholm alone , it is the fourth largest group of fashion stores in Sweden.  History  Åhléns began as a mail order business. It was created in 1899 by Johan Petter Åhlén and Erik Holm, in the little town of Insjön in the province of Dalarna. The name of the company was first “Åhlén och Holm” (Åhlén and Holm). The first item sold by the company was a print of the royal family. Over 100,000 copies were sold, and it was very successful. Åhlén and Holm continued to grow over the years. After only 10 years, JP Åhlén had a company with a worth of 1.5 million SEK and 255 employees. In 1915, the company moved to Stockholm with half its employees. Before he moved the company, JP Åhlén secured a seven-floor storage building. In 1932, Åhlén decided that he wanted to expand the business and create a retail trade store with low prices. He established the Tempo department store and opened it on Östermalmstorg in Stockholm. Åhlén died in 1939, leaving control of the companies to his oldest son. On the 50th anniversary (1945) of the establishment of Åhléns and Holm, the company boasted a worth of 87 million SEK, and with a force of more than 2700 workers. The mail order business was shut down in the 1960s, and a store called Åhléns City was opened in 1964 in the heart of Stockholm. In 1985, all the Tempo department stores re-branded as Åhléns. In 1988, Åhléns City was sold to Axel Johnson AB, which is owned by Antonia Ax:son Johnson. Åhléns stores have now been converted into department stores and moved upmarket, and now concentrate on four business areas: Fashion (Mode), Beauty (Skönhet), Homeware (Hem), and Media. Åhléns' loyalty card is called the Åhléns Club. In 2009, Åhléns City's sales totalled 6202 million SEK in stores, and the profit was 216 million SEK. In 2017, a truck crashed into the Åhléns City in a terrorist attack. Five died and fourteen others were seriously injured.

He was later elected to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate from 1859 to 1865. The reforms enacted during Powell's term as governor gave Kentucky one of the top educational systems in the antebellum South. He also improved Kentucky's transportation system and vetoed legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth. Powell's election as governor marked the end of Whig dominance in Kentucky. Powell's predecessor, John J. Crittenden, was the last governor elected from the party of the Commonwealth's favorite son, Henry Clay. Following his term as governor, Powell was elected to the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan dispatched Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, so much so that the Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions. Powell died at his home near Henderson, Kentucky shortly following a failed bid to return to the Senate in 1867. Early life Powell was born on October 6, 1812 near Henderson, Kentucky, the third son of Lazarus and Ann McMahon Powell.Biographical Sketch, p. 11 He attended the common schools of Henderson, and was tutored by George Gayle.Powell, p. 46 He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Saint Joseph College in Bardstown, Kentucky in 1833,Biographical Sketch, p. 18 and began studying law under John Rowan.Harrison, p. 731 He then enrolled in the Transylvania University School of Law, studying under Justice George Robertson and Judge Daniel Mayes. He was admitted to the bar in 1835, and partnered with Archibald Dixon to start a law practice in Henderson. The two remained partners until 1839.Biographical Sketch, p. 25 On November 8, 1837, Powell married Harriet Ann Jennings.Biographical Sketch, p. 26 The couple had three sons before Jennings died on July 30, 1846. Political career A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's political career began with an 1836 bid for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives.NGA Bio He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election.Starling in Kentucky: History of Henderson County This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.Memorial Record of Western Kentucky, pp. 625–630 =Governor of Kentucky= In 1848, Kentucky Democrats nominated Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd declined the nomination. Powell was chosen to replace Boyd on the ticket, largely due to the influence of James Guthrie.Biographical Sketch, p. 40 The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, and the race was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that he would run as an independent Democratic candidate. Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election. In the gubernatorial election of 1851, Powell was once again the Democratic Party nominee. The Whigs nominated Powell's friend and law partner, Archibald Dixon. Powell and Dixon traveled the state together, eating at the same taverns, speaking from the same platforms, and generally showing cordiality and friendliness that was rare in Kentucky politics in those days. Powell's margin of victory in the general election was a thin 850 votes, while Whig candidate John P. Thompson defeated the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, Robert Wickliffe, by several thousand votes.Ramage, p. 72 A third candidate for governor, abolitionist Cassius M. Clay, received 3,621 votes. Powell was the first Democrat elected to the office in almost twenty years.Encyclopedia of Kentucky (John L. Helm had ascended to the governorship on Crittenden's resignation.) The Whigs also maintained control of the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur. As a result of the 1850 census, the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell vetoed the redistricting, noting that the districts had been gerrymandered to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the veto. The governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.Harrison, p. 732 Powell implemented the use of the state's sinking fund to pay interest on school bonds, a measure which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.Ramage, p. 73 Among Powell's other successes as governor was his successful lobbying of the legislature to conduct a geological survey in 1854. He also encouraged private investment in transportation in the state. During his term, the state went from having of railroad track in operation to having in operation. =United States Senator= In January 1858, Powell was elected to the United States Senate. In April of that year, President James Buchanan appointed Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch commissioners to negotiate settlements with the Mormons in Utah. On arriving in Utah, Powell and McCulloch issued a proclamation by President Buchanan offering clemency to Mormons who agreed to submit to Federal authority.Biographical Sketch, p. 52 The offer was accepted, and violence was averted. Senator Powell favored Kentucky's neutrality policy during the Civil War, but nationally, the conflict put him in a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act. In 1861, Senator Powell vigorously condemned President Lincoln's decision to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. In 1862, he denounced the arrest of some citizens of Delaware—officially, the arrests were called \\"resolutions of inquiry\\"—as a violation of constitutional rights. These stances led to calls for his resignation by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1861, and some of his colleagues, led by Kentucky's other senator, Garrett Davis, unsuccessfully attempted to have him expelled from the Senate. Before the end of the war, both the General Assembly and Davis admitted being wrong in their attempts to remove him. Following his successful defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking against what he saw as violations of constitutional rights. In January 1863, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict by Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves. Later life and legacy Following his term in the Senate, he returned to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him.Biographical Sketch, p. 89 Powell believed that many of the legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally.Biographical Sketch, pp. 89–90 In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers.Biographical Sketch, p. 90 This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected. Powell died in his home on July 3, 1867. The cause of death was apoplexy, apparently the result of the toll years of rheumatism had exacted on his nervous system.Biographical Sketch, pp. 28–29 He is buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in Henderson, Kentucky. The state erected a high marble monument over his grave in 1870. Powell County, Kentucky, is named in honor of Governor Powell.

Because of term limits imposed by the state constitution adopted in 1799, he was the last Kentucky governor elected to two consecutive terms until the restriction was eased by a 1992 amendment, allowing Paul E. Patton's re-election in 1999. After serving in the Revolutionary War, Garrard moved west to the part of Virginia that is now Bourbon County, Kentucky. He held several local political offices and represented the area in the Virginia House of Delegates. He was chosen as a delegate to five of the ten statehood conventions that secured Kentucky's separation from Virginia and helped write the state's first constitution. Garrard was among the delegates who unsuccessfully tried to exclude guarantees of the continuance of slavery from the document. In 1795, he sought to succeed Isaac Shelby as governor. In a three-way race, Benjamin Logan received a plurality, but not a majority, of the electoral votes cast. Although the state constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority was required, the electors held another vote between the top two candidates - Logan and Garrard - and on this vote, Garrard received a majority. Logan protested Garrard's election to state attorney general John Breckinridge and the state senate, but both claimed they had no constitutional power to intervene. A Democratic-Republican, Garrard opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts and favored passage of the Kentucky Resolutions. He lobbied for public education, militia and prison reforms, business subsidies, and legislation favorable to the state's large debtor class. In 1798, the state's first governor's mansion was constructed, and Garrard became its first resident. Due in part to the confusion resulting from the 1795 election, he favored calling a constitutional convention in 1799. Because of his anti-slavery views, he was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. Under the resulting constitution, the governor was popularly elected and was forbidden from succeeding himself in office, although Garrard was personally exempted from this provision and was re-elected in 1799. During his second term, he applauded Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana from France as a means of dealing with the closure of the port at New Orleans to U.S. goods. Late in his term, his Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, persuaded him to adopt some doctrines of Unitarianism, and he was expelled from the Baptist church, ending his ministry. He also clashed with the legislature over the appointment of a registrar for the state land office, leaving him embittered and unwilling to continue in politics after the conclusion of his term. He retired to his estate, Mount Lebanon, and engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits until his death on January 19, 1822. Garrard County, Kentucky, created during his first term, was named in his honor. Early life and family James Garrard was born in Stafford County, Virginia, on January 14, 1749.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 363 He was second of three children born to Colonel William and Mary (Naughty) Garrard.Des Cognets, p. 6 Garrard's mother died sometime between 1755 and 1760; afterward, his father married Elizabeth Moss, and the couple had four more children. William Garrard was the county lieutenant of Stafford County, by virtue of which he held the rank of colonel and was in command of the county militia. The Garrard family was moderately wealthy, and the Stafford County courthouse was built on their land.Billings and Blee, p. 58 During his childhood, James worked on his father's farm.Everman in Kentucky's Governors, p. 7 He was educated in the common schools of Stafford County and studied at home, acquiring a fondness for books. Early in life, he associated himself with the Hartwood Baptist Church near Fredericksburg, Virginia.Des Cognets, p. 9 On December 20, 1769, Garrard married his childhood sweetheart, Elizabeth Mountjoy.Johnson, p. 721 Shortly thereafter, his sister Mary Anne married Mountjoy's brother, Colonel John Mountjoy.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 1 Garrard and his wife had five sons and seven daughters.Des Cognets, p. 15 One son and two daughters died before reaching age two. Of the surviving four sons, all participated in the War of 1812 and all served in the Kentucky General Assembly.Des Cognets, p. 14 A number of his grandsons served in the Civil War, including Union Generals Kenner Garrard and Theophilus T. Garrard.Des Cognets, pp. 31, 62 Another grandson, James H. Garrard, was elected to five consecutive terms as state treasurer, serving from 1857 until his death in 1865.Des Cognets, pp. 61-62 Garrard served in the Revolutionary War as a member of his father's Stafford County militia, although it is not known how much combat he participated in.\\"James Garrard\\". Dictionary of American Biography While on board a schooner on the Potomac River, he was captured by British forces. His captors offered to free him in exchange for military information, but he refused the offer and later escaped.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 2 While serving in the militia in 1779, Garrard was elected to represent Stafford County the Virginia House of Delegates, and he assumed his seat for the 1779 legislative session. His major contribution to the session was advocating for a bill that granted religious liberty to all residents of Virginia; passage of the bill ended persecution by citizens who associated with the Church of England upon followers of other faiths and countered an effort by some to establish the Church of England as Virginia's official church.Johnson, p. 720 After the session, he returned to his military duties. In 1781, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. Resettlement in Kentucky Mount Lebanon, Garrard's Bourbon County estate Following the revolution, Garrard faced the dual challenges of a growing family and depleted personal wealth. Acting on favorable reports from his former neighbor, John Edwards, Garrard and Samuel Grant headed west into the recently created Kentucky County. By virtue of his military service, Garrard was entitled to claim any vacant land he surveyed and recorded at the state land office.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 3 Beginning in early 1783, Garrard made claims for family and friends, as well as for himself. Later in 1783, he moved his family to the land he had surveyed in Fayette County, which had been created from Kentucky County since his last visit to the region. Three years later, he employed John Metcalfe, a noted stonemason and older half-brother of future Kentucky Governor Thomas Metcalfe, to build his estate, Mount Lebanon, on the Stoner Fork of the Licking River.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 5 There, he engaged in agriculture, opened a grist mill and a lumber mill, and distilled whiskey. In 1784, he enlisted in the Fayette County militia.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 15 In 1785, Garrard was elected to represent Fayette County in the Virginia legislature.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 4 He was placed on a legislative committee with Benjamin Logan and Christopher Greenup to draft recommendations regarding the further division of Kentucky County. The committee recommended the creation of three new counties, including Madison, Mercer, and Garrard's county of residence, Bourbon. On his return from the legislature, Garrard was chosen county surveyor and justice of the peace for the newly formed county. At various times, he also served as magistrate and colonel of the county militia. Although some historians have identified Garrard as a member of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.Everman in Governor James Garrard, pp. 19-20 Garrard's Mount Lebanon estate was designated as the temporary county seat of Bourbon County; the county court first convened there on May 15, 1786, and continued to meet there for many years. In 1789, the Virginia legislature established a permanent county seat named Hopewell, and Garrard was part of the committee chosen to survey the area for the city. He and John Edwards were among the new settlement's first trustees.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 18 Upon Garrard's recommendation, the city's name was changed to Paris in 1790. Soon after, he resigned as county surveyor to focus on more pressing needs of defense for the fledgling settlement. At his behest, the Bourbon County Court expanded its militia from one battalion to two at its meeting in August 1790.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 19 Religious leadership As early as June 25, 1785, Garrard and his friend Augustine Eastin attended meetings of the Elkhorn Baptist Association.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 9 In 1787, he helped organize the Cooper's Run Baptist Church near his estate. He was chosen as one of the church's elders and served the congregation there for ten years. Soon after its formation, the church joined the Elkhorn Baptist Association, and in 1789, it issued Garrard a license to preach.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 8 Although he owned as many as 23 slaves to work on his vast agricultural and industrial works, Garrard condemned slavery from the pulpit, calling it a \\"horrid evil\\".Everman in Governor James Garrard, pp. 6, 9 Whites and blacks participated equally in worship at Cooper's Run. Garrard and the other elders of the church started numerous congregations in the state, including one as far away as Mason County.Everman in Governor James Garrard, pp. 9-10 In 1789, Garrard and Eastin began working to reunite the more orthodox Regular Baptists in the area with the more liberal Separatist Baptists. Garrard's former church in Virginia had been a Regular Baptist congregation, and Garrard was considered a Regular Baptist despite his clear advocacy for religious toleration and his open expression of liberal views. Although he never succeeded in uniting the two factions, he was chosen moderator of the Elkhorn Baptist Association's annual meetings in 1790, 1791, and 1795 in recognition of his efforts.Everman in Governor James Garrard, pp. 10-11 From 1785 to 1799, Garrard served as a trustee of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University).Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 13 In 1794, the Baptist and more liberal trustees united against the orthodox Presbyterian members of the board to elect the seminary's first non-Presbyterian president. That president was Harry Toulmin, a Unitarian minister from England.Billings and Blee, p. 59 Toulmin's daughter Lucinda would later marry Garrard's son Daniel.Des Cognets, p. 60 As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the doctrines of Socinianism.Collins, p. 110 By 1802, Garrard and Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them. The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned these beliefs as heretical and encouraged Garrard and Eastin to abandon them. When that effort failed, the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men. This event ended Garrard's ministry and his association with the Baptist church. Political career Residents of what is now Kentucky called a series of ten conventions in Danville to arrange their separation from Virginia. Garrard was a delegate to five of these conventions, held in May and August 1785 and in 1787, 1788, and 1792.Des Cognets, p. 8 At the August 1785 convention, the delegates unanimously approved a formal request for constitutional separation.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 22 As a member of the Virginia legislature, Garrard then traveled to Richmond for the legislative session and voted in favor of the act specifying the conditions under which Virginia would accept Kentucky's separation. Before the final convention in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin reported to the Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was a major issue in the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate David Rice, a Presbyterian minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while George Nicholas argued most strenuously in favor of them.Harrison and Klotter, p. 63 Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists to vote against its inclusion.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 10 The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of slave owners, failed by a vote of 16-26. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 11 Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of a provision that forbade ministers from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against this provision.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 12 Aside from his opposition to slavery, Garrard did not take a particularly active role in the convention's proceedings. His most notable action not related to slavery occurred on April 13, 1792, when he reported twenty-two resolutions from the committee of the whole that provided the framework for the new constitution. =Gubernatorial election of 1795= Following the constitutional convention, it appeared that Garrard's political career was drawing to a close.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 31 He resigned all of his county offices to focus on his work in the Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 30 He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate. Thomas Todd, one of the candidates in the 1795 gubernatorial election When Governor Isaac Shelby announced he would not seek reelection, Garrard's friends encouraged him to become a candidate. The other announced candidates were Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 33 Logan was considered the favorite in the race due to his military heroism while helping settle the Kentucky frontier. However, his oratory was unpolished, and his parliamentary skills were weak, despite his considerable political experience. Todd, who had served as secretary of all ten Kentucky statehood conventions, had the most political experience, but his youth was considered a disadvantage by some. Garrard benefited from his political connections in Bourbon County, and many held him in high regard due to his work in the Baptist church. Under the new constitution, each of Kentucky's legislative districts chose an elector, and these electors voted to choose the governor.Everman in Kentucky's Governors, p. 8 Both Logan and Garrard were chosen as electors from their respective counties.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 34 On the first ballot, Logan received the votes of 21 electors, Garrard received 17, and Todd received 14.Harrison and Klotter, p. 75 A lone elector cast his vote for John Brown, a Frankfort attorney who would soon be elected to the U.S. Senate. Some speculated that Garrard's moral character prevented him from voting for himself, but his political acumen prevented him from voting for a rival, so he voted for Brown, who had not declared his candidacy. No proof exists that this was the case, however. The constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority vote was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard in order to achieve a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of State James Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 35 Although he did not believe Garrard had personally done anything wrong, Logan formally protested the outcome of the election to Kentucky Attorney General John Breckinridge. Breckinridge refused to render an official decision on the matter, claiming that neither the constitution nor the laws of the state empowered him to do so. Privately, however, he expressed his opinion that Logan had been legally elected. Logan then appealed to the state senate, which was given the authority to intervene in disputed elections. In November 1796, the Senate opined that the law giving them that authority was unconstitutional because it did not promote the \\"peace and welfare\\" of the state. State senator Green Clay was the primary proponent of this line of reasoning.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 36 By this time, Garrard had been serving as governor for five months, and Logan abandoned the quest to unseat him. =First term as governor= Garrard was regarded as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 39 He showed that he was willing to continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re- appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions. Kentucky's first governor's mansion was constructed during Garrard's first term. During Governor Shelby's term, the General Assembly had passed laws requiring that the governor, auditor, treasurer, and secretary of state live in Frankfort and allocating a sum of 100 pounds to rent living quarters for the governor.Clark and Lane, p. 5 Shortly after Garrard took office, the state commissioners of public buildings reported to the legislature that it would be more financially sensible to construct a house for the governor and his large family than to rent living quarters for them for the duration of his term.Clark and Lane, p. 6 On December 4, 1796, the General Assembly passed legislation appropriating 1,200 pounds for the construction of such a house. The state's first governor's mansion was completed in 1798. Garrard incited considerable public interest when, in 1799, he commissioned a local craftsman to build a piano for one of his daughters; most Kentuckians had never seen such a grand instrument, and a considerable number of them flocked to the governor's mansion to see it when it was finished.Clark and Lane, p. 10 Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark also relates that Garrard's addition of carpeting to the mansion - a rare amenity at the time - drew many visitors and was described by one as \\"the envy and pride of the community\\".Clark and Lane, p. 11 Among the other acts passed during the first year of Garrard's term were laws establishing the Kentucky Court of Appeals and a system of lower district courts.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 44 For the first time, lawyers in the state were required to be licensed. Six new counties - including one named in Garrard's honor - were created, along with several new settlements. Garrard approved enabling acts creating twenty-six counties; no other Kentucky governor oversaw the creation of as many. Left undone, however, was extending the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar of the state land office.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 48 Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on his experience as a surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 50 Garrard was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party and agreed with party founder Thomas Jefferson's condemnation of the Alien and Sedition Acts. In an address to the General Assembly on November 7, 1798, he denounced the Alien Act on the grounds that it deterred desirable immigration; the Sedition Act, he claimed, denied those accused under its provisions freedom of speech and trial by jury, rights - he pointed out - that he and the other soldiers of the Revolutionary War had fought to secure.Harrison and Klotter, p. 82Everman in Kentucky's Governors, p. 10 He advocated the nullification of both laws, but also encouraged the legislature to reaffirm its loyalty to the federal government and the U.S. Constitution. He was supportive of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799. Among the other issues addressed in the 1798 General Assembly was the adoption of penal reforms. Garrard was supportive of the reforms - which included the abolition of the death penalty for all crimes except murder - and lobbied for the education of incarcerated individuals.Everman in Kentucky's Governors, p. 9Harrison and Klotter, p. 83 He also secured the passage of laws reforming and expanding the militia. Among the reforms were the imposition of penalties upon \\"distractors\\" in the militia, provisions for citizens' hiring of substitutes to serve in the militia on their behalf, and the exemption of jailers, tutors, printers, judges, ministers, and legislative leaders from service. Garrard opposed lowering taxes, instead advocating increased spending on education and business subsidies. To that end, he signed legislation combining Transylvania Seminary and Kentucky Academy into a single institution.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 57 =A new constitution= Garrard's son William introduced legislation to call a constitutional convention. The difficulties with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 added to a litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some believed that it was undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention. Calling a constitutional convention required the approval of a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly.Harrison and Klotter, p. 76 In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt in the minds of many legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 47 When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority. On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still serving in the state senate, introduced a bill to hold another vote on calling a constitutional convention.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 51 In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes were in favor of calling a convention. Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 36-15 in favor of a convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 58 The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote. Delegates to the July 22, 1799, convention were elected in May 1799. Neither Garrard nor his son William were chosen as delegates, mostly due to their anti-slavery views. Garrard had been a more active governor than his predecessor, frequently employing his veto and clashing with the county courts. As a result, the delegates moved to reign in some of the power given to the state's chief executive. Under the 1799 constitution, the governor was popularly elected, and the threshold for overriding a gubernatorial veto was lowered from a two-thirds majority of each house of the legislature to an absolute majority.Harrison and Klotter, p. 78 Although the governor retained broad appointment powers, the state senate was given the power to approve or reject all gubernatorial nominees.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 59 New term limits were imposed on the governor, making him ineligible for reelection for seven years following the expiration of his term. The restriction on ministers serving in the legislature was retained and extended to the governor's office. Historian Lowell Harrison held that this restriction was \\"a clear snub to Garrard\\", but Garrard biographer H. E. Everman maintained that it was \\"definitely not a blow aimed at Garrard\\". Garrard was personally exempted from both the succession and ministerial restrictions, clearing the way for him to seek a second term. =1799 gubernatorial election= Confident that the results of the 1795 election would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 63 Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 64 With the advantages of incumbency and a generally popular record, Garrard garnered large majorities in the state's western counties, Jefferson County, and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky. Surprisingly, he even found support among some voters who had favored Logan four years earlier. The final voting showed Garrard the winner with 8,390 votes, followed by Greenup with 6,746, Logan with 3,996, and Todd with 2,166. Due to the term limits imposed by the new constitution, Garrard was the last Kentucky governor elected to succeed himself until a 1992 amendment to the state constitution loosened the prohibition on gubernatorial succession, and Paul E. Patton was reelected in 1999.Blanchard, p. 251 In 1801, Garrard nominated Todd to fill the next vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after the election.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 65 Similarly, he appointed Greenup to a position on the Frankfort Circuit Court in 1802. =Second term as governor= The first two years of Garrard's second term were relatively uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to the circuit court system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens could sit as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's circumvention of the governor's authority to appoint judges. The second bill allowed attorneys and judges in the circuit court system to reside outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure. Thomas Jefferson's acquisition of Louisiana was hailed by Garrard as a \\"noble achievement\\". On October 16, 1802, Spanish intendent Don Juan Ventura Morales announced the revocation of the U.S. right of deposit at New Orleans, a right that had been guaranteed under Pinckney's Treaty.Harrison and Klotter, p. 84 The closure of the port to U.S. goods represented a major impediment to Garrard's hopes of establishing a vibrant trade between Kentucky and the other states and territories along the Mississippi River. He urged President Thomas Jefferson to act and publicly declared that Kentucky had 26,000 militiamen ready to take New Orleans by force if necessary.Everman in Kentucky's Governors, p. 11 Jefferson was unaware, however, that the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso had ceded control of Louisiana to the French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800, although a formal transfer had not yet been made. As Jefferson deliberated, Napoleon unexpectedly offered to sell Louisiana to the United States for approximately $15 million. Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe, Jefferson's envoys in France, accepted the offer. The purchase delighted most Kentuckians, and Garrard hailed it as a \\"noble achievement\\". Soon after the agreement, the Spanish government claimed that the French had not performed their part of the Treaty of Ildefonso and, as a result, the treaty was nullified and Louisiana still belonged to Spain. Jefferson ignored the Spanish protest and prepared to take Louisiana by force. He instructed Garrard to have 4,000 militiamen ready to march to New Orleans by December 20, 1803. The Kentucky General Assembly quickly passed a measure guaranteeing 150 acres of land to anyone who volunteered for military service, and Garrard was soon able to inform Jefferson that his quota was met. Spain then reversed course, relinquishing its claims to Louisiana, and the territory passed into U.S. control two months later. The last months of Garrard's second term were marred by a dispute with the General Assembly over naming a new registrar of the state's land office.Everman in Kentucky's Governors, p. 12 Garrard first named Secretary of State Harry Toulmin, but the Senate rejected that nomination on December 7, 1803.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 77 Next, Garrard nominated former rival Christopher Greenup, but Greenup had designs on succeeding Garrard and asked Garrard to withdraw the nomination, which he did.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 76 The Senate then rejected Garrard's next nominee, John Coburn, and accused the next, Thomas Jones, of \\"high criminal offense\\" and barred him from any further appointive office. Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a bill that would have allowed the legislature to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 78 When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice. Later life and death His dispute with the General Assembly over the naming of a land registrar left Garrard embittered, and he retired from politics at the expiration of his second term. He privately backed Christopher Greenup's bid to succeed him in 1804, and Bourbon County's vote broke heavily for Greenup in the election.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 79 Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 81 Garrard returned to Mount Lebanon, where he developed a reputation as a notable agriculturist. His son James oversaw the day-to-day operation of the farm and frequently won prizes for his innovations at local agricultural fairs.Everman in Governor James Garrard, p. 80 The Mount Lebanon estate was badly damaged by one of the New Madrid earthquakes in 1811, but Garrard insisted on repairing the damage as thoroughly as possible in order to reside there for the rest of his life. He imported fine livestock - including thoroughbred horses and cattle - to his farm and invested in several commercial enterprises, including several saltworks, which passed to his sons upon his death. He died on January 19, 1822, following several years of feeble health.Des Cognets, p. 13 He was buried on the grounds of his Mount Lebanon estate, and the state of Kentucky erected a monument over his grave site. Notes *In her research of the Garrard family, Anna Russell Des Cognets notes that thirteen years elapsed between the birth of Garrard's older brother Daniel and James Garrard. She speculates that other children, who died in infancy, may have been born to Garrard's parents during this period, but notes that she is unable to locate any records confirming this.

The movement began in 1910 with de Chirico, whose dreamlike works with sharp contrasts of light and shadow often had a vaguely threatening, mysterious quality, \\"painting that which cannot be seen\\". De Chirico, his younger brother Alberto Savinio, and Carrà formally established the school and its principles in 1917. Development The Song of Love by Giorgio De Chirico, 1914 Giorgio de Chirico, unlike many artists of his generation, found little to admire in the works of Cézanne and other French modernists, but was inspired by the paintings of the Swiss Symbolist Arnold Böcklin and the work of German artists such as Max Klinger.Cowling, Elizabeth; Mundy, Jennifer (1990). On Classic Ground: Picasso, Léger, de Chirico and the New Classicism 1910–1930. London: Tate Gallery. p. 71. His painting The Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon (c. 1910) is considered his first Metaphysical work; it was inspired by what de Chirico called a \\"revelation\\" that he experienced in Piazza Santa Croce in Florence.Holzhey, Magdalena. Giorgio de Chirico. Cologne: Taschen, 2005, p. 16. In subsequent works he developed a disquieting imagery of deserted squares, often bordered by steeply receding arcades shown in a raking light. Tiny figures in the distance cast long shadows, or in place of figures there are featureless dressmakers' mannequins. The effect was to produce a sense of dislocation in time and space.Onians, John. Atlas of world art. Laurence King Publishing, 2004. p. 288\\\\. Web. 07 Oct. 2011. In 1913, Guillaume Apollinaire made the first use of the term \\"metaphysical\\" to describe de Chirico's paintings.Gale, Matthew. \\"Pittura Metafisica\\". Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. Carlo Carrà, 1918, L'Ovale delle Apparizioni (The Oval of Apparition), oil on canvas, 92 x 60 cm, Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna, Rome In February 1917, the Futurist painter Carlo Carrà met de Chirico in Ferrara, where they were both stationed during World War I. Carrà developed a variant of the Metaphysical style in which the dynamism of his earlier work was replaced by immobility, and the two artists worked together for several months in 1917 at a military hospital in Ferrara.Cowling, Elizabeth; Mundy, Jennifer (1990). On Classic Ground: Picasso, Léger, de Chirico and the New Classicism 1910–1930. London: Tate Gallery. p. 52. According to art historian Jennifer Mundy, \\"Carrà adopted de Chirico's imagery of mannequins set in claustrophobic spaces, but his works lacked de Chirico's sense of irony and enigma, and he always retained a correct perspective\\". After an exhibition of Carrà's work in Milan in December 1917, critics began to write of Carrà as the inventor of Metaphysical painting, to de Chirico's chagrin. Carrà did little to dispel this idea in Pittura Metafisica, a book he published in 1919, and the relationship between the two artists ended. By 1919, both artists had largely abandoned the style in favor of Neoclassicism. Arnaldo dell'Ira, Piazza d'Italia, 1934 Other painters who adopted the style included Giorgio Morandi around 1917–1920,Morandi, Giorgio (1988). Morandi. New York: Rizzoli. p. 141. Filippo de Pisis, and Mario Sironi. In the 1920s and later, the legacy of Metaphysical painting influenced the work of Felice Casorati, Max Ernst, and others. Exhibitions of Metaphysical art in Germany in 1921 and 1924 inspired the use of mannequin imagery in works by George Grosz and Oskar Schlemmer. Many paintings by René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, and other Surrealists make use of formal and thematic elements derived from Metaphysical painting. Between the two World Wars in Italy there were numerous architectural vulgarisations of the metaphysical poetics of the \\"Piazze d'Italia\\", whose timeless atmosphere seemed to be congenial to the propaganda needs of the time. Squares of metaphysical flavor were built in the historical centers, as in Brescia or Varese, or in newly founded cities, such as those of the Agro Pontino (Sabaudia, Aprilia), to culminate in the spectacular unfinished E42 in Rome.

Orphaned in his teens, Scott enlisted in the Virginia Regiment in October 1755 and served as a scout and escort during the French and Indian War. He quickly rose through the ranks to become a captain. After the war, he married and engaged in agricultural pursuits on land left to him by his father, but he returned to active military service in 1775 as the American Revolution began to grow in intensity. In August 1776, he was promoted to colonel and given command of the 5th Virginia Regiment. The 5th Virginia joined George Washington in New Jersey later that year, serving with him for the duration of the Philadelphia campaign. Scott commanded Washington's light infantry, and by late 1778 was also serving as his chief of intelligence. Furloughed at the end of the Philadelphia campaign, Scott returned to active service in March 1779 and was ordered to South Carolina to assist General Benjamin Lincoln in the southern theater. He arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, just as Henry Clinton had begun his siege of the city. Scott was taken as a prisoner of war when Charleston surrendered. Paroled in March 1781 and exchanged for Lord Rawdon in July 1782, Scott managed to complete a few recruiting assignments before the war ended. After the war, Scott visited the western frontier in 1785 and began to make preparations for a permanent relocation. He resettled near present-day Versailles, Kentucky, in 1787. Confronted by the dangers of Indian raids, Scott raised a company of volunteers in 1790 and joined Josiah Harmar for an expedition against the Indians. After Harmar's Defeat, President Washington ordered Arthur St. Clair to prepare for an invasion of Indian lands in the Northwest Territory. In the meantime, Scott, by now holding the rank of brigadier general in the Virginia militia, was ordered to conduct a series of preliminary raids. In July 1791, he led the most notable and successful of these raids against the village of Ouiatenon. St. Clair's main invasion, conducted later that year, was a failure. Shortly after the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792, the Kentucky General Assembly commissioned Scott as a major general and gave him command of the 2nd Division of the Kentucky militia. Scott's division cooperated with \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne's Legion of the United States for the rest of the Northwest Indian War, including their decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. Having previously served in the Virginia House of Delegates and as a presidential elector, the aging Scott now ran for governor. His 1808 campaign was skillfully managed by his step-son-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, and he won a convincing victory over John Allen and Green Clay. A fall on the icy steps of the governor's mansion early in his term confined Scott to crutches for the rest of his life, and left him heavily reliant on Bledsoe, whom he appointed Secretary of State. Although he frequently clashed with the state legislature over domestic matters, the primary concern of his administration was the increasing tension between the United States and Great Britain that eventually led to the War of 1812. Scott's decision to appoint William Henry Harrison as brevet major general in the Kentucky militia, although probably in violation of the state constitution as Harrison was not a resident of the state, was nonetheless praised by the state's citizens. After his term expired, Scott returned to his Canewood estate. His health declined rapidly, and he died on October 22, 1813. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia. Early life and family Charles Scott was born in 1739, probably in April, in the part of Goochland County, Virginia, that is now Powhatan County.Harrison, p. 803\\"Charles Scott\\". Dictionary of American Biography His father, Samuel Scott, was a farmer and member of the Virginia House of Burgesses.Ward (2004), p. 16 His mother, whose name is not known, died most likely around 1745.Ward (1988), p. 2 Scott had an older brother, John, and three younger siblings, Edward, Joseph, and Martha. He received only a basic education from his parents and in the rural Virginia schools near his home. Shortly after his father died in 1755, Scott was apprenticed to a carpenter.Ward (1988), p. 3 In late July 1755, a local court was preparing to place him with a guardian, but in October, before the court acted, Scott enlisted in the Virginia Regiment. He was assigned to David Bell's company. During the early part of the French and Indian War, he won praise from his superiors as a frontier scout and woodsman. Most of his fellow soldiers were undisciplined and poorly trained, allowing Scott to stand out and quickly rise to the rank of corporal.Ward (1988), p. 4 By June 1756, he had been promoted to sergeant. Scott served under George Washington in the Braddock Expedition, a failed attempt to capture Fort Duquesne from the French. For most of 1756 and the early part of 1757, he divided his time between Fort Cumberland and Fort Washington, conducting scouting and escort missions.Ward (1988), p. 5 In April 1757, David Bell was relieved of his command as part of a general downsizing of Washington's regiment, and Scott was assigned to Captain Robert McKenzie at Fort Pearsall. In August and September, Washington sent Scott and a small scouting party on two reconnaissance missions to Fort Duquesne in preparation for an assault on that fort, but the party learned little on either mission.Ward (1988), p. 6 In November, Scott was part of the Forbes Expedition that captured the fort. He spent the latter part of the year at Fort Loudoun, where Washington promoted him to ensign. Scott spent most of 1759 conducting escort missions and constructing roads and forts.Ward (1988), p. 7 During this time, Virginia's forces were taken from George Washington and put under the control of Colonel William Byrd. In July 1760, Scott was named the fifth captain of a group of Virginia troops that Byrd led on an expedition against the Cherokee in 1760. Scott's exact role in the campaign is not known. The expedition was a success, and Virginia Governor Francis Fauquier ordered the force disbanded in February 1762; Scott had left the army at some unknown date prior to that.Ward (1988), p. 8 Sometime prior to 1762, Scott's older brother, John, died, leaving Scott to inherit his father's land near the James River and Muddy Creek. Having left the army, he had settled on his inherited farm by late 1761. On February 25, 1762, he married Frances Sweeney from Cumberland County, Virginia. With the help of approximately 10 slaves, Scott engaged in growing tobacco and milling flour on his farm.Ward (1988), pp. 8–9 In July 1766, he was named one of two captains in the local militia.Ward (1988), p. 9 Over the next several years, Scott and his wife had four boys and four or five girls. Revolutionary War Lord Dunmore; Scott's men helped drive him from Virginia As the American Revolution intensified in 1775, Scott raised a company of volunteers in Cumberland County. It was the first company formed south of the James River to participate in the Revolution. The company stood ready to aid Patrick Henry in an anticipated clash with Lord Dunmore at Williamsburg, Virginia, in May 1775, but Dunmore abandoned the city in June, and they joined units from the surrounding counties in Williamsburg later that month.Ward (1988), p. 10 In July, the Virginia Convention created two regiments of Virginia troops, one under Patrick Henry and the other under William Woodford.Ward (1988), p. 12 As those leaders departed for Williamsburg, the Conventions acknowledged Scott as temporary commander-in- chief of the volunteers already assembled there. On August 17, 1775, he was elected lieutenant colonel of Woodford's regiment, the 2nd Virginia. His younger brother, Joseph, served as a lieutenant in the regiment. In December, Woodford dispatched Scott and 150 men to Great Bridge, Virginia, to defend a crossing point on the Elizabeth River.Ward (1988), p. 14 Days later, this force played a significant role in the December 9, 1775, Battle of Great Bridge by killing British Captain Charles Fordyce, thereby halting the British advance on the crossing.Ward (1988), p. 15 Following the battle, colonial forces were able to occupy the city of Norfolk, Virginia, and Lord Dunmore eventually departed from Virginia.Ward (1988), p. 17 On February 13, 1776, the 2nd Virginia became a part of the Continental Army; Scott retained his rank of lieutenant colonel during the transition.Ward (1988), p. 19 After spending the winter with part of the 2nd Virginia in Suffolk, Scott was chosen by the Second Continental Congress as colonel of the 5th Virginia Regiment on August 12, 1776; he replaced Colonel William Peachy, who had resigned.Ward (1988), p. 20 The 5th Virginia was stationed in the cities of Hampton and Portsmouth through the end of September. They were then ordered to join George Washington in New Jersey, eventually repairing to the city of Trenton in November. =Philadelphia campaign= Serving as part of Adam Stephen's brigade, Scott's 5th Virginia Regiment fought in the colonial victory at the December 26 Battle of Trenton.Ward (2004), p. 17 During the subsequent Battle of the Assunpink Creek on January 2, 1777, the 5th Virginia helped slow the advance of a combined force of British light infantry and Hessian mercenaries toward Trenton.Ward (1988), pp. 25–26 Major George Johnston, a member of the 5th Virginia, opined that Scott had \\"acquired immortal honor\\" from his performance at Assunpink Creek.Ward (1988), p. 26 Following these battles, Washington's main force prepared to spend the winter at Morristown, New Jersey, while Scott's regiment was based at nearby Chatham.Ward (1988), p. 28 From this base, he led light infantry raids against British foraging parties. In his most notable engagement – the February 1 Battle of Drake's Farm – he defeated a superior combination of British and Hessian soldiers.Fredriksen, p. 623 He led another notable raid against a large British force of about 2,000 at the February 8 Battle of Quibbletown. George Washington, commander of the colonial forces during the Philadelphia Campaign In March 1777, Scott returned to his Virginia farm, taking his first furlough in more than a year.Ward (1988), p. 31 In recognition of his service with Washington, Congress commissioned him a brigadier general on April 2, 1777.Trowbridge, \\"Kentucky's Military Governors\\" At Washington's request, he returned to Trenton on May 10, 1777. His 4th Virginia Brigade and another brigade under William Woodford constituted the Virginia division, commanded by Adam Stephen, who had been promoted to major general. With Stephen and Brigadier General William Maxwell ill, Scott assumed temporary command of the division between May 19 and 24.Ward (1988), p. 32 Washington spent much of mid-1777 trying to anticipate and counter the moves of British General William Howe, and the lull in the fighting allowed Scott time to file a protest with Congress regarding how his seniority and rank had been calculated.Ward (1988), pp. 33–34 After eight months of deliberation, Congress concurred with Scott's protest, placing him ahead of fellow brigadier general George Weedon in seniority.Ward (1988), p. 34 At the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly resisted the advance of General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown.Ward (1988), p. 37 Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack.Ward (1988), p. 39 On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown.Fredriksen, p. 624 Because of their circuitous route to the battle, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; they and the other colonial forces were lost in the smoke and retreated. After the defeat at Germantown, Washington's troops took a position in the hills surrounding Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, about from Philadelphia.Ward (1988), p. 40 Scott and four other generals initially favored an attack on Philadelphia in December, but after hearing Washington's assessment of the enemy's defenses there, they abandoned the idea.Ward (1988), pp. 41–42 After a series of skirmishes with Howe's men near Whitemarsh, Washington's army camped for the winter at Valley Forge. Scott was afforded the luxury of boarding at the farm of Samuel Jones, about three miles from the camp, but rode out to inspect his brigade daily.Ward (1988), pp. 42–43 Washington granted him a furlough in mid-March 1778, and he returned to Valley Forge on May 20, 1778.Ward (1988), p. 46 When Washington and his men abandoned Valley Forge in mid-June 1778, Scott was ordered to take 1,500 light infantrymen and harass the British forces as they marched across New Jersey.Ward (1988), p. 48 On June 26, the Marquis de Lafayette joined Scott with an additional 1,000 men, in anticipation of a major offensive the next day. General Charles Lee was chosen to command the operation, which was delayed by one day due to inadequate communications and delays in forwarding provisions.Ward (1988), pp. 48–49 Lee shared no battle plan with his generals, later claiming he had insufficient intelligence to form one.Ward (1988), p. 49 On the morning of June 28, Lee launched the attack, beginning the Battle of Monmouth. During the battle, Scott observed American artillerymen retreating. Not realizing that the men had only run out of ammunition, Scott believed the retreat was a sign of the collapse of the American offensive and ordered his men to retreat as well. Lacking a battle plan for guidance, William Maxwell and Anthony Wayne, whose units were fighting adjacent to Scott's men, also ordered a retreat. With such a great number of his men retreating, Lee fell back and eventually aborted the offensive. Although Washington's main force arrived and stopped the British advance, Scott's retreat was partially blamed for giving them control of the battle.Ward (1988), p. 51 Tradition holds that, in the aftermath of the battle, Scott witnessed Washington excoriating Lee in a profanity-laden tirade, but biographer Harry M. Ward considered it unlikely that Scott was present at the meeting.Ward (1988), pp. 50–51 Lee was later court-martialed for the retreat and suspended from command.Ward (1988), p. 52 Following the Battle of Monmouth, the British retreated to New York City. On August 14, Scott was given command of a new light infantry corps organized by Washington.Ward (1988), p. 53 He also served as Washington's chief of intelligence, conducting constant scouting missions from the Americans' new base at White Plains, New York. While Scott's men engaged in a few skirmishes with British scouting parties, neither Washington's army nor the British force at New York City conducted any major operations before Scott was furloughed in November 1778.Ward (1988), pp. 53–66 =Service in the southern theater and capture= A March 1779 letter from Washington to Scott, still on furlough in Virginia, ordered him to recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1.Ward (1988), p. 68 Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was in command of the militia forces there.Ward (1988), p. 69 Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south. Benjamin Lincoln, commander of the forces at Charleston, South Carolina Soon after Washington's orders were delivered, a British raiding party under George Collier and Edward Mathew arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy supplies that might otherwise be sent southward to aid the reinforcements going to South Carolina.Ward (1988), p. 70 Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When it became clear to both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott should continue to recruit men to reinforce the south.Ward (1988), p. 71 The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat. Scott's recruiting difficulties in Virginia continued, despite the implementation of a draft by the state legislature.Ward (1988), p. 72 Finally, in October 1779, he forwarded troops sent to him from Washington's Northern Army on to Lincoln in South Carolina, fulfilling his quota.Ward (1988), p. 73 He retained only Abraham Buford's regiment with him in Virginia. In February 1780, about 750 men sent by Washington under William Woodford arrived at Scott's camp in Petersburg, Virginia.Ward (1988), p. 74 Virginia authorities, fearing that the British force to the south under General Henry Clinton would turn north to Virginia, detained Scott and Woodford until it was clear that Clinton's object was Lincoln's position at Charleston, South Carolina. On March 30, 1780, Scott arrived in Charleston just as Clinton was laying siege to the city. He was captured when the city surrendered on May 12, 1780, and was held as a prisoner of war at Haddrell's Point near Charleston. Although he was a prisoner, he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed to correspond and trade with acquaintances in Virginia.Ward (1988), pp. 77–78 With the death of William Woodford on November 13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point.Ward (1988), p. 78 He requested his parole on account of ill health on January 30, 1781, and in late March, Charles Cornwallis granted the request.Ward (1988), p. 81 In July 1782, Scott was exchanged for Lord Rawdon, ending his parole. Washington informed him that he was back on active duty and ordered him to assist General Peter Muhlenberg's recruiting efforts in Virginia, then to report to General Nathanael Greene.Ward (1988), p. 83 Greene wrote that he did not have a command for Scott, and requested that he remain with Muhlenberg in Virginia. The few troops he was able to recruit were sent to a depot at Winchester, Virginia.Ward (1988), p. 86 When the preliminary articles of peace between the United States and Great Britain were signed in March 1783, recruiting stopped altogether. Scott was brevetted to major general on September 30, 1783, just prior to his discharge from the Continental Army. Following the war, he became one of the founding members of the Society of the Cincinnati. Settlement in Kentucky and early political career Peyton Short accompanied Scott to Kentucky in 1785. In October 1783, the Virginia Legislature authorized Scott to commission superintendents and surveyors to survey the lands given to soldiers for their service in the Revolutionary War. Enticed by glowing reports of Kentucky by his friend, James Wilkinson, he arranged for a cabin to be built for him near the Kentucky River, although the builder apparently laid only the cornerstone.Ward (1988), p. 90 Scott first visited Kentucky in mid-1785.Ward (1988), p. 91 Traveling with Peyton Short, one of Wilkinson's business partners, he came to Limestone (present-day Maysville, Kentucky) via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers. Scott and Short then traveled overland to the Kentucky River to examine the land they would later claim. Scott's stay in Kentucky was a short one; he had returned to his farm in Virginia by September 1785. On his return to Virginia, Scott employed Edward Carrington, former quartermaster general of the Southern Army, to set his financial affairs in order in preparation for a move to Kentucky. Carrington purchased Scott's Virginia farm in 1785, but allowed the family to live there until they moved to the frontier.Ward (1988), p. 92 In 1787, Scott settled near the city of Versailles, Kentucky. Between his military claims and those of his children, the Scott family was entitled to in Fayette and Bourbon counties.Clark and Lane, p. 13 Scott constructed a two-story log cabin, a stockade, and a tobacco inspection warehouse. In June 1787, Shawnee warriors killed and scalped his son, Samuel, while he was crossing the Ohio River in a canoe; the elder Scott watched helplessly from the riverbank.Ward (1988), p. 96 Although a small party of settlers pursued the Shawnees back across the river, they were not able to overtake them.Ward (1988), p. 97 In volume three of Theodore Roosevelt's The Winning of the West, he stated that Scott \\"delighted in war\\" against the Indians after the death of his son.Nelson, p. 220 Scott focused on the development of his homestead as a way to deal with the grief of losing his son. The settlement became known as Scott's Landing, and Scott briefly served as a tobacco inspector for the area. Determined to make Scott's Landing the centerpiece of a larger settlement called Petersburg, he began selling lots near the settlement in November 1788.Ward (1988), p. 98 Among those who purchased lots were James Wilkinson, Abraham Buford, Judge George Muter, and future Congressman and Kentucky Governor Christopher Greenup. Scott was one of 37 men who founded the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge in 1787.Ward (1988), p. 99 Although he did not participate in any of the ten statehood conventions that sought to separate Kentucky from Virginia, he supported the idea in principle.Ward (1988), p. 100 When Woodford County was formed from the part of Fayette County that included Scott's fledgling settlement, Scott declined appointment as the new county's lieutenant.Ward (1988), p. 101 He consented to be a candidate to represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his single term, he served on the committee on privileges and election and on several special committees, including one that recommended that President George Washington supply a military guard at Big Bone Lick to facilitate the establishment of a saltworks there. Northwest Indian War Josiah Harmar's failed campaign convinced Kentuckians that only local militia could effectively fight the Indians of the Northwest Territory. As tensions mounted between the Indians in the Northwest Territory and settlers on the Kentucky frontier, President Washington began sanctioning joint operations between federal army troops and local frontier militia against the Indians.Nelson, p. 223 In April 1790, Scott raised a contingent of volunteers from Bourbon and Fayette counties to join Josiah Harmar in a raid against the Western Confederacy along the Scioto River in what would become the U.S. state of Ohio.Nelson, p. 224 The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April 18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed south, toward the present-day city of Portsmouth, Ohio, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp.Ward (1988), p. 102 Fresh footprints, including those of a well- known Shawnee warrior – nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two club feet – led away from the camp site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot. Other than this, the expedition accomplished nothing, and it disbanded on August 27, 1790. In June 1790, Harmar and Arthur St. Clair were ordered to lead another expedition against the Indians.Ward (1988), p. 103 Harmar had hoped that Scott, Isaac Shelby, or Benjamin Logan would join the campaign and lead the Kentucky militia, but all three declined. Scott had been elected to represent Woodford County in the Virginia General Assembly, and his legislative duty prevented his service. He believed that the Kentucky militiamen would only serve under Colonel Robert Trotter, a veteran of Logan's earlier Indian fighting campaigns. Ultimately, command of the Kentucky militiamen was given to Major John Hardin, and many militiamen refused to join the campaign, just as Scott had predicted. During the expedition, Scott's son, Merritt, who was serving as a captain in the Woodford County militia, was killed and scalped. The entire expedition was a failure, and it solidified the Kentucky militiamen's strong distrust of Harmar; most vowed never to fight alongside him again. During Harmar's Campaign, Scott was serving in the state legislature in Richmond, Virginia.Ward (1988), p. 104 He was once again appointed to the committee on privileges and election. He also served on the committee on propositions and grievances and several special committees. On December 30, 1790, Virginia Governor Beverley Randolph, possibly acting on a recommendation from Washington, appointed Scott brigadier general in the Virginia militia and gave him command of the entire District of Kentucky.Nelson, p. 227 His primary responsibility was overseeing a line of 18 outposts along the Ohio River.Ward (1988), p. 108 In January 1791, President Washington accepted U.S. Senator John Brown's suggestion to appoint a Kentucky Board of War, composed of Brown, Scott, Isaac Shelby, Harry Innes, and Benjamin Logan.Harrison and Klotter, p. 70 The committee was empowered to call out local militia to act in conjunction with federal troops against the Indians.Ward (1988), p. 107 They recommended assembling an army of volunteers to locate and destroy Indian settlements north of the Ohio River. Later that month, Washington approved a plan to invade the Indians' homelands via a raid from Fort Washington (near present-day Cincinnati, Ohio).Nelson, p. 228 Most Kentuckians were displeased with Washington's choice of Arthur St. Clair, by then suffering from gout and unable to mount his own horse unassisted, as overall commander of the invasion. Scott was chosen to serve under St. Clair as commander of the 1,000 militiamen who took part in the invasion, about one- third of the total force. =The Blackberry Campaign= Washington ordered Scott to conduct a series of preliminary raids in mid-1791 that would keep the enemy occupied while St. Clair assembled the primary invasion force.Nelson, p. 229 Both Isaac Shelby and Benjamin Logan had hoped to lead the campaign, and neither would accept a lesser position.Ward (1988), p. 109 Shelby nevertheless supported the campaign, while Logan actively opposed it. Scott issued a call for volunteers to assemble at Frankfort, Kentucky, on May 15, 1791, to carry out these raids. Kentuckians responded favorably to the idea of an all-militia campaign, and 852 men volunteered for service, although Scott was only authorized to take 750; Senator John Brown was among the volunteers. After a brief delay to learn the fate of a failed diplomatic mission to the Miami tribes in the Northwest Territory, Scott's men departed from Fort Washington on May 24.Nelson, pp. 229–230 The militiamen crossed the Ohio toward a clutch of Miami, Kickapoo, Wea, and Potawatomi settlements near the location of present-day Lafayette, Indiana.Nelson, p. 230 For eight days, they crossed rugged terrain and were bedraggled by frequent rainstorms. The harsh conditions spoiled the militia's supplies, and they resorted to gathering the blackberries that were growing in the area; for this reason, the expedition earned the nickname the \\"Blackberry Campaign\\". As Scott's men reached an open prairie near the Wea settlement of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout and hurried to attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes.Nelson, p. 231 Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village on the other side of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.Ward (1988), p. 112 Low on supplies, Scott and his men ended their campaign.Nelson, p. 232 On the return trip, two men drowned in the White River; these were the only deaths among Scott's men.Ward (1988), p. 114 Five others were wounded but survived. In total, they had killed 38 Indians and taken 57 more prisoner. Scott sent 12 men ahead with the official report for Arthur St. Clair's review; the rest of the men arrived at Fort Steuben (present-day Clarksville, Indiana) on June 15. The next day, they recrossed the Ohio River and received their discharge papers at Louisville, Kentucky.Ward (1988), p. 115 =St. Clair expedition= Scott's Wabash Campaign was well-received both in Kentucky and by the Washington administration. On June 24, 1791, Arthur St. Clair encouraged the Board of War to organize a second expedition into the Wabash region and to remove their outposts along the Ohio River to free up manpower and finances as a prelude to his larger invasion.Nelson, p. 233 Scott questioned the wisdom of removing the outposts and convinced his fellow members of the Board of War to retain one at Big Bone Lick and one guarding an ironworks at the mouth of the Kentucky River. His instincts later proved to be right; a month later, Indian raiders tried to deny the frontier settlers access to salt by capturing Big Bone Lick, but they were repelled by the militia stationed at the outpost there. Scott also did not believe that 500 men, St. Clair's requested number for the second Wabash expedition, was sufficient for an effective operation. Arthur St. Clair led a failed expedition against the Northwest Indians in late 1791. In July, Scott gave permission to Bourbon County resident John Edwards to lead 300 men against a band of Indians suspected of stealing horses on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River. Although Edwards' expedition almost reached the Sandusky River, they found only deserted villages.Ward (1988), p. 116 Unknown to the volunteers, they narrowly missed being ambushed by the Indians in the area. Many of the men who accompanied Edwards accused him of cowardice. Due to illness, Scott was unable to lead the expedition St. Clair requested; instead, he chose his friend, James Wilkinson, to lead it. Wilkinson's men departed on August 1. During their expedition, they destroyed the evacuated village of Kikiah (also called Kenapocomoco), the rebuilt settlement of Ouiatenon, a small Kickapoo village, and several other small settlements in the area. Returning by the same route that Scott's previous expedition had, Wilkinson's men were back in Kentucky by August 21. Scott's and Wilkinson's campaigns took a heavy toll on the Northwest Indians. In particular, the and Kickapoos signed a peace treaty with the United States the following year, and the Kickapoos migrated farther into Illinois and Missouri. St. Clair continued his preparations for invading the northwest despite the fact that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health.Nelson, p. 234 Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition.Harrison and Klotter, p. 71 He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians. St. Clair's party left Fort Washington on October 1. On November 3, he ordered his men to make camp on a small tributary of the Wabash River, mistakenly believing they were camping on the St. Marys River. His intent was for the men to construct some protective works the next day, but before sunrise, a combined group of Miami and Canadians attacked the party, routing them and capturing part of their artillery and most of their supplies. Of St. Clair's force of 1,400 men, 600 were killed and 300 captured during the attack. The Kentucky militiamen scattered during the attack, and their leader, Colonel Oldham, was killed. Nevertheless, they and most citizens in Kentucky blamed St. Clair for the entire debacle. St. Clair retreated to Fort Washington, and on November 24, Scott joined him there with 200 mounted volunteers in case the Indians decided to pursue him and invade Kentucky.Nelson, p. 235 When it became apparent that no Indian invasion was imminent, Scott's men returned home.Ward (1988), p. 118 As a result of St. Clair's campaign, tribes that had previously been neutral in the conflict – including the Delawares and Wyandots – allied with the Miami and Shawnee against the frontiersmen. =Service with the Legion of the United States= After St. Clair's Defeat, President Washington asked Congress to authorize the formation of the Legion of the United States, a 5,000-man force to fight the Indians in the Northwest.Nelson, p. 236 Congress approved the proposal in March 1792, and Scott learned from a friend in Philadelphia that he was being considered as commander of the Legion. Ultimately Washington concluded that he was \\"of inadequate abilities\\"; his known vice of drinking too much alcohol also concerned Washington. Instead, Washington chose \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne to command the Legion. On June 4, 1792 – just days after Kentucky officially gained statehood – the Kentucky General Assembly commissioned Scott and Benjamin Logan as major generals in the state militia.Nelson, p. 237 On June 25, Scott was given command of the militia's 2nd Division, which was charged with operating north of the Kentucky River; Logan's 1st Division operated south of the river.Ward (1988), p. 120 The new state legislature had also appointed a five-man committee to select a city to be the new state capital.Ward (1988), p. 123 Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities – including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough – also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began.Ward (1988), p. 125 He was chosen as a presidential elector in 1793. \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne, commander of the Legion of the United States Wayne originally intended to use Kentucky militiamen in preemptive strikes against the Indians and to conduct the main invasion using only federal troops, but by the time he moved to Fort Washington in mid-1793, he had assembled fewer than 3,000 of the 5,000 troops he had anticipated.Nelson, p. 239 He now requested that Scott's and Logan's men join his main force.Nelson, p. 240 Logan flatly refused to cooperate with a federal officer, but Scott eventually agreed, and Wayne commissioned him an officer in the federal army on July 1, 1793. He and Governor Isaac Shelby instituted a draft to raise the 1,500 troops he was to command in Wayne's operation.Ward (1988), p. 130 When he joined Wayne at Fort Jefferson on October 21, 1793, he had only been able to raise 1,000 men.Nelson, p. 241Ward (1988), p. 131 On November 4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen to destroy a nearby Delaware village.Nelson, p. 242 Still resentful and distrustful of federal officers and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial.Ward (1988), p. 134 That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted in his report that he believed Scott and his officers had done all they could do to prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November 10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full quota of troops after the winter. Tensions cooled between Wayne and the Kentuckians over the winter of 1793–94.Nelson, p. 243 Wayne noticed that, despite their obstinance, the Kentucky volunteers appeared to be good soldiers. The militiamen, after observing Wayne, concluded that he – unlike Harmar and St. Clair – knew how to combat the Indians. Wayne augmented his popularity in Kentucky by building Fort Recovery over the winter on the site of St. Clair's defeat.Ward (1988), p. 136 The Indians' victory over St. Clair had become a part of their lore and inspired them to continue the fight against the western settlers; Wayne's construction of a fort on this site was a blow to the Indian psyche, and his re-burial of some 600 skulls that the Indians had dug up and scattered across the area was popular with Kentuckians, since many of their own were among the dead. While Scott came to respect Wayne personally, his friend, James Wilkinson, began an anonymous campaign to tarnish Wayne's image, coveting command of the Northwest expedition for himself.Nelson, p. 244 Scott, on leave in Philadelphia at the time, wrote to Secretary of War Henry Knox to defend Wayne's reputation, breaching his friendship with Wilkinson. Scott returned to Kentucky from Philadelphia in June 1794, mustered 1,500 militiamen, and joined Wayne at Fort Greeneville on July 27.Nelson, p. 245 He and Thomas Barbee led this force in support of Wayne's 1,000 regular troops. The combined force marched quickly and captured the recently evacuated Indian town of Grand Glaize on August 8.Nelson, p. 246 Here, Wayne ordered the construction of Fort Defiance, which took approximately a week. Scott was responsible for the naming of the fort; while observing its construction, he declared, \\"I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils in hell to take it.\\" Based upon intelligence provided by Scott's mounted volunteers, Wayne ordered his force to march toward Fort Miami on August 14, anticipating a battle with a combined British and Indian force of 2,400 there.Nelson, p. 247 About 8:45a.m. on August 20, Major William Price's brigade of volunteers engaged the Indian force near Fort Miami, beginning the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The well-positioned Indian force turned back Price's men, but Wayne ordered his regulars to conduct a vigorous bayonet charge, which routed the Indians.Nelson, p. 248 Major William Campbell, the British commander of Fort Miami, refused to open the fort to his Indian allies, and Wayne's force won a decisive victory. Following the battle, Wayne ordered Scott's volunteers to conduct numerous raids within a fifty-mile radius of their position.Nelson, p. 249 Due to a lack of pack horses in Wayne's force, the mounted volunteers were also employed transporting supplies between forts throughout September 1794.Ward (1988), p. 145 They eventually grew weary of garrison duty and complained that the use of their personal horses to transport goods had injured the animals. Many threatened to mutiny if not discharged. On October 13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home.Nelson, p. 251 In a commendation of Wayne issued on December 4, 1794, the U.S. House of Representatives specifically thanked Scott and his men for their service at the Battle of Fallen Timbers.Nelson, p. 250 The Treaty of Greenville formally ended the war in mid-1795. Later political career In 1795, Scott traveled to Philadelphia to help clarify service records that would determine the final pay of the men who served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky.Ward (1988), pp. 148, 151 He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799.Ward (1988), p. 152 Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn appointed Scott and Governor James Garrard to evaluate sites in Kentucky on which to construct a replacement for Fort Washington.Ward (1988), p. 153 Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort should not be in the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition. In 1797, Scott's son Daniel, who had settled in Virginia, died.Ward (1988), p. 151 In late 1799 or early 1800, his last son, Charles, Jr., also died. His daughter Martha married future U.S. Senator George M. Bibb in 1799 and moved to Daviess County.Ward (1988), p. 155 Daughter Mary had married and left the farm prior to Scott's return from military service, and youngest daughter Nancy left the farm near the turn of the 19th century, although she never married.Ward (1988), p. 156 After the death of his wife on October 6, 1804, he moved in with his daughter and son-in-law, John and Mary Postlethwait, in Lexington. He sold his farm in Woodford County in October 1805. As tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated in the wake of the June 22, 1807, Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, Scott applied to Governor Christopher Greenup to raise a mounted militia unit in anticipation of an outbreak of hostilities.Ward (1988), p. 159 Although Greenup granted the requested authorization, Scott remarried on July 25, 1807, and never assembled the militia unit. His second wife, Judith Cary (Bell) Gist, was the 57-year-old widow of Colonel Nathaniel Gist, who had been a prisoner of war with Scott during the Revolutionary War. After their marriage, they moved to Canewood, Gist's family's plantation in Bourbon and Clark counties. =Gubernatorial election of 1808= Green Clay, one of Scott's opponents in the 1808 gubernatorial election As the celebrations in honor of Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began to consider the possibility of running for governor in 1808.Ward (1988), p. 158 By mid-1806, state senator Thomas Posey and Lexington lawyer Thomas Todd had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant governor and presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued to act as lieutenant governor and preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified to act as lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to the hated Federalist Party, even though he self-identified as a Democratic- Republican. Although he was not successfully unseated as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Posey's diminished candidacy and Todd's exit from the race left only one major impediment to Scott's potential candidacy. A movement began in Kentucky to draft former Governor Isaac Shelby as a candidate for another term. Known as \\"Old King's Mountain\\" for his heroic role in the Revolutionary War Battle of King's Mountain, Shelby could match Scott's military appeal, and as a former delegate to Kentucky's statehood and constitutional conventions and a former governor, his political experience far exceeded Scott's. Ultimately Shelby declined to run, and Scott officially declared his candidacy on February 11, 1808.Ward (1988), p. 161 John Allen had by then declared his candidacy and Green Clay's announcement followed Scott's by about a month. Scott's campaign was managed by his stepson-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, a law professor at Transylvania University. Bledsoe was among the most able politicians in the state, though he preferred the role of \\"kingmaker\\" to that of candidate.Ward (1988), p. 162 Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, were hurt by a general distrust of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate.Ward (1988), p. 163 Further, Allen had served as general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers accused him of being privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state.Ward (1988), p. 164 To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line of campaigning was minimal.Ward (1988), p. 165 As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign.Ward (1988), p. 166 On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay. =Governorship= A fall on the icy steps of the governor's mansion crippled Scott for life. Among Scott's first acts as governor was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State.Ward (1988), p. 170 Bledsoe delivered Scott's first address to the legislature on December 13, 1808.Ward (1988), p. 171 Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches for the rest of his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions.Ward (2004), p. 18 His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term as governor.Ward (1988), p. 182 In domestic matters, Scott advocated increased salaries for public officials, economic development measures, and heavy punishments for persistent criminals. While he desired a tax code that would preclude the need for the state to borrow money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes as low as possible. He also urged them to convert the militia into a youth army. The General Assembly routinely ignored his calls for reform but did pass a measure he advocated that allowed debtors a one-year stay on collection of their debts if they provided both bond and security.Ward (2004), p. 19 Scott frequently clashed with the legislature, including once when the Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Dr. Walter Brashear as lieutenant colonel commandant of the state militia's second regiment.Ward (1988), p. 174 The governor refused to nominate anyone else for the position, saying that Brashear was the best person for it, and he assumed the senators would not want to be sent a worse nomination. He employed his gubernatorial veto three times over the course of his tenure, but all three were overridden by the legislature.Ward (1988), p. 175 Measures creating Harrison County and allowing squatters to purchase occupied land on more favorable terms were both vetoed because Scott felt that they had been passed too hastily to allow proper debate. Scott also vetoed the revocation of a pension granted to recently retired Kentucky Court of Appeals justice George Muter, because he felt it undermined citizens' confidence in the promises of their government. Throughout his term, Scott was dogged by rumors of heavy drinking and frequent use of profanity.Harrison, p. 804 On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel.Clark and Lane, p. 14 He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott was supposed to have replied, \\"Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so.\\" On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, \\"Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will.\\" When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, \\"Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?\\" After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.Ward (1988), p. 178 For most of Scott's tenure as governor, tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated.Ward (1988), p. 180 Sentiment in favor of a U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky.Ward (1988), p. 181 Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of the Embargo Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain.Ward (1988), p. 183 He reminded the General Assembly that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses. William Henry Harrison, supreme commander of the Army of the Northwest In September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then governor of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians for a new federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War William Eustis.Ward (1988), p. 184 Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians – from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe – perceived this as a slight to the governor.Ward (1988), p. 185 Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make an issue of the faux pas and instead became one of the staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career. In November 1811, a messenger brought news to Kentucky of former Kentucky Attorney General Joseph Hamilton Daveiss's death at the Battle of Tippecanoe, amplifying Kentuckians' outcry for war with the British and Indians.Clark and Lane, p. 15 In anticipation of a federal call for volunteers, Scott published messages in the state's newspapers in February and April 1812 whipping up support for the impending war effort.Ward (1988), p. 188 By the end of July, the state's quota of 5,500 volunteers had been met.Ward (1988), p. 189 On August 14, 1812, Scott greeted two regiments of soldiers at the governor's mansion just prior to their muster at Georgetown.Ward (1988), p. 190 He hobbled among the soldiers with his crutch, then turned and hammered it against the mansion's steps and was heard to mutter \\"If it hadn't been for you, I could have gone with the boys myself.\\"Ward (1988), p. 191 On August 25, 1812, Scott's last day in office, he appointed Harrison brevet major general over the Kentucky militia.Harrison and Klotter, p. 91 The appointment was made on advice from incoming Governor Isaac Shelby and Henry Clay. The brevet ensured that Harrison, and not James Winchester – who was unpopular in Kentucky and with his own troops – would lead the state's military forces in the war. Biographer Harry M. Ward noted that Harrison's commission was unconstitutional both because he was not a citizen of the state and because the state militia's allotment of major generals had already been filled. Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison concurred that the commission was \\"probably illegal\\", but further noted that it was \\"acclaimed across the state\\". The show of confidence from Scott and his aides influenced President James Madison to appoint Harrison as supreme commander of the Army of the Northwest.Ward (1988), p. 192 =Death and legacy= Following his term as governor, Scott retired to his Canewood estate with his wife and youngest step-daughter, Mary Cecil Gist.Ward (1988), p. 194 Two of his stepdaughters had married during his term as governor. In 1809, Anna Maria Gist married Captain Nathaniel G. S. Hart, who was killed in the River Raisin Massacre in January 1813.Ward (1988), pp. 193–194 Eliza Violet Gist married Francis Preston Blair on July 21, 1812, just prior to the expiration of Scott's term as governor. The governor opined that Blair, who was slightly built, stoop-shouldered, and suffering from tuberculosis, would leave Eliza a widow within six months. Blair survived the tuberculosis and went on to become a trusted advisor to President Andrew Jackson. He outlived Scott's prediction for him by more than sixty years. By mid-1813, Scott's health had begun to fail rapidly.Ward (1988), p. 195 He died on October 22, 1813, and was buried on the grounds of Canewood. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving generals of the Revolutionary War. His remains were re-interred at Frankfort Cemetery in 1854. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.Powell, p. 20 References =Bibliography=    * Further reading   External links  Category:1739 births Category:1813 deaths Category:American militia generals Category:American Revolutionary War prisoners of war held by Great Britain Category:British America army officers Category:Burials at Frankfort Cemetery Category:Continental Army generals Category:American people of the Northwest Indian War Category:Governors of Kentucky Category:Kentucky Democratic-Republicans Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates Category:People of Virginia in the American Revolution Category:People of Virginia in the French and Indian War Category:People from Powhatan County, Virginia Category:People from Kentucky in the War of 1812 Category:1792 United States presidential electors Category:1800 United States presidential electors Category:1804 United States presidential electors Category:People from Versailles, Kentucky Category:Virginia colonial people Category:Democratic-Republican Party state governors of the United States ","title":"Charles Scott (governor)"},{"id":"2168857","text":"Hank Hall is a fictional character in the DC Comics universe who first appeared in Showcase #75 as Hawk of Hawk and Dove. He later became the supervillain Monarch in the crossover event limited series Armageddon 2001. After that, he became known as Extant, and appeared in the Zero Hour limited series (as well as some related tie-ins). Hawk was restored, and in the final issue of Blackest Night, he was finally returned to life. Hawk has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films. He appears in his first live adaptation in the DC Universe and HBO Max series Titans, played by Alan Ritchson. Fictional character biography =Hawk and Dove= Hank Hall was originally the superhero Hawk of Hawk and Dove. Hawk represented \\"chaos\\", while Dove represented \\"order\\". His brother Don Hall died during Crisis on Infinite Earths and was replaced with Dawn Granger. =Armageddon 2001: Monarch= Monarch was an oppressive tyrant from a bleak, dystopian Earth fifty years in the future. The people were unhappy with his rule, particularly a scientist named Matthew Ryder, an expert on temporal studies, who was convinced he could use his technology to travel back in time and prevent the maniacal ruler from ever coming to power. He learned that forty years ago, one of Earth's strongest and most powerful heroes would eventually turn evil and become Monarch, and ten years from that event he would conquer the world. During a time travel experiment, Matthew was transformed into a being called \\"Waverider\\", and began searching the timestream for the hero who would become Monarch, not knowing that Monarch was following him. When Monarch came into battle with the heroes of the present day, he killed Dove, and her enraged partner killed him for it. Removing the villain's mask, Hank discovered that he was Monarch, and donned the armor. The reveal of Hank Hall as Monarch led to some controversy amongst the fan community; Monarch was originally intended to be revealed as Captain Atom, with clues in the story pointing towards this which had to be discarded when it was changed at the last minute. This change was due to the premature leaking of Monarch's identity. While Monarch was always supposed to be Captain Atom, this was supposed to be a secret. When Monarch's identity was prematurely leaked, DC decided to preserve the surprise of the story by switching Monarch's identity to that of Hank Hall. As many fans pointed out, Hawk and Dove Annual #2 had Hank Hall fighting Monarch face to face in 2001 with Hawk being the destroyer of Monarch.Hawk and Dove Annual #2 pp. 9-19 Dove allowed Waverider to see a multitude of futures and realize Hawk is Monarch. =Armageddon: The Alien Agenda= When hostile aliens encounter Monarch and Captain Atom in the past (sometime between 230 and 65 million years ago), they attempt to enlist both (with each figure having no knowledge of the other involved) to assist them in creating a wormhole. The wormhole's creation would destroy the universe in which the primitive Earth existed, but would allow the aliens to travel freely. =Zero Hour: Extant= Hank Hall as Extant during Zero Hour. Art by Eric Battle. Shortly after returning to the present, Monarch confronted Waverider and used his power to see the past and future to become aware of the power within him. It is explained at this point, that when Monarch killed Dove, her powers went directly into Hawk. Realising this, Monarch unleashes his hidden powers and becomes Extant. Extant then removes Waverider's timetravel device and joins forces with renegade Green Lantern Hal Jordan, now known as Parallax, in a plan to alter time as they saw fit. His first act was to alter the future so that he could have a metahuman army at his disposal, mostly consisting of members of the Teen Titans; his plan was to amass an army so powerful that no one could interfere with his efforts to control time itself. Several armies of heroes banded together to stop his plans before they began in the 30th century, and altered history so that his followers never came to exist in the future. Down, but not out, Extant began to strike back at the heroes at Ground Zero, the beginning of time. Parallax had warped several metahumans from various time periods together for the ultimate assault, and Extant hit the Atom with a chronal blast, de-aging him into a teenager. Sensing defeat was imminent, he escaped the fight, promising vengeance at a later date. Extant would first reappear in the 1999 one-shot \\"Impulse: Bart Saves the Universe\\".Impulse: Bart Saves the Universe. DC Comics (1999) In it, Extant picks a fight with the original Justice Society as a means of tricking the Linear Men into saving the life of an innocent bystander who was destined to die. The man they saved would now go on to develop a nuclear weapon that, when tested, would shift the Earth out of its proper orbit, causing massive changes in the timelines of some of Earth's greatest heroes. Among these changes, Hal Jordan never becomes Green Lantern, thus he never becomes Parallax, and never stops Extant from destroying all of time. Fortunately for the citizens of time, Impulse arrives and is barely able to defeat Extant and prevent the Linear Men from saving the doomed scientist. He would engage the Justice Society again on a later date as he sought to acquire the reality-warping power of the Worlogog, recently dismantled by Hourman because he feared its power. Although Extant succeeded in his goal with the aid of Metron's stolen Mobius Chair, Doctor Fate learned from the imprisoned Mordru that when Hourman had dismantled the Worlogog, he had retained a small fragment of it, thus creating infinitesimal flaw in the prime Worlogog that the JSA could exploit. After the resurrected Dove sacrificed herself to distract Extant, Hourman divided his Hour of Power amongst his teammates, thus granting them all immunity to Extant's reality warping powers for four minutes, each of them attacking him on a different temporal plane until they were able to separate him from the Worlogog. Following this setback, Extant again attempted to escape. Instead, Extant was teleported by Hourman and Metron, at Atom Smasher's behest, into the seat of an airplane whose crash Kobra had caused earlier (in his relative timestream). As a result of this, Atom Smasher's mother was saved (as she was on the plane when it crashed), but Atom Smasher replaced his mother with a weakened Extant, saving her life but murdering the super villain to stop his threat and ensure that the same number of people died on that plane who had died originally. =Hawk restored= In response to fan-criticism of Armageddon 2001, many of whose readers felt that the character of Hawk had been severely misused in the story's last-minute changes, DC Comics set about restoring the character as he had originally been intended; a hero. DC had already retconned Extant's portion of Hank Hall's timeline in issue 14 of JSA, dated September 2000, in which Metron announced his intention to erase the villain's \\"wretched timeline\\" with his Mobius Chair. This was the second issue of a 3-part story entitled The Hunt for Extant!, (the details of which are listed above). After this, DC also retconned Monarch's portion of Hall's timeline with the final issue of the 6-part miniseries The Battle for Blüdhaven, dated September 2006, which now depicted Captain Atom's transformation into Monarch, as had been DC's original intention back in 1991. Hawk was restored, but he would not be revived until the final issue of Blackest Night. =Blackest Night= White Lantern Hawk from Birds of Prey #4. Art by Ryan Sook. In the Blackest Night crossover, Hank Hall is reanimated as a member of the undead Black Lantern Corps. The black power rings also try to reanimate his brother Don, but are denied, stating \\"Don Hall of Earth at Peace\\".Blackest Night #2 (August 2009) Hank then tracks down and attacks Dawn and the new Hawk (Holly Granger). After a short battle, Hank rams his hand into Holly's chest, ripping her heart out, and using it to charge his ring.Blackest Night: Titans #1 (August 2009) Holly's body is then revived by a black ring, and the two attack Dawn together. Severely outmatched, Dawn retreats, with Hank and Holly giving chase.Blackest Night: Titans #2 (September 2009) Hank and Holly follow Dawn to Titans Tower, where more Black Lantern Titans are attacking the living heroes. The two eventually overwhelm Dawn, with Holly plunging her hand into Dawn's chest. Dawn suddenly radiates a white energy that completely destroys Holly's body and ring. The other Black Lanterns, seeing Dawn as their greatest threat, attack her. However, she turns the light on them, destroying all but Hank, Tempest and Terra who quickly retreat.Blackest Night: Titans #3 (October 2009) While battling the Black Lanterns at Coast City, Hank is later brought back to life by the power of the white light.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) Dawn has a vision of Don who tells Dawn that she can save Hank, and to not give up on him. =Brightest Day/Birds of Prey= At the beginning of the Brightest Day event, Hank and Dawn begin working together again as a crime-fighting duo. Dawn expresses worries over Hank's increasingly violent demeanor, but he simply brushes off her concerns.Brightest Day #0 While stopping an army of powerful teenaged super villains in Gotham City, Hank and Dawn are invited by Zinda Blake to join the Birds of Prey.Birds of Prey (vol. 2) #1 The two are immediately called by Oracle to help Black Canary and Huntress during their battle with a dangerous villainess known as the White Canary. Dove attempts to defeat her herself, but is surprised when White Canary is somehow able to dodge her attack and then draw blood from her.Birds of Prey (vol. 2) #2 Hank and Dawn later encounter Deadman who Hank asks to resurrect Don.Brightest Day #4 (June 2010) At a crater in Silver City, New Mexico, Deadman attempts to revive Don, only to be prevented from doing so by the Entity.Brightest Day #5-6 (July 2010) As a number of onlookers (including Jackson Hyde) watch the Entity speak to the heroes, it instructs Hank to catch the boomerang that Captain Boomerang will throw at Dove.Brightest Day #7 (August 2010) After being injured trying to kill himself because of depression, Hank Hall is sent to a hospital while his teammates plan their next move.Birds of Prey (vol. 2) #4 (August 2010) During his hospital stay, Hank has a vision of himself, clad in a White Lantern uniform and talking to Don. Just before the dream ends, Don assures his brother that he is at peace.Birds of Prey (vol. 2) #5 (September 2010) Later, Dawn is transported to the Star City forest by the Entity, Hawk unintentionally went with her, but when the \\"dark avatar\\" made his presence known, the Entity tells them that they must protect the forest and withstand the ultimate savior, which is Alec Holland.Brightest Day #23 (April 2011) It was revealed that Captain Boomerang's mission for throwing the boomerang was to free Hawk as an avatar of war from the Lords of Chaos because his act of saving Dove would have broken their hold on him to be his own self. However, he failed to catch the boomerang and instead it was caught by Boston Brand, who ended up dying in the process and used his final act to move his white power ring to Alec Holland and bring back the Swamp Thing in order to cleanse the Green of Nekron's influence.Brightest Day #24 Powers and abilities As Hawk he possessed a \\"danger sense transformation\\" which allowed him to change into a super-human with the powers of super strength, unlimited stamina, enhanced speed, increased agility, enhanced body density, extreme durability and healing factor. His partner Dove suppresses his violent nature, and without him or her Hank's rage becomes boundless. As Monarch he possessed the same powers that he had as Hawk, along with a suit of highly durable armor that was crafted using advanced technology. As Extant he had the powers of chronokinesis, energy projection, flight, and omniscience. After piecing together the Worlogog he became nigh-omnipotent. While he was a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Hank wielded a black power ring which allowed him to generate black energy constructs. He was also able to perceive emotional auras. However, whilst he was able to perceive Holly's aura as red for rage, he saw Dawn's as a pure white that his ring could not identify. While wearing the black power ring it lowers his original power by over 50%. Other versions *In the Elseworlds JLA: The Nail miniseries, and its sequel JLA: Another Nail, a version of Hank Hall exists, alongside the original Dove. *Justice League of America (vol. 2) #26 features an alternate reality created by the trickster god Anansi. In this reality, an armored version of Hawk is seen. In other media =Television= * Hawk (Hank Hall) is featured in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Fred Savage. This version is depicted with a strong relationship with his brother Dove (Don Hall). In their self-titled episode, their fighting styles were thoroughly contrasted; Hawk employs brute- force, aggressive tactics, at times resembling a football player while Dove uses a blend of techniques reminiscent of aikido or perhaps judo, using his attacker's movements to fling aside. After defeating some thugs in a bar, Hawk and Dove are enlisted by Wonder Woman to help stop Ares from causing war in Kaznia. They are successful due to Dove's peaceful resistance against the rage-powered Annihilator. This is another example of how close the two are as Hawk struggles against Wonder Woman in an attempt to protect Dove. Hawk screaming for Dove as he feared for his brother's life closely resembles when Dove was killed in Crisis on Infinite Earths. In the episode \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\", Hawk and Dove are among the heroes that fight the forces of Mordru. In \\"The Doomsday Sanction\\", Hawk and Dove assist in an evacuation of San Baquero before the island's volcano erupts. The brothers are last seen in the series finale \\"Destroyer\\" where they fight off Parademons alongside several other Justice League members. They later appear in the final scene running down the steps of the Metro Tower with the rest of the group. Fittingly enough, both in that fight scene and as they exit in the finale, they appear along with Steve Ditko's fellow creations: the Question, the Creeper and Captain Atom. * Hawk (Hank Hall) appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Greg Ellis. In the teaser for \\"When OMAC Attacks\\", he and Dove help Batman stop an intergalactic war between the Controllers and the Warlords of Okaara. While Hawk and Dove take out the ground forces, Dove claims that it is better to settle things diplomatically while Hawk says that they have to hurt them or they will never stop. Regardless, Batman gets the two sides' leaders to sign the peace treaty and end the war. Hawk and Dove do manage to embarrass themselves, their bickering causing them to fight in front of the leaders. Batman invites the leaders to have a drink in his ship to draw their attention from the bickering brothers. Hawk and Dove also briefly appear in the two-part episode \\"The Siege of Starro\\" Pt. 1 amongst the heroes who were taken over by Starro. After Starro's defeat, the brothers are back to normal. * Hawk (Hank Hall) appears in the series Titans, portrayed by Alan Ritchson with Tait Blum as a younger version of the character. Instead of being depicted as having superpowers, Hank's physical prowess is as a football player. In the series, Hank and his half-brother Don Hall are the original Hawk and Dove team that hunt down sexual predators, motivated by abuse that Hank's football coach inflicted on him as a child. After Don is killed in the same accident that kills Dawn Granger's mother, Hank has a romantic pairing with Dawn while subsequently being Hawk and Dove respectively. Ritchson also appears as Hank in the crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". =Web series= * Hawk (Hank Hall) appears in DC Super Hero Girls with Dove (Dawn Granger). They appear as background students of Super Hero High. =Film= * Hawk (Hank Hall) appears in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies as one of the many individuals after Batman and Superman.

He was the first governor of Kentucky to die in office, serving only a few weeks in 1816. Little is known of Madison's early life. He was a member of the influential Madison family of Virginia, and was a second cousin to President James Madison. He served with distinction in three wars – the Revolutionary War, Northwest Indian War, and War of 1812. He was twice wounded in the Northwest Indian War, and in the War of 1812 he was taken prisoner following the Battle of Frenchtown in Michigan. Madison's political experience before becoming governor consisted of a twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he run for governor in 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped out early due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, he became the first Kentucky governor to die in office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office. Early life George Madison was born in June 1763 in the portion of Augusta County, Virginia that eventually became Rockingham County. His parents were John and Agatha (Strother) Madison. His brother James became the Episcopal bishop of Virginia and the president of the College of William & Mary. Another brother was Captain Thomas Madison. They were second cousins to President James Madison.Harrison, p. 601 Madison was educated in the local schools and also received instruction at home.Encyclopedia of Kentucky, p. 73 Before he was legally old enough to enlist, he entered the Continental Army as a private during the Revolutionary War.Powell, p. 22NGA Bio It is not known when Madison moved to Kentucky, but land records in Lincoln County indicate he and his brother Gabriel were there by at least 1784.Hopkins, p. 20 He married Jane Smith and they had four children – Agatha, William, Myra, and George. Jane Smith-Madison died in 1811. Service in the Northwest Indian War Madison served with the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War. He was a subaltern in Arthur St. Clair's army in the American defeat at the Battle of the Wabash on November 4, 1791. During the retreat, a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting on a log. Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run, but Madison, who was already known to be of frail constitution, stood to reveal that he had been badly wounded and was bleeding profusely. Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen; he helped Madison astride the horse, and they both escaped.McClung, p. 274 Later in the war, Madison served under Major John Adair. On November 5, 1792, Adair's men were encamped near Fort St. Clair when they were ambushed by an Indian force under the command of Little Turtle. Adair ordered a retreat, then rallied his men and divided them into three groups. He ordered those under Madison to turn the enemy's flank, but they failed and Madison was wounded again in this battle. Following this, Adair withdrew to Fort St. Clair.Gaff, pp. 85–86 In Adair's report to Brigadier General James Wilkinson, he wrote: \\"Madison's bravery and conduct need no comment; they are well-known.\\"Collins, p. 310 Political career Governor Isaac Shelby appointed Madison as Auditor of Public Accounts on March 7, 1796. He served in this capacity in state government for twenty years. He never sought a higher office but 19th-century historian Lewis Collins said that \\"there was no office within the gift of the people which he could not have easily attained, without the slightest solicitation.\\" In 1800, Madison was appointed as a trustee of the Kentucky Seminary in Franklin County. On December 5, 1806, he served on a grand jury in the case of Aaron Burr's conduct; they did not find grounds for treason charges. Madison was appointed director of the Bank of Kentucky later that year. During the War of 1812, Governor Shelby called for volunteers to serve in the Army of the Northwest. Colonel John Allen raised a regiment, and Madison was commissioned as his second-in-command. The regiment, known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter, but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several charges by the British.Coles, p. 116 Madison's men believed they had won the victory when they observed a white flag in the midst of the British force, but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison's force to surrender. When Madison discovered that Winchester was waving the flag, he refused the order to surrender on grounds that, as a prisoner, Winchester had no authority to issue it.Young, p. 23 Proctor demanded Madison's unconditional surrender, but Madison insisted that the terms of surrender include Proctor's protection of the American prisoners from the Indian allies of the British. Proctor initially balked at anything but an unconditional surrender, but after Madison's promise that the Americans would \\"sell their lives as dearly as possible\\", Proctor acquiesced.Coles, p. 117 Proctor had taken as many prisoners as he had soldiers, and had little power to enforce the terms he had agreed to. The American non-commissioned officers were paroled to return home.Collins, p. 311 Madison and the other officers were taken to Fort Malden, then on to a prison in Quebec.Young, p. 26 The American wounded who could not march were left under the care of American physicians. Shortly after the battle, the Indians looted the American provisions, which included a large quantity of whiskey. Drunk and violent, they slaughtered many of the American wounded in what became known as the Massacre of the River Raisin. Madison was freed from prison a year after his capture, as part of a prisoner exchange. He returned to Kentucky following his release and was honored at a public dinner on September 6, 1814.Hopkins, p. 21 In 1816, he resigned as auditor of public accounts due to failing health. But, submitting to public demand, he became a candidate for governor later that year.Harrison, p. 602 James Johnson, the other candidate for office, withdrew from the race due to Madison's popularity, thus the latter was elected without opposition. Death and aftermath Madison traveled to Blue Lick Springs for his health soon after the election, but was too weak to return to Frankfort for the inauguration. A Bourbon County justice of the peace administered the oath of office on September 5, 1816 at the springs. Madison's only official act of office was the appointment of Colonel Charles S. Todd as secretary of state. He died on October 14, 1816, just weeks into his term, the first governor of the state to die in office. He is buried in Frankfort Cemetery. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, immediately challenged his ascendancy to the governorship. They claimed that a governor should not be allowed to serve without having been elected to that office by the people. A measure calling for a special gubernatorial election easily passed the state House of Representatives, but failed in the senate by a vote of 18–14. Slaughter was allowed to exercise the powers of the governor, but many government officials and citizens of the state refused to call him by that title, opting for \\"acting governor\\" or \\"lieutenant governor\\" instead.Powell, p. 24 See also * History of Kentucky * Thomas S. Hinde, close friend of the Madison family, and neighbor in Kentucky. Notes Powell, Encyclopedia of Kentucky, and NGA give Madison's birthplace as Augusta County. Harrison and Hopkins both give Rockingham County. Encyclopedia of Kentucky names these four children. Powell names only two: George and Myra. Hopkins references five children, but does not name them.

Typically, images are illustrated by wikiHow staff, usually under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike- Noncommercial license; however, registered users may upload and contribute images. The central hub for using contribution tools is the Community Dashboard, which displays several dynamic applets that link users to different editing tools, such as the Spell Checker, in which articles are proofread for spelling errors; the Categorizer, in which articles are assigned categories according to their topic; and the Cleanup Greenhouse, in which low-quality articles are copyedited and rewritten for style and format. = Quality review process = By default, newly created articles are de-indexed from search engines; the article text is hidden with a notice that the article is in \\"quality review\\". Logged in users can dismiss the warning in order to view the contents of the article. A system called New Article Boost allows certain users with the \\"New Article Booster\\" right to review these articles, and bring them up to standards if possible. Articles that meet these standards are \\"promoted\\", which removes the blurring effect as well as the notice, and makes the article publicly visible and searchable. If a New Article Booster finds a newly written high-quality article, they can mark it as a Rising Star. By default, RS-marked articles get promoted and placed on a main page for an unspecified period of time. Oppositely, articles below standards and that will take too much work to \\"get ready for readers\\" are \\"demoted\\", which removes them from the New Article Boost list and retains the blurring and notice, and moves the page to the \\"Articles in Quality Review\\" category. Deletion system Articles with content that goes against the site's deletion policy are also demoted (such as articles centered around joke, sexually explicit, or hate-based topics, as well as severely inaccurate or incomplete instructions). Titles that are identified as duplicates per wikiHow's Merge Policy are merged. Similar to Wikipedia's Articles for deletion discussions, wikiHow allows users to nominate an article that meets deletion criteria and have other users and admins discuss whether or not to delete. Additionally, like most wiki sites, wikiHow has a speedy deletion system for pages that are nonsensical, spam, inappropriate, etc. Registration and user rights Workshop on women on wikiHow at Wikimania 2012. Like many other wikis, registration is optional and privileges such as creating and editing articles are still available to those without an account. wikiHow complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and users are required to be at least 13 years old to register an account. COPPA is regularly enforced and site administrators are expected to block anyone confirmed to be underage, though editing privileges may be restored if the company receives a consent form signed by the user's parents or legal guardian. Underage users can still edit anonymously, but they are advised not to post their personal information. Over 1 million people have created accounts and over 15,000 people edit wikiHow in a month and make changes for the purpose of informing others. This community of volunteer contributors call themselves \\"wikiHowians\\". The most active, experienced, and trusted wikiHowians may gain additional editing privileges which help them administer and protect the website. New Article Boost rights are granted to users who have done at least 300 edits and pass a test (containing three different parts) demonstrating they understand wikiHow policies. People with these rights gain access to a special tool that allows them to edit recently written articles and ensure that their quality meets wikiHow's standards before the articles are publicly visible to all readers. The most experienced users with level-headedness and good judgment can be considered for adminship, which grants them additional powers to protect and improve wikiHow through various maintenance tools. = Community engagement = At least once a year, wikiHow organizes conferences where a small group of active community members are invited to gather offline for an extended weekend to get to know one another, in different cities each time. These conferences are known as \\"meetups\\". wikiHow's headquarters are located in a house in Palo Alto, California, dubbed the \\"wikiHaus\\".

When it was founded, it covered the traditional county of Yorkshire, England, but under the 1974 county boundary changes, some of the trust's boundaries were amended to reflect those changes. The Trust is part of the UK-wide partnership of 46 Wildlife Trusts. It was formed in 1946, as the Yorkshire Naturalists’ Trust, essentially to preserve its first nature reserve Askham Bog on the outskirts of York. It now manages more than ninety reserves across the county, including some of the best wildlife sites in the UK. These nature reserves cover the diversity of Yorkshire's landscape, from woodland to grassland, wetland and moorland, fen and bog, and river and coast. One of the flagship reserves is Potteric Carr, a mixed wetland habitat to the south of Doncaster. This trust offers a membership card that visitors can use to access the below mentioned reserves: Sites =North Yorkshire= =East Yorkshire= thumbNature Reserve at Kiplingcotes chalk pit east of Goodmanham, East Riding of Yorkshire.

Australian soldiers serving as part of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda estimated at least 4,000 people in the camp were killed by soldiers of the military wing of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, known as the Rwandan Patriotic Army. The Rwandan Government estimated the death toll to be 338.  History  Following the Rwandan genocide and the victory by the army of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), many ethnic Hutus, including an unknown number of those who had committed genocide, (Génocidaires) fled from the RPF controlled areas to zones controlled by the French as part of Opération Turquoise and into the neighbouring states of Burundi, Zaire, and Tanzania. When the French withdrew in August 1994, the administration of a number of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps was taken over by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) and a number of aid organizations. The new Rwandan government, dominated by the victorious Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), wished to identify those individuals and Interahamwe militia members in the camps who had committed genocide.Later Australian accounts confirm that former Interahamwe militia were armed and active within the camp. See Paul Jordan’s account for example In late 1994, the large camps in the former so-called Safe Humanitarian Zones housed about 350,000 people. The UN set up an Integrated Operations Centre (IOC) to handle the caseload and managed to repatriate about 80,000 IDPs between October 1994 and January 1995. However, this period fortuitously coincided with the period when the new RPF government had reduced the activities of its kill squads after their activities were documented in the officially-denied Gersony Report. In January 1995, after RPF fears of Western sanctions had abated and the sanctioned killings had resumed, the IDPs refused to return to their home villages, where they would be vulnerable to the kill squads. By the third week of February, the OIC had basically stopped working and the camps were filling back up with villagers fleeing the violence in the hills. The UN field workers were caught in a Catch-22. \\"The government's hostility to the camps was profound, visceral...A large proportion of those who had taken shelter within Zone Turquoise were seen by the government as perpetrators of the genocide\\", in the words of the former director of the United Nations Rwanda Emergency Office (UNREO), and the RPF was contemptuous of the inadequate programs proposed by the UN bureaucracy. In contrast, scholar Gerard Prunier asserts that \\"the camps sheltered thousands of women and children as well as men who might or might not have been genocidaires.\\" Meanwhile, UN headquarters in New York City insisted on proper procedures and close cooperation with the RPF government. The former UNREO director would later write, \\"The government was on board but never fully committed, allowing the humanitarian community to assume responsibility for an 'integrated' approach that in reality never existed.\\" The IOC situation reports reflected its conflicting responsibilities, blaming a \\"deliberate campaign of disinformation\\" for IDPs refusing to leave the camps, while nearly simultaneously reporting \\"people return to the camps, fearing for their personal safety. There have been reports that some people are fleeing the communes and entering the camps for the first time.\\"  Kibeho Camp  By early 1995, the Kibeho IDP camp was the largest in Rwanda, sprawling for 9 square kilometers and containing between 80,000 and 100,000 people. UNAMIR presence at the camp was maintained by a Zambian infantry company, with medical services provided by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The RPA maintained a tight cordon around the camp. Refugees wishing to leave the camp to return home had to pass through a checkpoint, where genocide survivors would point out individuals who had taken part in the 1994 killings. On 17 April 1995, the préfet of Butare announced that all camps in the prefecture would be closed immediately. The declared aim of this was to forcibly separate known Génocidaires from those who would be sent home via a staging camp in nearby Butare. Taken by surprise, UNAMIR hastily dispatched 32 Australian soldiers and medical officers to support its presence in Kibeho, on 18 April. Colonel P.G. Warfe of the Australian Army would later describe the events of that day: The Tutsi RPF minister of rehabilitation, Jacques Bihozagara, held a press conference in which he noted, \\"There are rumours that if the IDPs return home they will be killed... If that were the government's intention then it would have gone ahead and killed the people within the camps. After all, the camps are within Rwandan territory.\\" In contrast, the Hutu RPF minister of the interior, Seth Sendashonga, rushed to Kibeho the next day to stop the shooting and, upon his return to Kigali, held an emergency meeting of the UN and NGOs to arrange transport for the IDPs before the RPA lost all restraint. He further briefed Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President/Defense Minister Paul Kagame, who assured him that he would make sure things stayed under control. The next day soldiers opened fire again, killing twenty and killing sixty before surrounding the camp. Journalist and eyewitness Linda Polman, who was accompanying the approximately 80 Zambian soldiers from UNAMIR at Kibeho, described the situation that day: Several days of mounting tension between those in the camp and the RPF soldiers followed, with the RPF firing (at people and into the air) to control and move the refugees into an increasingly smaller area as processing of IDP continued. Reprinted from the Australian Army Journal. One of the Australian medics, Major Carol Vaughan-Evans recalled \\"I remember getting there four days preceding the massacre and we certainly weren't wanted. The Government forces [RPA] made that very, very clear... They insisted we only treat people who had decided to leave the camp... The government forces were extremely aggressive indicating that if we didn't empty the hospital they would...[by] killing people who remained\\" On the morning of 22 April the UNAMIR force discovered about 100 refugees had been wounded or killed in the night. About half of those injured had gunshot wounds, presumably from RPA soldiers, the remainder machete wounds, presumably from Génocidaires who were \\"trying to terrorise the refugees into remaining in the camp… so as to provide a human shield.\\"  Massacre of 22 April 1995  Not long after 10 am, in heavy rain, RPA forces began firing into the crowd in the hospital compound, causing a stampede of refugees against razor wire and barricades. RPA forces continued to fire at fleeing refugees for the next two hours. While initially firing into the massed crowd with rifles, the RPA later began using 60mm mortars. Corporal Paul Jordan wrote \\"we watched (and could do little more) as these people were hunted down and shot.\\" The RPA slowed for a while after lunch before resuming fire until about 6 pm. The MSF and Australian medical teams struggled to cope with the large numbers of wounded, many of whom were later evacuated to Kigali hospital. Despite this, the medical teams continued their work while the infantry sections brought in wounded to the clearing station and hospital, during breaks in the firing. During the morning the hospital was also moved, under fire, into the Zambian compound. Firing continued intermittently throughout the day. Jordan recalls seeing people being \\"killed all over the camp.\\" The RPA also directed automatic rounds, rocket propelled grenades and .50 calibre machine gun fire at another wave of IDP who tried to break out after 5.00 pm.  Casualties  The RPA began burying bodies during the night of 22–23 April. At daybreak of 23 April, Australian Medical Corps personnel began counting the dead. About 4200 were counted in the areas to which they had access, and they noted evidence that unseen bodies had already been removed Terry Pickard's account states the RPA forced Australians to stop counting bodies \\"when they realised what was going on\\". The Australians estimated that there were still 400-500 bodies uncounted, not including those removed. Scholar Gérard Prunier posits that \\"a not unreasonable estimate\\" would be over 5000 dead. There were also many wounded, but not as many as would be expected as in combat, as most of the dead were bayoneted or shot at close range, and thus died of their wounds. Minister Sendashonga had attempted to reach Kibeho on the morning of 23 April but was turned away by the army. President Bizimungu arrived that same afternoon and was told that there had been about three hundred casualties, which he accepted without comment. Bizimungu showed displeasure when a Zambian officer tried to present him with the figure compiled by the Australian unit. Both Rwandan government and UN officials minimized the numbers killed, giving public estimates of 330 and 2000 killed respectively. However, a series of photos taken by UN Provost Marshal Mark Cuthbert-Brown show some of the extent of the massacre on the morning of 23 April, as Zambian troops commenced moving bodies. Interior Minister Sendashonga asked for an international commission of inquiry but was rebuffed by Kagame. An Independent International Commission of Inquiry, consisting of members handpicked by the RPF, was formed and led by RPF member Christine Omutonyi. After meeting in Kigali between 3 and 8 May, without any field visits, the commission reached a conclusion backing the government account of events that criminal or genocidaire elements were in the camp and that the massacre had happened when \\"there had been firing from the IDPs and the RPA suffered casualties... The RPA responded by firing into the crowd,\\" and noted that they could not determine fatalities because of \\"logistics and time constraints\\". The government figure of 338 casualties has never been questioned by any official body. Those IDPs who were forced to leave the camps were subject to attacks by crowds seeking vengeance for family killed during the genocide, as well as dehydration and exhaustion. On April 24, the IOC announced that 145,228 IDPs had returned to Butare Prefecture from the camps, and two days later revised this figure down to 60,177. Prunier, attempting to make sense of these numbers, notes that if a low estimate of the pre-crisis Kibeho population (about 80,000) is taken as correct, this still means that at least 20,000 people \\"vanished.\\" From this, Prunier concludes that it is likely that 20,000 to 30,000 former residents of Kibeho died after the massacre as a result of being expelled from the comparative safety of the camps. Hundreds of patients were evacuated to, triaged and treated at the UN hospital in Kigali operated by the Australian Defence Force. All age groups and both genders were represented with Defence clinicians working round the clock with limited staff and consumable resources. All areas of the hospital were overloaded, including wards, ICU and the operating theatre.  Possible causes of the massacre  One Australian eyewitness notes that, \\"the events which occurred on that day are still not completely clear but one theory based on the reports of several eye witnesses and Intel reports is as follows\\": An account by Thomas Odom, the US Defence Attache in Kinshasa, described the cause in the same way: \\"Hard-liners (in the camp) drove other IDPs like cattle to try to break through RPA lines and the RPA commander lost control of the situation. His report adds; \\"the camp was heavily populated by people \\"involved in the 1994 genocide... and ... was an active insurgent base.\\" Odom uses the UN estimate of 2000 killed. Gérard Prunier, author of The Rwanda Crisis and Africa's World War, expresses skepticism of the claims that génocidaires were a significant factor in the massacre and characterizes the Kibeho as being a miniature version of the characteristics of the invasion of Zaire that would occur 18 months later: \\"nontreatment of the consequences of genocide, well-meaning but politically blind humanitarianism, RPF resolve to 'solve the problem' by force, stunned impotence of the international community in the face of violence, and, finally, a hypocritical denial that anything much had happened.\\"  Consequences of the massacre  The Kibeho Massacre, and its aftermath, began the final fracturing of the government of national unity that had been created in July 1994. Seth Sendashonga came to the conclusion that the Hutu were being collectively treated as murderers and being shot without trial. He proceeded to make himself a hindrance to the RPF, declaring that the many people arrested from Kibeho should not be held in crowded cells where they were suffocating to death and then canceling an attempt by Kigali mayor Rose Kabuye to distinguish current city residents from those residents returning from Zaire by color-coding their residency permits. After the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) leaked a memo to the press identifying Sendashunga as linked to \\"extremist forces\\", he disbanded the Local Defense Forces (LDF), groups set up to replace police but largely turned into thugs under the direction of RPF rural leaders. Prime Minister Twagiramungu called a special security meeting on 23 August that reached a climax after three days when Sendashonga, Minister of Finance Marc Rugenera and Vice Prime Minister Alexis Kanyarengwe (all Hutus who had been publicly identified by the DMI as being potential traitors) were joined by Tutsi minister of women's affairs Aloysia Inyumba in confronting Kagame, especially over his recent selection of 117 Tutsis out of the 145 newly appointed bourmestres. Kagame responded by leaving the room, thus ending the meeting. After two days, Prime Minister Twagiramungu announced his resignation but President Bizimungu, furious at the rebellion within the ranks of the government, got Parliament to fire Twagiramungu on August 28. The next day, Sendashonga, Minister of Transport and Communications Immaculée Kayumba, Minister of Justice Alphonse-Marie Nkubito and Minister of Information Jean- Baptiste Nkuriyingoma were fired. Sendashonga and Twagiramungu were placed under house arrest, but were eventually allowed to leave the country unharmed by the end of the year. While the government of national unity ostensibly continued until the presidential crisis of 2000, these events destroyed it for all practical purposes. Johan Pottier argues that the manner in which the RPF government restricted the access of journalists to information about Kibeho foreshadowed its approach in eastern Zaire later. He states, \\"Kibeho was a half-way stage in the development of Kagame's doctrine of tight information control.\\" = Australian awards = Four Australians were awarded the Medal for Gallantry for their distinguished service at Kibeho, the first gallantry medals awarded to Australians since the Vietnam War; Corporal Andrew Miller, Warrant Officer Rod Scott, Lieutenant Thomas Tilbrook and Major (then Captain) Carol Vaughan-Evans. All available accounts indicate that the small Australian team found the event deeply distressing, and were frustrated both by being unable to encourage many of the IDP to return home before the massacre and being helpless to prevent it once it was underway. However, some commentaries claim that the Australian actions helped reduce the numbers killed and wounded. Writing in the Australian Army Journal, Paul Jordan, has said that: \\"While there was little that we could have done to stop the killings, I believe that, if Australians had not been there as witnesses to the massacre, the RPA would have killed every single person in the camp.\\" See also *List of massacres in Rwanda  Footnotes   References  * *  External links  * * Includes short clip of Kibeho IDP camp * * Official Australian War Artist George Gittoes’ artwork from Rwanda * Major Carol Vaughan-Evans' short interview on the massacre Category:1995 in Rwanda Category:Mass murder in 1995 Category:Rwandan genocide Category:Conflicts in 1995 ","title":"Kibeho massacre"},{"id":"2168892","text":"Island Lake on alt=Godmanchester Nature Reserve The Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire (WTBCN) is a registered charity which manages 126 nature reserves covering . It has over 35,000 members, and 95% of people in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire live within five miles of a reserve. In the year to 31 March 2016 it employed 105 people and had an income of £5.1 million. It aims to conserve wildlife, inspire people to take action for wildlife, offer advice and share knowledge. The WTBCN is one of 36 wildlife trusts covering England, and 46 covering the whole of the United Kingdom. In 1912 Charles Rothschild formed the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves to protect sites considered \\"worthy of preservation\\". The society worked to secure statutory protection, and this began with the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In 1959 the society took on a coordinating role for local wildlife trusts, which covered the whole of Britain and Northern Ireland by 1978. The society changed its name to the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts in 2004, and it operates as The Wildlife Trusts. In 1956 the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Naturalists’ Trust was founded, and it was followed by the Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire Wildlife Trust in 1961, the Northamptonshire Wildlife Trust in 1963, and the Peterborough Wildlife Group in 1987. The Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire trusts merged in 1990, and a further merger produced the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire and Peterborough in 1994. Peterborough was dropped from the name (but still covered by the trust) in 2011. Fifty-two reserves are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), six are Ramsar wetland sites of international importance, six are Special Protection Areas under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds, two are national nature reserves, four are Nature Conservation Review sites, one is a Special Area of Conservation, two are in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one is a Geological Conservation Review site and eighteen are local nature reserves.

The band was founded in the mid-nineties by Tommi and former member Jürgen Sachau in Helsinki Finland. Tommi and Jürgen parted ways after the release of Haltya's 2nd studio album Electric Help Elves, and today Tommi records and produces Haltya mainly on his own, often with the help of other musicians, artists and producers. Haltya released their first studio recording on Exogenic Records in 1999 in the form of Project Haltya EP, and received very good feedback and club plays from, among others, Annie Nightingale at BBC Radio One. Their debut studio album Forest Flavor, which came out in 2000, was highly acclaimed by psychedelic electronic music lovers around the world, introducing a new fresh approach to sound imagination at that time. Their musical style took influences from jazz, funk, trance, house, drum n bass and all sorts of other musical directions. The result was seriously booty shaking funky forest music with sparkles on top, the trademark of Haltya. In late 2003 Haltya released the studio EP Hero, which made way for the following album Electric Help Elves, released 2004. Featuring the well known Finnish horn section baabelin torvet, a remix for Hidria Spacefolk, combining new elements and live instruments to their sound. The music is groovy, blends in unconventional psytrance instruments like guitars & horns and is best described as Funky Forest Trance. Borboleta Purpura, Haltya's 3rd studio EP, was released in 2007. It featured a slightly new sound direction as Tommi was influenced by having lived and playing at parties in Brazil at that time. The EP was recorded at mothership space station studios in Helsinki, the studio what would become home to numerous other side project releases incl. the double studio album for the band Headphonics, and Highpersonic Whomen's 2nd album. Haltya's 3rd studio album titled Book of Nature released in 2008, featured a more focused approach to song structure and form, alongside collaborations with other musicians and producers. Discussing the sound and process of creating this studio album, Tommi says \\"it was written and recorded during my journey's around the world, having visited and produced music in so many amazing places, having met so many interesting people, this album was a global process for me.\\" Today Haltya is considered to be one of the pioneers of electronic, funkedelic, and psychedelic music; as well as being a mainstay in Finnish Suomisaundi. Haltya has been heard at various parties in countries around the world during their numerous live gigs and dj sets. Aside from Finland, Haltya have played live gigs in Israel, Austria, United States, Turkey, Russia, Brazil, Germany, Denmark, Australia, Ukraine amongst other countries in the world. The name Haltya comes from the Finnish word haltija, which is for elf, or female spirit with wings. It is basically a faerie spirit, although in the old Finnish mythology haltija can be almost anything. It was believed that a person consists of many spirits, haltijas.

He had six brothers and six half brothers. When he was four years old, his mother died of cancer. His father was a merchant who married immediately after the death of Bijeh’s mother. Bijeh never remembered his mother, but said that his father was a barbaric person who beat him and chained his legs during childhood. His father forced him to abandon school and work. He was 11 when he came to Khatunabad with his family, where he began working at a furnace. Around this time, he was raped multiple times. Motivation He admitted that he had been raped and wanted to take revenge on the community, and that he suffered from his mother's early death and the lack of affection suffered in childhood. Bijeh commented on his main motive for the murders: \\"I suffered cruely from childhood, and when I compared my life with others, I had to commit such acts.\\"What is the news of the compatriot Bijeh and Shahla in Evin Arrest He said about his death sentence: \\"I do not deserve to be sentenced to death.\\" He was arrested on September 14, 2004 and tried in Branch 74 of the Tehran Penal Code under the presiding Judge Mansour Yavarzadeh Yeganeh and his four other lawyers, and by a majority of its judges and on November 27 the same year, he was sentenced to be executed.

Background The original location, 44th and France or Store 101, is located in Edina, Minnesota. Caribou Coffee founder, John Puckett, was working as a management consultant for Boston-based firm Bain & Company, helping develop ideas and strategies for other companies, when he decided he wanted to become an entrepreneur. After a trip to Denali National Park in Alaska, he and his wife, Kim, decided to raise money and start a coffee company. His wife stayed with a job at General Motors while John moved to Minnesota to find the first site and put together financing.John Vomhof Jr., Caribou founder: Knowing when to leave the corporate world and go into business for yourself, Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal, July 5, 2013, accessed July 8, 2013. The initial concept for Caribou was a five-day-a-week schedule aimed at downtown office workers, mimicking what worked in Boston. Puckett signed a lease for the first location to be in the large Pillsbury Center office building. However, soon afterward the building's landlord decided not to sign the lease, because another of the building's retail tenants had exclusive rights to selling coffee in the building and had threatened to sue them. As a result, the financing for the store fell through because it was dependent on that specific site. Puckett opted to start looking for an available location in the suburbs, and the first Caribou Coffee shop was started in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, in December 1992.

It is the only fission reactor power system launched into space by the United States. The reactor stopped working after just 43 days due to a non-nuclear electrical component failure.Nuclear Reactors for Space, Briefing Paper # 82, January 2004 The Systems Nuclear Auxiliary Power Program (SNAP) reactor was specifically developed for satellite use in the 1950s and early 1960s under the supervision of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. History The Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) program developed as a result of Project Feedback, a Rand Corporation study of reconnaissance satellites completed in 1954. As some of the proposed satellites had high power demands, some as high as a few kilowatts, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) requested a series of nuclear power-plant studies from industry in 1951. Completed in 1952, these studies determined that nuclear power plants were technically feasible for use on satellites. In 1955, the AEC began two parallel SNAP nuclear power projects. One, contracted out to The Martin Company, used radio-isotopic decay as the power source for its generators; these plants were given odd-numbered SNAP designations beginning with SNAP-1. The other project used nuclear reactors to generate energy, and was developed by the Atomics International Division of North American Aviation. Their systems were given even-numbered SNAP designations, the first being SNAP-2. SNAP-10A was the first Atomics International, nuclear-reactor power system built for use in space. Evolved from the SNAP-10 300 watt design, SNAP-10A fulfilled a 1961 Department of Defense requirement for a 500 watt system. Most of the systems development and reactor testing was conducted at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Ventura County, California using a number of specialized facilities. Construction The SNAP-10A has three major components – a compact nuclear reactor, the reactor reflector and control system, a heat transfer and power conversion system. The reactor measures 39.62 cm (15.6 in) long, 22.4 cm (8.8 in) diameter and holds 37 fuel rods containing 235U as uranium-zirconium-hydride fuel. The SNAP-10A reactor was designed for a thermal power output of 30 kW and unshielded weighs . The reactor can be identified at the top of the SNAP-10A unit. Reflectors were arranged around the outside of the reactor to provide the means to control the reactor. The reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing the reactor to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were held in place by a retaining band anchored by an explosive bolt. When the reflector was ejected from the unit, the reactor could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and the reactor permanently shut down. The eutectic sodium-potassium (NaK) alloy was used as a coolant in the SNAP-10A. The NaK was circulated through the core and thermoelectric converters by a liquid metal direct current conduction-type pump. The thermoelectric converters (identified as the long white \\"apron\\") are doped silicon germanium materials, thermally coupled, but electrically isolated from the NaK heat transfer medium. The temperature difference between the NaK on one side of the thermoelectric converter and the cold of space on the other created an electric potential and usable electricity.  SNAPSHOT mission =Launch and orbital operation = SNAP-10A was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base by an ATLAS Agena D rocket on 3 April 1965 into a low Earth orbit altitude of approx. 1,300 km. It is in a slightly retrograde polar orbit – an object with an inclination between 90 and 180 degrees is in a retrograde orbit. — this ensured that the spent rocket stages landed in the ocean. Its nuclear electrical source, made up of thermoelectric elements, was intended to produce over 500 watts of electrical power for one year. After 43 days, an onboard voltage regulator within the spacecraft – unrelated to the SNAP reactor – failed, causing the reactor core to be shut down, after reaching a maximum output of 590 watts. After the 1965 system failure, the reactor was left in a Earth orbit for an expected duration of 4,000 years., ...Launched in 1965 and carrying about 4.5 kilograms of uranium 235, Snap 10A is in a 1,000-year orbit.... In November 1979 the vehicle began shedding, eventually losing 50 pieces of traceable debris. The reasons were unknown, but the cause could have been a collision. Although the main body remains in place, radioactive material may have been released. Later research, published in 2008 and based on Haystack data, suggests that there are another 60 or more pieces of debris of size <10 cm =Ion propulsion= The SNAPSHOT test included a cesium ion thruster as a secondary payload, the first test of an electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system to operate in orbit (following the SERT-1 suborbital test in 1964). The ion-beam power supply was operated at 4500 V and 80 mA to produce a thrust of about 8.5 mN. The ion engine was to be operated off batteries for about one hour, and then the batteries were to be charged for approximately 15 hours using 0.1 kW of the nominal 0.5 kW SNAP system as the power supply. The ion engine operated for a period of less than 1 hour before being commanded off permanently. Analysis of flight data indicated a significant number of high-voltage breakdowns, and this apparently caused electromagnetic interference (EMI), causing attitude perturbations of the spacecraft. Ground tests indicated that the engine arcing produced conducted and radiated EMI significantly above design levels. Safety The SNAP reactor program necessitated a safety program and led to the inception of the Aerospace Nuclear Safety Program. The program was established to evaluate the nuclear hazards associated with the construction, launch, operation and disposal of SNAP systems and to develop designs to assure their radiological safety. Atomics International had primary responsibility for safety, while Sandia National Laboratories was responsible for the Aerospace Safety Independent Review and conducted many of the safety tests. Before launch was permitted, proof had to be obtained that under all circumstances the launch of the reactor would not pose a serious threat. A variety of tests were successfully completed and several videos of the development and tests are available for viewing. The Idaho National Laboratory conducted three destructive tests of SNAP nuclear reactors at Test Area North prior to the launch of SNAP-10A. Chapter 17: Science in the Desert. The SNAPTRAN-3 destructive experiment, on 1 April 1964, simulated a rocket crash into the ocean, purposely sending radioactive debris across the Idaho desert. The testing and development involving radioactive materials caused environmental contamination at the former Atomics International Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) facilities. The United States Department of Energy is responsible for the identification and cleanup of the radioactive contamination. (The SSFL was also used for the unrelated testing and development of rocket engines by Rocketdyne primarily for NASA.) The DOE website supporting the site cleanup details the historical development of nuclear energy at SSFL including additional SNAP testing and development information. Related work and follow-on programs Atomics International also developed and tested other compact nuclear reactors including the SNAP Experimental Reactor (SER), SNAP-2, SNAP-8 Developmental Reactor (SNAP8-DR) and SNAP-8 Experimental Reactor (SNAP-8ER) units at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (see Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power article). Atomics International also built and operated the Sodium Reactor Experiment, the first U.S. nuclear power plant to supply electricity to a public power system. , more than 30 small fission power system nuclear reactors have been sent into space in Soviet RORSAT satellites; also, over 40 radioisotope thermoelectric generators have been used globally (principally US and USSR) on space missions.

It is a softer material than any common III-V semiconductor. The Mohs hardness of HgTe is 1.9, CdTe is 2.9 and Hg0.5Cd0.5Te is 4. The hardness of lead salts is lower still. =Thermal= The thermal conductivity of HgCdTe is low; at low cadmium concentrations it is as low as 0.2 W*K−1m−1. This means that it is unsuitable for high power devices. Although infrared light-emitting diodes and lasers have been made in HgCdTe, they must be operated cold to be efficient. The specific heat capacity is 150 J·kg−1K−1. =Optical= HgCdTe is transparent in the infrared at photon energies below the energy gap. The refractive index is high, reaching nearly 4 for HgCdTe with high Hg content. Infrared detection HgCdTe is the only common material that can detect infrared radiation in both of the accessible atmospheric windows. These are from 3 to 5 µm (the mid-wave infrared window, abbreviated MWIR) and from 8 to 12 µm (the long-wave window, LWIR). Detection in the MWIR and LWIR windows is obtained using 30% [(Hg0.7Cd0.3)Te] and 20% [(Hg0.8Cd0.2)Te] cadmium respectively. HgCdTe can also detect in the short wave infrared SWIR atmospheric windows of 2.2 to 2.4 µm and 1.5 to 1.8 µm. HgCdTe is a common material in photodetectors of Fourier transform infrared spectrometers. This is because of the large spectral range of HgCdTe detectors and also the high quantum efficiency. It is also found in military field, remote sensing and infrared astronomy research. Military technology has depended on HgCdTe for night vision. In particular, the US air force makes extensive use of HgCdTe on all aircraft, and to equip airborne smart bombs. A variety of heat-seeking missiles are also equipped with HgCdTe detectors. HgCdTe detector arrays can also be found at most of the worlds major research telescopes including several satellites. Many HgCdTe detectors (such as Hawaii and NICMOS detectors) are named after the astronomical observatories or instruments for which they were originally developed. The main limitation of LWIR HgCdTe-based detectors is that they need cooling to temperatures near that of liquid nitrogen (77K), to reduce noise due to thermally excited current carriers (see cooled infrared camera). MWIR HgCdTe cameras can be operated at temperatures accessible to thermoelectric coolers with a small performance penalty. Hence, HgCdTe detectors are relatively heavy compared to bolometers and require maintenance. On the other side, HgCdTe enjoys much higher speed of detection (frame rate) and is significantly more sensitive than some of its more economical competitors. HgCdTe can be used as a heterodyne detector, in which the interference between a local source and returned laser light is detected. In this case it can detect sources such as CO2 lasers. In heterodyne detection mode HgCdTe can be uncooled, although greater sensitivity is achieved by cooling. Photodiodes, photoconductors or photoelectromagnetic (PEM) modes can be used. A bandwidth well in excess of 1 GHz can be achieved with photodiode detectors. The main competitors of HgCdTe are less sensitive Si-based bolometers (see uncooled infrared camera), InSb and photon-counting superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) arrays. Quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIP), manufactured from III-V semiconductor materials such as GaAs and AlGaAs, are another possible alternative, although their theoretical performance limits are inferior to HgCdTe arrays at comparable temperatures and they require the use of complicated reflection/diffraction gratings to overcome certain polarization exclusion effects which impact array responsivity. In the future, the primary competitor to HgCdTe detectors may emerge in the form of Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors (QDIP), based on either a colloidal or type-II superlattice structure. Unique 3-D quantum confinement effects, combined with the unipolar (non-exciton based photoelectric behavior) nature of quantum dots could allow comparable performance to HgCdTe at significantly higher operating temperatures. Initial laboratory work has shown promising results in this regard and QDIPs may be one of the first significant nanotechnology products to emerge. In HgCdTe, detection occurs when an infrared photon of sufficient energy kicks an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Such an electron is collected by a suitable external readout integrated circuits (ROIC) and transformed into an electric signal. The physical mating of the HgCdTe detector array to the ROIC is often referred to as a \\"focal plane array\\". In contrast, in a bolometer, light heats up a tiny piece of material. The temperature change of the bolometer results in a change in resistance which is measured and transformed into an electric signal. Mercury zinc telluride has better chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability characteristics than HgCdTe. It has a steeper change of energy gap with mercury composition than HgCdTe, making compositional control harder. HgCdTe growth techniques =Bulk crystal growth= The first large scale growth method was bulk recrystallization of a liquid melt. This was the main growth method from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. =Epitaxial growth= Highly pure and crystalline HgCdTe is fabricated by epitaxy on either CdTe or CdZnTe substrates. CdZnTe is a compound semiconductor, the lattice parameter of which can be exactly matched to that of HgCdTe. This eliminates most defects from the epilayer of HgCdTe. CdTe was developed as an alternative substrate in the '90s. It is not lattice-matched to HgCdTe, but is much cheaper, as it can be grown by epitaxy on silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge) substrates. Liquid phase epitaxy (LPE), in which a CdZnTe substrate is lowered and spinning on top of the surface of a slowly cooling liquid HgCdTe melt. This gives the best results in terms of crystalline quality, and is still a common technique of choice for industrial production. In recent years, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has become widespread because of its ability to stack up layers of different alloy composition. This allows simultaneous detection at several wavelengths. Furthermore, MBE, and also MOVPE, allow growth on large area substrates such as CdTe on Si or Ge, whereas LPE does not allow such substrates to be used. Toxicity The advancement of crystal growth technology has proceeded deliberately and steadily for four decades in spite of the high vapor pressure of Hg at the melting point of HgCdTe and the known http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2009/ARL-TR-5033.pdf toxicity of the material.

It started life as Post Office Giro but went through several name changes, becoming National Giro then National Girobank and finally Girobank plc before being absorbed into Alliance & Leicester plc in 2003. The organisation chalked up notable firsts. It was the first bank designed with computerised operations in mind; the first bank in Europe to adopt OCR (optical character recognition) technology; the first bank to offer interest-bearing current accounts, and the first bank in Europe to offer telephone banking, operating several years prior to the start of Midland Bank's First Direct service. It is widely credited for shaking up the UK banking market, forcing competitors to innovate and respond to the needs of the mass market. The concept Postal Giro or Postgiro systems have a long history in European financial services. The basic concept is that of a banking system not based on cheques, but rather by direct transfer between accounts. If the accounting office is centralised, then transfers between accounts can happen simultaneously. Money could be paid in or withdrawn from the system at any post office, and later connections to the commercial banking systems were established, often by the convenience of the local bank opening its own account at the Postgiro. By the middle of the 20th century, most countries in continental Europe had a postal giro service. The world's first post office giro banking system was established in Austria in the late 19th century by the Österreichische Postsparkasse. By the time the British Postgiro was conceived, the Dutch Postgiro was very well established with virtually every adult having a postgiro account with very large and well used postgiro operations in most other countries in Europe and Scandinavia. The term \\"bank\\" was not used initially to describe the service. The banks' main payment instrument was based on the \\"cheque\\" (\\"check\\" in American English) which has a totally different remittance model from the \\"Giro\\". In the banking model, cheques are written by the remitter and then handed or posted to the payee who must then visit a bank or post the cheque to his bank. The cheque must then be cleared, a complex process by which cheques are sorted once, posted to a central clearing, sorted again, and then posted back to the paying branch where the cheque is finally checked and then paid. In the Postal Giro model Giro Transfers are sent through the post by the remitter to the Giro Centre. On receipt, the transfer is checked and the account transfer takes place. If the transfer is successful, the transfer document is sent to the recipient, together with an updated statement of account being credited. The remitter is also sent an updated statement. In the case of large utilities receiving thousands of transactions per day, statements would be sent electronically and incorporate a reference number uniquely identifying the remittance for reconciliation purposes. Reason for establishment in the UK In 1959 a Committee set up to investigate the \\"Working of the Monetary System in the United Kingdom\\" recommended the introduction of a Giro System, and if the main banks did not do this, the possibility of the Post Office introducing it should be investigated. Politics played a part in the development of the National Giro as the British Postgiro was named. It reflected a general feeling in the Labour Movement that the banks were not meeting the mass banking needs of the British population. In the early 1960s, the majority of adults in the United Kingdom did not have a bank account and the banks did not court business from the working classes, which they regarded as unprofitable. Working-class employees would be paid weekly in cash, while those in the middle class were more likely to be salaried and paid with a bank cheque at the end of the month. Those who could afford to have a bank account could pay the cheque into the account, but even among the middle class, many had no bank account. It was common practice for cheques to be endorsed to local traders (and especially the milkman) who would know the customer and be prepared to exchange the cheque for cash. In the 1960s, although most towns had one or more bank branches, smaller communities very often had no bank branch at all. Post Offices, on the other hand were just about in every community. There used to be about 22,000 Post Offices in the UK compared to about 3,000 bank branches. The Post Office was ideally placed to establish a viable mass banking system. The banks also were rather secretive about their tariff structures which were never published. The Post Office would publish a tariff of charges, the key one being that transfers between accounts would be free of charge, thus encouraging the adoption of the system. At a stroke the National Giro, as the service would be called, would, it was hoped, revolutionise banking in the UK. Planning for the National Giro In 1965 a White Paper \\"A Post Office Giro\\" was published, which outlined the system including a computerised central system for processing transactions. Computerisation, it was argued, would transform the profitability of the new system, and it was estimated that a payment between two National Giro accounts could be made in 24 hours if there was a central accounting office located at a good communications hub. This would also speed up the national bank payment clearing system based on local bank branches and centralised cheque exchange requiring cheques to be returned to local branches. This had (and to this day still has) a 3-5 day clearing cycle. The Wilson government placed an Act before Parliament and the Post Office's central planning department and its new Computer Division began business and technical planning for the new service. By 20 September 1965 a central site was chosen at Bootle in Lancashire. The Post Office bought land on the site of sidings of the North Mersey Branch railway. It also built a large, purpose built office and data processing complex for the site, completed in March 1968. The National Giro was the first financial institution in Europe and probably the world, to be established from the outset to be fully computerised. It broke new ground in Europe when it adopted optical character recognition for its transfer, inpayment and outpayment transaction documents, making it possible for the first time for utility companies and mail order companies to print their own personalised remittance slips and automate at least part of the complex accounting processes. Uncertainty and the \\"Green Light\\" The early years of National Giro were unprofitable. This was hardly a surprise given that a huge amount had been invested in establishing a service infrastructure that began with zero customers. Similar types of enterprise such as the credit card operator, Barclaycard, would also take many years to begin to build a base from which to begin recouping both capital and labour costs. Nevertheless, the largely middle class press led by the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail were hostile to the creation of the National Giro as were the banks, which saw it as a long term threat. In 1969 National Giro partnered with the Mercantile Loan Company Ltd to provide loans to account holders, which was a significant stimulation of account growth. When a Conservative government came to power in 1970, there were pressures on the government to close the still loss making operation. The Post Office made a strong case for adding new services that could transform the financial viability of the operation. Essentially, it proposed that it tackle both the income and expenditure side of the business. * On the expenditure side, it would limit the growth in staff by limiting the plans for expanding the personal customer base. As this grew, transaction costs grew (including the cost of remitting all those daily movement statements). Advertising ceased and charges were introduced that would discourage further growth in the personal giro account business. * It also proposed that the government itself should start using the Giro by making social security payments through the service. As most people still did not have bank accounts, this led to the birth of the girocheque, a payment instrument exchangeable at the Post Office for cash, but equally capable of being paid into any bank account. The biggest change, however, took place behind the scenes. Instead of focusing on the needs of the utilities (which had by this time already adopted the Giro) and the personal banking market, National Giro would aim to capture the cash deposit business then dominated by the commercial clearing banks. The Post Office itself was a major customer of the commercial banks. It had a constant need for cash in order for it to pay out social security payments (welfare payments and pensions). Bank notes and coin had to be obtained from the banks which charged a fee for this service. The banks were also charging the depositors of these notes and coin, all of which needed to be counted before being passed on to the Post Office (which itself then had extra costs in counting the money provided by the banks. The new system was brilliantly simple. Large depositors of cash (supermarkets, petrol (gas) stations etc.) would be encouraged through pricing to pay their cash into the Post Office. Post Offices are more convenient and open longer hours so there was a natural case for choosing the Post Office. What's more, the depositor would count the money once and seal it discrete envelopes of say, units of £100, £500 or £1000. The Post Office would take the money on trust, but commit to counting it not on receipt, but within a fixed period, of say 5 days. Thus within the Post Office, money could be handled very easily and its source was clearly marked. The money would be counted at the time it was needed (i.e. when the envelope needed to be opened). Discrepancies were reported to the Giro, so that any attempt at systematic fraud could be easily identified. And the Giro could charge both the depositor for the deposit and the Post Office as an internal charge for the provision of the cash. As these charges were lower than those being charged by the commercial banks, everybody was happy. The Post Office internal handling of cash also became much simplified by the handling of fixed value envelopes. The government, with the advice of consultants Cooper Brothers, gave a \\"Green Light\\" to the continuation plan. However charges were doubled for the majority of customers, the 'same day' service was changed to a 'next day' service, and staffing was reduced from 3500 to 3000. The new plan was a great success and provided a firm financial foundation for its operations, although at some cost to the great plan to move the country over to using the Giro for remittances instead of the banks. Banking for the masses By the late 1970s, one pound in every four pounds deposited in cash at a bank in the UK was deposited with the National Giro at the Post Office. This would later rise to one pound in every three. The organisation was again profitable and repaying its capital costs. Indeed, its rate of return on capital was higher than that of the commercial banks, and this allowed the government to relax the constraints it had placed on the National Giro and even allow for further capitalisation. In 1978, National Giro renamed itself National Girobank to re-establish itself in the minds of the public as a bank, rather than some quasi non-bank. Its status as a bank had been fixed in law, but it had until now been reluctant to use the term. It also re-launched its ambition to be the People's Bank, and was the first bank to offer free banking to UK personal customers (provided the account was in credit. This included free postage for the remittance of documents to the Giro Centre as well as free cheques and deposits (the terms inpayments and outpayments were dropped). The new campaign was a great success and at first the bank had trouble keeping up with the flow of new business it generated. Later the bank dropped the word National from its title, simply being known as Girobank plc as a prelude to privatisation. Although the bank gained a large number of new accounts it never reached the level of penetration achieved by the European Postgiros to enable it to become the main payment clearing system in the UK as was the dream of its creators. By the late 1980s, Girobank was Britain's sixth largest bank. The main reasons are given in the next two sections. Girocheque as a derogatory term The term Girocheque quickly became associated with welfare dependence. Worse still, the name was often associated with Girobank in the public psyche, making little distinction between the welfare cheque and the business. Having a giro account meant writing one's own girocheques and although recipients of girocheques did not need to have (and most did not have) a giro account, girocheques issued by personal customers were sometimes viewed with suspicion by the recipient. They also carried the name and address of the issuer, making them very noticeably different from the cheques issued by other banks and noticeably similar to welfare girocheques. This issue was rectified in the 1978 relaunch. The term girocheque was dropped in favour of the more neutral cheque. Nevertheless, the media continued to refer to Girocheques as Giros. Competition The commercial banks had not been slow to respond to the challenge of competing with National Giro and had developed their own credit transfer service known as Bank Giro, primarily aimed at the same utilities that the Giro had attracted. It still mainly required a visit to a bank branch and there was no free postage for the remitter. The banks had also responded to the criticism that they were secretive about their tariffs and for the first time published a standard tariff for personal customers. They also began heavy advertising to the personal banking sector in order to capture the customers that National Giro had been forced to give up on during the period between the Green Light and the relaunch of Free Banking some seven years later. They had also adopted new services such as credit cards, personal loans and revolving credit accounts which Girobank could not easily do until it had a significant base. Although the Giro did offer personal loans through a third party, it did not offer many of these main services on its own behalf until after the relaunch in 1978. It added savings accounts, overdrafts, revolving credit accounts, credit and debit cards, and was instrumental in the formation of the LINK ATM consortium of smaller banks and building societies which led the commercial clearing banks to begin linking their own networks which they had hitherto refused to do. It was also quick to establish Internet banking and mass market it to its customers. So although the Girobank ended up looking much like any other bank, it was clearly nothing like the type of bank it originally expected to be, but it had also been instrumental in changing the competitive nature of the banking market in the UK and had been a great innovator. Privatisation The National Girobank Bootle office after privatisation The Alliance & Leicester Group won a bidding process for the Girobank operation in 1989 when the government decided to privatise it. The transaction was completed in 1990. By the time of the privatisation, the bank was essentially indistinguishable from its competitors apart from the fact that it used Post Offices to transact cash business. The contract with the Post Office was to continue to be an exclusive one for a fixed period after privatisation. Nowadays, the Post Office provides cash services to many banks on a commercial basis. After privatisation, the bank expanded and opened a £9.5 million operations centre in Wigan.18 May 90 UK: Contract -Wigan. Monk to build operations centre for Girobank. The personal banking business of Girobank became part of the Alliance & Leicester Building Society. The Business Banking arm continued trading under the name of Girobank as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alliance and Leicester, being repositioning as a cash handler and credit card processor for retailers and other banks. In 2003 the Girobank brand was dropped, with the business renamed as Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank following further consolidation in the Alliance & Leicester Group. In May 2010 Alliance & Leicester was acquired by Grupo Santander, and the name Alliance & Leicester was replaced by Santander UK. After the \\"Girobank\\" brand ceased to be used, the organisation lived on for a time within the Alliance & Leicester Group. The name \\"Girobank\\" continued in use on some Giro Credits intended for paying bills, along with the Alliance & Leicester \\"plus\\" logo. Some councils were continuing to use the original name \\"Post Office Giro\\" in 2011. Campaign for re-establishment On 17 March 2009, a campaign was launched to bring back Girobank. Backers include some MPs, trade unions and small businesses. In April 2013 the Post Office announced it would be relaunching a banking service accessible through Post Office branches under the Post Office Money brand.

The proposal was a reaction to the Supreme Court's Kelo v. New London (2005) decision in which Souter joined the majority ruling that the U.S. Constitution allows the use of eminent domain to condemn privately owned real property for use in private economic development projects. On March 14, 2006, a ballot initiative favoring this project was defeated by almost a three-to-one margin. Two candidates who had supported the initiative were not elected to the town's Board of Selectmen. History Souter voted with the five-Justice majority in Kelo v. New London, a 2005 decision in which the Court held that the Constitution does not prohibit a local government from condemning private property in order to transfer the land to a commercial developer that promises to bring in more tax revenue than the original owner, so long as such use serves a subjectively-defined \\"public purpose,\\" such as economic development of a \\"distressed\\" area. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the principal dissent, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Justice Thomas also wrote a separate dissent. On June 27, 2005, Logan Clements proposed that the Town of Weare use eminent domain to the land and farmhouse where Souter spent most of his youth, and where Souter still resided, for the purpose of constructing a hotel and restaurant on the property. Clements asserted that the Town of Weare would gain more tax revenue and economic benefits from the hotel and restaurant than it did from Souter's private residence. Clements said he would fund the hotel partly with investment capital from objectivists, libertarians, and other investors and hoped that members of prominent objectivist and libertarian groups would be regular customers. On June 29, 2005, Travis J. I. Corcoran created an online pledge form in which potential patrons would pledge to spend at least one week at the hotel if it was constructed. Within eight days, more than 1,000 registered users had signed the pledge, and by the pledge deadline of August 29, 2005, a total of 1,418 people had signed. Clements and his staff maintained that they were serious about building the hotel if it gained enough public interest and financial support. A local group, the Committee for the Protection of Natural Rights, proposed a measure which, if adopted by popular vote, would provide for Souter's house and land to be taken for the construction of an Inn. The measure would create two trusts to fund the hotel project, one to cover legal expenses and another to hold donations to provide \\"just compensation\\" for Souter's property. Clements announced an effort to add the proposal to the agenda of the Weare town meeting, and in late August, NPR and ABC reported he had managed to gain the 25 signatures required to place it on the ballot. Clements pursued financing and public relations efforts in support of the project. Supporters of the initiative held a rally in Weare on January 21 and 22, 2006, attended by supporters from as far away as Washington State and Texas, and supported of hotel backer Joshua Solomon's candidacy for election to the Weare Board of Selectmen in March 2006. Supporters also canvassed voters door-to-door in Weare and spread word of the ballot initiative. The effort received local, state, and national media attention. On February 4, 2006, voters who gathered for the meeting portion of the town's annual election process voted to change the article's wording. The new text simply called upon the state legislature to oppose the taking of private property for use by private development, as some argued the Kelo decision now allowed. The voice vote was unanimous, although some supporters of the hotel concept later said they were upset by the vote. Under New Hampshire's town election system, any town resident who attends this annual meeting may amend warrant articles, including ones submitted by petition. Clements later condemned this procedure as undemocratic. Weare voters passed this newly worded article as it appeared on the town ballot when they went to the polls on March 14, 2006. Two candidates for selectman who supported the hotel and were founding members of the Committee for the Protection of Natural Rights were defeated for election. Notable commentary Professor Randy Barnett, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Cato Institute who opposed Kelo, found the proposal amusing at first, facetiously calling the hotel an \\"excellent public purpose\\", but rejected the idea when he found out people were taking it seriously, stating: \\"Retaliating against a judge ... violates the holding of Kelo itself, for the intent would be to take from A to give to B, in this case to punish A.\\" The Volokh Conspiracy Professor Eugene Volokh categorized Clements' actions as political speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, he criticized the hotel proposal itself, on the grounds that \\"we shouldn't seriously want government agencies to retaliate against government officials by seizing their property.\\" The Volokh Conspiracy New Hampshire's Republican state representative from Weare, Neal Kurk, saw the hotel plans as \\"poetic justice\\", as he opposed Kelo, but he hopes that \\"Justice Souter's property will be protected by the good sense of New Hampshire townspeople.\\" Sterling Burnett, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, stated that he thought approval of the proposal would be \\"sweet justice\\", saying: \\"It shows how the sanctity of peoples' homes now exists solely at the whim of local politicians.\\" Editors of the Missoulian said they \\"like[d]\\" the proposal and that it would \\"be amusing to turn the tables on those who undermine the rights of citizens\\", but point out: \\"Based on our reading of the Supreme Court's majority opinion in the property-rights case, it takes more than a simple good idea to take someone's home away.\\" Air America Radio commentator Rachel Maddow, appearing on Tucker Carlson's MSNBC \\"Situation\\" program, dismissed the proposal as a \\"creepy\\" publicity stunt. One Weare area newspaper praised the Board of Selectmen for its handling of the Clements proposal, noting that it was \\"impossible for them to act on it because it had not gone through proper channels.\\" NewHampshire.com See also *Constitution Park (New Hampshire) References Category:Eminent domain Category:Libertarianism in the United States Category:2005 in politics Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States Category:Weare, New Hampshire ","title":"Lost Liberty Hotel"},{"id":"2168957","text":"Alain Grandbois, (May 25, 1900 - March 18, 1975) was a Canadian Quebecer poet, considered the first great modern one.

They were active between 1966 and 1969 and closely linked to the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), established by Ian Paisley and Noel Doherty in 1966. The organisation's inaugural meeting took place in Belfast's Ulster Hall, which would later become the UCDC. Their first incidents quickly followed. In the spring of 1966, members bombed an all-girls primary school in Ardoyne, where talks to better relations between Protestants and Catholics were to take place. In May of that year they had their first kill in Shankill, although it was unintentional. The victim was 70-year-old Matilda Gould, a Protestant who the volunteers mistook for the Catholic living next door. Shortly after this, the UVF and UPV took part in the killings of two Catholic men not far from the scene of the first attack. Following the 1967 trial of the UVF's leader Gusty Spence, the two groups were classified as illegal organizations.  1969 bombing campaign  In the spring of 1969, the UPV took part in a bombing campaign across Belfast. The series of bombings took place on 30 March, 4 April, 20 April, 24 and 26 April. These attacks targeted electricity substations that would remove power from the east and south parts of Belfast. Other attacks targeted the water supply. A separate bombing was also planned to target a hydroelectric plant in Ballyshannon. As a result, Irish troops moved toward the border alongside ambulances, and British troops moved into the area as well. The UPV was also involved in the RTE Studio bombing on 5 August 1969. Shortly after the failed attack in Ballyshannon, a message was issued by the groups: > \\"We wish to state that an active service unit from Northern Ireland was > dispatched to undertake this task. So long as the threats from Éire > continue, so long will the Volunteers of Ulster’s People’s Army strike at > targets in Southern Ireland.\\" Several attacks followed, including ones in Bodenstown and Dublin.

The UCDC was the governing body of the loyalist Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV). The UCDC coordinated parades, counter demonstrations, and paramilitary activities, in order to maintain the status quo of the government, lead a campaign against the reforms of Terence O'Neill, and stymie the civil rights movement.  Background  The fourth Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence O'Neill, who began his term in 1963, was trying to modernize industry to stave off an economic depression. This modernization brought foreign industry to Northern Ireland and threatened the Protestant, Unionist, power base. The Unionists held 90 percent of the jobs but foreign industries were hiring Catholics, thus reducing the strength of the Protestants. In 1965, Terence O'Neill also invited and met with Sean Lemass, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland, to promote economic cooperation. The Unionists regarded the Republic of Ireland as the enemy and a report from Brian McConnell, the Home Affairs Minister, said there was a new IRA campaign of subversion. Ian Paisley, a fundamentalist Presbyterian who was politically active, joined the Orange Order and supported the Unionist Party platform. The fundamentalists were associated with 'traditional Unionism,' that supported the Protestant power base with its advantages in jobs, housing, and political power. The ecumenical, liberal movement within Protestantism was thought to be aligning with the political elite and with the Catholics, thereby threatening the advantages enjoyed by working-class Protestants. Ian Paisley's attempt to put four candidates into an election ended up with him withdrawing them when he identified the need for an electoral machine to obtain votes in the Westminster general election.Boulton, David. _The UVF 1966-73, An Anatomy of Loyalist Rebellion_. Dublin: Torc Books, 1973.(Boulton 34) Noel Doherty, a member of Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster since 1956, was also a printer who with Paisley formed the Puritan Printing Company and created the first edition of the Protestant Telegraph in May 1966. Doherty was a great admirer or Gusty Spence, a member of the Ulster Protestant Action. Spence was a much harder character who recreated the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in March 1966, just prior to the creation of the UCDC.The original Ulster Volunteer Force was decimated at the Battle of Somme during World War I Doherty would propose the political vehicle Ian Paisley needed but Doherty's motives were more aligned with Spence than with Paisley. Doherty used his position of trust with Paisley and began to organise a network of the 'Ulster Protestant Volunteer Corps' about two months prior to the creation of the UCDC.  Organization  Ian Paisley met with fellow loyalists including Noel Doherty in April 1966, when he discussed a proposal by Doherty to create the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee. Paisley was made the Chairman and a \\"12-man united society of Protestant patriots pledged by all lawful methods to uphold and maintain the constitution of Northern Ireland\\" (also known as \\"the 12 disciples\\") was created. Doherty was made the Secretary.(Boulton 34-36) = UCDC Debut = The public debut of the UCDC took place on the Shankill Road (West Belfast) on 17 April 1966, in the form of a parade led by Ian Paisley and Noel Doherty. Members of both Doherty's and Spence's newly created organizations participated in the parade and were publicly thanked by Paisley. =Organizing the UPV= In May 1966, the UCDC decided to organize Doherty's Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV), which was a loyalist paramilitary group, into local branches, which were called divisions. The UPV was under the governance of the UCDC, binding it by a constitution which condemned illegal violence.(Boulton 38). Only Protestants were allowed to join and Roman Catholics along with members of the RUC were automatically excluded.  Activities  Noel Doherty made it difficult to separate the activities of the UCDC/UPV from the activities of the UVF. He asked members of the UVF and the Armagh Free Presbyterian Church to attend a meeting where the Loughgall division of the UPV would be created. During the meeting both guns and gelignite were discussed, along with reprisals against the IRA. Doherty chaired the meeting but Ian Paisley was not there, and later denied any knowledge, which was supported by Doherty. Despite the UCDC's disassociation with violence and illegal activities, divisions of the UPV under control of the UCDC were linked with petrol bomb attacks on Catholic schools, shops, bars and homes in the Spring of 1966.Coogan, Tim Pat. _The Troubles, Ireland's Ordeal 1966-1996 and the Search for Peace_. Colorado: Roberts Rinehart Publishers, 1996.(Coogan 49,50) The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)The RUC were the local police. investigated. Five of these attacks were in April and the 1st week of May. Noel Doherty facilitated the Loughgall division of the UPV and Gusty Spence's Shankill Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) working together.(Boulton 41) Doherty introduced a quarryman who supplied the explosive, gelignite and detonators to members of the UVF. (Boulton 42)  Disassociation with the UVF  Paisley organized a picket against a liberal church parade on 6 April 1966. He felt that the church supported Terrence O'Neill's political viewpoint which Paisley opposed. The parade went through a catholic area and a riot broke out (the Presbyterian General Assembly riot). Four policemen were badly injured which began an open hostility between the RUC and Paisley. The Orange Order, the liberal Presbyterian Church and official unionism disassociated themselves from Paisley and said his organizations \\"represent a defiance of lawful authority no less serious in essence than that of the IRA.\\"The Belfast Telegraph A murder outside a bar known as the Malvern Arms was investigated and the UCDC, led by Ian Paisley was implicated but he denied any knowledge. Gusty Spence, Hugh McClean and Robert Williamson from the UVF, shot four barmen they presumed were IRA men. Off duty RUC men were in the back room of the bar and arrests were made. The three gunmen were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Terrence O'Neill banned the UVF under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act of 1932. The UCDC and the UPV were not banned but O'Neill made many attempts to tie the organizations together, implying that Ian Paisley was the leader. Ian Paisley denied any connection with the UVF. He and James McConnell, the vice- chairman of the UCDC, expelled Doherty from the UCDC.(Boulton 54) Four days after the murder conviction, Noel Doherty was sentenced to two years on an explosive charge. The quarryman who supplied the explosives, Jim Marshall was fined £200. Ian Paisley was sent to jail on 19 July 1966 for refusing to sign a pledge of good behaviour after the Presbyterian General Assembly Riot. As a result, protests, parades and riots ensued. On Paisley's release on 19 October, his supporters celebrated all over Protestant Belfast. A public opinion poll indicated that 200,000 of Ulster's million Protestants considered themselves as potential Paisley supporters. Early clashes between Catholics and Protestants were reported on 7 March 1967.  Counter Demonstrations  The Northern Ireland civil rights movement was founded in February, 1967. It was made up from three distinct social groups: the Catholic middle class; the students of Queen's University; and the working class in the Catholic ghettos. It also included the remnants of the old IRA. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), chaired by Mrs. Betty Sinclair was slow starting. When it did start marching, the result was bloody clashes with the various Protestant organizations. (Boulton 66-67) The first civil rights march was scheduled for August 24, 1968. It was supposed to proceed from Coalisland to Dungannon by going through Market Square and the town centre. The UCDC/UPC convinced the police to re-route the march through the Catholic part of town. The marchers were met at the outskirts of Dungannon by the police and a large group made up mainly by the Ulster Protestant Volunteers. The police managed to keep both groups apart but were abused by both sides. At the conclusion of the demonstration, the executives of the UCDC thanked the UPV members for their support and stated that, \\"The policy of the UCDC, through the UPC, has been and will continue to be to confront the enemy at every opportunity.\\" (Boulton 69) The next civil rights march was banned as it was supposed to parade through part of Derry within the city walls. This was considered 'sacred' ground by the Protestants and not only the UPV but by all the unionists and the police. The marchers ignored the order and were confronted by the RUC riot squad where 90 marchers and 18 police were injured. \\"Meanwhile, students at Queens University here announced they would hold a rally of about 1,500 people to protest reported police brutality. A rival meeting was planned by the Ulster (Northern Ireland) Constitution Defense Committee.\\"Christian Science Monitor; Oct 13, 1968; ProQuest Historical Newspapers Christian Science Monitor, pg 4 Another NICRA demonstration in Belfast on 9 October 1968 was blocked by a crowd led by Ian Paisley. Derry was the site of numerous other civil rights marches and counter marches by the UCDC/UPV. The battles were having a political impact and Terrence O'Neill was a central figure in supporting the reforms to try and control the situation between the civil rights groups and the UCDC/UPV along with other Protestant groups.  Reforms  The UCDC was used to lead the campaign against the reforms of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence O'Neill, in the late 1960s.Melaugh, Martin. \\"Cain, Abstracts of Organizations.\\", \\"Cain, Abstracts of Organizations -U-\\", 11/20/2007, CAIN Web Services, retrieved 2/22/2008(Coogan 51) The reforms requested were as follows: *Reform the voting wards within Derry. *One-man, one-vote *A reformed system of housing allocations *Abolition of the Special Powers Act *Appointment of an Ombudsman O'Neill proposed reforms that resembled those requested but the proposal toned down the requests leaving neither side satisfied. The UPV issued a statement that inflamed the situation.  Bombings  A series of bomb attacks against local power and water distribution were attributed to the UCDC/UPC and the outlawed UVF. The attacks were considered to cause civil disruption with the result to force Terrence O'Neill to resign. Court trials found most of the defendants not-guilty so the attacks could not be linked to one or more Protestant extremist groups. O'Neill resigned in April 1969 after he was nearly defeated in his area by Ian Paisley.  Notes   References  #Boulton, David. The UVF 1966-73, An Anatomy of Loyalist Rebellion.

Distinctive features are grouped into categories according to the natural classes of segments they describe: major class features, laryngeal features, manner features, and place features. These feature categories in turn are further specified on the basis of the phonetic properties of the segments in question. Since the inception of the phonological analysis of distinctive features in the 1950s, features traditionally have been specified by binary values to signify whether a segment is described by the feature; a positive value, [+], denotes the presence of a feature, while a negative value, [−], indicates its absence. In addition, a phoneme may be unmarked with respect to a feature. It is also possible for certain phonemes to have different features across languages. For example, could be classified as a continuant or not in a given language depending on how it patterns with other consonants. In recent developments to the theory of distinctive features, phonologists have proposed the existence of single-valued features. These features, called univalent or privative features, can only describe the classes of segments that are said to possess those features, and not the classes that are without them. List Euler diagram showing a typical classification of sounds (in IPA) and their manners of articulation and distinctive featuresThis section lists and describes the features. = Major class = Major class features: The features that represent the major classes of sounds. #[+/− syllabic] Syllabic segments may function as the nucleus of a syllable, while their counterparts, the [−syll] segments, may not. Except in the case of syllabic consonants, [+syllabic] designates all vowels, while [−syllabic] designates all consonants (including glides). #[+/− consonantal] Consonantal segments are produced with an audible constriction in the vocal tract, such as obstruents, nasals, liquids, and trills. Vowels, glides and laryngeal segments are not consonantal. #[+/− approximant] Approximant segments include vowels, glides, and liquids while excluding nasals and obstruents. #[+/− sonorant] This feature describes the type of oral constriction that can occur in the vocal tract. [+son] designates the vowels and sonorant consonants (namely glides, liquids, and nasals), that are produced without an imbalance of air pressure in the vocal tract that might cause turbulence. [−son] describes the obstruents, articulated with a noticeable turbulence caused by an imbalance of air pressure in the vocal tract. =Laryngeal= Laryngeal features: The features that specify the glottal states of sounds. #[+/− voice] This feature indicates whether vibration of the vocal folds occurs with the articulation of the segment. #[+/− spread glottis] Used to indicate the aspiration of a segment, this feature denotes the openness of the glottis. For [+sg], the vocal folds are spread apart widely enough for frication to occur; for [−sg], there is not the same friction-inducing spreading. #[+/− constricted glottis] The constricted glottis features denotes the degree of closure of the glottis. [+cg] implies that the vocal folds are held closely together, enough so that air cannot pass through momentarily, while [−cg] implies the opposite. =Manner= Manner features: The features that specify the manner of articulation. #[+/− continuant] This feature describes the passage of air through the vocal tract. [+cont] segments are produced without any significant obstruction in the tract, allowing air to pass through in a continuous stream. [−cont] segments, on the other hand, have such an obstruction, and so occlude the air flow at some point of articulation. #[+/− nasal] This feature describes the position of the velum. [+nas] segments are produced by lowering the velum so that air can pass through the nasal tract. [−nas] segments conversely are produced with a raised velum, blocking the passage of air to the nasal tract and shunting it to the oral tract. #[+/− strident] The strident feature applies to obstruents only and refers to a type of friction that is noisier than usual. This is caused by high energy white noise. #[+/− lateral] This feature designates the shape and positioning of the tongue with respect to the oral tract. [+lat] segments are produced as the center of the tongue rises to contact the roof of the mouth, thereby blocking air from flowing centrally through the oral tract and instead forcing more lateral flow along the lowered side(s) of the tongue. #[+/− delayed release] This feature distinguishes stops from affricates. Affricates are designated [+del rel] =Place= Place features: The features that specify the place of articulation. *[ LABIAL ] Labial segments are articulated with the lips. As consonants, these include bilabial and labiodental consonants. #[+/− round]: [+round] are produced with lip rounding, while [−round] are not. *[ CORONAL ] Coronal sounds are articulated with the tip and/or blade of the tongue. These include a large number of consonants, which can be made with the tip, blade or underside of the tongue (apical, laminal, or subapical consonant, respectively), making contact with the upper lip (linguolabial), between the teeth (interdental), with the back of the teeth (dental), with the alveolar ridge (alveolar), behind the alveolar ridge (postalveolar), or on or in front of the hard palate ((pre)palatal). With postalveolar sibilants, additional tongue shapes need to be distinguished, i.e. \\"domed\\" or slightly palatalized (\\"hushing\\" or \\"palato-alveolar\\"), palatalized (alveolopalatal), and \\"closed\\" (\\"hissing-hushing\\"). #[+/− anterior]: Anterior segments are articulated with the tip or blade of the tongue at or in front of the alveolar ridge. Dental consonants are [+ant], postalveolar and retroflex ones are [−ant]. #[+/− distributed]: For [+dist] segments the tongue is extended for some distance in the mouth. In other words, laminal dental and postalveolar consonants are marked as [+dist], while apical alveolar and retroflex consonants are [−dist]. *[ DORSAL ] Dorsal sounds are articulated by raising the dorsum of the tongue. All vowels are dorsal sounds. Dorsal consonants include palatal, velar and uvular consonants. #[+/− high]: [+high] segments raise the dorsum close to the palate. [−high] segments do not. #[+/− low]: [+low] segments bunch the dorsum to a position low in the mouth. #[+/− back]: [+back] segments are produced with the tongue dorsum bunched and retracted slightly to the back of the mouth. [−back] segments are bunched and extended slightly forward. #[+/− tense]: This feature (mainly) applies to the position of the root of the tongue when articulating vowels. [+tense] vowels have an advanced tongue root. In fact, this feature is often referred to as advanced tongue root (ATR), although there is a debate on whether tense and ATR are the same or different features. *[ RADICAL ] Radical sounds are articulated with the root of the tongue. These include epiglottal consonants. #[+/− advanced tongue root]: [+ATR] segments advance the root of the tongue. #[+/− retracted tongue root]: [+RTR] segments bunch the root of the tongue towards the pharyngeal wall and activate the pharyngeal constrictor muscles *[ GLOTTAL ] Purely glottal sounds do not involve the tongue at all. These are the glottal consonants. =Vowel space= Vowels are distinguished by #[+/− back] (back vowels) #[+/− high] (close vowels) #[+/− low] (low vowels) #[+/− tense] (tense vowels) However, laryngoscopic studies suggest the features are #[+/− front] (front vowels) #[+/− raised] (raised vowels) #[+/− retracted] (retracted vowels) #[+/− round] (round vowels) Jakobsonian system This system is given by . =Sonority= *[+/− vocalic] vocalic, non- vocalic *[+/− consonantal] consonantal, non-consonantal *[+/− nasal] nasal, oral *[+/− compact] forward-flanged: velar and palatal consonant, wide vowel *[+/− diffuse] backward-flanged: labial and coronal, narrow vowel *[+/− abrupt] *[+/− strident] strident, mellow *[+/− checked] =Protensity= *[+/− tense] =Tonality= * [+/− grave] peripheral consonant, back vowel * [+/− acute] * [+/− medial] coronal or palatal consonant, front vowel * [+/− flat] narrowed slit, wider slit * [+/− sharp] widened slit, narrower slit Other uses The concept of a distinctive feature matrix to distinguish similar elements is identified with phonology, but there have been at least two efforts to use a distinctive feature matrix in related fields. Close to phonology, and clearly acknowledging its debt to phonology, distinctive features have been used to describe and differentiate handshapes in fingerspelling in American Sign Language.Godsave, Bruce. 1974. An investigation of the feasibility of using a particular distinctive feature matrix for recording and categorizing fingerspelling errors. University of Cincinnati, doctoral dissertation. Distinctive features have also been used to distinguish proverbs from other types of language such as slogans, clichés, and aphorisms.p. 73. Norrick, Neal. 1985. How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs. de Gruyter. Analogous feature systems are also used throughout Natural Language Processing (NLP). For example, part-of-speech tagging divides words into categories. These include \\"major\\" categories such as Noun vs. Verb, but also other dimensions such as person and number, plurality, tense, and others. Some mnemonics for part-of-speech tags conjoin multiple features, such as \\"NN\\" for singular noun, vs. \\"NNS\\" for plural noun, vs. \\"NNS$\\" for plural possessive noun (see Brown Corpus). Others provide more explicit separation of features, even formalizing them via markup such as the Text Encoding Initiative's feature structures. Modern statistical NLP uses vectors of very many features, although many of those features are not formally \\"distinctive\\" in the sense described here.

One of Diemer’s hobbies was concocting recipes for chewing gum based on the original Fleer ingredients. Though founder Frank Fleer had come up with his own bubble gum recipe in 1906, it was shelved due to its being too sticky and breaking apart too easily. It would be another 20 years until Diemer would use the original idea as inspiration for his invention. History Fleer Chewing Gum Company, in Philadelphia, had been searching for years to produce a formula that allowed bubbles to be blown that did not stick. In 1928, while Walter Diemer was testing new gum recipes, he noticed that his product was less sticky than regular chewing gum, and after testing it he found that he could create bubbles easily. After a year of attempts, he made the first successful batch of bubble gum. But the next morning when trying to recreate his successful concoction, he failed to reproduce the same results. After four months of trying to mimic his first success, he finally made a 300-pound batch of what would become Dubble Bubble.Smithsonian. Jul90, Vol. 21 Issue 4, p. 74–83 “Since 1928 it’s been boom and bust with bubble gum” The only food coloring available at the factory was pink, so Diemer had no choice but to use it, and the color would go on to become the standard for gum for the world over. Using a salt water taffy wrapping machine, Diemer decided to individually wrap 100 pieces and brought the stock to a local candy store. The gum was priced at one penny apiece and sold out in one day. Before long, the Fleer Chewing Gum Company began making bubble gum using Diemer’s recipe, and the gum was marketed as “Dubble Bubble” gum. Diemer’s bubble gum was the first-ever commercially sold bubble gum, and its sales surpassed 1.5 million dollars in the first year. To help sell the new bubble gum, Diemer himself taught salespeople how to blow bubbles so that they in turn could teach potential customers. The original gum featured a color comic strip, known as the Fleer Funnies, which was included with the gum. The featured characters, ‘Dub and Bub’, were introduced in 1930 but were replaced by the iconic Pud and his pals in 1950. Originally, Pud was much more rotund than the slimmed down version seen in the 1960s. The early comics were especially large and colorful. The comic also included Fleer Fortunes and Dubble Bubble Facts. The comics were sequentially numbered which made collecting them easy. They are not dated though, so it is difficult to know the exact year of release. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Fleer Funnies shrank to the small size most people remember. More than 1,002 comics have been released over the years. During World War II, Dubble Bubble was distributed to the military. Sugar and latex became scarce due to the war and bubble gum manufacturing was halted in 1942. In 1951, Fleer resumed manufacturing of Dubble Bubble and the popularity of its gum grew steadily. Over time, Fleer extended its reach by adding new flavors and new formats like ball gum and expanded distribution of its products overseas. In 1957, Fleer introduced the first gum 6-pack with Dubble Bubble. In 1998, Dubble Bubble was purchased by Concord Confections and in 1999 they introduced Dubble Bubble as a gumball. In 2003, Tootsie Roll Industries acquired Concord. Since Concord's acquisition, Dubble Bubble has since used a different recipe and also discontinued the comic strips and fortunes on the wrappers, but continued to use Pud as its mascot. Ingredients The main ingredients in Dubble Bubble gum are Sugar, Dextrose, Corn Syrup, Gum Base, Tapioca Dextrin, Titanium Dioxide, Confectioner's Glaze, Carnauba Wax, Corn Starch, Artificial Flavors, Artificial Colors, (FD&C; Red 40, Blue 1, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 3), and BHT (to maintain freshness).

Amshinov is a branch of Warka Hasidism, which in part is a branch of Peshischa Hasidism, as Israel Yitzhak Kalish was a leading disciple of Simcha Bunim of Peshischa (1765-1827).  History  The first Amshinover Rebbe, Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Kalish, was a son of Rabbi Israel Yitzhak Kalish (Yitzchok of Vurka), the (first) Vurker Rebbe. Rabbi Yitzchok of Warka () was a disciple of Grand Rabbi Dovid Biderman of Lelov (1746–1814), who was a disciple of the Seer of Lublin, who was a disciple of Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk, who was a disciple of Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch (the Maggid), the senior disciple of Rabbi Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov), the founder of Hasidism. After the death of Rabbi Dovid Biderman of Lelov, Rabbi Yitzchok became a disciple of Rabbi Simcha Bunim of Peshischa. Rabbi Yaakov Dovid died in 1878 (ד' כסלו תרל\\"ח) and was succeeded as Amshinover Rebbe by one of his sons, Menachem Kalish. When Rabbi Menachem died in 1917 (ט\\"ז כסלו תרע\\"ח), his son, Rabbi Yosef, became the Rebbe in Amshinov, and the other son, Rabbi Shimon Sholom, became rebbe in Otwock ( Otvotsk). Rabbi Shimon was a major driving force behind the exodus of thousands of young men in Kletzk, Radin, Novhardok, and other yeshivas via Japan to Shanghai at the outbreak of World War II. By the time Shanghai came under Japanese control, it held 26,000 Jews. Rabbi Yerachmiel Yehuda Myer Kalish (1901–1976) of Amshinov, a son of Rabbi Shimon Sholom, was born in Przysucha ( Pshiskhe), Poland. He studied Torah with his grandfather, Rabbi Menachem of Amshinov. After the war, Rabbi Shimon moved to the United States. Upon his death in 1954 (י\\"ט אב תשי\\"ד), Rabbi Myer accompanied Rabbi Shimon's body to Tiberias in Israel, and remained there. Rabbi Myer later moved to Tel Aviv, and then to the Bayit Vegan neighbourhood of Jerusalem. Rabbi Myer was noted for his greatness in Torah scholarship, as well as his warmth and sensitivity to all.  Present rebbes  = Jerusalem = Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Yeshia Milikowsky was born in the United States. He is the present Amshinover Rebbe in the Bayit Vegan section of Jerusalem. He is the grandson and successor of Rabbi Yerachmiel Yehudah Meir Kalish of Amshinov, son of Rabbi Chaim and Rebbetzin Chayah Nechamah Milikowsky, daughter of Rabbi Yerachmiel Yehudah Meir Kalish. He prays for hours on end, meditating on every word, as a result of which he ends the Sabbath very late. Once an adam gadol, a very learned man, discussed the Halachic implications of the Rebbe's zmanim with the late Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. Reb Shlomo Zalman referred to the Rebbe as a \\"Pillar of Fire\\" and advised his questioner that one who touches fire will be burnt. The Rebbe is also the mentor of the famous Hasidic preacher, R. Tzvi Maier Zilberberg who considers himself an Amshinov chassid. The renowned rabbi, Reb Yitzchok \\"Itche\\" Meyer Morgenstern, the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Toras Chochom considers the Amshinov Rebbe the \\"Tzadik HaDor.\\" The Amshinover Rebbe is widely known within the Haredi world, and is regarded within Hassidic circles for his exceptional Ahavas Yisroel, love of every Jew; In the present generation the Rebbe himself is considered a \\"pillar of tefillah\\" and davens for hours on end. In 2015 the rebbe founded a new organization called Tzedaka V'chesed Amshinov as a charity in memory of Rebbe Meir Ba'al HaNes. The Rebbe is also known for his outstanding advice in medical matters. HaRav Meier Bransdorfer, z\\"l advised the Rebbeim of \\"A Time\\" to consult with the Amshinov Rebbe – \\"a eish gadol meod\\" regarding complicated medical shailas. His advice is sought after on very delicate matters worldwide. = New York = Rabbi Yosef Kalish II was the previous Amshinover Rebbe in the Boro Park section of Brooklyn, New York City. He was the son of Rabbi Yitzchak Kalish of Amshinov, who was the son of Rabbi Yosef Kalish of Amshinov, the brother of Rabbi Shimon Shalom Kalish of Amshinov.

It claims to be the only humour weekly in Canada.Golden Words - Canada's Other National Newspaper The paper was founded by the Engineering Society in 1967http://qnc.queensu.ca/Encyclopedia/Queen_s_Encyclopedia_G/queen_s_encyclopedia_g.html#GoldenWords to give the Engineering Society a voice on campus. Its very first cartoon contained an Engineer reading a copy of the Queen's Journal, thinking to himself \\"Oh, what crap is this?\\". It has been published more or less continuously since inception, appearing every Wednesday for most of the Fall and Winter terms, unless the editors have tricked the readers into believing it had been shut down (as was the case in November 1985). Recent volumes have run 25 issues. Along with the Queen's Journal, it is one of the two main student-run publications on campus, and claims a circulation of roughly 4,000 copies. The paper's humour style reflects its motto: \\"Sola Veritas Est Qui Facit Ut Me in Merda\\", which translates to \\"Only The Truth Gets Me In Shit\\". Its printed humour is diverse, running the gamut from absurdist sketches and short stories to political satire and commentary on current events. Practical jokes have also figured prominently in its history, and are typically revealed in subsequent issues. Published parodies have included Queen's Journal (often appearing more than 24 hours early to coincide with the Journal's publication day), the Queen's Gazette (for faculty and staff), the Kingston Whig-Standard, and a national newspaper, The Globe and Mail. (When parodied in the 1980s, The Globe and Mail itself reported that the engineers had actually inserted the ersatz versions into the coin boxes in the Globe's own lobby.) In September 1989, the masthead staff stole the Greasepole (an engineering icon) from the first year students charged with protecting it - and ransomed it back to them for 100 cases of beer. The paper maintains a friendly rivalry with the Journal. Although Golden Words is owned by the Engineering Society, the paper attracts contributors (writers, artists, and editorial staff) from across the undergraduate population. Notable Golden Words alumni include humourist Jay Pinkerton, game designer Erin Robinson, screenwriter Elan Mastai, and 1000 Awesome Things author Neil Pasricha. Robertson Davies serially published the first few chapters of his work The Manticore in the Golden Words, with the mythical title character originally a Mexican hairless cat who could read German.

History The city of Mississauga, where Lorne Park is now located, was once known as Toronto Township, and comprised several towns and villages. The first settlements began around 1800 and developed around factories, harbours, or other local businesses. The larger of these rural communities were Clarkson, Cooksville, Erindale, Meadowdale, Malton, Port Credit and Streetsville. Many smaller villages also sprung up near the larger towns. These include Barberton, Britannia, Burnhamthorpe, Derry West, Elmbank, Frogmore, Hanlan, Harris’ Corners, Hawkins’ Corners, Lisgar, Lorne Park, Mount Charles, Palestine, Pucky's Huddle, Sheridan and Summerville.The Lost Villages of Mississauga, Heritage Mississauga The villages prospered until the arrival of the railroads in the late 19th century. The rise of the Industrial age prompted rapid urban growth and a steady economic and population decline in many rural Ontario communities. By 1915 most of the villages, now referred to as the \\"lost villages\\" of Mississauga, disappeared. Except for a few cemeteries, little is left to record their existence. Lorne Park shares a common history with Clarkson. Before the arrival of the Europeans, all the land in Toronto Township belonged to the Mississauga Indians. The first white settler in the Clarkson-Lorne Park area was Thomas Ingersoll, who established the Government Inn and trading post on the Credit River in 1798.History of Clarkson – Lorne Park Area, LPSS Matters (Alumni Newsletter of the Lorne Park Secondary School). Volume 5, Issue 2. April 2005. On August 2, 1805, the Mississauga Indians were swindled out of the Mississauga Tract by the British Government, which ran from the Etobicoke Creek to Burlington Bay. The area included of shoreline and extended inland. Out of this land deal Toronto Township was established and many small communities quickly developed. Clarkson and the area that would become Lorne Park were founded along the shores of Lake Ontario. In 1820, a log road was built from the mouth of the Credit River to the Humber River, followed shortly by a bridge that enabled travelers going from York to Hamilton to pass through Clarkson and attracted more settlers. By the 1830 logging was a major industry in Lorne Park. Most of the pine wood was exported to England and the United States. Over the early part of the 20th century Lorne Park grew into a unique community. In 1887, Joseph Thompson bought of land in Lorne Park which became known as Thompson's Wood, now called Jack Darling Park. Thompson's brother Ernest Seton lived there until the home was lost in foreclosure. Ernest left, changed his name to Ernest Thompson Seton and achieved fame as an author and artist. The Lorne Park Post Office opened in 1892 and George D. Perry was the village's first postmaster. James Alberton built the three-story Albertonia Hotel in 1899. In 1927, it was renamed the Lorne Park Lodge but burned down two years later in 1929. The Lorne Park Mission Hall was built in 1902. It featured an open porch and a bell tower on the roof. The first library was organized by sawmill owner Robert Taylor in 1903. The first library meeting was held in January, 1904, in the Lorne Park Mission Hall. Reverend H. Thompson officiated over the first Anglican services in 1906, also held at the Lorne Park Mission Hall. St. Paul's Anglican Church was built in 1914. The Lorne Park Baptist Church was founded Sunday, May 18, 1919, in the Lorne Park Mission, with Reverend J. Williamson presiding. At some point a \\"pleasure grounds,\\" was operated in Lorne Park by the Toronto Park Association, included separate parlours for men and women, bowling lanes and merry-go-rounds. Travel to the resort from Toronto was often by steamer. After a series of bankruptcies, the resort lands were sold to cottagers. With access of the QEW highway, suburbanization of the original lands and surrounding area ensued in the post WWII period. (Brown, 1997 _Toronto's Lost Villages_ ) For the next half century, Lorne Park remained a small burg, until 1968 when it, along with several other villages, was amalgamated to form the town of Mississauga. Six years later, Mississauga was incorporated and now is Canada's 6th largest city. Even though Lorne Park was absorbed into Mississauga, it remained a distinct neighborhood that retains ties to its pioneer origins. Lorne Park Estates Lorne Park Estates is a community, south of Lorne Park, located within the City of Mississauga. It is bordered by Lake Ontario on the south, Lakeshore Road on the north, Jack Darling Park on the west and Richard's Memorial Park on the East. Lorne park, is the closest commercial service area for residents of Lorne Park Estates. LPEA Homeowners are responsible for municipal taxes and upkeep of the LPEA lands, and are also co-operatively responsible for the maintenance, insurance and taxes on their reserve; including their roads, forests, walking trails, a cottage, a private park and amenities area (the 'Commons') and their of private beaches with riparian rights. There are only 2 roads into Lorne Park Estates and they are clearly marked as \\"private\\" as they are dually privately maintained and privately owned by the Lorne Park Estates Association. These private roads are for the exclusive use of only the residents within the estates, and their invited guests. These privately maintained roads in the community are narrow, uncurbed and with no sidewalks as this is the common preference of their exclusive community. Lorne Park Estates History The Lorne Park is commonly thought to be named after John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, better known by the courtesy title Marquess of Lorne.and former governor general of Canada Clarkson Book - Part 4 (1951–2002), City of Mississauga However, this is conjecture, as the park was already titled Lorne before he became Governor General, the aetiology of the name Lorne remains a cryptic enigma. The Marquis also was not in attendance at the opening of the park in 1879:Montreal Museum of Fine Arts The Marquis was in Montreal officiating an investiture ceremony knighting members into the Queen's privy counsel commissioning the official opening of the Beaux Arts Museum that Victoria Day weekend in 1879. Historically the community, and the parklands have seen many changes. The land, first occupied by the Mississaugas, was transferred with larger land portion through Treaty No. 13 to Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1805. The land, which housed a significant stand of pines, was slated to be used for its wood as resources for the British Empire. However, this was not required and the land remained intact and became a subject of interest. First by individuals of the British military who wished to settle, and then by sundry businessmen and investors. Its legal ownership started 1832, ultimately resulting in the owners admirably taking charge of their community. Currently, Lorne Park Estate owners have Canada Postal Service, garbage and water service alliance with the City of Mississauga, homes were electrically heated still into the 1980s, when a gas line deal was brokered with Union Gas. Roads, parks and sewage are handled by the Lorne Park Estates Association and the individual homeowners within the estates. In a survey of 1888 the \\"Toronto and Lorne Park Summer Resort Company\\" assumed cottage lots, a hotel, wharf, walking trails and common grounds from the formerly named Toronto Park Association. The hotel in the amusement park at that time was called the Lorne Park Hotel. The newly revamped community was orchestrated and drawn by Edmund Burke, (a park resident) of Langley and Burke architects, including many of the original cottages and a Burke designed renovation to the existing Hotel. The investors renamed the Hotel Lorne as \\"the Hotel Louise\\" at that point, it is commonly thought this was to capitalize on the popularity of the Marquis of Lorne and the dual coincidence of the existing park name \\"Lorne\\" which dates back to 1860, but Louise was the name of the premier investor James Boustead's mother, also his daughter Mary Louise Boustead Clarke. The park was officially re-opened in May 1889 ( the Marquis of Lorne had been departed from Canada in 1883 at this point and he was no longer governor General) . Trains, carriage and steamers left Toronto on a regular basis to ferry visitors to the wharf, picnic areas, dining pavilion and eating establishment. Most of the names of the original investors are reflected in the street names Roper, Stockwell, and Henderson, however, the streets proposed at that time did not all survive as entertained, the Toronto and Lorne Park summer Resort Company did not thrive past 1903, when the wharf collapsed and 3 bystanders were splashed by Lake Ontarios frigid waters. Without a wharf for steamers to ferry people to Lorne Park, the enterprise floundered, and it became an exclusively owned private summer retreat for the wealthy temperate Toronto elite who owned it. The end of the wharf was a mixed blessing for the community as its temperate residents became increasingly annoyed by members of the greater community, who routinely only wished to use the wharf for transportation into the city of York (Toronto), rather than patronise the dry Lorne Park amenities as their choice of recreational destination. The hotel and common lands were purchased by investors keen to re-invent the park as a motor club: and the hotel was renamed the Lakeshore Country club, which failed, because an attempt to procure a liquor license was thwarted by the resident homeowner shareholders within the park, and the LCC was foreclosed upon by the Farmers Bank in 1911. In 1914 Toronto investor developer Sydney Small purchased the common lands and hotel for the amount of $46,000 with plans to develop the forest into a subdivision. Development was thwarted by the residents with a Supreme Court of Canada ruling. This coincided with the WW1 real estate market downturn and actually was a fortuitous turn of events for Mr Small who was saved further losses by his non-development as houses did not start selling again until after World War II. In 1919, prominent resident Mary Louise Boustead Clarke charitably purchased the lands and Hotel for $20,000 to prevent further outsiders from developing the parklands and ultimately her estate bequeathed the lands to the Lorne Park Estates Association in 1948. The hotel was irreparably damaged by fire in 1920. The survey of 1922, shows slight changes to the lot configuration under the auspices of Lorne Park Estates Limited. Few of the lots were bought with the intention of building small cottages. According to \\"A Village Within a City - a Story of Lorne Park Estates\\" (1980), some people were purchasing two to four lots in order to create larger properties of up to . However, the forests, walking paths, Commons area and beach area continued to be collectively owned and managed. Orient Avenue and North Crescent became referred to by locals as Orient Marsh as they are still undeveloped. Lugsdin Avenue became referred to as Lugsdin Creek. Campbell, McIntyre, Neville, Venn, Hill Dale and Moore avenues have to date not been developed but most notably Boustead Terrace, the grand lakefront promenade feature of the Victorian era park, has disappeared through the erosive effects of the lake and parkland mismanagement. Sections of Boustead Terrace still remain today but it is currently impassable as a road. Of the summer homes that were initially built, a number were designed by Edmund Burke in the English Arts and Crafts style as two-stories with deep verandas and sleeping balconies to catch the breeze of Lake Ontario.  Transportation  The main roads in Lorne Park are Lakeshore Road, Lorne Park Road, Truscott Drive, and Indian Road. The main bus routes are 23 Lakeshore and 14 Lorne Park, operated by Mississauga Transit.  Education  The two-story, four-room Lorne Park Public School opened in 1923, with 76 students enrolled. Throughout the 1930s the school was a centre of community activity, hosting concerts, Christmas festivities, dinners and village events. The original school was destroyed by fire on January 22, 1982 and was rebuilt. and will celebrate its 90th anniversary in 2013. It serves students grades 1 through 5.

She is part of the BC Ferries fleet. History Queen of Alberni was built by Vancouver Shipyards Co. Ltd. in North Vancouver, British Columbia in 1976. She joined the other two ferries, Queen of Coquitlam and Queen of Cowichan, that were also built in that year, with the other two C-class ferries, Queen of Surrey and Queen of Oak Bay, joining later. Queen of Alberni was different from the others, as she only had one car deck designed to carry overheight vehicles. Her lack of an upper car deck put its capacity at 145 overheight vehicles. The ferry's high truck capacity made her a natural for the service's Tsawwassen-Duke Point route (established in 1990 as the Mid- Island Express, running between Tsawwassen and Departure Bay; and later between Tsawwassen and Duke Point), which is intended for a high volume of overheight vehicles. This route is also served by , a . In 1984, the ship was stretched and lifted, gaining an upper car deck for non-overheight vehicles, leading to a new vehicle capacity of 292. In 1999, the ship underwent another refit in Victoria. The ship has a different system of ship evacuation since it carries fewer passengers. All of the lifejackets are stored in large containers scattered throughout the two passenger decks. The ship has three evacuation stations on each side of the top passenger deck, or sun deck. The combined capacity of these six stations is 1,200. In 2007, Queen of Alberni completed a 40 million dollar mid-life upgrade which will prepare the 31-year- old vessel for another 20 years of service. Accidents The life of Queen of Alberni has seen quite a few mishaps. Only three years after her launch in 1976, the vessel ran aground in Active Pass. Many cars and trucks were damaged when the ship tilted over, and some flipped over completely. There were no major injuries, and the only casualty was a racehorse that was being transported. Misfortune struck again in 1989 when ship smashed into the dock at the Departure Bay terminal in Nanaimo. Six people were injured. Another accident would come on March 12, 1992. At around 8:00am Queen of Alberni left the Tsawwassen terminal with heavy fog and almost zero visibility. The Japanese bulk carrier Shinwa Maru left the Westshore Terminal No. 1 at nearby Roberts Bank, British Columbia at 7:40am. At 8:06am the two ships made contact after seeing each other on radar to arrange a safe passage. At 8:08am the two vessels collided. Queen of Alberni hit Shinwa Maru about aft of the bow, above the waterline, and at a 70-degree angle. Two people aboard Queen of Alberni were seriously injured, while none aboard Shinwa Maru were injured. Queen of Alberni had minor damage to the hull and some of the cafeteria equipment was displaced. Shinwa Maru, however, was damaged when the ferry penetrated the #1 cargo hold and ballast tanks. On December 15, 2001 Queen of Alberni got caught in a heavy wind storm which turned a regular 2-hour crossing into a -hour ordeal.

Kanziga is part of a Hutu lineage that long ruled an independent principality until the late nineteenth century. She was arrested by French authorities on 2 March 2010 in France following the French President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to Rwanda. She was frequently regarded as one of the powers behind the throne during her husband's 20-year presidency, and her family connections to powerful Hutu politicians are often regarded as having provided necessary political capital for Habyarimana. She was the centre of a powerful clique of northern Hutus called le clan de madame or akazu (Kinyarwanda for \\"little house\\"), an informal organization of Hutu extremists whose members contributed strongly to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. On 9 April 1994, immediately following Habyarimana's assassination and the beginning of the Rwandan genocide, she was airlifted out of Rwanda by French troops and arrived in Paris 8 days later. In this exodus she was accompanied by thirty other members of the akazu, including Ferdinand Nahimana, director of Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines. Upon arrival in Paris, she received a gift of F 230,000 from the French government, from a budget allocated for \\"urgent assistance for Rwandan refugees\\". In September 1997, she moved to Libreville, Gabon, at the invitation of Omar Bongo, and then Gbadolite in Zaire. Fearing the threat of the RPF, she went back to Zaire in late 1995 and later settled in Gabon, where she was granted a diplomatic passport under a false name. In response to threats by the RPF, she left Libreville and smuggled into France where she resides illegally. Agathe Habyarimana is the sister of Protais Zigiranyirazo. She was denied political asylum in France on 4 January 2007 where she filed in January 2004, but remained in France. She was arrested on Tuesday, 2 March 2010, following French President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to Rwanda where he admitted to mistakes made by France over the genocide, further stating that France would seek out those responsible for the genocide who were living in France. In September 2011, a French court denied Rwanda extradition of Habyarimana. A civil suit, perhaps thus weakened, remains.

A glacial stream on the Mismi was firmly identified as the most distant source of the Amazon River in 1996;Source of the Amazon River Identified (Jacek Palkiewicz) this finding was confirmed in 2001 and again in 2007.

It is a tributary of the Ucayali which later joins the Marañón to form the Amazon proper. Location The Amazon originates from a cliff at Mismi, with a sole sign of a wooden cross. Mismi is about 160 km west of Lake Titicaca and 700 km southeast of Peru's capital city, Lima, in the Arequipa Region. It is one of the highest points of Colca Canyon. There are several glaciers on the peak. The Cousteau Amazon Expedition In 1982 Jean-Michel Cousteau led a large scale scientific exploration of the Amazon from its mouth to its origin. The \\"Cousteau Amazon Expedition\\"One Cold Day cost eleven million dollars and culminated in a six-hour television documentary titled \\"Cousteau's Amazon\\" released in 1983. It offered study information to last years and gave insights into the biology and geology of the largest river system on earth. This expedition was broken into three separate groups and the upper Amazon section was covered by \\"The Flying Expedition\\" tasked with exploring the upper third to Arequipa from the river's origin. Traditionally, explorers and geographers define the origin of a river system by tracking the longest tributaries while heading upstream, as volume can change dramatically from month to month. In a system as complex as the Amazon basin with dozen of streams as candidates in previously poorly mapped areas, no consensus could plausibly be substantiated for some time, and the origin was left to speculation. Half a dozen sites claimed title to \\"The Origin of the Amazon\\" and until 1982 several were in the running. But in 1971 Loren McIntyre discovered the true source of the Amazon before anyone else. This has since been confirmed by satellite.http://www.peruviantimes.com/15/satellite-images-confirm-true- source-of-the-amazon/13676/ Using an international team of twelve and bringing in expeditionary specialists from Germany, France, Argentina, Peru and the US, Jean-Michel Cousteau put together resources and logistics spanning a thousand miles of unknown jungle. The Upper Amazon expedition (The Flying Expedition) included an Eastern European multi-axled articulated Land Rover for use on land, a float plane Papagaiu, for air support and reconnaissance, and the Peruvian Air Force offered a high elevation helicopter to reach the upper levels of the Chila mountain range in Peru. Expedition support bases were established in Cuzco, in the mountains, in Arequipa, and high in the Chilca mountain range at Caylloma for the quest to find the origin of the Amazon. Many locations were remote, making it necessary to surmount language, terrain and logistical difficulties, as the mountain team made their way up the Selinque River to the flanks of the Mismi. At this mountain's base, Cousteau dispatched a team of German alpinists who climbed the 18,000 foot volcano and returned in two days. During their descent, they found melt water dropping into a fissure. This cleft varied from two meters to half a meter wide, angling down the slope. This stream flowed nearly fifty meters before disappearing, emerging again lower downstream to flow between stones and continue its course. They discovered that within the fissure, the water was deep enough to float a small craft, and realized that they were presented with an opportunity. Utilizing pack llamas, kayaker Caril Ridley was brought to the site, and in June 1982, navigating by kayak, became the first person to run the origins of the Amazon. Later expeditions refined the understanding of the river's many origins and its subsequent course to the Atlantic Ocean. National Geographic Society Expedition In 2001, it was verified that the main headwater of the Amazon River has its glacial source on the Mismi. An expedition of the National Geographic Society discovered that the Qarwasanta stream flowing into Apurímac River originates on the northern slopes of the mountain and then runs its course through other tributaries and rivers to help form the main Amazon River. Brazilian scientists in 2007 confirmed that the headwaters of Apurímac River are the source of the Amazon River and pointed to Mismi as the most probable source of the Amazon.

Objects are chiral when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are chiral. In biology, 19 of the 20 natural amino acids are homochiral, being L-chiral (left-handed), while sugars are D-chiral (right-handed). Homochirality can also refer to enantiopure substances in which all the constituents are the same enantiomer (a right- handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term. It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose; however, it appears to be a form of information storage. One suggestion is that it reduces entropy barriers in the formation of large organized molecules. It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from an enantiopure samples of the amino acid than from racemic (enantiomerically mixed) ones. It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed. Some of these models propose three distinct steps: mirror- symmetry breaking creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, chiral amplification builds on this imbalance, and chiral transmission is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another. In biology Amino acids are the building blocks of peptides and enzymes while sugar- peptide chains are the backbone of RNA and DNA. In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (L-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars). Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including hormones, toxins, fragrances and food flavors. Glycine is achiral, as are some other non-proteinogenic amino acids are either achiral (such as dimethylglycine) or of the D enantiomeric form. Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. Carvone, a terpenoid found in essential oils, smells like mint in its L-form and caraway in its R-form. Limonene tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed. Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. Thalidomide, in its left- handed form, cures morning sickness; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects. Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient. Many drugs are available as both a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both chiralities) and an enantiopure drug (only one chirality). Depending on the manufacturing process, enantiopure forms can be more expensive to produce than stereochemical mixtures. Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species. In the edible snail Helix pomatia, only one out of 20,000 is left-helical. The coiling of plants can have a preferred chirality and even the chewing motion of cows has a 10% excess in one direction. Origins =Symmetry breaking= Theories for the origin of homochirality in the molecules of life can be classified as deterministic or based on chance depending on their proposed mechanism. If there is a relationship between cause and effect - that is a specific chiral field or influence causing the mirror symmetry breaking -, the theory is classified as deterministic; otherwise it is classified as a theory based on chance (in the sense of randomness) mechanisms.Guijarro, A. and Yus, M. The Origin of Chirality in the Molecules of Life (RSC Publishing, Cambridge, 2009), 1st ed. Another classification for the different theories of the origin of biological homochirality could be made depending on whether life emerged before the enantiodiscrimination step (biotic theories) or afterwards (abiotic theories). Biotic theories claim that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices. If this was the case, remains of the extinct chirality sign should be found. Since this is not the case, nowadays biotic theories are no longer supported. The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has also been associated with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.  Deterministic theories  Deterministic theories can be divided into two subgroups: if the initial chiral influence took place in a specific space or time location (averaging zero over large enough areas of observation or periods of time), the theory is classified as local deterministic; if the chiral influence is permanent at the time the chiral selection occurred, then it is classified as universal deterministic. The classification groups for local determinist theories and theories based on chance mechanisms can overlap. Even if an external chiral influence produced the initial chiral imbalance in a deterministic way, the outcome sign could be random since the external chiral influence has its enantiomeric counterpart elsewhere. In deterministic theories, the enantiomeric imbalance is created due to an external chiral field or influence, and the ultimate sign imprinted in biomolecules will be due to it. Deterministic mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction (via cosmic rays) or asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation, β-Radiolysis or the magnetochiral effect. The most accepted universal deterministic theory is the electroweak interaction. Once established, chirality would be selected for. One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the Murchison meteorite supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of circularly polarized light originating from Mie scattering on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an enantiomeric excess within chiral material in space. Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion. Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see Parity violation) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules.  Chance theories  Chance theories are based on the assumption that \\"Absolute asymmetric synthesis, i.e., the formation of enantiomerically enriched products from achiral precursors without the intervention of chiral chemical reagents or catalysts, is in practice unavoidable on statistical grounds alone\\". Consider the racemic state as a macroscopic property described by a binomial distribution; the experiment of tossing a coin, where the two possible outcomes are the two enantiomers is a good analogy. The discrete probability distribution P_p(n, N) of obtaining n successes out of N Bernoulli trials, where the result of each Bernoulli trial occurs with probability p and the opposite occurs with probability q=(1-p) is given by: P_p(n, N)=\\\\binom{N}{n}p^n(1-p)^{N-n} . The discrete probability distribution P(N/2, N) of having exactly N/2 molecules of one chirality and N/2 of the other, is given by: P_{1/2}(N/2, N)=\\\\binom{N}{N/2}\\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right )^{N/2} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right )^{N/2}\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi N}} . As in the experiment of tossing a coin, in this case, we assume both events (L or D ) to be equiprobable, p = q = 1/2 . The probability of having exactly the same amount of both enantiomers is inversely proportional to the total number of molecules N . For one mol of a racemic compound, N = N_A \\\\approx 6.022 \\\\cdot 10^{23} molecules, this probability becomes P_{1/2}(N_A/2, N_A) \\\\approx 10^{-12} . The probability of finding the racemic state is so small that we can consider it negligible. In this scenario, there is a need to amplify the initial stochastic enantiomeric excess through any efficient mechanism of amplification. The most likely path for this amplification step is by asymmetric autocatalysis. An autocatalytic chemical reaction is that in which the reaction product is itself a reactive, in other words, a chemical reaction is autocatalytic if the reaction product is itself the catalyst of the reaction. In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other. =Amplification= Theory Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in L-D plane (except L = D line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states In 1953, Charles Frank proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of autocatalysis.Note that on his original paper, Frank did not propose any set of chemical reactions but a set of dynamical equations, where the concentrations of both enantiomers were denoted as [n1] and [n2] respectively. In his model the L and D enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A :\\\\begin{align} A + L \\\\xrightarrow{k_a} 2L,\\\\\\\\\\\\ A + D \\\\xrightarrow{k_a} 2D, \\\\end{align} while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called mutual antagonism \\\\begin{align} L + D \\\\xrightarrow{k_d} \\\\varnothing.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the law of mass action: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d[\\\\ce L]}{dt} &= k_a [\\\\ce A] [\\\\ce L] - k_d \\\\ce{[L] [D]}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{d[\\\\ce D]}{dt} &= k_a [\\\\ce A] [\\\\ce D] - k_d \\\\ce{[L] [D]}, \\\\end{align} where k_a is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, k_d is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess \\\\Phi as :\\\\Phi = \\\\frac{[\\\\ce D] - [\\\\ce L]}{[\\\\ce D] + [\\\\ce L]}, we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using chain rule from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres L and D. : \\\\frac{d\\\\Phi}{dt} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{2k_d \\\\ce{[L] [D]}}{[\\\\ce D] + [\\\\ce L]}\\\\right)\\\\Phi. Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state \\\\Phi = 0 is unstable. Starting from almost everywhere in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state. It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry- breaking is different. Experiments There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is autocatalytic. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an enantioselective catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer. The initial presence of just 0.2 equivalent one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% enantiomeric excess of the product. 500px Another study concerns the proline catalyzed aminoxylation of propionaldehyde by nitrosobenzene. In this system, a small enantiomeric excess of catalyst leads to a large enantiomeric excess of product. 500px Serine octamer clusters are also contenders. These clusters of 8 serine molecules appear in mass spectrometry with an unusual homochiral preference, however there is no evidence that such clusters exist under non-ionizing conditions and amino acid phase behavior is far more prebiotically relevant. The recent observation that partial sublimation of a 10% enantioenriched sample of leucine results in up to 82% enrichment in the sublimate shows that enantioenrichment of amino acids could occur in space. Partial sublimation processes can take place on the surface of meteors where large variations in temperature exist. This finding may have consequences for the development of the Mars Organic Detector scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique. A high asymmetric amplification of the enantiomeric excess of sugars are also present in the amino acid catalyzed asymmetric formation of carbohydrates One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory. When sodium chlorate is allowed to crystallize from water and the collected crystals examined in a polarimeter, each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the L form or the D form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of L crystals collected equals the amount of D crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively L or exclusively D. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver D-crystals and 18 others L-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to autocatalysis taking place in the nucleation process. In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic amino acid derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution (compare with dynamic kinetic resolution). =Transmission= Once a significant enantiomeric enrichment has been produced in a system, the transference of chirality through the entire system is customary. This last step is known as the chiral transmission step. Many strategies in asymmetric synthesis are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so- called organocatalysis of organic reactions by proline for example in Mannich reactions. Some proposed models for the transmission of chiral asymmetry are polymerization, epimerization or copolymerization. Optical resolution in racemic amino acids There exists no theory elucidating correlations among L-amino acids. If one takes, for example, alanine, which has a small methyl group, and phenylalanine, which has a larger benzyl group, a simple question is in what aspect, L-alanine resembles L-phenylalanine more than D-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all L-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was L and phenylalanine was D. It was reported in 2004 that excess racemic D,L-asparagine (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser), valine (Val), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp). The enantiomeric excess of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 D,L-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess D,L-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized. It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in L\\\\- or D-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule. This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences. History of term This term was introduced by Kelvin in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecules are homochiral if they have the same chirality. Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as enantiomerically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),However, the message can be confusing. In , the entry for Enantiomerically Pure/Enantiopure says \\"Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged\\"; but the entry for Homochiral says \\"See enantiomerically pure/enantiopure.\\" its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single optical isomer in a pair of isomers in these journals.

Gorebridge's local football team is juniors Arniston Rangers who were founded in 1878 and play home games at Newbyres Park. A notable player who resides in Gorebridge is Ryan Frankitti. Annette Crosbie, known to many as the long suffering wife of Victor Meldrew, played by fellow Scot Richard Wilson in the BBC comedy series One Foot in the Grave, is a former resident of Gorebridge. The Reverend David Arnott, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2011–12, was minister at Gorebridge Parish Church in the 1970s. On 6 September 2015 Gorebridge saw the return of the Waverley Line with a new station built on the site of the original station. This gives rail access to the Borders and Edinburgh Waverley railway station. In the Gore Glen there is a shallow cave, named \\"The King's Cave\\". According to legend a thief used to steal cattle and hide in this nearby cave. It is not, as some think, named after Robert the Bruce, who was said to have hidden here after defeat at the hands of the English. There are 29 listed buildings in Gorebridge including one Category B building (Harvieston Lodge), and two Category C buildings (Gorebridge old station and the Post Office). On 30th August 2020, police broke up a party of 300 people at the Mansion house of Kirkhill in Gorebridge and issued a fine to the organiser. Scottish Government rules during the coronavirus pandemic at the time were for a maximum of eight people from three households to meet inside at one time.  History  The village got its name from the bridge across the River Gore, a tributary of the South Esk. It was the home of Stobsmill, Scotland's first gunpowder mill, at the Gore Water, that started operating in 1794 and closed in 1875. In the 1860s century a coal mine called Emily Pit was opened, the village grew as miners came and a railway was built to take the coal from the mine. The Emily Pit and Gore Pit (another coal mine) were together renamed the Arniston Colliery which closed in 1962. The railway line was closed in 1969 and reopened in 2015.

It is named after the nearby Main river. The building is when its antenna spire is included. The tower has five underground floors and two public viewing platforms. It is the only skyscraper in Frankfurt with a public viewing observatory. It is the 4th tallest building in Frankfurt and the 4th tallest in Germany, tied with Tower 185. The foyer of the building has two art pieces accessible to the public: the video installation by Bill Viola \\"The World of Appearances\\" and the wall mosaic by Stephan Huber \\"Frankfurter Treppe / XX. Jahrhundert\\" ( \\"Frankfurt's Steps/20th century\\"). The tower's design features what appears to be two connected towers. The smaller of the two is of a cuboid shape and a design common to 1970s architecture. The second and taller of the two towers is a circular tower with an entire blue glass exterior which features the transmission tower on top. History The structure was built between 1996 and 1999, and serves as headquarters for Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen (Helaba). Other tenants are the German Offices of Merrill Lynch and Standard & Poor's and a television studio of the Hessischer Rundfunk. Prominent US law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton are also residents of the Main Tower. The first tenants moved in on 5 November 1999, and the official inauguration was 28 January 2000. During weather reports by the television station, the weather reporter stands on the top of the building. In June 2015 NorthStar Realty Finance of New York entered into an agreement to acquire Main Tower for about €540 million ($606 million).

Because it has been produced in Cologne since at least 1799, it is allowed to use the geographical indication Original Eau de Cologne. The brand has been expanded to various other perfumes and products besides the original Echt Kölnisch Wasser, which has used the same formula for more than 200 years. The original 4711 store at Glockengasse 4 in Cologne is a popular tourist attraction.  History  An original 4711 bottle from 1885 Today's flacon: the so-called \\"Molanus bottle\\" In the early 18th century, Johann Maria Farina (1685–1766), an Italian living in Cologne, Germany, created a fragrance. He named it Eau de Cologne (\\"water from Cologne\\") after his new home. Over the next century, the fragrance became increasingly popular. According to legend, on 8 October 1792, a Carthusian monk made a wedding gift for the merchant Wilhelm Mülhens (1762-1841): the secret recipe of a so-called \\"aqua mirabilis\\", a \\"miracle water\\" for internal and external use. Mülhens then founded a small factory at Cologne's \\"Glockengasse\\" and established the first \\"Eau de Cologne\\" as a remedy. Peter Joseph Mülhens and his son Wilhelm Mülhens had been in a dispute over the use of the name \\"Farina\\" from 1800 to 1881. The Farina family accused Mülhens of using the name without authorization. The firm \\"Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz\\" feared confusion between the products because they also produced perfumes. In 1832, Wilhelm Mülhens lost the dispute, whereupon he employed another Mr. Farina from Mortara in order to continue using the name. The company name was Eau de Cologne & Parfümerie Fabrik Glockengasse No. 4711 gegenüber der Pferdepost von Ferd. Mülhens in Köln am Rhein until 1990, when it was renamed Mülhens GmbH & Co. KG. In 1994, the Mülhens family company was bought by Wella AG, Darmstadt, Germany. Since 1997, Wella has operated its cosmetic activities under the name Cosmopolitan Cosmetics GmbH, although the name Mülhens GmbH & Co. KG was still in use. In 2003, Wella AG was taken over by the American competitor Procter & Gamble. In summer 2006, Procter & Gamble announced it would sell the 4711 brand and three other former Mühlens brands, as part of an effort to divest \\"local\\" brands and to focus on global brands. The offer attracted several interested parties; in December 2006, P&G; announced that the brand had been sold to the perfume company Mäurer & Wirtz in Aachen, a subsidiary of the Dalli Group.  House number 4711  Glockengasse 4 in Cologne, the headquarters of 4711 Third address book of Cologne, 1797, page 179 On 3 October 1794, in view of the French troops standing just outside Cologne, the city council approved a plan proposed by the guard-committee to number all houses in the city without exception and to install what would be considered appropriate lighting for each location. Orders were given to install the lighting immediately, while the numbering was left to fate.HAStK, Bestand 10 (Ratsprotokolle) Nr. 241 Bl. 216v. On 6 October 1794, French troops occupied the city. On 7 October 1794, the city council decided that every local government official had to hand in an inventory of all citizens and non- citizens in his district within 48 hours. Furthermore, the guard-committee received authorisation to number the houses as previously agreed.HAStK, Bestand 10 (Ratsprotokolle) Nr. 241 Bl. 225v. On 20 October 1794, Senator Gottfried von Gall noted in his diary that the numbering and the written documentation of the houses which started eight days earlier was being continued.HAStK, Bestand 7030 (Chron. u. Darst.) Nr. 175, Bl. 71v. The printer Heinrich Josef Metternich (a council member) applied for permission to publish an address calendar. This calendar was supposed to include, amongst other things, the house numbers which had recently been assigned. He also sought permission to collect all the relevant details.HAStK, Bestand 350 (Franz. Verw.)

Adreßbuch: Gemeinnütziger Addresse-Kalender der Stadt Köllen, Cologne 1797, page 103 Wilhelm Mülhens was listed as the tenant of the house no sooner than in the third edition of the address book of Cologne; his occupation was listed as \\"in Speculationsgeschäften\\" (which translates to speculator). He is not yet listed under the manufacturers of Eau de Cologne in the mercantile directory.RWWA Abt.33, 3. Adreßbuch: Verzeichnis der Stadt-Kölnischen Einwohner, Cologne 1797, page 179. In 1811, the continuous house numbering was changed to a system of numbering streets separately, as is common today. In the preface to the 1813 French edition of the address book, the publisher Thiriart claimed that there had not been any house numbering before the arrival of the French in the city (\\"inconnu à Cologne avant l´arrivée des armées françaises au bord du Rhin\\") and that the order to number the houses had been given in 1795.RWWA Abt.33, Itinéraire de Cologne, 1813, page 12. In 1854, Peter Joseph Mülhens moved from Glockengasse 12 into a newly constructed commercial building with a neo-gothic facade at Glockengasse 26-28. Glockengasse 12, which had been assigned the number 4711 in 1794, remained vacant for a period of time and was torn down after it was sold.RWWA Abt.33 Kölner Adressbücher.Economic Archive of Rhine Westphalia, section 33, Cologne Street Indexes The depiction of a French military officer painting the house number 4711 on the facade of the house in the Glockengasse while sitting on his horse is a product of advertising.

Diemer (January 8, 1904 - January 8, 1998) was an American accountant who in 1928 invented bubble gum. Life Born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Diemer was working as an accountant at Fleer in 1926 when the company president sought to cut costs by making their own gum base. The company's founder, Frank Henry Fleer, had previously made a batch of bubble gum in 1906 which he called \\"Blibber Blubber\\", but it was too sticky and easily broke. Ultimately, the \\"Bubble Gum\\" used nowadays was eventually invented in 1996, in Wisconsin and has remained his greatest achievement. Although an accountant by trade, Diemer liked to experiment with gum recipes in his spare time. In doing so, he accidentally stumbled upon a unique recipe. The gum was pink because it was the only food coloring in the factory, which is the reason most bubble gum today is pink. Compared to standard chewing gum, the gum was less sticky, would not stick to the face, and yet stretched more easily. Diemer saw the possibilities, and using a salt water taffy wrapping machine, wrapped one hundred pieces of his creation to test market in a local mom-and-pop candy store. Priced at one penny a piece, the gum sold out in one day. Fleer began marketing the new gum as \\"Dubble Bubble\\" and Diemer himself taught salesmen how to blow bubbles as a selling point for the gum, helping them to demonstrate how Dubble Bubble differed from all other chewing gums. Sold at the price of one cent a piece, sales of Dubble Bubble surpassed US$1.5 million in the first year. However, Diemer did not patent his invention and competition soon arose as bubble gum became a popular and inexpensive treat during the Great Depression. According to his second wife, Florence, Walter Diemer never received royalties for his invention but he did not mind. She also said he oversaw construction of bubble gum plants in Philadelphia and Barcelona, Spain, and traveled around the world marketing the gum. He stayed with Fleer for decades, eventually reaching the position of senior vice president as well as a member of the Board of Directors of the Fleer Corporation. He retired in 1970, and remained on the board for 15 more years thereafter. Following the death of his first wife Adelaide in 1990, Diemer rode around his Pennsylvania retirement village in a big tricycle, distributing bubble gum to children. Diemer died of congestive heart failure in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on his 94th birthday.Goodnough, Abby (12 January 1998). \\"W.E.

The team began operation in 1922 as a founding member of the Eastern Shore League, which operated out of cities on the Delmarva Peninsula. The Indians did not field a particularly competitive team in the first year of its existence, but from 1923 through 1927 they finished second or third every year. Because of economic hard times, however, the league ceased operations before the 1928 season. 1937 season The Eastern Shore League was revived in 1936 with the original six teams and the addition of two more. Seven of the eight teams were affiliates of Major league teams. The Salisbury team was affiliated with the Washington Senators. Under the rules of play then in existence, teams in the Class D division of baseball, which included all of the teams in the Eastern Shore League, were only allowed to field three players who had ever played in a higher level league. In 1937, Eastern Shore League commissioner Colonel J. Thomas Kibler ruled that Salisbury was fielding four players with higher level experience because one of their players had signed with a Class C team, even though he had never played for them. Kibler ruled that Salisbury had to forfeit all of its games, meaning that, although they had a record of 21-5 at the time, they dropped to 0-26. The team appealed, first to William G. Bramham, president of the National Association, then to Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Commissioner of Baseball, but the ruling stood. The team decided that they would recuperate by being competitive on the field. They did so by finishing the season with 59 wins and 11 losses, and winning the league pennant. Counting the wins they had forfeited, Salisbury had a record of 80-16 for the season. Prior to the beginning of the Eastern Shore League playoffs, Salisbury played the Trenton team, which was the Senators' Class A team. The Indians won, 72–. They then went on to win the league playoffs. The Indians' manager, Jake Flowers, was named Minor League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News. The 1937 Indians were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. Later years In 1938, with many of the same players as the year before, Salisbury went 65-47 to repeat as champions. The Indians and the league continued in operation until 1941, when the league closed for the duration of World War II, then reformed from 1946 through 1949. The Indians won the league two more times, and won the regular season pennant but lost in the playoffs one time. In 1951, a reconstituted Salisbury Indians team joined the Class B Interstate League, but that team only existed for two years. Salisbury had no further minor league baseball participation until 1996, when the Delmarva Shorebirds joined the South Atlantic League.

Signature elements of the band's music were an abundance of uncommon time signatures; frantic and abrupt mood changes between soft jazz tones and blistering punk assault; nimble bass guitar work providing a counterpoint to the guitar attack; and often indecipherable lyrics delivered both in Spanish and in English. Some comparisons have been made to bands like Cardiacs (Turtle's 1994 album in fact has a song titled Cardiako) and NoMeansNo. Deep Turtle broke up in 1996 but reformed again in 2002, only to disband again in 2004 due to drummer Erjossaari's insurmountable difficulties with tinnitus, which forced him to quit the band. Deep Turtle made Finnish music history by being the first Finnish band to be invited to do a John Peel session in 1994. Contrary to public belief, Peel was not present at the studio, and he never managed to meet the band in person.

The plot centers on law and crime in a fictional underwater metropolis with the protagonist, Inspector Gill, trying to solve various crimes, often Mafia- related, while avoiding being seduced by the buxom Angel Jones. The comic featured several marine species as its characters, while the plots and dialogue were reminiscent of film noir. Original Fish Police stories were published from 1985 to 1991. Sam Kieth (The Maxx) inked \\"a single panel and drew a 'Next Issue' pin-up\\". Story The story centers Inspector Gill, a fish detective who, it is hinted at, had once been a human. He is met by a female fish named Angel, who tells him that her uncle has developed a drug called Hairballs. The uncle, Calamari, meets Gill and tells him that he will trade Hairballs for his niece.  Publication history  Fish Police started in 1985 as a self-published black-and-white title by Moncuse through his own Fishwrap Productions. After 11 issues, the title was picked up by Comico in 1987, which reprinted issues 1–4 in a trade titled Hairballs, followed by color reprints of the publication's remaining issues. Comico also printed a special prequel issue, and continued the series with number 12. After issue 17, Comico went bankrupt. Fish Police was then acquired by Apple Press,\\"Three Former Comico Titles Find New Homes\\", The Comics Journal 129 (May 1989), pp. 13-14: about Fish Police, Trollords and The Trouble with Girls; and The Maze Agency, which had not yet found a new publisher. The new series continued the numbering begun by Comico, but the comic reverted to black-and-white. Apple published the title until early 1991, when the run ended with number 26,. Apart from the main series, Apple Press printed a Issue 0 which featured an early draft of the stories seen in issues 1–5. In 1992–1993, Marvel Comics reprinted the first six issues again, again in color. Apple published a six- issue spin-off, Fish Shticks, written by Moncuse and drawn by Steve Hauk, between 1992 and 1993. This series was more gag-based than the original. In 2010, Moncuse began work on a new Fish Police title, set 20 years after the end of the original. IDW Publishing reprinted the first four Fishwrap issues in a trade in February 2011. A new story written and drawn by Moncuse, titled \\"F.P.B.C.\\", appeared in Dark Horse Presents issue 22, March 2013. = Issues = * Fish Police (Fishwrap Productions) — 12 issues (June 1985 - November 1987) * Fish Police Special (Comico) — 1 issue (July 1987) * Fish Police: Hairballs (Comico) Introduction by Harlan Ellison (October 1987) * Fish Police (Comico) — 14 issues (April 1988 – June 1989) * Fish Police (Apple Press) — 9 issues (August 1989 - Spring 1991) plus Issue 0 (1991) * Fish Police (Marvel Comics) — 6 issues (October 1992 – March 1993) Critical reception Slings and Arrows Comics Guide called the characters \\"pleasing\\" and the art a \\"clean, open style\\", but criticized the writing for being \\"like a glossy dramatisation of a blockbuster, specially designed not to be too upsetting or too taxing.\\" The same publication called Fish Shticks \\"fresh, funny, and wonderfully human.\\" Harlan Ellison describes it as a series that \\"turns to gibberish when one attempts to codify it\\", praising Moncuse's writing style. D. Aviva Rothschild, in Graphic Novels: A Bibiliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics, called it \\"all idea and little execution\\", saying that \\"there are too many characters and too many threads of plot\\", although she praised Moncuse's art. Animated series version Hanna-Barbera Productions adapted Fish Police into an animated television series that was first broadcast on CBS in 1992, lasting only six episodes over one season. The show was cancelled after only three episodes; the remaining three episodes have never been shown in the US. Fish Police had a decidedly more mature tone than most other animated Hanna-Barbera series, with episodes often filled with innuendo and cases of mild language. It also featured several stars' voices, including Ed Asner, John Ritter, Tim Curry, Hector Elizondo, Buddy Hackett, Megan Mullally, Robert Guillaume and JoBeth Williams.

It is also known for the Kibeho Massacre, in April 1995, where several thousand internally displaced people were killed by the Rwandan Patriotic Army. History = Visions = The Blessed Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ reportedly appeared to a 19-, 20-, and 21-year-old in Kibeho in 1981, as Our Lady of Kibeho. These visions were accompanied by intense reactions: crying, tremors, and comas. On 19 August 1982, those who saw the visions reported gruesome sights (rivers of blood, sliced heads, etc.) which some today regard as an ominous foreshadowing of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and particularly in that specific location in 1994(Tutsi killed) and 1995(Hutu killed). Catholic Bishop Augustin Misago of Gikongoro, Rwanda approved public devotion linked to the apparitions on 15 August 1988 and declared their authenticity on 29 June 2001. In his declaration, the bishop singled out visions of Mary by the three original visionaries as worthy of belief; but declined to declare as worthy of belief the purported visions of Jesus by four other visionaries due to \\"disquieting personal situations\\" in that case. = Rwandan genocide = Kibeho church was the site of one of the early massacres of the Rwandan genocide; it is estimated that around 17,500 people were killed. = Kibeho massacre = After the 1994 genocide, in which the Hutu killed an estimated 5,000/6,000 Tutsi in Kibeho,it became the site of an internally displaced person (IDP) refugee camp, with many of the Hutu refugees suspected of having participated in the genocide. The camp was the largest in Rwanda, spreading 9 square kilometers and containing between 80,000 and 100,000 people. In mid - April 1995, elements of the Tutsi - led Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), announced they would close the camp, with the aim of forcibly separating known Génocidaires from those who would be sent home. As the camp was closed, tensions mounted and RPA troops opened fire on some of the remaining refugees. There were no foreign troops or reporters in Kibeho in 1994. Australian and Zambian troops of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) and staff from International Aid Agencies witnessed the massacre. Many of these were killed in the same school in which the apparitions had occurred; one of the children who reported the vision was even one of the victims. The local bishop recognized officially on 29 June 2001 three cases as authentic. The church Notre-Dame des Douleurs (Our Lady of Sorrows) was built in Kibeho, supported by Pallottines.

The popularity of hard trance peaked during the late 1990s, and has since then faded in scope of newer forms of trance. Hard trance is often characterized by strong, hard (or even downpitch) kicks, fully resonant basses and an increased amount of reverberation applied to the main beat. Melodies vary from 140 to 180 in tempo, and can feature plain instrumental sound in early compositions, with the latter ones tending to implement side-chaining techniques of progressive on digital synthesizers. Hard trance was the final form of progressive to hit the mainstream. It eventually morphed into hardstyle, jumpstyle and gabber. Its mainstream popularity decreased in the mid-2000s. History The hard trance sound developed out of the breakbeat hardcore/hardcore era which itself developed from Belgian New Beat industrial style of Techno. When the hardcore breakbeat production community split into its separate subgenres, hard trance began to develop within the breakbeat hardcore production community. Hard trance went on to become one of the dominant and most successful electronic music styles throughout the 1990s in mainland Europe and around the world. The British electronic music scene split off into other styles such as jungle/drum and bass, hardcore, techno and house. =Popularity, commercialisation and commercial downfall= ; Europe Remaining popular around 1993–1997 in mainland Europe, hard trance was associated with mega-raves of many thousands of ravers. Many series of compilation CDs came initially from the originators of the sound and the clubs that promoted it. It ultimately went overground and reached commercial status becoming known commercially as \\"maximaal\\". Throughout the 1990s the popularity of the sound caused a flurry of popular and financially successful tracks to be licensed by major record labels, with the sound becoming aggressively marketed through commercial compilations on TV, radio and across the different forms of media. ; UK The hard trance sound came to the UK via the underground techno community in clubs such as Heaven, Trade, Melt and FF and Fist or through clubs such as The Omen in Morley and Club UK in London. It never reached the same commercial heights or as on the continental mainland due to British music scene already being widely diversified into styles such as jungle/drum & bass, hardcore and house. =Influence on other musical styles= Europe Alongside the birth of hard trance, the same producers and record labels were already producing and developing the jumpstyle sound, the successor of gabber, which was popular in the Netherlands. Jumpstyle used the same sounds as the hard trance sound with faster beat patterns but slightly slower than gabber, this developed directly into hardstyle toward the end of the 1990s, which along hardtechno and hard house came to dominate the harder spectrum of electronic music. UK The sound influenced and led to the development of UK hard house and its subgenres, prior to this style the UK clubs where hard house developed were typically already playing a mixture of harder techno styles, progressive trance, electro and hardstyle incorporating many sounds and influences from each style can be heard across the others.

Life Oberman was born in Utrecht on 15 October 1930. He earned his doctorate in theology from the University of Utrecht in 1957 and joined the faculty of the Harvard Divinity School in 1958. There he rose rapidly from instructor to associate professor and, in 1963, to professor of church history. He was appointed Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Harvard in 1964 and continued teaching there until 1966. He then accepted a chair in the theology faculty at the University of Tübingen, Germany, where he also became director of the Institute for Late Middle Ages and Reformation Research. Later in life, Oberman founded the Division for Late Medieval and Reformation Studies at the University of Arizona. His major books include The Harvest of Medieval Theology: Gabriel Biel and Late Medieval Nominalism (1963), which articulated his program of bridging the gap between the later Middle Ages and Reformation era (at least in the field of theology), and an iconoclastic biography of Martin Luther, translated from German as Luther: Man Between God and the Devil (1989). About Luther, Oberman wrote: \\"There is no way to grasp Luther's milieu of experience and faith unless one has an acute sense of his view of Christian existence between God and the Devil: without a recognition of Satan's power, belief in Christ is reduced to an idea about Christ – and Luther's faith becomes a confused delusion in keeping with the tenor of his time.\\" (Oberman, Heiko (1989). \\"Luther: Man Between God and the Devil\\". Yale University Press. p. 104.) He died on 22 April 2001. Honors Numerous honorary degrees and affiliations in the United States and abroad pay homage to Oberman's stature as a scholar and an educator. He became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. In 1996, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences awarded him the prestigious Dr A.H. Heineken Prize for History – the highest honor a historian can receive – and, in 2001, shortly before his death, he was told that he would be awarded a knighthood by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 2002 for extraordinary representation of Dutch scholarship and culture. At the University of Arizona, he was named Regents' Professor of History in 1988 and was honored with the 5-Star Faculty Teaching Award in 1989, the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences Teaching Award for Graduate Instruction in 1999, and the SBS Board of Advisors Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.

It is located at 675 Green Street and borders the Club De Golf St-Lambert. Chambly Academy is the only English-language secondary school in Saint Lambert and is part of the Riverside School Board. It offers an International Baccalaureate program. Chambly Academy has had a student population ranging from 400 to 750 students (during a baby boom peak in the early 1970s). The school is currently home to approximately 500 students. History St-Lambert High School Air Cadets in 1942 The first St. Lambert High School was built on the corner of Green and Notre-Dame streets in 1896. In 1912, it was enlarged so that students from all of Chambly County could attend. Due to increased enrolment, the current building at 675 Green Street was opened in November 1954, and Chambly County High School became the first English language high school on the South Shore. In 1979, St. François-Xavier High School was opened in La Prairie, Quebec. In 1993, the students from St. Francois-Xavier were transferred to Penfield Academy, an institution named in honour of neurosurgeon Dr. Wilder Penfield. In September 1999, Penfield Academy was merged with Chambly County High School. The combined school, named Chambly Academy, was located on the premises of Chambly County High School. In 1976, facing space shortages, portable classrooms were built on the current location of the \\"F-wing\\". In 2001, these classrooms were destroyed and replaced with new portable classrooms which were built in 2002 and opened in the back of the current \\"E-wing\\". These classrooms served as temporary space, while four new permanent classrooms were constructed on the site of the destroyed portables at a cost of $1 million. The new classrooms were completed in 2004 and were shortly thereafter known as the \\"F-wing\\". In 2007, a $1.5 Million general renovation project was undertaken by the Riverside School Board; classrooms, hallways, offices were all renovated. At the same time, with the collaboration of the provincial government, all science labs were rebuilt. In late 2007, a long-standing sale of school land was approved by the city of Saint-Lambert. The proceeds from this sale ($5.4 Million) were used to further renovate and expand the school over the two next years. By fall 2009, Chambly Academy's renovation and expansion work had been completed. The former gymnasium was converted into a cafeteria, the original cafeteria was transformed into a state of the art food preparation and serving area and the library was transformed into 2 additional classrooms. A new state of the art sports complex with a double gymnasium was built along with a new library and a new student services area. On July 1, 2015, Chambly Academy was renamed Saint-Lambert International High School. The school was renamed to better reflect the school's location in Saint-Lambert as opposed to Chambly.

History Maximum Destruction's original look used from 2003 to 2012 In 1999, Clear Channel (now Feld Entertainment) signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling to create monster trucks based on popular professional wrestlers. In order to ensure the success of the truck of Goldberg, Clear Channel contracted the team of Tom Meents (who was already popular from driving Monster Patrol and Bulldozer) to build and campaign the \\"Goldberg\\" truck. Meents debuted in the truck in January 2000 at the Georgia Dome, where he won racing and finished third in freestyle. As the year progressed, and as Dennis Anderson struggled in Grave Digger, Meents dominated and capped the year by winning the first Monster Jam World Finals Racing Championship. The following year saw a continuation of the dominance, when Meents won the world racing and freestyle championships. In 2001, WCW was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation and the deal with Clear Channel was dropped. For 2002, Meents kept the same truck and body but renamed the truck Team Meents, even retaining much of Goldberg's color scheme and graphics. Once again, Meents swept both the racing and freestyle at World Finals 3. In 2003, saw the truck change both name and image to become Maximum Destruction, a name which Meents had intended to run the year before until he delayed those plans out of respect for the September 11 attacks. Neil Elliot began driving a second truck for the team that year as well. The team has remained significantly popular, and is now generally introduced as the chief rival of Grave Digger, the tours' most popular team. Tom Meents signing autographs in front of Maximum Destruction In 2005 Meents jumped Maximum Destruction over his old house, before destroying the house with the truck. In 2013, Maximum Destruction celebrated 10 years. The trucks were painted in a new livery featuring spikes around the body, and the truck began to be known as \\"Max-D\\". At World Finals 14, Meents won freestyle in Max-D, earning his 11th World Finals Championship. In 2016, Meents's two stepsons, Colton and Jared Eichelberger, joined the team. At World Finals 17, both Meents and Colton competed in the main events while Jared competed in the Young Guns Shootout. During the racing encore, Meents jumped his truck over five monster trucks. In an attempt to break this record, he tried to jump over six trucks in April at Levis Stadium, though the trucks were positioned to either side of the area Meents was jumping, thus not breaking the record. This was mainly because of the conditions of the muddy track. He later reattempted this, successfully jumping over six trucks later in the same month at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. In 2017, Meents sustained an injury and was unable to compete. Due to his injury, Meents did not compete in World Finals 18. Dennis Anderson also sustained an injury, making this the first time where Meents and Anderson both did not compete in the World Finals; Anderson would retire after that season. In 2018, at World Finals 19, the Max-D team celebrated their 15-year anniversary of the truck with a special encore after competition ended, featuring all the Max-D trucks throughout the past years, including the original Maximum Destruction truck. Signature elements Since the truck debuted as Goldberg, the truck has become known for bouncy and wild rides, and for its ability to make large jumps and take several hits during freestyle runs and not suffer significant damage. The truck is also known for its numerous crashes, often simply as a result of Meents' full-throttle driving. Meents' driving style is emulated by the other drivers, who are said to have graduated from the \\"Tom Meents School of Monster Truck Driving\\". Maximum Destruction is one of the few teams in the modern monster truck industry to use a front-mounted engines. = Backflips = During the freestyle portion of a European tour event in Gothenburg, Sweden, Meents hit the backside of a 'step up' jump which caused the truck to rotate backwards, land on the roof at the top of the obstacle and then continue to roll backwards back onto the wheels where Meents continued his run. This inspired drivers to attempt a complete aerial backflip. Travis Pastrana made an attempt during a Season 1 episode of Nitro Circus using a purpose-built ramp. However, the truck did not get enough rotation and slammed down onto the roof from about 40 feet in the air; Pastran was uninjured. In 2009, at World Finals 10 in Las Vegas, Meents rolled on to the floor during the encore in Maximum Destruction. Nobody knew what he was going to do until he launched his truck off the backside of the center jump, which was almost a solid wall of dirt. The truck instantly bounced up into the air and managed to rotate one and half times backwards until landing on the tailgate, resulting in the truck rolling onto its roof. Although spectacular, it did not technically count because he did not land on his tires. It was later revealed in a special DVD release about Meents' build up to the backflip at the World Finals, that he had, in fact, landed a complete backflip in his backyard during testing. Therefore, Meents was the first to land a successful backflip. In 2010, Cam McQueen, driving Pastrana's Nitro Circus truck, completed a backflip in Jacksonville, Florida. This was the first backflip landed in competition. Since then, there have been many successful and unsuccessful attempts from several drivers. A few drivers have even completed corkscrew type flips where the truck backflips and lands facing the opposite direction. Linsey Weenk, driver of the Lucas Oil Crusader truck, was the first driver to land two backflips in one scored freestyle run. After George Balhan, driver of Mohawk Warrior, landed two consecutive backflips at the 2012 Monster Jam World Finals, Meents was driven to land the double. After months of preparation at his shop in Paxton, Illinois, on June 16, 2012, at the last show of the Monster Jam Path of Destruction Tour at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Meents came out in a modified Maximum Destruction stunt truck, built specifically for the double backflip. When Meents hit the jump, his truck completed one rotation, but started to twist in the second rotation then landing on the roof, coming up just short. Then, on Saturday, March 23, 2013, he attempted it again in the encore portion of Monster Jam World Finals 14. The truck landed on the sides of the left side tires, and bounced into a perfect landing, becoming the first successful double backflip. A double backflip has yet to be landed in competition.  Trucks  Max D in 2013 Since the debut of the Maximum Destruction name in 2003, there have been 9 trucks fielded by the team: *1 – Debuted in 2000 as Goldberg, became Maximum Destruction in 2003, retired in 2010 *2 – Debuted in 2003, retired in 2011 *3 – Debuted in 2011, retired in 2016 *4 – Debuted in 2011, retired in 2017 *5 – Debuted in 2012, retired in 2017 *6 – Debuted in 2012, currently driven by Colton Eichelberger *7 – Debuted in 2017, currently driven by Blake Granger *8 – Debuted in 2017, currently driven by Tom Meents *9 – Debuted in 2018, currently driven by Neil Elliott Additionally, a truck with a modified design used only for special stunts debuted in 2012.

The team was one of the eight founding members of the American Association.1929 Kansas City Blues from the Minor League Baseball website The Blues did not field particularly competitive teams until 1918, when they won the AA pennant. The team won again in 1923, and again in 1929. They won the Junior World Series championship both years, defeating the Baltimore Orioles and the Rochester Red Wings of the International League, respectively, in best-of-nine series. In 1935, the Blues became a farm club of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1936 they became an affiliate of the New York Yankees. They won the AA championships five times in the 1930s and 1940s. They defeated the Newark Bears, another Yankees farm club, in the 1938 Junior World Series. When the American League Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City in 1955, the Blues moved to Denver, Colorado, and became the Denver Bears. The 1923, 1929, and 1939 Blues were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. Team History The Kansas City Blues were admitted to the American Association in 1902, and won their first league championship in 1918. They'd win two more, one in 1923 and the second in 1928. However, the onset of The Great Depression took a toll on the team as attendance began to fall. At one point, the Blues lead the league in attendance, but that number would soon be cut in half. Frustrated with how things were going in Kansas City, owner George Muehlebach sold the franchise to a group headed by Hollywood actor Joe E. Brown, and included former MLB star Tris Speaker. Speaker would also serve as the team's manager. The change in ownership did little to spark interest in the team and Speaker was replaced as manager with Nick Allen. who'd won a championship with St. Paul. The franchise was sold again, this time to Kansas City resident and former Cubs player Johnny Kling who in turn hired Roger Peckinbaugh, who'd just been released as manager by the Cleveland Indians to take over as manager for Kansas City.http://www.milb.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=12 The Blues still struggled with attendance, though it did improve, even if Kansas City finished in last place. Another change was made as Peckinbaugh was released and Dutch Zwilling, who piloted the Blues to their 1929 championship, was brought back as manager. The Blues began to rise in the league standings and the attendance rose as well. Another ownership change was afoot as Kling sold the franchise to the New York Yankees who quickly made the Blues one of their farm teams. The home opener in 1939 was a near sell out and the fans went home happy, as outfielder Vince Dimaggio hit a home run in his first at bat. The Blues routed Louisville 8-2 en route to a season that saw Kansas City win 107 games. However, the Blues lost to Indianapolis in the play offs. One of the stars of the Blues that season was a 21 year old shortstop named Phil Rizzuto. The Blues would never have a team as great as the 1939 squad again, but the team was a launching pad for future major league players like Johnny Lindell and in later years, Mickey Mantle. And by the 1950s it was over for the Blues altogether, as the franchise ceased once the A's moved from Philadelphia to Kansas City.

Ulster nationalism is a minor school of thought in Northern Ireland politics that seeks the independence of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom without joining the Republic of Ireland, thereby becoming an independent sovereign state separate from both. Independence has been supported by groups such as Ulster Third Way and some factions of the Ulster Defence Association. However, it is a fringe view in Northern Ireland. It is neither supported by any of the political parties represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly nor by the government of the United Kingdom or the government of the Republic of Ireland. Although the term Ulster traditionally refers to one of the four traditional provinces of Ireland which contains Northern Ireland as well as parts of the Republic of Ireland, the term is often used within unionism and Ulster loyalism (from which Ulster nationalism originated) to refer to Northern Ireland. History =Craig in 1921= In November 1921, during negotiations for the Anglo-Irish Treaty, there was correspondence between David Lloyd George and Sir James Craig, respective prime ministers of the UK and Northern Ireland. Lloyd George envisaged a choice for Northern Ireland between, on the one hand, remaining part of the UK under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, while what had been Southern Ireland became a Dominion; and, on the other hand, becoming part of an all-Ireland Dominion where the Stormont parliament was subordinate to a parliament in Dublin instead of Westminster.Cmd.1561, Letter I (6) Craig responded that a third option would be for Northern Ireland to be a Dominion in parallel with Southern Ireland and the \\"Overseas Dominions\\", saying \\"while Northern Ireland would deplore any loosening of the tie between Great Britain and herself she would regard the loss of representation at Westminster as a less evil than inclusion in an all-Ireland Parliament\\".Cmd.1561, Letter II(3) =W. F. McCoy and Dominion status= Ulster nationalism has its origins in 1946 when W. F. McCoy, a former cabinet minister in the government of Northern Ireland, advocated this option.W. F. McCoy He wanted Northern Ireland to become a dominion with a political system similar to Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the then Union of South Africa, or the Irish Free State prior to 1937. McCoy, a lifelong member of the Ulster Unionist Party, felt that the uncertain constitutional status of Northern Ireland made the Union vulnerable and so saw his own form of limited Ulster nationalism as a way to safeguard Northern Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom. Some members of the Ulster Vanguard movement, led by Bill Craig, in the early 1970s published similar arguments, most notably Professor Kennedy Lindsay. In the early 1970s, in the face of the British government prorogation of the government of Northern Ireland, Craig, Lindsay and others argued in favour of a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from Great Britain similar to that declared in Rhodesia a few years previously. Lindsay later founded the British Ulster Dominion Party to this end but it faded into obscurity around 1979. =Loyalism and Ulster nationalism= Whilst early versions of Ulster nationalism had been designed to safeguard the status of Northern Ireland, the movement saw something of a rebirth in the 1970s, particularly following the 1972 suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the resulting political uncertainty in the region. Glenn Barr, a Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party Assemblyman and Ulster Defence Association leader, described himself in 1973 as \\"an Ulster nationalist\\". The successful Ulster Workers Council Strike in 1974, (which was directed by Barr), was later described by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees as an \\"outbreak of Ulster nationalism\\". Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan also thought an independent Ulster might be viable. After the strike loyalism began to embrace Ulster nationalist ideas, with the UDA, in particular, advocating this position.Ian S. Wood, Crimes of Loyalty:A History of the UDA, pg. 50. Firm proposals for an independent Ulster were produced in 1976 by the Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee and in 1977 by the UDA's New Ulster Political Research Group. The NUPRG document, Beyond the Religious Divide, has been recently republished with a new introduction. John McMichael, as candidate for the UDA-linked Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party, campaigned for the 1982 South Belfast by-election on the basis of negotiations towards independence. However, McMichael's poor showing of 576 votes saw the plans largely abandoned by the UDA soon after, although the policy was still considered by the Ulster Democratic Party under Ray Smallwoods. A short-lived Ulster Independence Party also operated, although the assassination of its leader, John McKeague, in 1982 saw it largely disappear. =The National Front= While Ulster nationalism went into something of a decline in loyalist circles following the South Belfast by-election, the issue became a matter of policy for the Official National Front, as the Political Soldier wing of the British National Front was known. During the 1980s the group produced a document entitled Alternative Ulster – Facing Up to the Future, which laid out plans for how independence could be achieved and how the independent state would function. Arguing that Ulster represented a nation distinct from the rest of Ireland, and Great Britain, they called for an independent state to be run by a series of Community Councils, with an economy based on distributism. Despite the plans, the NF never had more than minor support in the region and the plans failed to reach a wider audience. =Post-Anglo-Irish Agreement= The idea enjoyed something of a renaissance in the aftermath of the Anglo- Irish Agreement, with the Ulster Clubs amongst those to consider the notion.Wood, pg. 86. After a series of public meetings, leading Ulster Clubs member, Reverend Hugh Ross, set up the Ulster Independence Committee in 1988, which soon re-emerged as the Ulster Independence Movement advocating full independence of Ulster from Great Britain. After a reasonable showing in the 1990 Upper Bann by-election, the group stepped up its campaigning in the aftermath of the Downing Street Declaration and enjoyed a period of increased support immediately after the Belfast Agreement (also absorbing the Ulster Movement for Self-Determination, which desired all of Ulster as the basis for independence, along the way). No tangible electoral success was gained however, and the group was further damaged by allegations against Ross in a Channel 4 documentary on collusion, The Committee, leading to the group reconstituting as a ginger group in 2000. With the UIM defunct, Ulster nationalism was then represented by the Ulster Third Way, which was involved in the publication of the Ulster Nation, a journal of radical Ulster nationalism. Ulster Third Way, which registered as a political party in February 2001, was the Northern Ireland branch of the UK-wide Third Way, albeit with much stronger emphasis on the Northern Ireland question. Ulster Third Way contested the West Belfast parliamentary seat in the 2001 general election, although candidate and party leader David Kerr failed to attract much support. Northern Irish independence is still seen by some members of society as a way of moving forward in terms of the political crisis that continues to haunt Northern Irish politics even today. Some economists and politicians see an independent state as viable but others believe that Northern Ireland would not survive unless it had the support of the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland. Although it is not supported by a political party, around 533,085 declared in the 2011 census to be Northern Irish. This identity does not mean they believe in independence, however in a poll based upon what the future policy for Northern Ireland should be, 15% of the poll voters were in favour of Northern Irish independence. Relationship to unionism  Ulster nationalist flag above a plaque in memory of Wesley Somerville in Moygashel Ulster nationalism represents a reaction from within unionism to the perceived uncertainty of the future of the Union by the British government. Its leadership and members have all been unionists and have tended to react to what they viewed as crises surrounding the status of Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, such as the moves towards power-sharing in the 1970s or the Belfast Agreement of 1998, which briefly saw the UIM become a minor force. In such instances it has been considered preferable by the supporters of this ideological movement to remove the British dimension either partially (Dominion status) or fully (independence) to avoid a united Ireland. However, whilst support for Ulster nationalism has tended to be reactive to political change, the theory also underlines the importance of Ulster cultural nationalism and the separate identity and culture of Ulster. As such, Ulster nationalist movements have been at the forefront of supporting the Orange Order and supporting contested 12 July marches as important parts of this cultural heritage, as well as encouraging the retention of the Ulster Scots dialects. Outside traditional Protestant- focused Ulster nationalism, a non-sectarian independent Northern Ireland has sometimes been advocated as a solution to the conflict. Two notable examples of this are the Scottish Marxist Tom NairnSee The Break-Up of Britain,(2nd edition), Verso, 1981. and the Irish nationalist Liam de Paor.See his book Unfinished Business, Radius,1990. Pgs.158-9 \\"...It is possible to reconcile these conflicting aspirations [Unionist and Nationalist] through a compromise that would involve a new constitution for Northern Ireland: a devolution that would create a self-governing state...\\" See also *Partitionism *Two nations theory (Ireland) *Unionism in Ireland -- \\"Alternatives to Devolution\\", \\"The Defence of British-Unionist Culture\\", \\"Ulster Scots and New Decade, New Approach\\".

Hayes House, Rutherford B. Hayes Summer Home and Rutherford B. Hayes State Memorial was the estate of Rutherford B. Hayes, the nineteenth President of the United States, located at the corner of Hayes and Buckland Avenues in Fremont, Ohio. Spiegel is the German and Dutch word for mirror. The traditional story is that the estate was named by Hayes' uncle Sardis Birchard, who first built it for his own residence. He named it for the reflective pools of water that collected on the property after a rain shower. Rutherford Hayes inherited the estate and moved there in 1873. He died in 1893 and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery next to his wife who had died in 1889. Following the gift of this home to the state of Ohio for the Spiegel Grove State Park, their bodies were reinterred at Spiegel Grove in 1915. They are buried at a memorial on the property. The Rutherford B.

Design 1885 first floor plan sketch by Henry Howe The house was built around 1860 for Sardis Birchard as a two-story brick mansion. It featured many bedrooms and a wrap-around porch. In 1880, after Rutherford B. Hayes had moved in, he expanded the house by the addition of 5 new rooms, and the massive staircase that led all the way up to the 4th floor. In 1889, 6 more rooms were added to the house, giving it its current appearance. After the expansions, the house had more than 30 rooms and of living space. Tourism The estate was given to the state for the Spiegel Grove State Park. Since then, the house has been open for tourists as a house museum. For a fee, visitors can view the various rooms as well as furniture, books, and other items in the house. Visitors are allowed to access most of the rooms on the first and second floors.

Having retired with the rank of General, he was approached on April 18, 1964 by his former colleague General George Grivas and offered the leadership of the newly formed Greek Cypriot Cypriot National Guard, which post Karayiannis accepted. From April to August 1964 Karayiannis commanded and organised the Cypriot National Guard, whose stated mission was to defend the island against possible Turkish military invasion, and to counter the paramilitary forces of the Turkish Cypriot group known as Turkish Resistance Organization or TMT. Grivas arrived in Cyprus himself on June 10, 1964 and used the popularity he gained in Cyprus and Greece during the EOKA era to coerce the governments of Greece and Cyprus into appointing him supreme military commander of Cyprus. On July 22 Grivas set himself up in an office at the National Guard headquarters and began to issue orders directly to National Guard units. This incensed Karayiannis who submitted his resignation, which was not accepted. On July 4 negotiations on the Cyprus dispute began in Geneva between representatives of the United States, Greek and Turkish governments, with the presence of the United Nations. Special advisor to the US representation was Dean Acheson, and those US proposals eventually became known as the \\"Acheson plan\\". Karayiannis and Grivas were recalled to Athens on August 5 to confer with the Greek government. Karayiannis reports that he and Grivas were counselled by Minister of Defense Petros Garoufalias to exercise all restraint, as Enosis was imminent, and to seek the counsel of the Greek government before any action which might lead to escalation. Grivas was to return to Cyprus on August 6, and Karayiannis on August 7. While returning to Cyprus on August 7 on board the Athens-Nicosia airliner, Karayiannis saw shell bursts and smoke in the Kokkina area. On arrival he headed immediately for the Headquarters of the National Guard which he found on full war alert. General Grivas informed Karayiannis that the Swedish battalion of the UN Forces in Cyprus had abandoned their positions on the hill known as Akoni in the Kokkina area on August 6, that Cypriot National Guard units which took their place came under fire from units of the TMT stationed on the nearby hill known as Lourovouno, and that therefore Grivas had ordered an attack on Lourovouno for the morning of August 7. Karayiannis reports that he later found out that the attack on Lourovouno had been ordered without the Greek government having been informed, and that Grivas had misled Makarios and the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus into thinking he would obtain authorisation from Greece before acting. Karayiannis was once more incensed at Grivas. He became even more incensed when he found out that the attack had been badly organised, so that it had only started at 3:30pm instead of the planned time in the morning, and therefore failed to achieve its objectives by nightfall. During that night Grivas ordered a large number of forces into the Kokkina area and ordered an attack for the next morning. Lourovouno was taken by 07:45 on the morning of August 8. Still without authorisation from Greece, but with the support of Makarios, Grivas escalated operations, with the objective of taking over the entire Kokkina enclave. At 10:05, Grivas was ordered by signal from the General National Defense Staff of Greece to cease offensive operations at that time, which order he ignored. Later the same day, Greek Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou sent a message to Makarios expressing his disapproval of the latter's initiatives. While Grivas went to the field of operations, Karayiannis, who was insisting that the orders of the Greek government to suspend offensive operations be obeyed, remained at the Headquarters of the National Guard in Nicosia. At 16:15 on the afternoon of August 8, the Turkish Air Force attacked the Cypriot National Guard formations in the Kokkina area, against no significant resistance as the National Guard operated no aircraft and had very rudimentary anti-aircraft capability. Grivas, who was present in the area, did all he could to prevent the panicking National Guardsmen from abandoning their positions. When the air attacks ceased two hours later, Grivas returned to his office at the Headquarters of the National Guard in Nicosia. At 20:00 the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus convened, with the presence of Makarios, Grivas and Karayiannis. Grivas proposed, and the Council agreed to, an all-out night attack to take over the Kokkina enclave. Karayiannis intervened, asking Grivas whether he had any idea, if such an order were issued, as to when and how it would be carried out by units in the field. Grivas was forced to admit that he could not order an attack for earlier than the afternoon of the next day, August 9. Karayiannis also protested that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus was undertaking offensive initiatives without counsel with the government of Greece, despite prior agreements. The Minister of Interior and Defense of the Republic of Cyprus, Polycarpos Georgadjis, replied by submitting his resignation because, though Karayiannis was leader of the Cypriot National Guard, he was taking orders from Minister of Defense Garoufalias in Greece rather than Georkadjis. The resignation was not accepted. After 21:00 Grivas returned to his office at the Headquarters of the Cypriot National Guard and, in the presence of Georkadjis, Karayiannis and others, submitted his resignation, describing himself as a \\"renegade\\" for not obeying the orders of the Greek government. He then left his office. Karayiannis immediately ordered all units to regroup, maintain positions and await further orders. At 10:00 on the morning of August 9, the Turkish Air Force resumed its operations in the Kokkina area and extended them to civilian targets in the region. Napalm attacks on the villages of Pyrgos, Pigenia, Pachyammos, Pomos and the town of Polis Chrysochous killed 53 and injured 125 civilians. The Turkish Air Force also mistakenly attacked Kokkina itself. The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus, in an emergency session with Makarios presiding, decided to issue an ultimatum to the Turkish government warning that unless air attacks stopped, a general attack on Turkish Cypriot villages by the Cypriot National Guard would be ordered, and asked General Karayiannis to select two villages for destruction in case the ultimatum was not heeded. Karayiannis reports that he refused the order, saying that he was an army officer and not an executioner of innocent people. During the night of August 9 the military crisis was defused by an intervention of the UN Security Council. All units were ordered to stand down. Only then did Grivas return to his office, having been absent throughout the critical events of August 9. He announced that he was assuming supreme military command of Cyprus once more. Karayiannis reported to him on events during the day and preparations to face a possible landing by the Turkish army, whereupon Grivas instructed Karayiannis not to move a single platoon without his personal approval. Before, and during, the Kokkina crisis, Karayiannis found himself charged with duties to both the government of the Republic of Cyprus and of Greece, which became contradictory because of the lack of agreement between the two governments. He also found that Polycarpos Georgadjis and George Grivas interfered with the discharge of his duties. He made his position clear in the account of events he submitted to the government of the Republic of Cyprus immediately after the Kokkina events. Immediately afterwards, he submitted a letter of resignation to Makarios III. Makarios asked Karayiannis to reconsider his decision, which Karayiannis promised to do after returning to Greece to consult with the Greek government. Presumably, Makarios wished Karayiannis to stay on as Chief of Staff of the Cypriot National Guard as a counterweight to Supreme Military Commander Grivas, who Makarios was finding increasingly difficult to deal with. Karayiannis, however, after his return to Greece and consultation with the Greek government, wrote Makarios another letter upholding his decision to resign. Makarios III wrote Karayiannis accepting his resignation and thanking him for his services. In June 1965 Karayiannis began a series of articles on his time in Cyprus in the Greek newspaper National Herald, in which he related his account of the facts and accused Grivas of military incompetence, irrational behaviour and psychological weakness. That series of articles, and his report on the Kokkina crisis submitted to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus immediately after events, provide an interesting insight into an important era in the Cyprus dispute and into the personality and actions of George Grivas.

As of January 2014, he is ranked 12th in the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). He began playing at the age of 6 and was picked for the Chinese men's national squad in 1993 when he was only 15 years old. He holds three majors (3 World Championships). He has been ranked #1 by ITTF for 25 consecutive months, from September 2000 to September 2002, which is the second-longest period for being consecutive #1 of the world as of January 2011. At the end of 2013, Wang Liqin retired from the national team. Table Tennis Master  Style/Equipment  Wang is the type who changes his playing equipment often. He has perhaps used more than 10 different model of rackets, some of them for a longer period of time, e.g. The Butterfly Timo Boll Spirit, Stiga Clipper CR, Offensive CR, Rosewood V, DHS Hurricane King II, III, and some Nittaku's models. His main forehand rubber is DHS Hurricane II, III, TG III. It is said that he had used Nittaku Hammond, the Tenergy series, and many other rubbers for his backhand. Wang Liqin uses the shakehand grip. He plays a forehand dominated style with the occasional backhand loop to open a topspin rally. His above average height allows him additional leverage for acceleration and momentum, creating more powerful shots. Many often describe him as possessing one of the most unusual and powerful forehand shots.  Awards  Wang won the gold medal in doubles at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and the bronze medal in singles at the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens, Greece, as well as at the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing, China. At the 2008 Summer Olympics Wang won gold medal in team competition with Ma Lin and Wang Hao. For most of 2004–6, he ranked as the world's best table tennis player. Wang Liqin won his first World Championship in Osaka, Japan in 2001. In 2003, Wang made it to the quarter-finals of the World Table Tennis Championships. He has since won two more World Championships – 48th WTTC 2005 in Shanghai, China and 49th WTTC 2007 in Zagreb, Croatia.

It featured one of the first 3-D body shells, with horns sticking out of the roof. In this respect, it resembled El Toro Loco. The truck debuted as a promotional truck for Smoke Craft jerky in the USA Motorsports series in 1997 (USA Motorsports owned the rights to the truck), and several different entertainment companies received the rights when they bought out USA Motorsports in 1999, including SFX, PACE Motorsports, Clear Channel, Live Nation, and lastly FELD Motorsports. The truck has been driven previously by Bobby Zoelner, Steve Reynolds, Rob Knell, former Taurus driver Eldon DePew, and current Maximum Destruction superstar Tom Meents, as well as Chuck Werner and Alex Blackwell. Bulldozer sometimes switched bodies with Hot Wheels, Bob & Tom, or High Roller. Originally the owner & driver of the Bulldozer monster truck was Guy Wood, who had been racing monster trucks for 15 years. Guy got his start in the sport of monster truck racing at a race track near to his home at the time. As demand for his presence increased, so did his interest in the sport until he was racing the truck full-time. Eventually, Guy gave the rights to Bulldozer to USA Motorsports. World Finals Appearances Bulldozer has appeared in four Monster Jam World Finals. In 2001, the truck was driven by Eldon DePew. In 2000, 2002, and 2004, the truck was driven by Guy Wood. Final Appearance The truck performed its last show in Englishtown, New Jersey at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park on September 19, 2009.

The species is native to Southeast Asia. Description The tree is average sized, reaching in height and in diameter. Seedling trees 30 years old planted at 8 × 8 meter spacing can have a height of 10 meters and diameter of 25 cm. The trunk grows in an irregular manner, with its buttress roots showing above ground. The tree's bark is a greyish colour, with light and dark spots. Its resin is thick and milk coloured. The pinnately compound leaves are odd numbered, with thin hair, and 6 to 9 buds at intervals. The buds are long and elliptical, approximately by in size. The upper edge shines, and the leaves themselves have pointed bases and tips. The stems of the buds measure . The flowers are located in inflorescences that grow and hang from large branches or the trunk; the bunches may number up to 5 in one place. They are often branched at their base, measure in size, and have short fur. The flowers are small, with short stems, and have two genders. The sheathe is shaped like a five lobed cup and is coloured a greenish-yellow. The corona is egg-shaped and hard, measuring by . There is one stamen, measuring in length. The top of the stamen is round. The pistil is short and thick. The fruit can be elliptical, ovoid or round, measuring by in size. Fruits look much like small potatoes and are borne in clusters similar to grapes. The larger fruits are on the variety known as duku. It is covered by thin, yellow hair giving a slightly fuzzy aspect. The skin thickness varies with the varieties, from to approximately . The fruit contains 1 to 3 seeds, flat, and bitter tasting; the seeds are covered with a thick, clear-white aril that tastes sweet and sour. The taste has been likened to a combination of grape and grapefruit and is considered excellent by most. The sweet juicy flesh contains sucrose, fructose, and glucose. For consumption, cultivars with small or undeveloped seeds and thick aril are preferred. Cultivars West Kutai There are numerous cultivars of L. parasiticum. Overall, there are two main groups of cultivars, those named duku and those named langsat. There are also mixed duku-langsat varieties. Those called duku generally have a large crown, thick with bright green leaves, with short bunches of few fruit. The individual fruit are large, generally round, and have somewhat thick skin that does not release sap when cooked. The seeds are small, with thick flesh, a sweet scent, and a sweet or sour taste. Meanwhile, the variant commonly known as langsat generally has thinner trees, with a less dense crown consisting of dark green leaves and stiff branches. The bunches are longer, and each bunch holds between 15 and 25 large, egg- shaped fruit. The skin is thin and releases a white sap when cooked. The flesh is watery and tastes sweet and sour. L. parasiticum cultivation in Mandi Angin, Rawas Ilir, Musi Rawas. Lansium domesticum var. aquaeum is distinguished by its hairy leaves, as well as the tightly packed dark yellow fruit on its bunches. The fruit tends to be small, with thin skin and little sap; the skin is difficult to remove. To be eaten, the fruit is bitten and the flesh sucked through the hole created, or rubbed until the skin breaks and the seeds are retrieved. In Indonesia the fruit has several names, including kokosan, pisitan, pijetan, and bijitan. The seeds are relatively large, with thin, sour flesh. Reproduction The seeds of L. parasiticum are polyembryonic, the multiple embryos resulting from apomixis. Lansium parasiticum is traditionally reproduced by spreading seedlings, either cultivated or collected from below the tree. It has been said that new seedlings require 20 to 25 years to bear fruit, with the possibility of the quality being inferior. However other sources quote 12 years to first production from seed and no variations. Production often varies from year to year, and depends to some extent on having a dry period to induce flowering. One example of ten trees in Costa Rica about twenty-five years old produced during five years the following weights of salable fruits: 2008: 50 kilos, 2009: 2000 kilos, 2010: 1000 kilos, 2011: 100 kilos, 2012: 1500 kilos. Experiments in the Philippines with grafting where two trees are planted close to each other and then grafted when one to two meters tall to leave twin root systems on a single main trunk have resulted in earlier and less erratic fruit production. Another common method is by air layering. Although the process requires up to several months, the new rooted tree produced is itself ready to bear fruit within two years. Trees cultivated with this method have a high death rate, and the growths are less resilient. The third common way to reproduce L. parasiticum is with grafting. This results in the new trees having the same genetic characteristics as their parent, and being ready to bear fruit within 5 to 6 years. The offspring are relatively stronger than transplanted shoots. Ecology A L. parasiticum agroforest in Mandi Angin, Rawas Ilir, Musi Rawas. Lansium parasiticum grows well in mixed agroforests. The plant, especially the duku variant, prefers damp, shaded areas. It can be grown in the same agroforest as durian, petai, and jengkol, as well as wood- producing trees. Lansium parasiticum is grown from low grounds up to heights of above sea level, in areas with an average rainfall of a year. The plant can grow and blossom in latosol, yellow podzol, and alluvium. The plant prefers slightly acidic soil with good drainage and rich in mulch. The langsat variant is hardier, and can weather dry seasons with a little shade and water. The plant cannot handle floods. Lansium parasiticum generally bears fruit once a year. This period can vary between areas, but blooming is generally after the beginning of the rainy season and fruit production some four months later. Distribution Lansium parasiticum is native to the Malesian phytochorion of Southeast Asia, from Peninsular Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, to Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines (Luzon, Camiguin, Basilan, and Mindanao), Sulawesi, the Moluccas, and Western New Guinea. It has also been introduced to Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Micronesia, Hawaii, Sri Lanka, India, the Seychelles, Trinidad & Tobago, and Surinam, among others. The tree is cultivated commercially in Thailand (, langsat), Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Malaysia and the Philippines (). It grows well in the wetter areas (120 inches/3 meters or more annual rainfall) of Costa Rica, where it is still very rare, having been introduced decades ago by the United Fruit Company. A major hindrance to its acceptance seems to be that it is very slow in bearing, said to take 12 years or more from seed. However, air layering from mature trees, as well as grafting, are said to work well and produce much faster. The name Duku is reserved for the larger-sized varieties of Langsat, near the size of golf balls, claimed sweeter and with less sap in the peel. A variety called Dokong exported to mainland Malaysia from Thailand (this variety is called 'Longkong' in Thailand) grows tighter in the clusters, giving it a faceted shape, and is preferred by many over the standard Langsat. Uses Peeled L. parasiticum, showing the clear-white aril around the seed. Lansium parasiticum is cultivated mainly for its fruit, which can be eaten raw. The fruit can also be bottled in syrup. The wood is hard, thick, heavy, and resilient, allowing it to be used in the construction of rural houses. Some parts of the plant are used in making traditional medicine. The bitter seeds can be pounded and mixed with water to make a deworming and ulcer medication. The bark is used to treat dysentery and malaria; the powdered bark can also be used to treat scorpion stings. The fruit's skin is used to treat diarrhea, and in the Philippines the dried skin is burned as a mosquito repellent. The skin, especially of the langsat variety, can be dried and burned as incense. The greatest producers of Lansium parasiticum are Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. The production is mostly for internal consumption, although some is exported to Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuwait.

It is located in the Old Temple of Chavin de Huantar which rests in the central highlands of Peru. The Chavín religion was the first major religious and cultural movement in the Andes mountains, flourishing between 900 and 200 BCE. The Lanzón itself was erected during the Early Horizon period of Andean art circa 500 BCE and takes its name from the Spanish word for \\"lance,\\" an allusion to the shape of the sculpture. The name is deceiving, as its form more closely resembles a highland plow which would have been used for agricultural purposes at the time. It is suspected because of this that the deity depicted is linked to agrarian worship. Geographic location and significance The Lanzón rests in the heart of Chavín de Huantar. This site at the time was on one of the few passes between the mountainous region of the coast and the dense Amazon. Due to the difficulty of the geography, one must have used these passages. The exposure of Chavín art, such as the Lanzon, to other cultures occurred because of its geographic location. Archaeologists have found textiles which echo the architecture of Chavín and its sculptural artifacts buried as far away as the South Coast in sites such as Karwa, suggesting its influence reached much farther than many other sites at the time. Visual Analysis The Lanzón is housed in the central cruciform chamber of a labyrinthine series of underground passages in the Old Temple of the ceremonial and religious center of Chavín de Huantar. Devotees would be led into the maze of pitch-black tunnels, eventually coming face to face with the sculpture. The worshipers' disorientation, in addition to the hallucinogenic effects of the San Pedro cactus they were given before entering, only heightened the visual and psychological impact of the sculpture. The imagery of the Lanzon is a complex series of line work which winds around each of the three sides of its floor to ceiling triangular form. Due to the imagery being divided, one would have to circumambulate the fixture in order to fully observe its design. The Lanzon depicts an anthropomorphic figure with a snarl, claws, and teeth akin to a jaguar. The being's hair flows in all directions, ending with the heads of snakes. The eyes are stylized, commonly referred to as pendant eyes. The carving is almost perfectly symmetrical except for one hand being raised with the other lowered. Additionally, there is special attention paid to the eyes, nose, lips, and teeth- deeper set carvings for these features make them project, due to the higher relief, it adds a greater feeling of ferocity. Cosmology The Lanzón expresses a fundamental motif within Chavín art: the jaguar. These representations vary from realism to stylized anthropomorphism, this particular stella falling under the latter category. The imagery of the jaguar occurs so frequently within Chavín art that it has been hypothesized that they were the foundation for the jaguar cult, worshipping the characteristics of these animals. This depiction of an anthropomorphic jaguar deity lends itself to other cosmological beliefs not just of Chavín but of Andean society as a whole. Camay, the belief of an object being a conduit for a deity, is particularly significant when considering the function of the Lanzón. Though it was made of terrestrial material, the Lanzón housed a celestial being, the people of Chavín even brought it offerings of food and ceramics. Furthermore, the central image of the Lanzon functions as axis mundi, or pivot linking the heavens, earth and underworld. This concept is also reflected in the raised and lowered arms, one linked to the celestial and the other linked to the terrestrial. The opposite arms are also reflective of the reverence to duality. Opposites seen in daily life such as night/day, life/death, male/female were considered sacred to create balance. The importance of duality is also seen with the contour rivalry of the snakes and hair, the transformation between man and beast, and the geographical location between the arid mountain range and the lush amazon. Finally, a key cosmological belief within Andean society as a whole, tinku. This is the concept of multiple parts converging to create something wholly new. The strategic geographic location of the Lanzón is placed at the convergence of the Mosna and Wacheqsa rivers.

The humor usually centers on four principal characters who had initially been presented as co-workers at an unspecified firm until the firm went out of business on December 25, 2007. Romantic relationships among the principals resulted in marriages and children, with one of the couples opening a small bar in the unnamed Texas Rio Grande Valley ranchland in which the strip is now principally set. These characters, their friends, and their families remain the strip's focus. The strip has a conservative libertarian viewpoint, and often makes reference to political weblogs. It was a Yahoo! Pick in the \\"Comics and Animation\\" category in 2004.Yahoo! Picks > Entertainment > Comics and Animation > Comic Strips Format and history The strip is updated daily, including weekends. It usually follows a loose \\"strip story arc\\" throughout a given week. Except on Sundays, the strip is usually three colorized panels, comprising a combination of newly drawn art and a library of hand-drawn elements that Muir has digitized and reuses. As with many newspaper comics, the strips for Sundays are larger and have more panels. Muir has stated in interviews that by crafting the cartoons digitally, and using previously drawn faces, expressions, and body postures, he can react to breaking news by crafting a relevant comic and putting it up the next day, breaking or delaying the main storyline. Generally, the strip features a running commentary on political events with the characters interacting in a vaguely seen office setting. In addition, the author often shows a \\"Doonesbury-esque\\" White House strip with an unseen President talking to his staff. Muir has often used the same treatment to show goings-on at the United Nations and The New York Times. The home URL was written vertically on the leftmost edge of the strip, beginning on May 2, 2003, running until the site's redesign in 2006. The comic itself has run since November 1, 2002, with a hiatus from September 12, 2004 to November 30, 2004. The large-format Sunday strips started in 2005. In 2007 the strip controversially portrayed Hillary Clinton in blackface and as speaking Ebonics. Financial model Like many other web comics, Day by Day is supported by a combination of contributions from readers (via PayPal, Amazon and other payment vehicles), banner advertising, and merchandise. Originally it was published without the benefit of syndication. In 2005, the strip became available for print newspaper syndication and was carried by the Hemingford Ledger, the Knoxville News- Sentinel, the North County Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune. In October 2007, Day by Day discontinued service to newspapers. Also in October 2007, E-book compilations of Day by Day cartoons became available for free on WOWIO.WOWIO: eBooks, Comics and Graphic Novels  Books Evolved It had a peak readership of more than 200,000 people a month. Characters * Zedediah \\"Zed\\" Owens is a laconic, goateed product designer who is frequently worried that he may be over the hill. He was born in Gonzalez, Texas.Day by Day Cartoon by Chris Muir :: April 12, 2014 Archives It has been revealed that Zed is a former Special Operations sniper, who has since been recalled back to duty in Iraq, where, as one strip revealed, he was actively hunting insurgents as a sniper once again.Day by Day Cartoon by Chris Muir :: July 21, 2007 Archives He proposed to Sam, and they married in Las Vegas. He currently resides in Texas. * Samantha \\"Sam\\" Owens (formerly Samantha Flanagan) is a red-headed, cautious engineer, married to Zed. In 2006, it was revealed that her father is Irish and her mother (Kimiko Flanagan) is Japanese. She gave birth to twin daughters.Day by Day Cartoon by Chris Muir :: November 23, 2007 Archives Zed and Sam more often than not side with Damon, and both carry concealed handguns. Strips often center about the generational aspects between the forty-something Zed and Sam and the twenty-something Damon and Jan. ** Caroline Owens and Catherine Owens are Zed and Sam's twin daughters. Sam was recently pregnant again, but suffered a miscarriage possibly brought on by the shock of seeing a severely wounded Zed in the hospital. * Damon Thomas is an African-American conservative and a self-taught programmer. He has explicitly stated in the past that he was orphaned in early childhood. He frequently accuses the Democratic Party as a whole of being racist. When his beachfront home was razed by the town (in a commentary on Kelo v. New London), he began living with, and is now married to, Jan. They have one son. * Jan Portago is an ardent liberal marketing director, who does not seem to understand how Damon can be both black and conservative. At some point after Damon moved in with her after losing his house, they began a romantic relationship, and have since been married. Prior to the beginning of their romance, Jan secretly went out of her way to prevent him from leaving their company. ** Javier Luciano Thomas is Damon and Jan's son. * M. Luciano de la Portago y Verrillo is Jan's father and an entrepreneur. When Damon took offense at the politics of the company's majority shareholder, he, at Jan's request, persuaded them to sell their stock so that Damon would not resign. * Skye Flanagan is Sam's younger sister, introduced to the strip in June 2006. She is as liberal as Jan, if not more so. Facially, she resembles Sam, but she has brown hair rather than Sam's flaming red hair, and has a number of piercings and tattoos. She is happy for Sam and Zed, despite the fact that he is \\"some conservative guy\\". She was romantically involved with Dmitri Anatoly, but they split after a short time. After Dimitri left, she discovered that she was pregnant. * Dimitri Anatoly is a Russian asset rescued from Afghanistan by Zed and brought to the U.S. He and Skye were involved for a short time, but eventually split. * Suzi Strom was a young intern who was openly attracted to Zed, despite the large age gap between them. (Zed did not reciprocate.) She left the company off-panel at some point in 2006. In the December 19th 2017 strip, Zed informs Sam that Suzi \\"went back to Sweden years ago, where she was raped to death by her new Muslim boyfriend.\\" https://www.daybydaycartoon.com/comic/metoo/ * Naomi Rivka Levy is a private military contractor working in Iraq, who had previously served as Zed's spotter during his time as a sniper. It is revealed that Jan's father hired her to keep an eye on his daughter while she is in Iraq, but Jan's obvious and undisguised disdain of her and mercenaries in general complicates matters. She is Israeli, as Jan seems somewhat shocked to note.Day by Day Cartoon by Chris Muir :: July 16, 2007 Archives * Lieutenant Markos Anderson is a U.S. Army Infantry Officer in Iraq whose platoon Jan is embedded with. He is dedicated and takes his work seriously, reprimanding his troops for ogling Jan on numerous occasions, but also demonstrates a wry sense of humor when Jan's preconceptions about Iraq and the American military are made known. Creator Chris Muir, cartoonist The Day by Day strip is drawn by cartoonist Chris Muir (born October 30, 1958, in Syracuse, New York). Prior to that, he drew a single- panel comic called Altered States for about five years for Florida Today (a Gannett newspaper). Muir currently lives in Florida. As to the strip's political viewpoint, Muir stated that he \\"wanted to present the point of view that I never see represented in what I call Old Media: the papers, magazines, TV (until Fox News), etc. Where's the voice of the other half, the moderate- conservative half of America, on ethics, economy, politics and the age-old dynamic betwixt men and women?\\" The strip is popular amongst conservative bloggers, and often mentions bloggers and blog posts. Muir cites the work of several other cartoonists as inspiration, including Gary Larson and Garry Trudeau. In February 2007, Muir visited Iraq and was embedded for five days in Mosul.

Any eHow user can leave comments or responses, but only contracted writers can contribute changes to articles. The writers work on a freelance basis, being paid by article. eHow is frequently called a content farm. History Old logo, used until 2011 Logo used 2011-2016 eHow was founded by Courtney Rosen in 1999. On 8 February 2001 it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. At that time it had $1.16 million in assets and $7.2 million in debts and had used up $23.5 million in venture capital funding in a year and a half that came from companies including Hummer Winblad Venture Partners ($1.3 million) and Dominion Ventures ($982,035). eHow's major debts included $598,460 owed to Vignette Corp., $140,024 to Engage Media in San Francisco and $237,492 to LifeMinders. The Silicon Valley Bank seized $180,548 that was in EHow's accounts to pay off outstanding loans. eHow was acquired by Demand Media in 2006. Originally it was a source of written articles and step-by-step instructions. At the time of its acquisition it had 17,000 articles and 5.8 million visitors a month. A year after purchasing the website Demand Media introduced the video format. In 2008 the site won a Mashable Blogger's Choice award in the 2nd Annual Open Web Awards.Demand Media (2012), About Us at www.ehow.com/about-us.html, Retrieved 28 November 2012 In 2009 the website introduced a mobile version for cell phone users and also was a CNET Webware 100 Winner in the category of Search & Reference. That same year Demand Media merged their acquisition of Expert Village into eHow and opened a branch operation in the United Kingdom. The moves gave eHow over one million articles and videos available on-line in 2009 and doubled that number by the following year. In 2010 they received a New Media Award. It was in 2009 that eHow was noted as having changed its method of identifying content to contract for creation. The company moved from human-identified lists of potential content to the use of a computer-based algorithm, a move that increased revenue by a factor of 4.9 times per article or video created. Getting rid of the human editors who formerly identified and approved content to be produced increased profits for the company by a factor of 20–25 times. The automated program combines search data, internet traffic patterns and the rates of keyword use and uses this information to determine what internet users want to know and also calculates how much money advertisers will pay to appear on the same page content created. Another algorithm, called the Knowledge Engine, then works out what exactly internet users want to know about the subjects identified and details exactly how to approach profitable subjects and what its potential subject longevity is. The machine-created subjects are then proofread by freelance proofreaders for 8 cents each, to ensure that they are clear enough for bidding on by freelance article and video producers. Content producers are then paid about US$15 per article or US$20 per video to produce the product. This change resulted in the Demand Media making an estimated US$200 million in revenue in 2009, including from Google's advertising income. In 2011 the site released an iPad application, providing a direct shortcut to the website. That same year the site received a reorganization and overhaul of its look, consolidating its now three million articles and videos into six categories: Home, Health, Food, Style, Money and Family. In 2011 the site was adding more than 5,000 articles and videos a day while employing 13,000 freelance writers, editors and producers. In 2012 a seventh category was added, entitled Mom, focusing on parenting and family issues. Criticisms Demand Media and eHow in particular have been criticized for large amounts of low-quality content and for operating as a content farm, paying contributors low rates for content intended to rank high in search results, rather than focus on quality information, with poor quality articles intended mainly to drive up search results rather than inform. In 2010 and 2011 Google implemented changes to their algorithms intending to reduce the ranking and impact of content farms. These changes led to a 40% drop in traffic to Demand Media sites. Demand Media responded to the algorithm changes, saying their business model remained solid. Jack Herrick, former owner of eHow, started up wikiHow after concluding that the wiki method of content creation would ultimately produce higher quality work. He described the difference between eHow and wikiHow as \\"eating a McDonald's burger vs. a wonderful, home cooked meal\\" Search engine DuckDuckGo's CEO Gabriel Weinberg has criticized eHow, along with other Demand Media websites, labeling the company a \\"content mill,\\" because of the website's search engine driven content, low article quality and low writer salaries. DuckDuckGo filters out eHow content because of Weinberg's perception that Demand Media produces low-quality content designed specifically to rank highly in Google Searches for the purposes of promoting advertising. Another search engine, Blekko also regarded eHow as spam, blacklisted the site and filtered eHow results out. Wired magazine has also criticized eHow and Demand Media, calling their content: \\"slapdash\\" and a \\"factory stamping out moneymaking content\\".

It is one of the Palliser Islands, a subgroup of the Tuamotu Archipelago. Apataki is located approximately northeast of the island of Tahiti, east of Arutua and northeast of Kaukura. The island is approximately rectangular; it is long and wide. It has a total area of approximately 706 km2 with a land area of approximately . Two navigable passes enter its wide lagoon. , Apataki Atoll has 350 inhabitants, down from 492 in 2007. The main village is called Niutahi. History The first recorded European to sight Apataki Atoll was Dutch navigator Jakob Roggeveen in 1722. It was visited by James Cook in 1774. Apataki appears in some maps as \\"Hagemeister Island\\".> On 27 May 1902, while Paul Gauguin was living in the Marquesas Islands, the mail-boat Croix du Sud between Papeete and Atuona was shipwrecked at Apataki. leading to a three-month loss of supplies for the islanders.Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin in the South Seas, 1965, George Allen and Unwin, pp. 252, 263 There is a territorial (domestic) airfield in Apataki which was inaugurated in 1977. Administration Administratively, Apataki Atoll is part of the commune of Arutua. Images & Maps Economy Apataki has an airport but no tourism industry. The only main industry of the island is cultured Tahitian (black) pearls. The coconut palm, which forms the basis for copra (dried coconut) production, used to be of special economic importance to the islanders. On a few islands, the residents cultivate vanilla. Agriculture is generally limited to simple subsistence. Pandanus leaves are traditionally woven together as roof thatch (although corrugated sheet metal is also used today), as well as for other items such as mats and hats. Apataki's two large reef passes provide excellent diving and surfing, both of which are serviced by local boat-based charter companies. Land-based accommodations do not exist. Cuisine Fruit and vegetable staples include yams, taro, and breadfruit, as well as a wide range of tropical fruits. Flora and fauna The sparse soil of Apataki cannot sustain a great variety of vegetation. The animal life on the islands consists mostly of seabirds, landcrabs, insects, and lizards. The underwater fauna, however, is rich and varied, making scuba diving a popular activity for tourists.

He proposed that this magnetic field resulted from electric currents induced in the fluid outer core of the Earth. He revealed the history of the Earth's magnetic field by the study of the magnetic orientation of minerals in rocks.March 20 - Today in Science History - Scientists born on March 20th, died, and events. He was also the first to suggest that the wave-like nature of matter might be investigated by electron scattering experiments using crystalline solids. The Olin Hall at the Johns Hopkins University has a Walter Elsasser Memorial in the lobby. Biography Elsasser was born in 1904 to a Jewish family in Mannheim, Germany. Before he became known for his geodynamo theory, while in Göttingen during the 1920s, he had suggested the experiment to test the wave aspect of electrons. This suggestion of Elsasser was later communicated by his senior colleague from Göttingen (Nobel Prize recipient Max Born) to physicists in England. This explained the results of the Davisson-Germer and Thomson experiments later awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1935, while working in Paris, Elsasser calculated the binding energies of protons and neutrons in heavy radioactive nuclei. Wigner, Jensen and Goeppert-Mayer received the Nobel in 1963 for work developing out of Elsasser's initial formulation. Elsasser therefore came quite close to a Nobel prize on two occasions. During 1946-47, Elsasser published papers describing the first mathematical model for the origin of the Earth's magnetic field. He conjectured that it could be a self- sustaining dynamo, powered by convection in the liquid outer core, and described a possible feedback mechanism between flows having two different geometries, toroidal and poloidal (indeed, inventing the terms). This had been developed from about 1941 onwards, partly in his spare time during his scientific war service with the U.S. Army Signal Corps. During his later years, Elsasser became interested in what is now called systems biology and contributed a series of articles to Journal of Theoretical Biology. The final version of his thoughts on this subject can be found in his book Reflections on a Theory of Organisms, published in 1987 and again posthumously with a new foreword by Harry Rubin in 1998. Elsasser died in 1991 in Baltimore, Maryland, US. Biotonic laws A biotonic law, a phrase invented by Elsasser, is a principle of nature which is not contained in the principles of physics. Biotonic laws may also be considered as local instances of global organismic or organismal principles,Łukasiewicz-Topos Models of Neural Networks, Cell Genome and Interactome Nonlinear Dynamic Models http://en.scientificcommons.org/23394472 such as the Organismic Principle of Natural Selection. * Gatherer D: Finite universe of discourse. The systems biology of Walter Elsasser. The Open Biology Journal 2 4-15 Some, but not all, of Elsasser's theoretical biology work is still quite controversial, and in fact may disagree with several of the basic tenets of current systems biology that he may have helped to develop. Basic to Elsasser's biological thought is the notion of the great complexity of the cell. Elsasser deduced from this that any investigation of a causative chain of events in a biological system will reach a \\"terminal point\\", where the number of possible inputs into the chain will overwhelm the capacity of the scientist to make predictions, even with the most powerful computers. This might seem like a counsel of despair, but in fact Elsasser was not suggesting the abandonment of biology as a worthwhile research topic, but rather for a different kind of biology such that molecular causal chains are no longer the main focus of study. Correlation between supra-molecular events would become the main data source. Moreover, the heterogeneity of logical classes encompassed by all biological organisms without exception is an important part of Elsasser's legacy to both Complex systems biology and Relational Biology.Baianu, I.C. 2006. \\"Robert Rosen's work and complex systems biology\\", Axiomathes, Vol. 16: 25-34; https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10516-005-4204-z  Publications  * The Physical Foundation of Biology.

In Western art, primitivism typically has borrowed from non- Western or prehistoric people perceived to be \\"primitive\\", such as Paul Gauguin's inclusion of Tahitian motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from \\"primitive\\" or non-Western art has been important to the development of modern art.Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.See especially Marianna Torgovnick. Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, Literary Primitivism (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism. The term \\"primitivism\\" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of naïve or folk art like Henri Rousseau, Mikhail Larionov, Paul Klee and others.  Philosophy  Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional \\"state of nature\\" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond \\"civilization\\" (cultural primitivism).A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935). The desire of the \\"civilized\\" to be restored to a \\"state of nature\\" is as longstanding as civilization itself. In antiquity the superiority of \\"primitive\\" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the Golden Age, depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the Pastoral. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system. During the Enlightenment, the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” The Yearbook of English Studies, 13 (1983), 32–45. In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist Giambattista Vico (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than \\"civilized\\" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature. In the 18th century, the German scholar Friedrich August Wolf identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (Prolegomena to Homer, 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by Herder.See Isaiah Berlin, Vico and Herder (New York: Viking, 1976). Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.See William Rubin, \\"Modernist Primitivism, 1984,\\" p. 320 in Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History, Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors. The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of historicism, or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. Neoclassicism in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such \\"historicist\\" movement in art was the Nazarene movement in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian \\"primitive\\" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting). Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the Pre-Raphaelites, who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of John Ruskin, who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of. Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of Realism in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of non-Euclidean geometry, which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art (Princeton University Press, 19810). The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in Beaux Arts Schools of Academic painting, which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up Renaissance perspective painting as the culmination of civilization and knowledge. Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art. In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to Japanese and Chinese art, which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and tribal art fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting. Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as pastoral art had done for millennia.Connelly, F, The Sleep of Reason, (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5. Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century \\"historicism\\", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors. The painting of Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso and the music of Igor Stravinsky are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, is \\"primitivist\\" in so far as its programmatic subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre- Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict \\"Dionysian\\" modernism, i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more \\"Apollonian\\" neoclassicism, to use Nietzsche's terminology, although in his use of serialism he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein. Origins of modernist primitivism Fang mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the \\"Age of Discovery\\", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to colonialism.Diamond, S: In Search of the Primitive, (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217. As the European Enlightenment. With the decline of feudalism, philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the New World. From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is \\"the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities\\".Diamond 1974, p. 215. Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization. The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to \\"primitive\\" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the hieroglyph, emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.Robert Goldwater, Primitivism in Modern Art, rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967). According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of Africa and the Oceanic islands that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their \\"white, Western, and preponderantly male quest\\" for the \\"elusive ideal\\" of the primitive, \\"whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference.\\"See Solomon- Godeau 1986, p. 314. These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well. Paul Gauguin Paul Gauguin. Spirit of the Dead Watching, 1892. Oil on canvas. Albright Knox Art Gallery Painter Paul Gauguin sought to escape European civilization and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of Tahiti and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe. Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch (1892), Parau na te Varua ino (1892), Anna the Javanerin (1893), Te Tamari No Atua (1896), and Cruel Tales (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly Arcadia of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical pastoral of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called \\"Tahitian Pastoral\\" and another \\"Where Do We Come From\\".Writing about \\"Where Do We Come From?\\" in a review entitled \\"Back to Paradise\\", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: \\"Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape--for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution--could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne.\\" In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non- European models. Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist postcolonial critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324. They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is \\"wrong\\" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the \\"dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal\\".Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315. To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in \\"an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness\\" with \\"Otherness\\". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to Exoticism and Orientalism, as critiqued by Edward Said, in which European imperialism and monolithic and degrading views of the \\"East\\" by the \\"West\\" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.(See Edward Said's 1978 book, Orientalism). Fauves and Pablo Picasso Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of Picasso's African-inspired period. In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, in part because of the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence. Artists including Maurice de Vlaminck, André Derain, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. Pablo Picasso, in particular, explored Iberian sculpture, African sculpture, African traditional masks, and other historical works including the Mannerist paintings of El Greco, resulting in his masterpiece Les Demoiselles D'Avignon and, eventually, the invention of Cubism.Cooper, 24 The generalizing term \\"primitivism\\" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65. Anticolonial primitivism Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about \\"primitive\\" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.See Ben Etherington, Literary Primitivism (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018). The work of artists connected with the Négritude movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. Négritude was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre- colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002. When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, The Jungle, Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar. Museum exhibitions on primitivism in modern art In November of 1910, Roger Fry organized the exhibition titled Manet and the Post- Impressionists held at the Grafton Galleries in London. This exhibition showcased works by Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, Édouard Manet, Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, and other artists. This exhibition was meant to bring England up to date on the art that had taken place in France for the past 30 years. However, the critics in London were shocked by what they saw. Some called Fry “mad” and “crazy” for showing such artwork to the people of London.Frances Spalding, “Roger Fry and His Critics in a Post-Modernist Age,” The Burlington Magazine 128, no. 1000 (1986): 490. Fry’s exhibition called attention to primitivism in modern art even if he did not intend for it to happen. Scholar Marianna Torgovnick stated that this exhibition was viewed as “the English debut of the primitive in high culture.” Marianna Torgovnick, Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern Lives, Nachdr. (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1990), 104. In 1984, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City had a new exhibition focusing on primitivism in modern art. Instead of pointing out the obvious issues, the exhibition celebrated the use of non- Western objects as inspiration for the modern artists. The director of the exhibition, William Rubin, took Roger Fry’s exhibition one step farther by displaying the modern works of art juxtaposed to the non-Western objects themselves. Rubin stated, “That he was not so much interested in the pieces of ‘tribal’ art in themselves but instead wanted to focus on he ways in which modern artists ‘discovered’ this art.” William Rubin et al., eds., “Primitivism” in 20th Century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern (New York : Boston: Museum of Modern Art ; Distributed by New York Graphic Society Books, 1984). He was trying to show there was an ‘affinity’ between the two types of art. Scholar Jean-Hubert Martin argued this attitude effectively meant that the ‘tribal’ art objects were “given the status of not much more than footnotes or addenda to the Modernist avant-garde.” Jean-Hubert Martin, The Whole Earth Show, interview by Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, July 1989. Rubin’s exhibition was divided into four different parts: Concepts, History, Affinities, and Contemporary Explorations. Each section meant to serve a different purpose in showing the connections between modern art and non- Western ‘art.’ In 2017, the Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac in collaboration with the Musée National Picasso-Paris, put on the exhibition Picasso Primitif. Yves Le Fur, the director, stated he wanted this exhibition to invite a dialogue between “the works of Picasso – not only the major works but also the experiments with aesthetic concepts – with those, no less rich, by non-Western artists.\\" Yves Le Fur, “Picasso Primitif,” Exhibition Leaflet, Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac, 2017, 2. Picasso Primitif meant to offer a comparative view of the artist’s works with those of non-Western artists. The resulting confrontation was supposed to reveal the similar issues those artists have had to address such as nudity, sexuality, impulses and loss through parallel plastic solutions. In 2018, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts had an exhibition titled From Africa to the Americas: Face-to-Face Picasso, Past and Present. The MMFA adapted and expanded on Picasso Primitif by bringing in 300 works and documents from the Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac and the Musée National Picasso-Paris. Nathalie Bondil saw the issues with the ways in which Yves Le Fur presented Picasso’s work juxtaposed to non- Western art and objects and found a way to respond to it. The headline of this exhibition was, “A major exhibition offering a new perspective and inspiring a rereading of art history.”“From Africa to the Americas: Face-to-Face Picasso, Past and Present,” The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, accessed December 3, 2018. The exhibition looked at the transformation in our view of the arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas from the end of the 19th century to the present day. Bondil wanted to explore the question about how ethnographic objects come to be viewed as art. She also asked, “How can a Picasso and an anonymous mask be exhibited in the same plane?” Ian McGillis, “MMFA Show Shines a Light on How Picasso Tapped into Africa to Redefine Art in the 20th Century,” Montreal Gazette, May 4, 2018.

Such officers are treated for most intents and purposes as commissioned officers.

The subordinate officer's rank insignia is a single narrow strip of gold braid worn on the cuff of the Service Dress jacket, or on slip-ons on the shoulders of other uniforms. Unlike that of commissioned officers, the peak of the service dress cap (if worn) is plain, identical to that of non-commissioned members (NCMs). However, cap badges and other accoutrements are those of commissioned officers which are different from those of NCMs. In the Royal Canadian Navy, Elliot's Eye (the Executive Curl) is absent from the visible rank. Subordinate officers are addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\" by non-commissioned members, and by rank and name by superior officers. As they do not hold commissions they are not required to be saluted. They may however hold positions of authority, either in an acting capacity or for training purposes, such as second-in-command of a platoon, under the close supervision of a superior officer.

Before that, he served in both houses of the state legislature, and was elected as the Senate Majority Leader by the end of his term.Politics: \\"Loren Leman\\", Russian- American Heritage Museum He served in office in electoral politics from 1989 to 2006. When Leman was elected as lieutenant governor in 2002, he was the first person of Alaska Native ancestry to be elected to statewide office in Alaska. He also has Russian-Polish ancestry. Early life and family Leman was born in Pomona, California, and grew up in Ninilchik, Alaska, in a Russian-speaking family of Alutiiq and Russian-Polish ancestry. They were commercial fishermen. He watched his father operate a fish trap during Territorial days, before this fishing method was outlawed by referendum in 1959. He subsequently has worked the family salmon setnet operation on Cook Inlet near Ninilchik. He longlined for halibut in Cook Inlet and harvested herring roe on kelp in Prince William Sound. Leman traces his long family history in Alaska to the marriage in Kodiak in 1798 between a Russian shipbuilder and an Alutiiq woman from Afognak. He graduated from Ninilchik High School in 1968. He received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Oregon State University in 1972 and master's degree in civil/environmental engineering from Stanford University in 1973. He and his wife Carolyn raised three children; Rachel, Joseph, and Nicole. Their younger daughter, Nicole, died in a hiking accident in New Zealand in December 2015. Political career Leman joined the Republican Party in Alaska and became politically active. He was elected in 1988 to the Alaska state house, representing west Anchorage and serving until 1993. He was known as a social conservative, pro-development, pro-business, environmentally-conscious, a supporter of Alaska's military and taxpayer-friendly. In 1992 he was elected to represent northwest Anchorage in the State Senate, serving from January 1993 to December 2002. In addition to other assignments, he chaired the Senate State Affairs, Labor & Commerce and Resources committees, and served on its Finance Committee. In his last term, he was elected as Senate Majority Leader. Lieutenant governor In November 2002, Leman became the first person of Alaska Native ancestry to be elected to statewide office when he won the position of Alaska's eighth lieutenant governor. In the fall of 2002 Leman had campaigned to win the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. His opponents were Gail Phillips, State Representative from Homer; Robin Taylor, State Senator from Wrangell; and Sarah Palin, who had been a mayor of Wasilla. Leman won. Palin was a close second, within 2,000 votes. She later ran for Vice President on a ticket with Senator John McCain for president. As lieutenant governor, Leman continued his interests in budget discipline, education accountability, promoting wise use of Alaska's natural resources, and supporting the right to life. Leman was an advocate for fiscal responsibility through adopting and following a five-year plan to reduce State spending by $250 million. A social conservative, he led efforts to require parental notification for girls seeking to have abortions and was a prime sponsor of a 1998 Alaska constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He was active on the multi-state Energy Council, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, and Pacific States Legislative Task Force. He taught the Alaska constitution and legislative process to Boys and Girls State delegates, \\"Winning Women\\" seminars, and has been a guest lecturer to high school and University of Alaska students. During his four years as lieutenant governor, Leman led Alaska's Faith-Based & Community Initiatives, to develop synergies between government and Alaska's faith communities. After the initiative had been underway for a year, the White House recognized Alaska as a \\"role model State\\" for its FBCI achievements. Lieutenant Governor Leman spoke on the role of people of faith in politics and community service. He represented the State as one of seven commissioners on the Denali Commission, a unique State-federal cooperative effort to improve health care, energy, transportation, economic opportunities and workforce development, primarily in rural Alaska. There was speculation Leman might run for governor in 2006, either challenging Frank Murkowski in the primary or running for an open seat if Murkowski retired. Leman planned an announcement in February 2006, but postponed the news to talk more with his family about the decision. In late May 2006, Murkowski announced his plans to run for reelection. A few days later, Leman declined a run for the office (saying Murkowski's decision was only one of many factors) and also opted out of a second term as lieutenant governor.Sutton, Anne. (2006-05-30). Republican Sean Parnell succeeded Leman. Transportation improvements Loren Leman has long maintained an avid interest in transportation improvements in Alaska. He has managed projects to improve airports, was an early supporter of the Alaska Aerospace Development Corporation's launch facilities on Kodiak, served on the Board of Directors of the Challenger Learning Center in Kenai, and as the national chairman of the Aerospace States Association, an organization of lieutenant governors and governor-appointed delegates from space ports and academia who advise Congress on aviation and space issues. He was a sponsor of legislation to enable the Alaska Railroad to complete a track realignment and improvement project from Ship Creek to Wasilla. He has championed road, port and harbor, and building improvements and served on the Legislature's Deferred Maintenance Task Force in the mid-1990s, identifying more than $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvement needs. His other work history includes consulting civil/environmental engineering and fishing. A registered civil engineer in Alaska, Leman has had engineering work during the past 43 years that has spanned the entire State, from Ketchikan to Kotzebue, Unalaska to Wasilla to Yakutat. Legacy and honors *In 1999 then-Senator Leman won the national Civil Government award from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the world's premier civil engineering society, for his work in improving education, developing resources and improving transportation in Alaska.

It was released in October 1985 through Homestead Records, while the band were on their first US tour. It is considered the first grunge record because it was released several months before the Deep Six album that was compiled by six other Seattle grunge bands.  Overview  In the early 1980s, the Seattle branch of the indie movement was influenced by punk rock, however it removed its speed and its structure and added elements of metal. Although Malfunkshun and Soundgarden were more popular in Seattle at this time, Green River was the first band of this movement to release a recording. Come On Down has been described as a balance between punk and metal, being similar to a mashup of 1980s metal together with early Mudhoney, and with the sound being \\"dirty\\". In audio engineering, the term \\"dirty\\" or \\"fuzzy\\" describes \\"the opposite of clear, clean sound. A dirty tone would have some amount of noise, distortion, or overdrive in the signal.\\" This record also marks Green River's only record with original guitarist Steve Turner (later of Mudhoney), other than the 2016 LP release of 1984 Demos, and the 2019 LP release of Live At The Tropicana. Turner left the group due to his dissatisfaction with bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's heavy metal leanings. The record was released to little fanfare, and did not sell well. Allmusic describes the EP as \\"a worthwhile listen but not something that points towards the bright futures that its band members would enjoy.\\" It contains the first recording of the song \\"Swallow My Pride\\", a song describing a lover's disdain for his girlfriend's feverish American patriotism, which was later re-recorded for the band's debut album, Rehab Doll. In mid-1985, Green River embarked on its first nationwide tour to promote Come On Down. Release of the record was delayed however, thus negating the purpose of the tour. From all accounts the experience was less than positive, though it did help cement alliances with other emerging American indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. In 1986, the band continued to play in and around the Pacific Northwest to steadily larger crowds (most notably in Seattle). Leighton Beezer, who played with Mark Arm and Steve Turner in The Thrown Ups, states that when he first heard Green River play Come On Down, he realized that they were playing punk rock backwards. Additionally, he noted that the augmented fifth note was used by Black Sabbath to produce an ominous feeling but it is not used in punk rock. In the 1996 grunge film documentary Hype!, Beezer demonstrated on guitar the difference between punk and grunge. First he played the riff from Rockaway Beach by The Ramones that ascends the neck of the guitar, then Come On Down by Green River that descends the neck. The two pieces are only a few notes apart but sound completely unalike. He took the same rhythm with the same chord, however descending the neck made it sound darker, and therefore grunge. Your Own Best Friend (Demo) is a bonus track on the 2018 remaster. The album’s title track discusses the Green River murders from the murderer’s (Ridgway's) point of view. Ridgway is the second most prolific serial killer in the U.S.  Track listing   Personnel  ;Green River * Jeff Ament – bass guitar, back and sleeve designs * Mark Arm – vocals * Stone Gossard – guitar * Steve Turner – guitar * Alex Vincent – drums ;Production * Green River – production, cover concept * Chris Hanzsek – production, engineering * Charles Peterson – photography, cover concept * Paul Scoles – assistance  References  Bibliography * Category:1985 debut EPs Category:Green River (band) albums Category:Grunge EPs Category:Homestead Records EPs Category:Albums produced by Jeff Ament Category:Albums produced by Stone Gossard ","title":"Come On Down (EP)"},{"id":"2169497","title":"List of newspapers in Canada by circulation"},{"id":"2169498","text":"Neville Chamberlain showing the Anglo-German Declaration (the resolution) to commit to peaceful methods signed by both Hitler and himself, on his return from Munich on 30 September 1938 \\"Peace for our time\\" was a declaration made by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Neville Chamberlain in his 30 September 1938 speech concerning the Munich Agreement and the subsequent Anglo-German Declaration. The phrase echoed Benjamin Disraeli, who, upon returning from the Congress of Berlin in 1878, stated, \\"I have returned from Germany with peace for our time\\". It is primarily remembered for its ironic value: less than a year after the agreement, Hitler's continued pressure for return of the Polish corridor and his subsequent invasion of Poland were followed by declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. It is often misquoted as \\"peace in our time\\", a phrase already familiar to the British public by its longstanding appearance in the Book of Common Prayer. A passage in that book translated from the 7th-century hymn \\"Da pacem, Domine\\" reads \\"Give peace in our time, O Lord; because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.\\" It is unknown how deliberate Chamberlain's use of such a similar phrase was. Speeches Chamberlain's aeroplane landed at the Heston Aerodrome on 30 September 1938, and he spoke to the crowds there: > The settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem, which has now been achieved > is, in my view, only the prelude to a larger settlement in which all Europe > may find peace. This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, > Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as > mine [shows paper to crowd]. Some of you, perhaps, have already heard what > it contains but I would just like to read it to you: \\" ... We regard the > agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic > of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.\\" Later that day he stood outside 10 Downing Street and again read from the document and concluded: > My good friends, for the second time in our history, a British Prime > Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honour. I believe it > is peace for our time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Go home > and get a nice quiet sleep. Chamberlain's return was not universally well-received. 15,000 people protested against the Munich agreement the same day in Trafalgar Square, three times more than welcomed him at 10 Downing Street. Due to Chamberlain's ongoing manipulation of the BBC, this news was largely suppressed at the time. Labour spokesman Hugh Dalton publicly suggested that the piece of paper which Chamberlain was waving was \\"torn from the pages of Mein Kampf.\\" Disbelieving Chamberlain, Isaac Asimov published in July 1939 \\"Trends\\", which mentions a World War in 1940. He later wrote \\"I was too conservative\\" (about when war would begin). Cultural references Peace In Our Time is the title of a 1947 stage play by Noël Coward. Set in an alternative 1940, the Battle of Britain has been lost, the Germans have supremacy in the air and the United Kingdom is under Nazi occupation. Inspired to write this play in 1946 after seeing the effects of the occupation of France Coward wrote: \\"I began to suspect the physical effect of four years' intermittent bombing is far less damaging to the intrinsic character of a nation than the spiritual effect of four years of enemy occupation\\". \\"Peace in Our Time\\" is a 1984 satirical song by Elvis Costello which references Chamberlain. It is featured on the album Goodbye Cruel World. U.S. President John F.

The superhero character is modeled closely after the main character of The Secrets of Isis, a live-action American Saturday morning television program starring Joanna Cameron that served as the second half of The Shazam!/Isis Hour. The television character appeared in several late 1970s DC Comics publications. A subsequent incarnation of the character was introduced into the DC Universe in 2006 as a female counterpart to the character Black Adam, a part of the Shazam! family of characters. The Egyptian goddess character has been depicted within the Wonder Woman comic book. Live- action programs introduced characters inspired by Isis beginning in the 2000s. The 2001 - 2011 television show Smallville depicted Isis as a superhero form taken on by Lois Lane (Erica Durance) when possessed by the Amulet of Isis in one episode, while Erica Cerra portrayed an Egyptologist named Adrianna Tomaz. Legends of Tomorrow introduced a new version of the character, named Zari Tomaz and portrayed by Tala Ashe. This version was portrayed as a wise- cracking hacker from the future with wind powers derived from an amulet and no superhero code name. Zari is a series regular starting from the season three's episode \\"Zari\\". The character is set to make her cinematic debut portrayed by Sarah Shahi in Black Adam. Fictional character biography =Andrea Thomas and Saturday morning television series= Joanna Cameron as Isis in The Secrets of Isis Like the main character of the first half of the program, Captain Marvel, Isis had roots in ancient Egyptian mythology. The Secrets of Isis starred Joanna Cameron as Andrea Thomas, a high school science teacher who gains the ability to call upon the powers of the goddess Isis after finding an Egyptian amulet during an archeological dig in Egypt, as revealed during the show's opening title sequence. Fifteen episodes of The Secrets of Isis were produced for The Shazam! Isis Hour, and the character also appeared in three episodes of the Shazam! portion of the show. The Secrets of Isis was given its own timeslot in 1977, for which seven new episodes were broadcast alongside reruns from the first two seasons. Isis later appeared in animated form on Filmation's Tarzan and the Super 7 show in 1980, as part of a segment called The Freedom Force. She later guest starred on The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!'s \\"Hero High\\" segment, though Cameron did not voice the character. Powers and abilities Isis demonstrated numerous powers that manifested when the need arose. These included flight, super speed, super strength (to a level comparable to Superman and Wonder Woman), telekinesis (the ability to move and levitate objects), geokinesis (the ability to control elements such as fire, earth, wind, and water), the ability to change the molecules of inanimate objects to allow people to pass through them, the ability to act as a human lightning rod, remote viewing, and (at her power's maximum) the ability to stop and reverse time. To activate these powers, Isis usually is shown reciting a rhyming chant (the most frequent being \\"Oh zephyr winds that blow on high, lift me now so I can fly!\\"). The medallion Andrea Thomas uses to change into Isis also gives her apparent limited powers even when in her non-Isis form, as she is shown communicating telepathically with her pet crow Tut and engaging in minor mind control even without changing. She also received superior hand-to-hand and weapons combat skills from the goddess. Love interests Andrea/Isis' love interest is fellow teacher Rick Mason (although this relationship is more implied than explicitly stated, the two characters are simply shown in many episodes enjoying each other's company: going on picnics, horseback riding, and going for dinner together). As in the classic Lois Lane example, Mason remains oblivious to the physical similarities between Andrea and Isis, beyond some idle speculation in early episodes. In one episode (\\"The Seeing Eye Horse\\") a blind character realizes that Isis and Andrea have almost identical voices, but otherwise the series never explored the secret identity dilemma in any serious way. During the abbreviated second season, cosmetic changes were made to the Isis character in terms of makeup and hairstyle. First appearance in comics Isis' first appearance in comics was in Shazam! #25 (Sept.–Oct. 1976). She was later given her own TV tie-in book the following month, titled The Mighty Isis, which ran for two years, out-surviving the TV series. The eight-issue run by DC Comics began in October 1976 and ended in January 1978; early issues featured a special \\"DC TV\\" logo. All stories starred the Andrea Thomas character from the television series; the book was edited by Denny O'Neil, written by Jack C. Harris and most issues illustrated by Mike Vosburg (the first issue was illustrated by Ric Estrada and Wallace Wood). Although early issues stayed within the format of the TV series, later issues covered storylines beyond the scope of the show, such as a story arc involving Andrea abandoning her \\"human\\" alter ego and cutting ties with her friends and family, resulting in Rick Mason revealing his love for her. Like other DC characters who have been reimagined, this version of Isis, though not mentioned or appearing in Crisis on Infinite Earths, can be assumed to have been retconned out of existence following the 1985 DC miniseries. =As a goddess within the DC Universe= In January 2002, DC Comics re-introduced the goddess Isis as one of the chief gods worshipped by the Bana-Mighdallian Amazons in the Wonder Woman comic. Although the Bana tribe was introduced in 1989, their gods were not shown until 2002. Her introduction depicted her in a standard white sleeveless gown and Egyptian headdress containing her trademark symbol. Later, the various Amazon gods were depicted as selecting more modern appearances for themselves. After this, Isis was then shown as wearing a black business suit with skirt, long straight black hair, and a neck choker containing an ankh. =Adrianna Tomaz= 52 The superhero Isis was re-introduced in the DC Universe in the weekly comic book 52, in issue #3 (May 2006). In this series, an Egyptian woman named Adrianna Tomaz (an homage to the Andrea Thomas character on the television program) is a refugee who is enslaved and brought to Black Adam as a gift from Intergang along with $2,000,000 in gold. Upon freeing her and killing the emissaries who had brought her to him, Black Adam found her to be unafraid and highly vocal about how he could change his country for the better. After weeks of discussion during which Adrianna changed the way Adam looked at the world and inspired him to commit kinder acts, Adam retrieved the magical amulet of Isis from the tomb of his wife and children, and asked Captain Marvel, now the Keeper of the Rock of Eternity, to confer its power on Adrianna. The Amulet of Isis had long ago belonged to another of the wizard Shazam's champions, Queen Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the 18th Dynasty, who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom. Upon Hatshepsut's death the amulet became dormant.52 Week 12 (July 26, 2006) Artwork for the cover of 52 Week Twelve, the debut of the character as Isis within the main DC Comics continuity. Art by J. G. Jones. Upon holding the amulet and speaking \\"I am Isis,\\" Adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. She and Adam then began traveling the Middle East and freeing enslaved children, hoping to find Adrianna's kidnapped brother.52 Week 13 (August 2, 2006) In Week 16 of the series, Adam proposes marriage to Isis, offering a jewel given to Cleopatra by Caesar; they are wed by Captain Marvel, who invokes the gods of all the universes and planets. Intergang unsuccessfully attempts to ruin the wedding with a suicide bomber. Several other Shazam! characters attend the ceremony, and Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel, Jr., Tawky Tawny and Uncle Dudley serve as members of the wedding party. Isis is a calming influence on Black Adam, transforming him from a ruthless dictator into a more benevolent figure. This incarnation of Isis has powers similar to Black Adam's. She can also heal wounds of nearly any severity. She has control over nature, related to her mood: rain falls when she's sad even if she is inside, flowers bloom when she is happy. Her first transformation is triggered by the phrase \\"I am Isis\\", but later transformations use the phrase, \\"Oh Mighty Isis\\" instead. Adrianna finally locates her brother Amon, who has been tortured and crippled by Whisper A'Daire for his refusal to join Intergang's religion of crime and for his multiple escape attempts. Isis stops Black Adam from taking revenge on the Intergang members. Isis is unable to fully heal Amon's wounds because they are too deep and complex. Black Adam asks Amon to say his name; upon doing so, Amon is struck by Shazam's mystic lightning bolt and transformed into Osiris. Reunited with her brother, Isis decides to change the world beginning with China. Osiris convinces her to also change the public perception of the Black Marvel Family. Isis coaxes Black Adam into joining them in a public unmasking of their secret identities and a public declaration of their good intentions for the future. The Black Marvels defeat the demon Sabbac at Halloween when he tries to sacrifice children to Neron, further increasing their popularity. During a charity dinner with Mrs. Sivana, Osiris befriends a humanoid crocodile, Sobek, that escaped from Sivana's lab. Amanda Waller is not convinced of the Black Marvels' good intentions, and she forms a new Suicide Squad. She sends the Persuader to attack Isis with his radioactive ax. Osiris rushes to help her and he cuts the Persuader in half. Osiris is distraught over the unintentional death, and Isis whisks him away from the scene. Photographic evidence of the incident turns public opinion against the Black Marvel Family. Osiris believes that his powers make him evil, and he blames Black Adam. A series of calculated events arranged by Intergang lead to Osiris' death at the hands of Sobek. The Black Marvels battle with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, manifested in physical forms controlled by Intergang and Doctor Sivana. Isis dies when she is infected with diseases from the Horseman, Pestilence, while she defends Adam against the Horseman, Death. Before she dies, Isis tells Adam that she was wrong in trying to change him, and she begs him to avenge her and Osiris' deaths. Adam's path of vengeance instigates World War III. Several weeks later, an unidentified individual takes Isis' amulet; Adrianna appears to be trapped inside it. One Year Later In Black Adam: The Dark Age, Adam (now under his civilian title of \\"Teth-Adam\\") gets into Khandaq under a false name, and takes her remains despite a shootout in which nearly all his men are killed. In the mountains, he is forced to eat his servant Hassan who offers himself to Black Adam. He fails to notice that he has dropped one of her fingers and her ring at the tomb. He resurrects Isis using the Lazarus Pit. Her resurrection is short lived, as Adam is forced to kill Isis again upon seeing her new body rotting away as soon as she has come back to life. Her bones are then transferred to Doctor Fate's tower, where, with the assistance of Felix Faust, Adam turns them into a magical conduit to imbue himself with god-like powers taken from Isis' corpse itself. Apparently, Isis still could be revived, but every time Adam takes power from her, her bones become more brittle, jeopardizing a new attempt at resurrection. Faust reveals that it is Isis' amulet that can revive her, and that Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. broke it into four parts and scattered it across the globe. It is later revealed that the missing fragments of her body, the reason the Lazarus Pit failed, were being held by Atom- Smasher who found it when the Justice Society investigated the tomb. He meets Black Adam and gives them to him. Finally, Black Adam manages to find the pieces of the amulet and reunites it with the now-complete skeleton. The spell apparently backfires, resulting in a shambling, rotting corpse. A séance takes place in which Isis' spirit swears eternal hate for her husband, before returning to death. Black Adam flees, laden with guilt, emptiness, and rage; then Faust begins the real rite, having shown Black Adam the skeleton of Ralph Dibny as a way to hide the real Isis from him and blame \\"her\\" rotten condition on Black Adam's abuse of their now-shared powers. So Isis is able to be fully restored to life, even if bound by powerful spells to drain her will and bind her to mindless obedience. Now a mere puppet in Faust's hands, Isis' magic is used to free him from his imprisonment in Fate's tower by creating a magical doorway through the tower wall. Felix Faust then drags her away to a hideout, where it is strongly implied that he sexually assaults the paralyzed Isis.Black Adam: The Dark Age #6 (March 2008) Later, Black Adam, still mourning for her, finds a bloodied flower sprouting in their family shrine. He takes it as a sign that Isis is trying to communicate with him, which becomes apparent when he finds a larger collection of flowers in the shape of the Shazam lightning bolt symbol, pointing in the direction Adam must go to find her.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #16 (July 2008) Eventually, Black Adam finds Isis and Felix Faust, and Adam forces Faust to release Isis from his control. The resurrected Isis is far less merciful and forgiving than before, and castrates Faust for his treatment of her. Reunited, Isis and Adam travel to the Rock of Eternity, where they banish Captain Marvel back to Earth as a powerless Billy Batson (Isis has turned him back using magic lightning from saying Shazam from a spell book) and begin setting a plan in motion to \\"cleanse the Earth\\" of evil their way, even recruiting Mary Marvel to their crusade.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #23 (March 2009) The Justice Society come to the Rock of Eternity, seeking to help Billy, only for Isis to brutally attack them, even throwing Jay Garrick into the mists covering the Rock, from which there is no escape.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #24 (April 2009) During the course of the fight, the combatants end up in Kahndaq, where the people praise Black Adam's return. Isis then kills several of the followers, claiming that they are tainted by this new Earth. Black Adam attempts to protect his people, only to be attacked by Mary and Billy, who had been tainted by Mary's power. At that point, Jay Garrick appears with the spirit of Billy's father, and Shazam, whom the former had helped Jay recover from the Rock of Finality. Adam is convinced to return his power to Shazam so that the wizard's spirit can save Isis from her corruption. Shazam is released from his stone form. In turn, Shazam takes the power from Isis, Billy, and Mary, and transforms Teth-Adam and Adrianna into statues. Some time later, a shadowy figure appears to the statues in a bolt of lightning, wanting them to be his \\"champions.\\"Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #25 (May 2009) Brightest Day After the events of the Blackest Night storyline, Osiris is resurrected by the White Lantern Entity and returns to Khandaq, vowing to restore the kingdom to its former prosperity. Osiris takes the petrified bodies of Adam and Isis and flies off to an unknown destination.Brightest Day #0 (April 2010) Despite his best efforts, Osiris is unable to return Adam and Adrianna to their living states. He ultimately aligns himself with Deathstroke and his new team of Titans after being told that the mercenary can help him return his family to life.Titans: Villains For Hire Special (July 2010) Both Adrianna and Teth-Adam are currently stored in Deathstroke's base of operations, the Labyrinth.Titans (vol. 2) #24 (August 2010) It is ultimately revealed by the White Lantern Entity that Osiris was resurrected with the express purpose of saving Adrianna from her fate.Brightest Day #6 (September 2010) During a battle with a drug kingpin named Elijah, Osiris experiences a vision of Isis after falling asleep due to the villain Pisces. He is told that he is guilty for his hand in the murder of Ryan Choi, and that in order to free her, he will have to kill more people. Osiris accidentally electrocutes Elijah after waking from his vision after yelling 'Isis,' and returns home to find that more cracks have appeared on Isis' statue. He then surmises that it was Elijah's death which caused the cracks, and states that he will indeed have to kill more people to free Isis from her prison.Titans (vol. 2) #27 (November 2010) He then kills a guard at Arkham Asylum using his lightning channelled by saying 'Isis' again, although he seems to not enjoy this action, saying 'Great Ra forgive me.'Titans (vol. 2) #28 (December 2010) After killing two bank robbers, Osiris is confronted by Freddy Freeman. Somehow, Osiris manages to steal Freddy's power and give it to Isis. However, Isis' first words upon being reunited with her brother are \\"What have you done to me?\\"Titans (vol. 2) #32 (April 2011) It is soon revealed that the killings Osiris did in her name have corrupted her soul, causing her to haphazardly shift between her kind, caring personality and a callous, cruel one. When Osiris' back is turned, Isis breaks out of the Labyrinth.Titans (vol. 2) #33 (May 2011) She goes on a rampage, unable to stop herself from using nature to try to destroy the world. In desperation, she attempts to commit suicide by lightning, but Osiris shields her with his own body. When they awake, Isis discovers that the corruption has left her, but she still feels it inside Osiris, and it worries her.Titans (vol. 2) #34 (June 2011) It was later revealed by the Entity that Isis was brought back to life because she's the one that will aid the Swamp Thing.Brightest Day #24 (June 2011) Later, Isis aids her brother Osiris in stopping the Quraci soldiers who are attacking Khandaq. Isis learns that Osiris has become more violent, killing the soldiers. When the Justice League attacks Deathstroke's Titans, they are stopped by Isis, who forces them to leave Khandaq at once. She declares her rulership of Khandaq, and withdraws the country from the United Nations, stating that they will outlaw outsiders and recognize no power but their own, and that any intrusion will incite World War III. The Justice League's only option is to leave, and Deathstroke's Titans leave as well. Isis then tells Osiris that he is not welcome in Khandaq, because of his bloodlust.Titans Annual 2011 (July 2011) The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Adrianna Tomaz is a young woman who, by fighting pacifically against Khandaq's evil rule, is opposed to her brother Amon entering The Sons of Adam terrorist group. However, after he is killed by Khandaq's forces and she is forced to resurrect Black Adam, Adrianna decides to follow a path of violence, with an unknown voice saying that she will be chosen to wield power. Justice League of America v3, 7.4 (November 2013) Powers and abilities In order to change form, Adrianna must be able to say \\"I am Isis\\", thereby invoking spells involving the energies of the extra-dimensional being once known as Isis on Earth. This spell adds almost a hundred pounds of impervious godly muscle and tissue to her frame. This spell seems to be solely vocal; she cannot access this spell if she is gagged or hampered in some way from talking (the precision of this spell is somewhat erratic). All Adrianna has to say is \\"I am Isis\\" and she is mystically transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. It was later revealed that the powers that Adrianna draws from Isis are the most powerful of the eight Egyptian Gods. When her powers were possessed by Black Adam, he was able to fight off most of the superheroes on Earth alone. When Black Adam transferred both his and Isis's powers to Mary Marvel, she was able to easily withstand Darkseid's Omega Beams. After transforming, Adrianna/Isis gains physical abilities similar to her brother, husband, and the other Marvels. She is superhumanly strong and is easily capable of lifting far in excess of 100 tons, putting her on the same level as Supergirl, Power Girl, Mary Marvel, Donna Troy, Big Barda and Wonder Woman. Isis is also incredibly durable and cannot be harmed by physical force unless the being she is engaged with is stronger than her. She is also totally bulletproof and bladed weapons shatter against her skin. She is superhumanly fast, capable of moving at speeds past mach 10 on Earth. Isis also has far superior reflexes and agility when compared to normal humans or even other superhumans. She is also able to mystically fly through the air at incredible speeds and can travel across and around the planet in minutes. Like the other Marvels, Isis possesses an immense degree of superhuman intelligence, allowing her to come up with solutions to complicated problems quickly. Unlike the other Marvels, Isis's powers focus on the control of nature. She has control over water, fire, earth, air and electricity, and can control the weather and the lava within the Earth. These powers are tied to her emotions. When she cried, it began to rain and when she grew angry, enormous roses crushed the buildings around her. Simply put, Isis is nature and can control its every aspect. In addition to her manipulation of natural materials, Isis possesses the power of telekinesis, allowing her to lift objects, fire blasts of telekinetic force, and to create telekinetic shields. Isis's godly energies are able to heal nearly any wound that has been inflicted upon her with surprising speed (though she has died before). Using a second amulet, Isis is able to achieve clairvoyance and is able to see events happening in the present at remote locations. However, she cannot use this power to see into the past or the future. Due to her death and subsequent resurrection, Isis had a bit of trouble controlling her powers for a time. She stated that this was because Nature had deemed her a failed subject, but she has since regained full control. Other versions In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Isis is mentioned by her brother, Osiris, believing that she has been killed by the Atlanteans/Amazons war.Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint #1 (June 2011) It is revealed that Isis was held captive by the Outsider for Black Adam into selling the Outsider his home country, Khandaq. The Outsider then shot Black Adam and threw him off of his train, joining Isis as his trophy/prisoner.Flashpoint: The Outsider #2 (July 2011) In other media =Television= * The superhero version of Isis originated in the live-action Saturday morning program The Secrets of Isis, produced by Filmation and broadcast on CBS, both as part of The Shazam!/Isis Hour and on its own, from 1975 to 1977. * Isis was a main character of the TV series The Freedom Force, voiced by Diane Pershing. * The superhero version of the character appeared in the 10th season Smallville episode, \\"Isis\\". This version of the character appears when Lois Lane (portrayed by Erica Durance) is possessed by the Amulet of Isis. An homage to the comics character's secret identity and The Secrets of Isis television show also appears: Erica Cerra portrays a character named \\"Adrianna\\" who (like The Secrets of Isis' Andrea Thomas) is an Egyptologist and curator of the Metropolis Museum. * In Young Justice season 2 Episode 18 \\"Intervention\\", Zatanna called forth the spirit of Isis to give her the power to cleanse Blue and Green Beetle of the Reach control. * The superhero show Legends of Tomorrow introduced a version of Isis named Zari Tomaz, portrayed by Tala Ashe. She is a Muslim-American hacker from the year 2042, a future where an authoritarian A.R.G.U.S. has banned religion and metahuman activity. She harnesses her air manipulation powers from a totem similar to the one possessed by Amaya Jiwe/Vixen, both of which first appeared in the animated Arrowverse web series Vixen. Before Zari, the totem belonged to her brother who operated as an anti-A.R.G.U.S. vigilante and was killed for his resistance. Upon joining the time-traveling Legends, Zari hopes they will help save her brother and initially does not understand why the team only aims to fix time instead of improving it. Captain Sara Lance/White Canary explains that time is delicate and should not be messed with, sharing her own dilemma of not being able to save her sister. \\"Here I Go Again\\" is a bottle episode where Zari learns more about the Legends and becomes an official member of the team. In the Halloween-themed episode \\"Phone Home\\", Zari—who generally does not wear a superhero costume—briefly dons an outfit based upon that worn by Joanna Cameron in the original TV series. In the fifth season her future changed as Zari Tarazi and she became a media mogul and socialite, with her brother Behrad Tarazi (portrayed by Shayan Sobhian) taking control of the amulet. In \\"The Great British Fake-Off\\", another incarnation of Zari is disguised as Cleopatra when she first discovers her powers, also paying homage to Cameron's Isis. =Film= * Isis is set to appear in the upcoming Black Adam film, set in the DC Extended Universe, portrayed by Sarah Shahi. =Video games= * Isis appears in the MMORPG video game DC Universe Online voiced by Samantha Inoue-Harte. Felix Faust tricks Black Adam into giving him his power in order to revive Isis as a zombie. Faust escapes, and the players defeat Isis even though Black Adam vows that Faust will pay for his treachery and that the players will pay for sending Isis back to the dead. * Isis appears in Black Adam's ending for Injustice: Gods Among Us. Black Adam returns to Khandaq after defeating a totalitarian Superman, and decides with his queen Isis to magically separate Khandaq from the rest of the world. * Isis appears in Black Adam's ending for Injustice 2. When Isis fell victim to Brainiac's attack on Earth, Black Adam took her body to a Lazarus Pit somewhere in Khandaq where he encountered Ra's al Ghul who allowed Black Adam to use it in exchange for a partnership in their goals. DVD releases Fans of the TV series, with support from Joanna Cameron, lobbied for the release of the series to DVD for several years. BCI/Ink and Paint has released three DVD sets containing the TV character of Isis: *Space Sentinels /The Freedom Force—The Complete Series; August 22, 2006 *Hero High—The Complete Series; May 22, 2007 *The Secrets of Isis—The Complete Series DVD Set; July 24, 2007 Despite her stated support for the DVD release, Cameron did not participate in the release of the live-action series DVD.

John 1:1-6 with decorated headpiece Analysis The first chapter of the Gospel of John has 51 verses and may be divided in three parts: *The Prologue or Hymn to the Word (verses 1-18) *The testimony of John the Baptist (verses 19-34) *The first disciples (verses 35-51).The Jerusalem Bible (1966) uses this breakdown, although its primary analysis treats the Prologue as separate from , which covers \\"The First Passover\\" with five distinct components. English language versions which typically divide biblical chapters into sections often have more divisions: there are 5 sections in the New International Version and the Good News Translation, and 7 sections in the New King James Version. =Hymn to the Word (verses 1–18)= The end of Gospel of Luke and the beginning of Gospel of John on the same page in Codex Vaticanus (4th century). Codex Harcleianus (Lectionary 150) from 995 AD. The first part (verses 1–18), often called the Hymn to the Word, is a prologue to the gospel as a whole, stating that the Logos is \\"God\\" (\\"divine\\", \\"god-like\\", or \\"a god\\"Duff, Jeremy, The Elements of New Testament Greek (3rd ed.), Cambridge University Press, 2005. . \\"[W]e can't tell if the author meant the word was [a god] or [God],\\" says in p. 63, ft. 3. according to some translations). Comparisons can be made between these verses and the narrative of , where the same phrase In the beginning first occurs along with the emphasis on the difference between the darkness (such as the earth was formless and void, Genesis 1:2) and the light (the ability to see things not understood/hidden by the darkness, ). Methodist founder John Wesley summarised the opening verses of John 1 as follows: *John 1:1–2 describes the state of things before the creation * describes the state of things in the creation * describes the state of things in the time of man's innocence * describes the state of things in the time of man's corruption.Wesley, J., Notes on the Gospel according to Saint John on John 1:3, accessed 24 January 2015 According to the writers of the Pulpit Commentary, the phrase \\"the light of men\\" () \\"has been differently conceived by expositors. John Calvin supposed that the \\"understanding\\" was intended—\\"that the life of men was not of an ordinary description, but was united to the light of understanding,\\" and is that by which man is differentiated from animals. Hengstenberg regards it, in consequence of numerous associations of \\"light\\" with \\"salvation\\" in Holy Scripture, as equivalent to salvation; Christoph Ernst Luthardt with \\"holiness\\" and many with the \\"eternal life\\", which would introduce great tautology.\\"Pulpit Commentary on John 1, accessed 25 January 2016 English translations of variously translate the Greek as \\"understanding\\" (e.g. the New King James Version: \\"the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it\\"), but in other translations the meaning is given in terms of a struggle between darkness and light: \\"the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it\\" (Revised Standard Version). Verses 10 and 11 state that \\"He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him\\" but theologians differ in their interpretation of these verses. Wesley viewed \\"in the world\\" as meaning \\"even from the creation\\", the Pulpit Commentary speaks of the \\"pre-Incarnation activity\\" of the Word and Joseph Benson wrote that \\"He was in the world ... from the beginning, frequently appearing, and making known to his servants, the patriarchs and prophets, the divine will, in dreams and visions, and various other ways\\",Benson Commentary on John 1, accessed 27 January 2016 whereas in Albert Barnes' opinion, \\"He was in the world [...] refers, probably, not to his pre-existence, but to the fact that he became incarnate; that he dwelt among human beings\\".Barnes' Notes on the Bible on John 1, accessed 27 January 2016 Verse 14 :And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. KJV The word \\"flesh\\" is emphasized as a 'symbol of humanity', drawing the attention to 'the entry of the Word into the full flow of human affairs'. The summation of the comparison between darkness and light occurs in the statement \\"the law was given through Moses [...] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ\\" (). Here John successfully bridges the gap for the reader—including Jewish readers well- versed in the Torah—from the Law to the One who would fulfill the Law (such as the requirement of animal sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, ), Jesus. Verse 18 :No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. KJV The end verse of this prologue recalls the verse 1, that no other possibility of human to know God except through Jesus Christ. =Testimony of John the Baptist (verses 19–34)= John 1:29–35 on Papyrus 106, written in the 3rd century The second part () shows the preparation that John the Baptist was in the process of making for the coming of the Messiah, the Messiah's arrival and the Messiah's first disciples. John has been introduced in verse 6 (\\"a man sent from God\\")Sent \\"by\\" God in the New Century Version and some other translations and his witness, known already by the reader, has already been recalled: \\"This is the One I told you about\\". The Greek text has the past tense () but both Charles Ellicott and the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges prefer a present tense translation such as \\"John bears witness\\".Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers on John 1, and Plummer, A., Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on John 1, accessed 28 January 2016 Verses 19–34 present John's manifesto, delivered to the priests and Levites sent by the Pharisees to investigate his message and purpose. In response to their enquiries, John confesses that he is not the Messiah, nor the reappearance of the prophet Elijah (contrast , where Jesus states that John is \\"Elijah who is to come\\"), nor \\"the prophet\\". John then reveals that when the One comes he would be unfit to even so much as untie his sandals, let alone baptize Him like the many he had up to that point. No sooner than the next day the Messiah appears before John the Baptist, and he then acknowledges Jesus as the Lamb of God () of whom he had been speaking (). The evangelist divides this series of events into four 'days': the day (or period) when the Jerusalem delegation met John to enquire into his identity and purpose () is followed by John seeing Jesus coming towards him \\"the next day\\" (), and on \\"the next day again\\"Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on John 1, accessed 31 January 2016 he directs his own disciples towards following Jesus (). A fourth 'day' follows () on which Jesus wanted to go to Galilee and invited Philip to follow him. Bengel calls these \\"Great Days!\\", because \\"the care of this Evangelist in marking times is remarkable.\\"Bengel's Gnomon of the New Testament on John 1, accessed 31 January 2016 =Jesus' first disciples (verses 35–51)= As the chapter progresses further, the gospel describes how Jesus calls his first disciples, Andrew and an unnamed disciple (verses 35–40). The unnamed disciple was possibly John, the evangelist. Andrew finds his brother Simon (verses 41–42), and Jesus changes Simon's name to Cephas (Peter) (verse 42). Cephas, original Greek: (), means \\"a rock\\" (Young's Literal Translation) or \\"a stone\\" (King James Version). This provided a powerful analogy as to the role Peter would have after the crucifixion; to lead the development of the church. Name changes occur in other places in the Bible and demonstrate God's authority as well as what that person would become, do, or had done, such as Abram to Abraham and Jacob to Israel. Jesus' first active sign of power was to Nathaniel, who was thoroughly impressed by Jesus' foreknowledge of his personal character. The titles of Jesus Within these verses Jesus is given the following titles: *the true light () *the Word and the Word made flesh (), identified by the Christian theology with the second divine person of the Most Holy Trinity; *the Son of God () and the Unigenitus Son of God (() and the Nicene Creed) *the Lamb of God () *the Christ ( *Rabbi, meaning Teacher or Master () *the Messiah, or the Christ () *Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph () *the King of Israel () *the \\"Son of Man\\" or \\"Son of Humanity\\" () *the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit () *the one of whom Moses wrote in the law (, referring to : \\"The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren: him you shall hear\\") The Disciple whom Jesus loved The first appearance of the \\"disciple whom Jesus loved\\" in this Gospel is as one of the two disciples of John the Baptist who become the first followers of Jesus, but this is indicated in a subtle way. Bauckham notes the occurrence of at least two specific words in the narratives of both the first and the last appearance of this disciple: \\"to follow\\" (Greek: ) and \\"to remain/stay\\" (Greek: , ). In verse it is stated that \\"Jesus turned, and seeing them following ('akolouthountas'), said to them, \\"What do you seek?\\"\\", then in verse they \\"remained ('emeinan') with Him that day\\". In the last chapter of the Gospel, the last appearance of the 'Disciple whom Jesus loved' is indicated using similar words: in verse it is written that \\"Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following ('akolouthounta')\\", then in verse \\"Jesus said to him [Peter], \\"If I will that he remain ('menein') till I come, what is that to you?\\" Bauckham sees the placement of the appearances of the disciple as \\"the inclusio of eyewitness testimony\\" to privilege his witness (in the Gospel of John ) over Peter's, not to denigrate Peter's authority, but rather to claim a distinct qualification as an 'ideal witness' to Christ, because he survives Peter and bears his witness after Peter.Bauckham, R. \\"The Beloved Disciple as Ideal Author,\\" JNST 49 (1993) 21-44; reprinted in S. E. Porter and C. A. Evans, eds., The Johannine Writings (Biblical Seminar 32; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic, 1995) 46-68; apud Bauckham 2017, p. 128 The appearances are also close to Peter's, as the first one, along with Andrew, happened just before Peter's, who was then given the name 'Cephas' (alluding Peter's role after Jesus' departure), and the last one, just after Jesus' dialogue with Peter, acknowledging the significance of Peter's testimony within \\"the Petrine's inclusio\\", which is also found in the Gospel of Mark and Luke (see Luke 8 under \\"The Women who sustained Jesus\\"). Chronology Verses 1:19 to 2:1 contains a chronological record of an eyewitness:Exegetical Commentary on John 1 (verses 1:19–51), Study By: W. Hall Harris III * Day 1: the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask John the Baptist (). * Day 2 (\\"the next day\\"): John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, \\"Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!...\\"(). * Day 3 (\\"again, the next day\\"): John stood with two of his disciples, and looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, \\"Behold the Lamb of God!\\": The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. One of them is mentioned by name as \\"Andrew, Simon Peter's brother\\"; the other one not named is the eyewitness, who is John the evangelist (). * Day 4 (one day after Andrew and John stayed with Jesus for the rest of Day 3): Andrew brought Simon Peter to Jesus (). * Day 5 (\\"the following day\\"; Day 1 of travel to Cana): Philip and Nathanael followed Jesus (). * Day 6 (Day 2 on the way to Cana): Travel to Galilee (). * Day 7 (\\"on the third day\\"): The wedding in Cana of Galilee (). Liturgical use In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church and in Western Rite Orthodoxy, the chapter's first fourteen verses are known as the \\"Last Gospel\\", as they are recited at the end of the Tridentine Mass (or \\"Extraordinary Form\\") of the Mass. This is distinct from the Proclamation of the Gospel that occurs much earlier in the service. After reciting the dismissal formula , the priest reads the Last Gospel in Latin from the altar card to their left. At the beginning of verse 14, (\\"And the Word became flesh\\"), they genuflect. Any congregants present, who remain standing for the reading, would kneel at this point, responding with (\\"Thanks be to God\\") at its conclusion. This ritual began as a private devotion for the priest after Mass. It is not part of the 1969 Mass of Paul VI (known as the \\"Ordinary Form\\" widely used today) that was introduced after the Second Vatican Council.
