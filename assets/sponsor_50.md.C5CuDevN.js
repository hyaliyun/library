He was one year ahead of soon-to-be Hanshin teammates Shun Takayama and Seishir≈ç Sakamoto. When he went undrafted after graduation, he joined the Industrial Leagues under JX-ENEOS for two years. He debuted with a walk off hit, and finished his first season with .330 BA, and got to participate in the intercity tournaments. While his team didn't make it the following year, he joined Toshiba's team as a loaned player, and still got to play in the tournament, but didn't make it all the way to the championships.

On the next day, he recorded his 1st hit on his 3rd at-bat from Carp pitcher Ryan Brasier. He made it to the starting line up as shortstop/7th batter on April 14, and from then on, alternated between being a pinch hitter and starter.

He was taken off the roster and went into rehab until the season ended. He got a chance to pinch-hit during the post-season play-offs, but Hanshin did not advance into the final round.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1970.It is the largest shell midden in Miyagi Prefecture. Overview During the early to middle J≈çmon period (approximately 4000 to 2500 BC), sea levels were five to six meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the T≈çhoku region was inhabited by the J≈çmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of J≈çmon society. Most of these middens are found along the Pacific coast of Japan, and the rocky ria coast of Miyagi Prefecture was densely settled from the early through late J≈çmon period. The Nagane Shell Midden is located in an inland location at an elevation of approximately thirteen meters on a low plateau south of Kabukiri Swamp; however was found to contain shells from seawater shellfish, such as oysterss in its lowest strata, shellfish native to brackish water, such as shijimi in its middle layers and shells from freshwater mollusks and fish in its upper layers, indicating that the coastline in the region has receded. Aside from shellfish, the midden also contained the bones of deer and wild boar, and waterbirds including swans, geese and ducks. Other artifacts found in the 1968 excavation included pottery, stone implements, clay figurines, jewelry and vessels made from bone and animal horn. In addition, the foundations of two mid-J≈çmon period pit dwellings were uncovered. The midden is very large, extending for 300 meters east-west and 250 meters north-south in a ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shape, and spans the end of the early J≈çmon period through the late J≈çmon period (i.e. 6000 to 2300 years ago), with some smaller middens scattered to the west. The National Historic Site designation was extended in 1976 to cover outlying portions which had been discovered since 1970. The site was backfilled after excavation, and there is now nothing to se at the site except for a monument and plaque. The site is located bout 30 minutes by car from Wakuya Station on the JR East Ishinomaki Line.

From 1969-1972 he played with the Schnuckenack Reinhardt Quintett, after which he made five albums with his own ensemble playing acoustic gypsy jazz along with self-composed and traditional gypsy tunes. From the early 80s to his death he played in a more mainstream/bebop jazz style with other German jazz artists including the violinist Martin Weiss (his nephew), and the double bass player Vali Mayer.  Life and work  Weiss was born in 1951 in Berlin to a musical Sinto (German gypsy) family, learning the guitar from his father Gono who before the second world war had played violin, guitar, accordion and zither.http://www.wsws.org/de/articles/2016/07/01/haen-j30.html H√§ns'che Weiss Obituary on the World Socialist Web Site (in German) Taking up the guitar at age 13, two years later he won first prize in a young talent competition in Berlin.http://www.djangostation.com/Hans-che-Weiss-212.html H√§ns'che Weiss page on DjangoStation (in French) By the age of 18, he was already an excellent guitarist in the tradition of Django Reinhardt and in December 1969 was picked by Schnuckenack Reinhardt to join his quintet in the role of solo guitarist. Over the succeeding two and a half years he played with this group in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France and played as solo guitarist on two of the quintet's albums (Musik deutscher Zigeuner 3 and Musik deutscher Zigeuner 4), produced by Siegfried Maeker for the Da Camera Song label. In September 1972 at age 21, Weiss left Schnuckenack's ensemble to found his own group, the H√§ns'che Weiss Quintet which drew some of its members from the (old) Schnuckenack Reinhardt Quintet. This new group comprised H√§ns'che Weiss on solo guitar, the then 15-year old prodigy Titi Winterstein on violin, Holzmanno Winterstein and Ziroli Winterstein on rhythm guitars and Hojok Merstein on double bass. This line-up travelled to the United Kingdom in 1975 where they played at the prestigious Cambridge Folk Festival.https://www.cambridgelivetrust.co.uk/folk-festival/folk- festival/history/1971-1975 Cambridge Folk Festival History 1971-1975 In 1976 Holzmanno Winterstein departed and was replaced by the excellent guitarist Lulu Reinhardt who played both rhythm and additional lead guitar roles. The Quintet released five albums all produced by Siegfried Maeker: Musik deutscher Zigeuner 5 (1973), for which the ensemble received the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis (German recorded music prize); Musik deutscher Zigeuner 6, Dja Maro Drom (1974) on Electrola, Das H√§ns'che Weiss Quintett (1975) on Songbird, and F√ºnf Jahre Musik deutscher Zigeuner (1977) on Intercord. In addition to making powerful music, Weiss and his musicians also made an important commitment to the defense and understanding of the Sinti people and culture. In the late 1970s the Quintet was dissolved and left to Titi Winterstein to continue. In 1981 H√§ns'che released the album Couleurs, with a novel lineup including the percussionist Trilok Gurtu and second guitarist Romani Weiss. Subsequently, he formed a trio with his nephew, the young violinist Martin Weiss and bassist Vali Mayer. This line-up released the albums Zugaben... in 1985, Erinnerungen in 1988 and Vis √† vis in 1991, with Weiss paying a more modern, bebop style of jazz guitar inspired by his other idols such as Barney Kessel, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass and Kenny Burrell, also incorporating some influences from bossa nova. After the departure of Martin Weiss, who then began a solo career, H√§ns'che Weiss continued to perform as a duet with Vali Mayer, sometimes accompanied by the young pianist Micky Bamberger. This line-up released three albums in a more modern style: Just play, Just play II,The duo: live!, and performed regularly within Germany. After being ill for some time, H√§ns'che Weiss died on 2 June 2016. His Django- inspired guitar work played a significant role in the revival of the \\"hot club\\" style of gypsy guitar playing from the late 1960s onwards and he is remembered not only for his fine playing and mentoring of younger musicians but also for his cheerful on-stage persona.

The collective of rappers based out of various districts from their home state are noted for emphasizing on contemporary and philosophical themes ranging from social realism to dystopian fantasy. They collaborate with projects like Mappila Lahala and Palakkadan Dystopia, to release songs that focus on having cultural discussions set in avant-garde backdrops. History Street Academics was an idea brought forward by Rjv Ernesto in 1999, as a small group for spoken word poetry and making pause tapes. Later he was introduced to Haris Saleem through hip-hop communities in Myspace and Orkut. After recording various demo tracks, they brought in Amjad Nadeem, Abhimanyu Raman and Pranav to move forward as a hip-hop collective in 2009. Keyboardist & music producer Ruthin Thej worked with the group to produce a couple of singles, before leaving to pursue his career as keyboardist for Thaikkudam Bridge. Later Vivek Radhakrishnan joined the group as the DJ/producer providing a bass-oriented sound. They started collaborating with the cultural music collective Mappila Lahala, led by filmmaker Muhsin Parari, to release politically oriented singles which featured veteran actor Mamukkoya and national award-winning composer Bijibal. The group has also formed avant garde hip-hop project Palakkadan Dystopia to release singles and went on to collaborate with experimental theatre acts, performing shows which combined spoken word, theatre, hip-hop music & graffiti. After working on singles and compilations over the years, the group released a complete multilingual album titled \\"Loop\\" loosely based on seven deadly sins. On July 13th 2019, a live performance of Street Academics along with Bandish Projekt and Swadesi, was interrupted by a group of people who demanded the venue officials to play Kannada songs, instead of the group's original Malayalam tracks, as they were in Bengaluru. The group's set was cut short and forced off stage. After the performance, rapper/vocalist Amjad and few of his friends were taken away by the police, allegedly for causing public nuisance. Venue management later released a public statement, apologizing to Street Academics regarding the incident. The group released a protest song titled \\"Hara Hara\\" along with a music video, and performed it live during Citizenship Amendment Act protests at Kozhikode. Themes and Influences Members state that they started off through slam poetry before getting introduced to hip-hop music. Rjv Ernesto cites spoken word poetry and sports/pro-wrestling commentary as his influence in rap music. Developing an interest towards drum solos, he recalls creating beats by cutting out bits of tape from cassettes using a razor blade and glueing them back before inserting the tape into the cartridge. The group's multilingual lyricism usually brings up questions of expression & identity, affirming the place of vernacular rap in India, being one of the first acts to do so. Street Academics is considered to be one of the oldest independent hip-hop outfits in India. They are noted for pioneering Malayalam rap with serious content & multisyllabic rhyme patterns, against the comical parody image that rap/hip-hop music has had in their region. Even though the production relies on minimal boom bap oriented sampling as the backbone, the collective effort exhibits influences of lo-fi, glitch, folk, ambient, R&B;, jazz poetry, grime and funk. Most of the themes are set in an alternate reality or a post-apocalyptic world, often presented from the narrative mode of various alter egos. It is noted that majority of those plots are inter-connected & follow a particular nonlinear storyline throughout the body of their work. The group's singles Vandi Puncture and Native Bapa, both released in 2012, are often held responsible for taking Malayalam hip-hop music to mainstream.

He should not be confused with his son Gabriel II Bataille.  Biography  The allusions to Brie in his verse pieces suggest that Gabriel Bataille was a native of this province. He had a brother Louis, a tailor, quoted in an act of 1621Paris ANF : MC XVIII, 172, quoted from Jurgens 1974 p. 305. and a sister Catherine, married to Didier Dutour, usher of the accounts and treasures in Paris, and died before 1600.Moreover, it is not known if Gabriel was related to Damien Bataille, clerk of the chapel of plain-chant of the king, reported on June 13, 1547 for his salaries of 22 lt and 10 sols for the month of October 1547. Cf. Paris BNF (Mss.): ms. fr. 5127 f. 41v, quoted from Handy 2008 (p. 236). At the time of his marriage with Catherine Carre, on 12 February 1600, he was already a Parisian, but his marriage contract specified that he was then clerk to the parliamentary counselor Germain Regnault; thus he was not yet a professional musician.Contract of marriage with Catherine Carr√©, daughter of a merchant. He lived in the Rue de la Chanvrerie. Paris ANF : MC III, 463, quoted from Jurgens 1967 (pp. 305). When in 1608 Pierre I Ballard published the first volumes of his Airs de diff√©rents autheurs, he had probably become one: from 1614 he was listed as master of music. From 1617 to his death, he was master of music of the house of Anne of Austria (1601‚Äì1666), by semester, alternating with Antoine Bo√´sset. He had signed a contract with the latter, which also aimed at this post, so that the one who would obtain it would share it with the other (what happened).Paris ANF : MC XV, 26, contrat of 2 March 1617, quoted from Jurgens 1974 (pp. 129). He had to testify on 9 June 1617 at the trial of Leonora Galigai, and described the exorbitant conditions imposed by the Marshal d'Ancre on the musicians who had applied for the charges of musician of the house of the queen (an entire year of wages).Hayem 1910 (pp. 256-257). Bataille inserted a piece of verse to the praise of Jacques Le F√®vre in his MeslangesRISM L 1434, Guillo 2003 n¬∞ 1613-I. dated 1613; by will, the latter left him on 22 December 1627, a part of the books of music which collected all his works.Paris ANF : MC LIV, 510, quoted from Jurgens 1974 (p. 156), In 1617 and 1618, Bataille also published pieces of verses at the beginning of books by Antoine Bo√´ssetRISM B 3272, Guillo 2003 n¬∞ 1617-C. and Pierre Gu√©dron.RISM G 4823, Guillo 2003 n¬∞ 1618-C; The three documents are transcribed in Verchaly 1947 (pp. 4‚Äì77).; It is thus necessary to see these three musicians at the center of his network of friends. On 5 February 1614, he was a witness at the marriage of Jean Rocher, Sieur de Br√©au, agent at the Finance Council.Paris ANF : MC II, 80, quoted from Jurgens 1967 (p. 305) His friendship with Pierre I Ballard, which favored his career, shows in his sponsorship of Marguerite, daughter of the printer and Sansonne Coulon, dated 11 February 1619. On 22 January 1624, Gabriel Bataille was again witness of the marriage of Nicolas Chastelet (like him a musician of the queen) with Marie SodeyParis ANF: Y 164 f. 239, insinuation of 15 May 1624, quoted from √âcorcheville 1907 (pp. 26‚Äì27), then on 5 February of the same year, witness of the bride at the marriage of Thomas Vassetz, notary note- keeper at the Grand Ch√¢telet, with Marie Carr√©, probably a sister of his wife.Paris ANF : MC V, 61, quoted from Jurgens 1967 (p. 306) He had four living children:To which is added a child who died in infancy in 1611, quoted by Verchaly 1947 (p. 3), after the Laborde file, mention not found in Brossard 1975.

His wife Catherine Carr√© was buried on 8 February 1624; while he died on 17 December 1630 and was buried in the √©glise Saint-Paul the day after.Jal 1867 (p. 125); He lived at (at least since 1611). The inventory of his possessions,Paris ANF : MC LXXXIV, 114, quoted from Jurgens 1967, (p. 307) note 1. drawn up on 14 February 1631, revealed five lutes, 29 packages of music and an interesting library.  Works  Title page of the IVe livre d'airs mis en tabulature de luth (1613). = Court arias set to lute = The most active period of the production of Bataille was between 1605 and 1620; After that date, and until his death, we have very little information about his life. In 1608 and 1615 he published a collection of court arias composed by the most prominent masters of the moment and arranged by him for voice and lute. It includes six books, some of which have been reissued, a sign of real success. Here is the list: * Airs de diff√©rents auteurs mis au luth par G.

Bataille VIe livre, RISM 1615(11), Guillo 2003 n¬∞ 1615-AThis collection of tunes \\"put to the lute\\" was continued with 2 books of tunes of different authors \\"put to the lute by themselves\\" (Books VII-VIII, 1617-1618) then with 8 Books of tunes \\"put to the lute by A. Boesset\\" (Books IX-XVI, 1620-1643). In between, Jean Boyer and √âtienne Moulini√© each published a book of court tunes in this form (1621 and 1624). ::The ensemble was republished in facsimile by Minkoff in Geneva; In addition, a selection of pieces was published twice: French ayres from Gabriel Bataille's Airs de diff√©rents autheurs (1608-1618), ed. Peter Warlock (London : Oxford University Press, ca.1926);Nine pieces appear in Airs de cour pour voix et luth (1607‚Äì43), √©d. A. Verchaly (Paris: , 1961). They contain mostly airs de cour, autonomous or excerpts of ballets represented at the time to the court of France. There are also nine psalms translated into verses measured by Philippe Desportes. In these courtly tunes, Bataille took a lot of the works of Pierre Gu√©dron. He of course included in his collections several of his own compositions. He showed himself respectful of the original vocal melody, by decorating it appreciably. At the lute, he respected the original bass part, but more easily adapted the intermediate voices. Many of the pieces in these collections have been included in collections of contemporary spiritual arias, such as La Pieuse Alouette of printer Jean Vervliet (Valenciennes, 1619‚Äì1621), which is a sign of a fairly wide spread. = Arias of his own = Gabriel Bataille also composed his own tunes. * 16 tunes for four voices, grouped at the beginning of Airs √† quatre de diff√©rents auteurs, et mis ensemble par Pierre Ballard (Paris: Pierre I Ballard, 1613, RISM 1613(8), Guillo 2003 No 1613-B). * 34 tunes for one voice published in 1615 and 1626, of which 21 appear in the Airs de cour et de diff√©rents auteurs [1st Book] (Paris : Pierre I Ballard, 1615, RISM 1615(12), Guillo 2003 n¬∞ 1615-B. * 43 tunes for voice and lute are contained, under his name, in the collections published between 1608 and 1615 mentioned above, put to the lute by himself. Among these tunes are 10 psalms on Desportes verses, which Verchaly all attributes to Bataille, while only the last (in the 1615-A collection) is published under his name. * 9 other tunes for voice and lute, published between 1617 and 1620, in the following collections: ** Airs de diff√©rents auteurs, mis en tablature de luth par eux- m√™mes, (7th Book) (Paris: Pierre I Ballard, 1617, RISM 1617{(8), Guillo 2003 n¬∞ 1617-A). ** Idem, (8th Book) (idem, 1618, RISM {(9), 1618-A). ** Airs de diff√©rents auteurs, mis en tablature de luth par eux-m√™mes, (9th Book) (idem, 1620, RISM 1620(11), Guillo 2003 n¬∞ 1620-A). In these last collections, some tunes come from contemporary court ballets: Ballet du roi (c. 1616), Ballet de La d√©livrance de Renaud (1617), Ballet de Monseigneur le Prince (1620).

History The foundation of the Koganeyama Jinja and the date of discovery of gold in the region are unknown. In 740 AD, when Emperor Sh≈çmu was constructing the Nara Daibutsu, a call was sent out to all provinces requesting the donation of gold for the statue.

New Serbia joined the Serbian Progressive Party's coalition electoral list for the 2012 parliamentary election and maintained its alliance with the Progressives for the 2014 and 2016 campaigns. Jovanoviƒá was not a candidate in 2012 but received the ninety-eighth position on the Progressive- led list in 2014 and was elected when it won a majority victory with 158 out of 250 mandates.–ò–∑–±–æ—Ä–∏ –∑–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–µ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∫–µ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–µ —Å–∫—É–ø—à—Ç–∏–Ω–µ –æ–¥—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏ 16. –∏ 23. –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2014. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ, –ò–ó–ë–û–†–ù–ï –õ–ò–°–¢–ï (ALEKSANDAR VUƒåIƒÜ - BUDUƒÜNOST U KOJU VERUJEMO) , Republika Srbija - Republiƒçka izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017.

Independent Velimir Iliƒá expelled Jovanoviƒá from New Serbia in January 2017. This occurred after Iliƒá said he would withdraw support from the administration of Progressive Party leader Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá; Jovanoviƒá, as a party vice- president, responded that Iliƒá was entitled to his personal opinions but that the party as a whole remained supportive of the administration.KULMINIRALE TENZIJE U NS Potpredsednik Nove Srbije se ograƒëuje od Iliƒáevih izjava, Blic (source: Tanjug), 20 January 2017, accessed 11 August 2017. Iliƒá justified his decision to expel Jovanoviƒá on the grounds that the latter had disobeyed the decisions of the party leadership, had made false claims about a diploma, and was compromised because of his involvement in a 2012 car accident. Jovanoviƒá rejected these claims and said that Iliƒá was actually concerned that he could pose a successful challenge for the leadership of the party.Mirjana R.

At around the same time that Jovanoviƒá was expelled from New Serbia, deputies Dubravka Filipovski and Mladen Grujiƒá voluntarily left the party in opposition to Iliƒá's leadership and his decision to leave Vuƒçiƒá's coalition. All three continued to offer support the Progressive-led administration.Usvojene izmene zakona, Vlada dobija jo≈° dva ministarstv, Radio Television of Serbia, 26 June 2017, accessed 11 August 2017.

Jovanoviƒá argued that the group would offer conservative Serb voters a third choice, distinct from the country's existing political blocs supporting and opposing Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá's presidency.Filip Rudic, \\"Serbian Right-Wingers Unveil Populist Platform\\", Balkan Insight, 15 June 2017, accessed 27 September 2017.

It may be pink or light yellow. It is thin-walled and may appear as a small blister, more than 5 mm in diameter. It can also be referred to as a bulla. Some clinicians may also include milk blisters as a type of bleb. In addition, a blocked Montgomery gland may also be called a nipple bleb though its cause is different than a milk or serous-filled bleb on the nipple. In some cases the bleb may be associated with an adjacent blocked sebaceous cyst. It may be caused by a blocked pore that leads to seepage of milk or serous fluid under the epidermis. This causes a white 'bump' that appears opaque and shiny. If the bleb continues to block the flow of milk out of the breast it may develop into a blocked milk duct or even mastitis. A nipple bleb is often treated by the woman herself since a warm saline soak and gentle washing may open the blister and cause it to drain.  Symptoms  * Shapeless raised, smooth, shiny, pimple-like, tiny bumps formed on breasts or in and around the nipple pore * Raised, water/fluid filled areas on breasts. The colour of the fluid in nipple blebs may vary from white, yellow or transparent * Nipple blebs become flat when pressure is applied on them * Cause discomfort to the lactating mother while breastfeeding * May or may not be painful in general * It can be painful when the baby nurses while you have a nipple bleb Treatment  * Breastfeed more frequently * Learn how to make the baby latch properly * Try wet, warm heating pads before and after each feeding * Massage the area around the duct to help loosen up the blockage * Ice packs can be soothing * Apply gentle pressure to release the bleb * Do not wear tight fitting bra.

His artwork alludes his origins: culture and tradition of his birthplace, the concept of shortage, colonization and globalization are the artist's main approaches. Marepe lives and works in Santo Antonio de Jesus, Brazil. Education In 1989, when Marepe had his first notable success by winning the first prize at the Rec√¥ncavo Biennale (Brazil) he refused an offer to study at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg continuing his visual arts studies at the Federal University of Bahia. Work Marepe's Untitled (2002‚Äì04) during the 'Alien Nation' exhibition held in 2006 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London Marepe's artwork expresses his personal perception upon his life juxtaposed with the political and socio-cultural spirit of Brazil, represented using everyday objects, local materials and events from his home based surroundings. In 2013, during an exposition at the Inhotim Institute (Brazil) where Marepe exposed a metal sculpture, A Cabra / The Goat, his curator claimed to The New York Times that \\"Marepe is connected to the popular culture of Brazil, and how people represent the more rustic elements of their lives\\". In Veja Meu Bem (2007), made to last just two days at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, Marepe reconstructed the atmosphere of a Brazilian funfair, installing a festival carousel and adding to it a chute of sugar-coated fruits, accessible to the viewers. The artwork was inspired by what he called \\"beautiful and precarious Brazil\\" and it was a way to bring a piece of his native country to London ‚Äî a shift comparable to a prior installation art project, where the artist took a painted exterior wall from Santo Antonio de Jesus to the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. Transporting ordinary objects into the world of art, the artist honours the Duchampian wave of the pr√™t-√†-porter, but he also induces it, creating new meanings. The fact that Marepe lives in his native town influences his art; the everyday life in Brazil is Marape's source for creation: stalls, low-income m√©nages, metallic basins or trees trunk ‚Äì are mixed in his artwork. Marepe includes these items in different universes resulting an \\"alterity\\" within the artistic world, alluding subjects as colonialism, identity issues, various differences between social classes and the antithesis between the modern and the traditional lifestyles. Marepe renders objects which may seem useless but which are a necessity in some of the under developed areas of Brazil. In contrast with this, he calls his works \\"necessities\\". One of Marepe's artworks, Peixe Com Aur√©ola (2012), consisted in a bicycle designed in such way it couldn't be ridden, having a wheel emerging from the seat. He also replaced the two classical wheels with a fish head in the front and a fish tail, both made of wood, in the back. Through this artwork, according to the former American news website, Examiner.com, Marepe tried to express \\"the dire need in his community for the type of abundance necessary to pursue greater meaning in life\\".

He was born at Streatham Hill in London and died at Trincomalee in Sri Lanka. Hawkins was educated at Whitgift School, then called Whitgift Grammar, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a first-class cricketer, he was primarily a bowler: a tall right-arm medium pace bowler and a right-handed lower-order batsman. In his first two years at Cambridge, he suffered from the bowling and batting riches available to the university cricket team: in his single match in 1896, he bowled just two expensive overs, and in 1897, given two games, he bowled in only one of the four innings played by Cambridge's opponents. Better opportunities came in 1898, when Hawkins impressed in the senior trial match by taking 11 wickets in a 12-a-side game. In another 12-a-side match, this time a first-class game between Cambridge University and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he was instrumental in securing a narrow Cambridge victory by taking seven wickets for 45 runs, and he followed that up with five for 37 against Surrey in the very next match. That led to his selection for the 1898 University Match against Oxford University, though he had no success in the game. In 1899, he was again a regular member of the Cambridge first team, and though his bowling figures for the season were less successful than in 1898, he had a better game in the University Match, taking four wickets, albeit expensively. That match was his final appearance in first-class cricket. Hawkins graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1898 and this was upgraded to a Master of Arts in 1903. He became a schoolmaster in France, and an obituary in 1933 states that he attempted to introduce something of the ethos of the English public school into France, though the work was stopped by the outbreak of the First World War. He served in the Royal Garrison Artillery in the war, reaching the rank of captain. After the war, he became the headmaster of a preparatory school for the children of colonial administrators at Nuwara Eliya in Sri Lanka; he was still in post when he and his wife were drowned while bathing on New Year's Day, 1933, at Trincomalee.

History  The first mention of the Church of Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow in Bessergenevskaya village dates back to 1647. In 1797, due to dilapidation of the old church, a new, wooden one with a bell tower was built. The latter was consecrated in 1800 also in the name of Metropolitan Alexius. In 1810 the stanitsa moved to a new place. The temple was also transferred. In 1858, it was moved again, this time to Kazachy-Kadamovsky khutor. In 1882, instead of the wooden church, a stone church was erected.

History  Shamans are part of every culture, starting from the origin of humanity in the Stone Age. They used stories, initiated and facilitated various rituals consisting of storytelling, dances and embodiment of past or future events and challenges. They applied basic principles of improvisation, to help people, to collaborate, to understand what is happening around them and to cope with daily life. The Sanskrit-Theater originated 1,000 BC is a very early form of theatre. The vidushaka was part of the cast and the plot and at the same time stepped out, made comments, that mostly were improvised. He can also be seen as the first appearance of a clown. Starting about 600 BC Rhapsodes travelled around Greece. He ‚Äì only men ‚Äì combined in an improvised way the epics of e. g. of Homer, myths, tales, jokes, songs and adapted this mixture spontaneously to local expectations and situations. In many aspects he built upon the traditions of the shamans and the trickster. In the fifth century BC originated in Greece an intense examination of improvisation applied in rhetoric. Schools were established, to learn how to improvise a speech which had a t relevance as instrument of democracy and civic education. The fourth century BC in Greece is an important milestone for the history of theatre: The roots of drama and comedy were established, also in the phylax play, a burlesque dramatic, played on wooden stages: A lot of the content was improvised. Improvisation also was applied in the Atellan Farces in ancient Rome. Always a combination of stocked and improvised moves, dances and artistic movements coined performances of Pantomimes ‚Äì in ancient Rome it was also one of the origins of improvised dancing. Their performances were influenced through traditions of the Etruscans. They also performend on public spaces, traveling around the country. From the 12th to the 14th century Minnesang was very popular. The musicians visited castles and cities, they used stock texts and music and added a lot of improvisation, inspired also by historical events, social developments and reactions of the audience. Both, Commedia dell‚ÄôArte and Minnesang can also be perceived as a contribution to adult education and civic education in a time, literacy was not common and access to information often difficult. Also in the 12th century emerged the Jester and had the task to use improvisational methods to call attention to urgent matters of politics and society. He was allowed to criticise decisions of the emperors. In many ways he incorporates the practise of the Trickster. In medieval Italy Commedia dell‚ÄôArte was a revival of the Atellan Farces: Groups of actors travelled also through parts of Europe. As inspiration for the improvised parts of their plays they also used political events and current social issues, what they experienced and heard in other cities, as well as wishes and reactions of the audience. In the 17th century the pedagogue John Comenius was one of the first who emphasized the significance of play and games as method for learning and teaching ‚Äì he referred to the works of Plato. Games often consist of stepping into different personas in a blink of a moment, of pretending being in various settings and genres. They often have a certain structure and also invite to play with this structures, evolve them ‚Äì therefore improvisation is an important aspect of games. Also games are often the starting points for improvisation and theatrical approaches. Also pedagogues like Pestalozzi, Fr√∂bel and Montessori applied games and role plays in education. The social worker Neva Boyd collected around 1920 description of various games and added own inventions. She used them to teach language skills, problem-solving, self-confidence and social skills in Chicago. She also accompanied people to cope with the effects of the Great Depression. Boyd also worked together with the theatre academic and educator Viola Spolin. She used and evolved her games which ‚Äû‚Ä¶were meant to promote creative expression through self discovery and personal experiences between children with extremely diverse backgrounds.‚Äù (LaPolice, 2012, S. 26). Spolin also emphasized, that these games and exercises evolved key competencies like self-efficacy, creativity, the ability for collaboration and to tackle problems. Spolin applied the games and exercises also in workshops for actors of the Compass Theater in Chicago, the first improvisational theatre group. Also in the 1920s Jakob L. Moreno summarized existing ideas and founded in Vienna the Stegreiftheater, the Theater of Spontaneity: People attending were actors as well as the audience ‚Äì the shift took often place within a used improvisational exercises or scene. Later on he used these experiences in the development of psychodrama ‚Äì improvisational approaches are an important aspect in this method. Starting in the 1950s the educator and playwright Keith Johnstone developed in the USA and Canada various improvisational games ‚Äì they not only were used to train actors or to prepare for performances of improvisational theatre groups but also in workshops and projects with teachers of schools and universities, trainers in juvenile and adult education. In the development of improvisational theater also Del Close had an important function, as he developed also long form games. Also in the 1950s started the work of Augusto Boal: He also developed various improvisational methods and applied them e. g. in the theatre of the oppressed. Actors and audience switch their roles often; Boals methods are also applied in civic education, in the training of teachers of all fields and in politics. In 1975 Johnathan Fox and Jo Salas founded the first Playback Theatre: People from an audience tell stories of their lives, which are after that transformed in theatrical sequences by actors, using improvisational methods speaking, singing and dancing. In the late 1990s the performative turn began in social research. Performance ‚Äì also any kind of using improvisational approaches - was not longer considered only as a process on a theatre stage with a rather passive audience, but as a comprehensive principle for researching and understanding human actions. People like Shaun McNiff started to apply improvisational methods in arts based research projects. 2002 the Applied Improvisation Network was founded, a non-profit organization of people using improvisational methods in various fields.  Examples for the implementation of applied improvisation  Some fields to use applied improvisation Additional in the training of actors and as preparation to improvisational theater, applied improvisation e. g. is used: In consulting and corporate training applied improvisation is used e. g. in team and sales training, workshops for presentation skills, resilience, leadership and for people responsible for innovations. Applied improvisation is also often used in methods like design thinking and in service design projects ‚Äì therefore the methods are also researched and applied in UX-Design. And it is used in evolving engineering. Another field for applied improvisation is in the education and advanced training for people working in the fields of social work, medical and health care and medicine. A new approach is to apply improvisation for disaster readiness and response. Additional to psychodrama, improvisational methods are also used in other therapeutic settings and drama therapy. In education, improvisational approaches are used in all fields of teaching teachers, of designing and evolving didactic concepts, and also as a method of student centered learning. As mentioned in the history, improvisational methods are also applied as research tools since the permormative turn. There are several projects connected to applied drama where improvisation is an important aspect. There are also examples of use in the fields of health and life sciences, in evolving didactics and in design research.  The Applied Improvisation Network  The Applied Improvisation Network (AIN) is a global community of over 5000 members online and numerous local groups. Practitioners of applied improvisation facilitate workshops, for individuals or organisations, introducing them to these principles, tools etc. via solo, paired or group exercises, activities and games. The members of the AIN are business professionals and academics who use improvisation tools, experience, and theory for human development and training in communities and organizations. The network includes consultants, managers, trainers, coaches, facilitators, performers and academics. The AIN was founded in 2002 by Paul Z Jackson, Michael Rosenburg and Alain Rostain. Since then the number of local groups and online communities has grown year by year, with a series of conferences, regional events and roadshows in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia.

The church underwent three major restorations, in 1867‚Äì1868, 1897 and 1910‚Äì1911. It remains an active parish church. The church is dedicated to the 6th-century Saint Elli, who may have been a daughter or granddaughter of King Brychan, or a male disciple of Saint Cadoc. History The church dates from the 14th century, or earlier, but little remains of this period. The nave is medieval but its walls were all rebuilt in the restorations of the 19th and 20th centuries. The first of these rebuildings took place in 1867‚Äì1868, and was undertaken by the architect Joseph Nevill of Abergavenny. The spire dates from the restoration of 1897 by Baldwin of Brecon. The final rebuilding was undertaken by J. Vaughan Richards of Crickhowell in 1910‚Äì1911. Until local government reorganisation of 1974, the parish of Llanelly was in the historic county of Brecknockshire and St Elli's remains an active church under the administration of the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon, although the parish is now in Monmouthshire. Architecture and description The church is built of Old Red Sandstone rubble. It comprises a nave with west tower, chancel, aisle and porch. The architectural historian John Newman considered the \\"broad and squat\\" tower the most memorable feature. The interior contains some monuments of \\"unusually high quality\\" which are noted in the church's listing record for its Grade II* designation.

The Center is one of the first animal rescue centers in Vietnam and one of the largest primate rescue centers in Southeast Asia. It is a non-profit project aiming at rescuing, rehabilitation, breeding, research and conservation of endangered primate species in Vietnam.  History  In 1991, Tilo Nadler came to Vietnam to make a documentary film about Delacour's Langur. On this trip, he saw the threats that endangered primate species were facing. In 1992, Frankfurt Zoological Society called for help from specialists to perform a langur conservation project in Vietnam and Tilo Nadler volunteered for this project. Starting from March of 1993, Tilo Nadler built EPRC Vietnam and became the Director of the rescue center in Cuc Phuong National Park. Currently EPRC Vietnam is managed under Vietnam Primate Conservation Program and it is operated by Zoo Leipzig and Cuc Phuong National Park. Tilo Nadler has retired from the center, and it is now run by contracted Directors from Zoo Leipzig.  Facilities  At the present, EPRC Vietnam has more than 48 large enclosures, 2 electric-fenced semi-wild areas (one sized 2 hectares and one 5 hectares). The semi-wild areas are built to prepare qualified animals to be released into the wild. They also help researchers to study the behavior of primates changing from captivity to a semi-wild area. There are enclosures with heated housing specifically designed for primate species of Central and South Vietnam.  Animals  Endangered red-shanked douc langur at EPRC Vietnam. There are around 180 animals at EPRC Vietnam and this number fluctuates over time due to release, or death of animals. Some animals born at EPRC Vietnam are the first of their species to be bred successfully in captivity such as the Catba langur, Delacour's langur and Gray-shanked douc langur. There are 15 primate species there: \\\\- Lorises: Slow loris, Pygmy loris; \\\\- Langurs: Fran√ßois' langur, Hatinh langur, Catba langur, Delacour's langur, Indochinese gray langur, Laotian langur; \\\\- Douc langurs: Red-shanked douc langur, Gray- shanked douc langur; \\\\- Gibbons: Black gibbon, Northern white-cheeked black gibbon, Southern white-cheeked black gibbon, Northern yellow-cheeked black gibbon, Southern yellow-cheeked gibbon.  Funding  Approximately 75% of support for EPRC Vietnam comes from Zoo Leipzig. The rest comes from donors, donations, volunteers and merchandise.

Description  Hylaeus agilis are slender and mainly black in colour, with distinctive yellow or white markings on their face. They have sparse hairs and range in size from 7-9mm.Hart,N. (2007).

Retrieved from https://www.fndc.govt.nz/services/the-far-north-district-plan/plan- changes/plan-change-18/Pre-Circulated-Evidence-GEFree-Ngaire-Hart2.pdf Like all Hylaeus bees they lack pollen-carrying hairs (scopa), and resemble wasps. They have been discovered to pollinate red mistletoe (Peraxilla tetrapetala), an endangered mistletoe species endemic to New Zealand. This mistletoe species is explosive, meaning that requires forceful opening and was previously thought to only attract endemic birds evolved to twist the flowers open. However, Hylaeus agilis was observed continuously gnawing on unopened buds until they opened. Thus H. agilis is ecologically important for native New Zealand plants. Because H. agilis has no specialized pollen-carrying structures on its body, pollen is carried in a crop. This internal pollen is regurgitated for larval food. Like most bee species endemic to New Zealand, they are solitary mining bees but instead of constructing or excavating their own nests, they live in blind tunnels in branches and twigs, or in abandoned beetle holes in logs.  Distribution  H. agilis is found on the North, South and Stewart Islands as well as on Three Kings Island. H. agilis is predominantly located in vegetated areas from sea level to 1590m of elevation.

The law is named after Brodie Panlock, a 19-year-old who took her own life after being bullied at work. Brodie's parents, Damien and Rae Panlock, successfully lobbied the Victorian Government to make the amendment. Brodie Panlock Brodie Rae Constance Panlock grew up in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne in the Australian state of Victoria with her parents and two older brothers. In early 2005, at the age of 18, Brodie started working at Cafe Vamp in Hawthorn an inner suburb of Melbourne. In March 2006, shortly after her 19th birthday, Brodie moved to a small flat in Hawthorn to be closer to work. Cafe Vamp helped Brodie with references and lent her the bond money for the flat. She worked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and was described as a \\"loyal employee\\" and \\"buoyant, chirpy, compassionate, patient, giving girl\\" by co-workers. Panlock had plans to save enough money to travel overseas with her brother and his girlfriend before enrolling at TAFE to study social work. In September 2006, Brodie jumped from the top of a multilevel carpark in Hawthorn and died from her injuries in The Alfred Hospital three days later. =Bullying= Panlock became involved in an intermittent intimate relationship with the cafe manager Nicholas Smallwood in the fifteen months leading up to her death. Panlock became infatuated with Smallwood, but the attention was not returned. In the last few months Panlock's relationship with Smallwood became unhealthy, according to Coroner Peter White, who found that Smallwood and others \\"systematically bullied her, both physically and emotionally\\". Smallwood, fellow waiter Rhys MacAlpine and, to a lesser extent, chef Gabriel Toomey, called her names, told her she was fat, ugly and a whore. They kicked and spat on her, held her down and poured oil on her hair and clothes, covered her in chocolate sauce and filled her kit bag with fish oil. Other employees intervened without effect, and the cafe owner Marcus Dela Cruz turned a blind eye to the behaviour. In May 2006 after being kicked out of Smallwood's apartment, Panlock took rat poison and alcohol in a suicide attempt. Smallwood later taunted Panlock that she could not do it properly, and put rat poison in her handbag. =Final days= On 20 September 2006, Smallwood left her flat after Panlock had begged him to stay. She called a former school friend Ashlea Cooper, who gave evidence to the inquest. Cooper recalled that Panlock \\"cried hysterically\\" and felt that she had made a fool of herself, saying: Shortly after 11:00pm on 20 September 2006, Brodie jumped from the top of a multilevel carpark in Hawthorn; she died from her injuries in The Alfred Hospital three days later. =Penalty= Four men and MAP Foundation, the company that owned Cafe Vamp, were charged with offences under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 for their part in bullying Panlock. They pleaded guilty to the charges on 8 February 2010, at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. They were ordered to pay $335,000 in fines as follows: *MAP Foundation ‚Äì $220,000 *Marcus Dela Cruz ‚Äì $30,000 *Nicholas Smallwood ‚Äì $45,000 *Rhys MacAlpine ‚Äì $30,000 *Gabriel Toomey ‚Äì $10,000 Law Reform =Victoria= Brodie Panlock's parents Damien and Rae Panlock successfully lobbied the Victorian Government to make changes to the law to include serious bullying as an offence punishable by imprisonment. On 4 November 2010 the Victorian Attorney-General asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission to review the adequacy of Victoria's criminal laws in dealing with serious bullying. The request was made to ensure that perpetrators of serious bullying receive appropriate sanction under Victoria's criminal law. On 5 April 2011, the Attorney-General introduced the Crimes Amendment (Bullying) Bill 2011 to Parliament, which amended the offence of stalking under section 21A of the Crimes Act 1958, to include serious bullying as a crime carrying a maximum penalty of ten years. The Bill received royal assent on 7 June 2011, and commenced immediately; it is colloquially known as \\"Brodie's Law\\". In the five years since the law's proclamation on 16 June 2011, fifty-eight offenders were charged with 140 offences against Brodie's Law. =National= The Victoria Attorney-General Robert Clark announced that Brodie's Law would be discussed at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in November 2011. The response by the Victorian government was backed by the Federal Assistant Treasurer, Bill Shorten. In September 2011 the New South Wales Government was examining the Victorian legislation. Damien and Rae Panlock continued to lobby the federal government because they feared that the states would fail to agree on the matter. On 26 May 2012, they met with Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and Bill Shorten, now Minister for Workplace Relations, and made a joint announcement of a national parliamentary inquiry into bullying. The report was released on 25 November 2012, and \\"contained 23 recommendations including the adoption of a new national definition of 'workplace bullying', a workplace bullying 'hotline' and a legislative and regulatory framework.\\" In response to the recommendations the Federal Parliament passed the Fair Work Amendment Act 2013 which gave the Fair Work Commission jurisdiction to hear and resolve \\"a workplace incidence of bullying\\". Brodie's Law Foundation In late 2012, Damien and Rae Panlock toured Victoria, using the first anniversary of the introduction of Brodie's Law to raise awareness about bullying. Damien and Rae Panlock continue to tour Australia and speak in workplaces and at public events, to campaign against bullying. The foundation assists with education in workplaces, schools and sporting clubs, with speaking engagements and production of education packages for teachers, club members, employers, and employees. In February 2017, Brodie's Law Foundation was formed and registered as a charity.

John Boyce Murray is known as one of the founders of Memorial Day, along with druggist Henry C. Welles.  Biography  Murray was born in Arlington, Vermont to Edward and Phoebe Manchester Murray. He married Angelina Savage in 1848 and they had two children, William and Maud while living in Bearytown (now Fayette), New York. He moved to Seneca Falls, NY in 1853 where he joined the state militia and began practicing law. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he was commissioned a Captain of the 50th New York State Engineers. He resigned his commission in the summer of 1862 but rejoined the 148th Regiment, New York Volunteers as a Major that fall. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1863 and to Colonel in 1864. He was brevetted to the rank of Brigadier General for meritorious service in 1865. He moved to Waterloo, New York after being elected Seneca County Clerk in the fall of 1865. It was here that he met Welles. Murray became active in the Grand Army of the Republic and was appointed postmaster. He resumed his law practice in 1880 and spoke at political rallies and Memorial Day services. It was following one of his speeches on October 7, 1884 that he became ill and succumbed the next day.  Presidential Proclamation  President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed Waterloo the birthplace of the holiday following the passage of House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 587 in 1966. The resolution and proclamation were based on research done by eight members of the community who comprised the Research Committee of the Waterloo Memorial Day Centennial Committee. Their purpose was to promote the centennial of the founding of Memorial Day on May 5, 1866. The holiday was supposedly conceived by Welles who communicated the idea to Murray, the county clerk who helped carry it out.  Myth Exposed  In 2014, almost fifty years after the proclamation, Bellware and Gardiner published The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America and call into question the veracity of that claim. According to the research committee, there are no contemporaneous reports of this celebration. Their earliest sources date from 1882, sixteen years after the event. Bellware and Gardiner, however, uncovered evidence that this story was a myth. This evidence includes an earlier report from 1875 in a New York newspaper that describes, in detail, Waterloo‚Äôs first Memorial Day and places it in 1868 as well as other inconsistencies between the historical record and the story compiled by the Centennial Committee. They also note a complete lack of discussion or debate by the congressional committee behind HCR 587. Unlike Welles, Murray seems complicit in the hoax. He was called the founder of Memorial Day during his lifetime and was in demand as a Memorial Day orator. Bellware and Gardiner credit Mary Ann Williams and the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia as the true originators of the holiday as abundant contemporaneous evidence from across the nation exists to substantiate the claim. In 2016, VFW Magazine featured an article by Doris Wolf in recognition of the 150th anniversary of Waterloo's Memorial Day observance. The editors added a note at the beginning of the article advising the readers of the existence of Bellware and Gardiner's book, that the Columbus, Georgia event of April 26, 1866 predated the Waterloo event by nine days and that the article on Waterloo was being presented to provoke historical inquiry. In 2019, the hoax was further explored (and exposed) by author Marshall S. Berdan in Welles‚Äô hometown of Glastonbury, CT. His article in The Glastonbury Citizen recounts Berdan‚Äôs disenchantment with the story after the staff of Waterloo‚Äôs National Memorial Day Museum was unable to provide the definitive evidence he sought prior to the placement of a plaque honoring Welles in Glastonbury. It also mentions some of Berdan's own research used to debunk the myth.

In particular, his choreography Previous (2003), again a piece for five dancers, marked that change of direction to a more abstract language and an in-depth study of improvisation. In addition to his choreographies, Salva collaborated in the period 2000-2004 regularly with choreographer Marc Vanrunxt (on his productions Performance and Most Recent), video artist Elke Vandermeerschen and visual artist Kristof Van Gestel.Biography of Salva Sanchis on the website of the Alkantara festival With Marc Vanrunxt he also collaborated afterwards. Collaboration with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas From 2002 to 2007, Salva Sanchis was associated with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker‚Äôs dance company Rosas.

In the period that Salva Sanchis was associated with Rosas, his work was determined by research guided by musical sources. By working with jazz music, he developed a personal approach to the relationship between dance and music. After that, music (often live music) remained an important element in his choreographic work.

Aljazeera, September 3, 2017. This, as well as a regular joint U.S.‚ÄìSouth Korea military exercise undertaken in August 2017 and U.S. threats, raised international tensions in the region and beyond.North Korea's Potential Targets: Guam, South Korea and Japan NYT, August 9, 2017. During 2017, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in early September, and heated rhetoric was exchanged, stoking fears about a possible war. While the tensions were mostly with the United States, North Korea threatened Australia twice with nuclear strikes throughout 2017, accusing them of siding with the U.S. and 'blindly' following them. By the beginning of 2018, however, tensions began to ease dramatically, with North Korea announcing the restoration of the Seoul‚ÄìPyongyang hotline and agreeing to hold talks with South Korea about participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Diplomatic activity flourished during the next few months, with the suspension of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea, and the 2018 inter-Korean summit in late April which culminated in the signing of the Panmunjom Declaration on 27 April 2018. An unprecedented bilateral summit between Kim and Trump was held in Singapore on 12 June 2018. It resulted in a joint declaration calling for the \\"full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\\". A second summit between Kim and Trump took place in Hanoi, Vietnam on 27‚Äì28 February 2019. Though talks there broke down, a third summit took place in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on 30 June 2019, with Trump becoming the first US leader to visit North Korea. Follow-up talks later in 2019, however, broke down within hours.David E. Sanger, U.S. Nuclear Talks With North Korea Break Down in Hours, New York Times (October 5, 2019). Background =North Korea's nuclear weapons program= Military parade in Pyongyang In his New Year's Day speech on January 2, 2017, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, said that the country was in the \\"last stage\\" of preparations to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). On May 3, North Korea issued a rare and harshly worded criticism of its chief ally, China, stating that \\"One must clearly understand that the D.P.R.K.'s line of access to nukes for the existence and development of the country can neither be changed nor shaken[...] And that the D.P.R.K. will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China, risking its nuclear program which is as precious as its own life, no matter how valuable the friendship is... China should no longer try to test the limits of the D.P.R.K.'s patience[...] China had better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of the D.P.R.K.-China relations.\\" The harsh commentary also accused the Chinese media (which is tightly controlled by the government) of dancing to the tune of the U.S. In early August 2017, The Washington Post reported an assessment, made by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in July 2017, which said that North Korea had successfully developed nuclear warheads for missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland (a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles). =Sanctions on North Korea; trade with China= Since North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006, the UN Security Council had passed a number of resolutions that imposed various sanctions on the DPRK, including restrictions on economic activity. Nevertheless, North Korea's gross domestic product grew by an estimated 3.9 percent in 2016, to about $28.5 billion, the fastest pace in 17 years; the progress was largely attributed to continued trade with China, which accounted for more than 90% of North Korea's international trade.North Korea's Secret Weapon?

Within hours, North Korea responded by announcing that it was considering attacking U.S. military bases in the US territory of Guam. On August 10, 2017, North Korean Lt. Gen. Kim Rak-gyom responded to Trump's speech of \\"fire and fury,\\" saying his words were \\"nonsense\\" and asserting that \\"reasonable dialogue\\" wasn't possible with Trump as president of the US. The North Korean governmental news agency KCNA reported that Kim Jong-un's military was considering a plan to fire four ICBMs, type Hwasong-12, into the Philippine Sea just 30‚Äì40 kilometers away from the island Guam. The flight time of missiles was estimated to be exactly 17 minutes and 45 seconds. A report by the KCNA suggested the plan would be put into operation in mid-August. U.S. officials stated that Joseph Y. Yun, the US envoy for North Korea policy, and Pak Song-il, a senior North Korean diplomat at the country's UN mission, were making regular contact during this dispute, through a conduit of communication they called the New York channel. On August 11, Trump wrote on Twitter: \\"Military solutions are now fully in place,[]locked and loaded,[]should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!\\" Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated that the standoff between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program was comparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Bob Woodward, in his 2020 book Rage, quoted Mike Pompeo as saying the national security team \\"never knew whether it was real, or whether it was a bluff\\", and reported that Jim Mattis slept fully dressed due to concerns about a North Korean attack. On August 14, Ukraine's Chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksandr Turchynov denied that it had ever supplied defense technology to North Korea, responding to an article in the New York Times that said North Korea might have purchased rocket engines from Ukrainian factory Yuzhmash, who have also denied the report.

On September 21, responding directly for the first time to President Trump's threat, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in his capacity of Chairman of State Affairs of DPRK called Trump a \\"mentally deranged U.S. dotard\\" () and vowed the \\"highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.\\" (The ad hominem insults aside, no reference was made to the \\"hostile policy\\" of the United States, a staple of North Korean statements otherwise.) Foreign minister Ri Yong-ho likewise alluded to Trump as a barking dog, and furthermore remarked that North Korea might be considering the largest test of a hydrogen bomb ever in the Pacific Ocean, which would constitute the first atmospheric nuclear test in the world since 1980 (last performed by China). On September 25, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused Trump of declaring war on his country, referring to Trump's recent tweet that North Korea \\"won't be around much longer.\\" The White House responded that the United States has not declared war. On September 30, Rex Tillerson stated while on a trip to China, that the U.S. and North Korea were in \\"direct contact\\". \\"We have lines of communications to Pyongyang\\" he said, \\"We're not in a dark situation\\". He further stated that the U.S. was \\"probing\\" the possibility of direct talks. \\"So stay tuned\\". The Associated Press has claimed that a long-used back-channel has been re-opened in the past months, the 'New York Channel', facilitating communication between Washington and Pyongyang. The next day however, Trump made a series of posts on Twitter which seemed to undermine Tillerson's efforts, claiming that Tillerson was \\"wasting his time\\" trying to negotiate with North Korea and that \\"we'll do what has to be done\\". Former CIA Director John O. Brennan, during a Q&A; session at Fordham University on October 18, remarked that \\"I think the prospects of military conflict in the Korean peninsula are greater than they have been in several decades... I don't think it's likely or probable, but if it's a 1-in-4 or 1-in-5 chance, that's too high.\\" Argument about nuclear armament of South Korea and Japan An argument emerged in both South Korea and Japan about the nuclear option, driven by worry that the United States might hesitate to defend the countries if doing so might provoke a missile launched from the North at major U.S. cities. In South Korea, polls show that 60 percent of the population favors building nuclear weapons, and that nearly 70 percent want the United States to reintroduce tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn in 1991.South Korea's Heated Debate Over the Possibility of Tactical Nukes In October, Hong Jun-pyo, one of the leading South Korean opposition figures, argued \\"only by deploying tactical nuclear weapons on South Korean territory can we negotiate with North Korea on an equal footing.\\" Republican Senator John McCain urged that the U.S. should consider deploying nuclear weapons to South Korea. Former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger mentioned \\"If North Korea continues to have nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons must spread in the rest of Asia.\\" Armistice violation in early November 2017 South Korean President Moon Jae-in with U.S. President Donald Trump in November 2017 On November 13, North Korean soldiers unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Oh Chong-song, a defector from crossing the border in the Joint Security Area.

A11 The missile was said to have flown to a record altitude of 2,800 miles and landed in the Sea of Japan into the exclusive economic zone, a distance of 600 miles. breaking up into three pieces. Initial assessments made by the Pentagon and subsequent analysis suggested that it was an ICBM judging by the height it traveled and, if fired on a normal trajectory, would more than be able to reach anywhere in the continental United States. The South Korean and Japanese defense ministries also concluded that an ICBM was likely launched and that it had traveled in a lofted trajectory. Japanese defense minister Itsunori Onodera also added that the missile broke apart into at least three pieces before it crashed into the waters located within the exclusive economic zone, indicating that the re- entry vehicle failed to survive re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. It was launched from a larger launcher vehicle, with 9 axles, as opposed to the 8-axle vehicles purchased from China. Each of the three ICBMs launched so far have been launched from three different locations. In a press conference shortly after the launch, President Trump said regarding North Korea's ICBM launch that \\"we'll handle it\\". Reports of sanction violations in December 2017 In late December 2017, it was reported that Chinese and Russian- flagged tanker ships had been observed conducting at-sea transfers of oil and petroleum products to North Korean ships over the course of the previous year, violating sanctions imposed by the US and United Nations. In posts on Twitter, Trump blasted China for defying the sanctions and continuing to support North Korea. One of these vessels, Lighthouse Winmore registered out of Hong Kong with 23 Chinese crew members, was seized by South Korean officials after reportedly delivering 600 tons of oil illegally to the North Korean vessel Sam Jong 2 in a part of the West Sea, between China and South Korea back in October.Choe Sang-Hun (29 December 2017) The New York Times \\"South Korea Seizes Ship Suspected of Sending Oil to North Korea\\" Chinese ships accused of breaking sanctions on North Korea , Financial Times, 2017-12-27Chinese Ship Which Illegally Sold Oil To North Korea Seized By Seoul , International Business Times, 2017-12-29 Executive Order 13722 blocks, among other items, the export of laborers which benefit the government of North Korea, or the Worker's Union Party.NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS PROGRAM 16 November 2016 On 1 January 2018 The New York Times reported that as many as 147,000 workers from North Korea now work abroad, and that the Worker's Union Party of Pyongyang garnishes from 30 to 80 percent of the workers' wages. The specific businesses reported included a shipyard, a shipping container manufacturer, and greenhouses in Poland.(1 January 2018) \\"Earning wages for Pyongyang within Poland\\" The New York Times pp. A1, A6 =Winter Olympics \\"d√©tente\\" and further developments: January‚ÄìFebruary 2018= Kim Jong-un meeting with South Korean envoys at the Workers' Party of Korea main building, 6 March 2018 The crisis had caused concern about the safety of the 2018 Winter Olympics to be held in Pyeongchang in South Korea. It is widely believed that if North Korea participates in the Games, the risk of escalation diminishes. This theory was later put to the test when North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un signaled a possibility to send athletes to the Games after all in his New Year's speech for 2018, saying \\"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility\\". The announcement was followed by South Korean agreement to participate in the first high-level talks with the North since December 2015. The talks were scheduled for 9 January 2018. North Korea is also prepared to talk to the IOC that week. In preparation for the North‚ÄìSouth talks, the two countries restored the Seoul‚ÄìPyongyang hotline, which had been inactive for almost two years, and exchanged related documents via fax. After these developments, North Korea's IOC member Chang Ung said that the participation of North Korean figure skaters again looked likely. The possibility of North Korean participation has stirred up talk about a possible Olympic boycott by the United States, after the administration of President Donald Trump, who has been at loggerheads with Kim Jong-un, has issued mixed messages. After discussions on 9 January 2018, North Korea announced they would send athletes to compete along with a delegation to attend the Winter Olympics. North and South Korea marched together in the Olympics opening ceremony and fielded a united women's ice hockey team. As well as the athletes, North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation, headed by Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, and President Kim Yong-nam, and including performers like the Samjiyon Orchestra. The delegation passed along an invitation to President Moon to visit North Korea. According to North Korea expert Sung-Yoon Lee, North Korea's policy toward the Olympics is to enhance North Korea's status: \\"One doesn't need to be a genius to see that this is what North Korea does: After having created a war-like, crisis atmosphere, (Kim [Jong-un]) takes a small step back and there's a collective sigh of relief that there's no war. It does wonders for North Korea's image.\\" False alarms in Hawaii and Japan Residents and tourists in the U.S. state of Hawaii were briefly thrown into a panic when an emergency alert was issued January 13, 2018, advising of an imminent ballistic missile threat. Another message was sent out about 40 minutes later describing the first alert as a false alarm. The incident is under investigation.\\"So this is what it feels like to believe that you could have a nuclear bomb or an incoming missile about to destroy your world. It's not a good feeling. Something must be done. Not just about the flawed mobile warning system in Hawaii but about a situation in which this scenario is even plausible, but about a world in which nations are poised to destroy each other with barely a moment's notice and bring about the end of life on this planet.\\" William J. Perry (15 January 2018) The Terrifying Lessons of Hawaii's Botched Missile Alert Three days later in Japan, broadcasting agency NHK also accidentally sent an alert about a North Korean missile launch in error. The error was corrected in minutes.(16 January 2018) Japanese News Outlet Mistakenly Sends North Korean Missile Alert 2018 State of the Union Address In his first State of the Union address, President Trump devoted much time to North Korea, stoking fears that an American strike was under serious consideration and not mere saber-rattling, particularly given the withdrawal of Dr. Victor Cha as Ambassador to the Republic of Korea and its similarity to George W. Bush's Axis of Evil 2002 State of the Union Address. Speculation about attack on North Korea In mid-February, as the Olympics were ongoing, after previous media reports, the Trump administration denied considering a so-called preemptive \\"bloody nose\\" attack on North Korea's nuclear program. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Thornton confirmed that the administration's policy remains one of \\"maximum pressure\\" via economic sanctions in order to get North Korea to negotiate on eliminating its nuclear weapons. Thornton however reiterated that military options are still \\"on the table\\" and that Pyongyang would be forced to give up its nuclear weapons \\"one way or another\\". =Beginning of peace efforts= Inter-Korean summits Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in during the April 2018 inter-Korean summit On April 27, the two leaders met at the Joint Security Area, with Kim Jong-un crossing the MDL in South Korean territory, the first time a North Korean leader has done so. President Moon also briefly crossed into the North's territory. Both Moon and Kim signed the Panmunjom Declaration, declaring the Korean conflict over and to sign a proper peace treaty by the end of the year. With that, Moon agreed to visit Pyongyang in the fall. =2018 Singapore summit= Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump during the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit On March 8, in a surprise departure from the hostile dialogue during 2017, Trump announced that he would meet with leader Kim Jong-un, and the two would meet likely by May. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that \\"in the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.\\" North Korea accepts South Korea's proposal to hold the high-level inter-Korean talks, which took place on March 29. On May 24, President Trump cancelled the planned meeting with Chairman Kim over \\"tremendous anger and open hostility\\" displayed by Kim. On June 1, President Trump reversed the cancellation and confirmed that the summit would take place on June 12 as planned. Following their talks, both leaders signed a joint declaration titled \\"Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong-un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit\\". It states: # The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.‚ÄìDPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity. # The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. # Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. # The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains including the immediate repatriation of those already identified. =Suspicion of continued nuclear program= In June 2018, NBC News reported that U.S. intelligence believed that North Korea was increasing production of enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and that, in addition to its known fuel-producing facility at Yongbyon, it had multiple secret nuclear sites. In August 2018, US officials said that North Korea could be continuing to build nuclear weapons, and days later the United Nations Security Council received reports that North Korea may not have stopped its nuclear program. The reports also claimed that North Korea was violating the UN sanctions. In late September 2018, Trump claimed that North Korea had already stopped nuclear testing, and he said that the United States would not impose any required timeline for North Korea's total denuclearization. \\"I've got all the time in the world...we are not playing the 'time game.' If takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter,\\" Trump said. He was responding to and denying U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's claim that North Korea's denuclearization would be completed by January 2021. Trump maintained that sanctions against North Korea would stay in place until it had denuclearized. Satellite images obtained by CNN in December 2018 show that the Yeongjeo-dong long-range missile base (the existence of which was already public knowledge) remains active. The images also revealed continued construction on an underground facility and construction on a facility (the existence of which was previously unknown to the public) several miles from Yeongjeo-dong. = 2019 Hanoi summit = A second summit between Kim and Trump occurred on February 27‚Äì28, 2019.

It was published on 6 August 2010 for Windows. The game received positive reception from critics and won a BAFTA Award.  Gameplay  The player plays as a squad of miniature Marines wearing condom hats who are sent into various people's vaginas and rectums, as well as other parts of the body, in order to kill real-life sexually transmitted infections (STI), which are depicted as monsters. The right weapons must be used to destroy them, which include anti-bacterial and anti-viral guns. The player can order their squad, which consists of up to three additional Marines besides the player, to attack certain enemy types while they cover the others.  Plot  The main character is Jack, who commands Foxtrot Squad. The squad, whose members have been deemed too useless by the \\"top brass\\", is forced to embark on a dangerous mission with a combat veteran in the hopes that they will either \\"shape up\\" or die.  Development  The game was funded by Channel 4, in order to promote safe sex for teenage boys. Developer Dan Marshall compared the game to Gunstar Heroes in its design. He called his Google Search history when making the game \\"eclectic, horrific and embarrassing\\", saying that \\"if my ISP are snooping on me, they're presumably pretty concerned about my well- being\\", and saying that the game's artist was \\"constantly getting sent stuff he desperately didn't want to look at\\". He also said that his eyes were \\"opened\\" about sexual health, and realised how easy STIs were to transmit. The game was rejected from release on the Xbox 360 by Microsoft after being advised that it would fail peer review due to its overly sexual content. This decision was derided by critics, with Destructoid saying \\"I think it's very disturbing that we have a culture where deplorable violence is considered normal, but sex [...] is treated like something freakish and wrong\\".  Reception  The game was positively received by critics. Eurogamer said that it was \\"genuinely refreshing to experience something that gets straight to the point\\" about sexual health, pointing to \\"frightening\\" statistics amongst teenagers. Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game's writing and music, despite remarking on some audio issues. The game was criticised by a feminist blog, Hoyden About Town, for being \\"misogynist\\". In a counter-argument by Lewis Denby of Gamasutra, he said that the game does not try to send the message that women's genitals are \\"filthy and disease-ridden\\", but rather was a \\"great idea\\" due to its focus on sexual education, calling the article \\"tremendously bad reporting\\", but ultimately admitting that \\"the author has a point\\" and that humorous games about \\"serious issues\\" will always be open to criticism.

The first written record of the castle dates to 1303, from which it is clear that a Herr Richelin, a knight in Zavelstein, had lived in the castle, probably from 1280. By 1311 Zavelstein surfaces in the documents as a W√ºrttemberg castle and was thus owned by the counts of W√ºrttemberg. Together with their lordship of the castles of Neuenb√ºrg, Calw, Fautsberg, Wildberg and Nagold, they were able to maintain their influence over the newly acquired territories in the northeastern Black Forest. In the 14th century, the castle was frequently let out as a fief or used as a security. In 1342, Paul of Giltlingen sold the fief of the castle for 1,530 pounds of hellers to Count G√∂tz of T√ºbingen. Three years later Zavelstein was transferred for a pledge of 5,000 pounds of hellers from Count Ulrich IV and Eberhard II of W√ºrttemberg to Count Palatine William of T√ºbingen. Because William died one year later without issue, Zavelstein returned to W√ºrttemberg in accordance with the contract. The castle became a Leibgedinge in 1365 for William's brother, G√∂tz of T√ºbingen, but he gave it up just one year later. Ambush in Wildbad Zavelstein Castle gained significance in 1367, when the Count of W√ºrttemberg Eberhard II, the Whiner (der Greiner) and his son, Ulrich, were able to escape to the castle from an ambush in the Wildbad by the House of Martinsv√∂gel. Due to the poor financial situation of the House of W√ºrttemberg the fief of the Barony of Zavelstein was constantly extended. From a 1396 deed, it is clear that the pledge to Gerhard of Straubenhardt had passed down to his legal successors, Straub of Straubenhardt and Schimpf G√ºltlingen. It was not until 1468 that Burkhard von Ehingen was given an order to settle the income of the castle and town of Zavelstein for 2,600 guilders. The knights of Ehingen held ownership rights until 1552. During the Peasant Wars, the castle was damaged in 1525 but not occupied. Duke Christopher of W√ºrttemberg redeemed the pledge in 1552 from Hans of Ehingen In 1554, Jordan of Braitenbach on Ro√ünitz was enfeoffed with the castle. From 1554 to 1589, he repaired the castle facilities for 3,500 guilders, as can be seen from the bills for construction work. After his death in 1593, his widow Agnes of Braitenbach presumably continued to live there. After her death in 1612, the fief was transferred by John Frederick of W√ºrttemberg to Freiherr Benjamin Buwinghausen of Wallmerode. In 1620 the Freiherr of Zavelstein bought it and began extensive building work that lasted until 1630. During this time, the castle was rebuilt into a schloss. In 1634, the castle was plundered after the Battle of N√∂rdlingen. After the baron died of the plague in 1635 in Stuttgart, his son James Frederick Buwinghausen took possession of the property. He subsequently became well known as the Obervogt of Calw, especially in connexion with witch trials. In 1686, Eberhard Frederick Buwinghausen took possession of the estate as well as his father's offices. Following the destruction of Hirsau and Calw, Zavelstein was destroyed in 1692 by French troops under Melac. Only a few parts of the castle remained habitable, but Zavelstein was abandoned by the Buwinghausens. Eberhard Frederick Buwinghausen sold the estate to Duke Eberhard Louis of W√ºrttemberg in 1710 for 20,000 guilders. However, the castle was not rebuilt and remained a ruin. In 1844, the stairs of the bergfried were renewed and it has been used since as a viewing tower. In 1991, archaeological investigations were carried out during reconstruction work.

He is best known for his work with keyboardist/bandleader Sun Ra and is an original member of the Sun Ra Arkestra under the direction of Marshall Allen. Background Knoel Scott was born Noel Scott on July 18, 1956 in Baltimore, Maryland, to Brooks and Kathaniel Walker Scott. His father Brooks Scott is listed as deceased on Scott's birth certificate, and he was raised by Robert and Edith Nero in Jamaica, Queens. Scott studied at Queens College from 1974 to 1976, and also at State University of New York at Old Westbury, where he graduated in 1979. \\"Knoel Scott Biography\\", official website. Scott studied additionally at Jazzmobile with such musicians as Frank Foster, Charles Davis, John Stubblefield and Lisle Atkinson.Charles Waring, \\"SUN RA & ME: saxophonist Knoel Scott tells SJF about his time with the legendary bandleader\\", Soul and Jazz and Funk, August 26, 2011. Sun Ra Arkestra Scott auditioned for Sun Ra in July 1979, having first heard the Arkestra at the Beacon Theatre in 1977‚Äì78. Scott said in a 2011 interview that he \\"immediately decided that membership in the Arkestra would be [his] life's dream.\\" He subsequently began recording and touring with the Sun Ra Arkestra.

Return to Sun Ra & present In 1988 Sun Ra invited Scott back to the Arkestra, to fill a reed-section chair temporarily vacant during an absence of Marshall Allen. Scott retained that chair to the present day ‚Äî usually playing alto sax but occasionally tenor or his native baritone. Sun Ra also encouraged Scott to dance and sing, and in a 2012 review of the Arkestra for two.one.five Magazine, Elija Bliss says: \\"Vocalist and saxophonist Knoel Scott's voice, honeyed with just the right amount of gravel, echoed clear across the field, melding with the big brass of the Arkestra's horn section, coaxing patrons from their lawn chairs to the grassy dance floor. After all, music that swings this hard just can't be listened to sitting down.\\" Reviewing a 2015 appearance by the Knoel Scott Quartet (KSQ) at the 100 Club in London, Kevin Le Gendre wrote: \\"Although his main CV credit, mainstay of the Sun Ra Arkestra for the best part of four decades, may suggest that he comes from one of the most singular of locations on the landscape of African-American music, the saxophonist unveils a much wider set of references. In his tails and engaging stage presence we see a shade of Cab Calloway; in the unabashed romanticism of his singing, particularly on the second set highlight 'Don't Misunderstand' we feel the spirit of Nat 'King' Cole; and in the bulk of the material we hear extensions of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie‚Äôs bebop innovations.... Scott, and this is the most impressive thing about the performance, provides an all too rare display of how all of the aforesaid disparate historic characters are part of a bigger, coherent story.\\"Kevin Le Gendre, \\"Knoel Scott takes on tradition at the 100 Club\\", Jazzwise, 2015-11-12.

Anna Gordon S. Anna Gordon (January 9, 1832 - unknown) was a physician and author of Camping in Colorado with Suggestions to Gold Seekers, Tourists and Invalids (1879). Early life Sarah Anna Gordon was born in Charlemont, Massachusetts, on January 9, 1832. On her father's side, she was a descendant of John Steele Sr (1591-1665), who established Hartford, Connecticut. Among the distinguished persons in her family lineage was Noah Webster, the son of Noah Webster Sr. and Mercy Steele, a descendant of Governor William Bradford of Plymouth Colony. On her mother's side she is a descendant of William Ward, of Sudbury, Massachusetts, many of whose descendants won historic distinction as military men and statesmen. When Gordon was young, her parents moved to New York, where she was reared and took the first year of a college course of study, which was afterwards completed in Illinois. Career Before marriage, Gordon had charge of the ladies' department in Rock River Seminary, and subsequently, the same position was twice tendered her in Ripon College (Wisconsin). She was offered the position of principal of the newly formed State Normal school of Wisconsin. She attended teachers' institutes, wherever held throughout the State, for the purpose of agitating the subject of a normal school, until the desire became an object accomplished. In 1858, she married W. A. Gordon, M. D., of Wausau, Wisconsin. After the Civil War they moved to Hannibal, Missouri. After her marriage, Gordon immediately commenced the study of medicine with her husband, attended a partial course of lectures, and was called upon by the people to assist him in an overburdening practice. In 1859 and 1860 the Gordons were connected with the Smithsonian Institution, taking meteorological notes and making collections for the same. Gordon filled an engagement of one year as associate editor on the Central Wisconsin, and then joined her husband in Louisville, Kentucky, where he was stationed most of the time during the Civil War. In Louisville, Gordon gave considerable time to the study of art, the remaining time being devoted to the relief of the suffering soldiers around her. Situated near her husband's headquarters at one time was a camp of homeless southern refugees, overtaken by the smallpox. They could find no physician to serve them. Gordon's husband was prohibited both by want of time and the exposures it would bring to the soldiers. She learned of their pitiful condition and at once went to their relief and fought the scourge until it vanished. Gordon served as hospital officer to her husband in different capacities as unavoidable circumstances created vacancies not readily supplied. Gordon was a weekly contributor to the literary columns of the Louisville Sunday Journal during the war. She has been a member of the Dante Society of America since its organization, and in 1882 and 1883 was State editor for the Missouri Woman's Christian Temperance Union on the Chicago Signal. Camping In Colorado With Suggestions To Gold-seekers, Tourists And Invalids During a residence in Denver, Colorado, Gordon was the first person to suggest the demand for the newsboys' home there, which she had the opportunity of aiding in establishing. She was also assistant superintendent of Chinese work in that city for some time. Gordon was the author of: Music of Waters, Missing Gems, Pebbles, Camping in Colorado with Suggestions to Gold Seekers, Tourists and Invalids (1879, The Author's Publishing Company, 1st edition, 1882, W B Smith & Co., New York, 2nd edition), and several papers and poems that have entered into other collections. Camping in Colorado descrived her and her family's adventures as they camped in the Rocky Mountains near Denver: \\"At the gates of the park we discovered an open cabin. It was built of unhewn logs, and covered with earth. The windows were gone, and the paths that once led to it were overgrown with bramble. We learned that this had been the home of Mountain Jim, who, during his life, had been known as trapper, hunter, fishman, and more. The desolate cabin still serves as a monument to his memory; and it is pointed out to strangers, the thrilling of this strange life and tragic death are related; all of which have become historically associated with the park\\"‚ÄîS. Anna Gordon. In 1889, Gordon graduated with honors from the Hahnemann Medical College of Chicago. In medicine, she was a homeopathist.

The musical style is based on Black Metal influenced by Progressive Metal, Doom Metal and Thrash-/Heavy Metal.  History  The band was founded in the year 2003 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria. Founding members are Andras (a.k.a. Moloc), Dagon and Harbarth. In the founding year the first demo ‚ÄûOf Ancient Splendour‚Äú was released. In 2004 they published their first album ‚ÄúWorshiping Times of Old‚Äù. On these two releases Dagon was responsible for vocals, Harbarth played guitar and Andras drums and bass. Andras additionally took over the main part of composing on the split-album with Lost Life published via Fullmoon Funeral Productions. Harbarth left the band in 2005 due to personal circumstances and lack of motivation. Developments at that time in the Black Metal scene (brotherhoods, federations) caused Andras and Dagon to withdraw from the scene and stage since they shared the opinion that the true evolvement of this genre can solely be found in loneliness of the individual. For the album ‚ÄúChroniken des Ablebens‚Äù (29.8.2008, Debemur Morti Productions) Andras completely took over composing, the whole instrumentation (drums, guitars, bass) and a part of the lyrics. Dagon concentrated on vocals and lyrics. Being a concept album, ‚ÄúChroniken des Ablebens‚Äù was supposed to extend the moment of dying with all its emotional distress to the length of a CD. In addition to composition and complete instrumentation, Andras gives his debut as a vocalist on the concept album ‚ÄûExIst‚Äú (2011, Debemur Morti Productions) since Dagon had left the formation in 2010. Andras‚Äô very personal album concept and the missing opportunity for rehearsals are said to be the main reasons. The album‚Äôs concept of psychotic dissociative conditions is reflected in the album‚Äôs title ‚ÄúExIst‚Äù, ‚ÄúEx‚Äù representing the past and ‚ÄúIst‚Äù synonymous for the present; both syllables are separated by a line (presumably a personal point of time). In a bilingual approach it is also supposed to be interpreted as the verb ‚Äúto exist‚Äù in contrast to ‚Äúto live‚Äù in order to define a condition far away from emotion or personality in consequence of a chronic psychiatric disease. In 2012 Andras tried to recruit session members for live purposes in order to bring Infestus back on stage after 7 years of avoidance. This undertaking failed at the first attempt and resulted in dissolution of the first live line-up. The first concert with new live-members and Andras appearing as vocalist on stage took place in 2013. Since then many line-up changes took place. On April 25, 2014 the second concept album ‚ÄûThe Reflecting Void‚Äú was released, again by Debemur Morti Productions. The concept interprets the sensation of inner emptiness as a deceiving reflexion which hides the true reason and is broken open by Andras in order to dare a glimpse on repressed truths. The synthesis of this concept concludes that catharsis is an illusion. Then as now, Andras describes the deep emotional connection with his work which he defines as his inner demons that gain access to our reality through his hands. With ‚ÄûThe Reflecting Void‚Äú Andras moves away from Black Metal a little more and leaves room for other influences in order to create a more complete picture of his personality.  Style  Initially rooted in Black Metal, the musical expression evolves with Andras continuing Infestus as a solo-project to an inventive composition of different styles using Black Metal as foundation. Melancholic melodies are being paired with raw aggression, introspective acoustic moments and bluesy guitars. Within the complex partly progressive compositions which from time to time appear ‚Äúalmost jazzy‚Äù, ‚Äúold boundaries of Black Metal have no access here‚Äù  Discography  * 2004: \\"Worshiping Times of Old\\" CD (self released) * 2008: \\"Chroniken des Ablebens\\" CD/LP (Debemur Morti Productions) * 2011: \\"ExIst\\" CD (Debemur Morti Productions) * 2014: \\"The Reflecting Void\\" CD/LP (Debemur Morti Productions) * 2018: \\"Thrypsis\\" CD/LP/limited LP (Debemur Morti Productions)  Splits and compilations  * 2005: Split Album mit Lost Life CD * 2012: Debemur Morti Productions compilation CD  References   External links  * Official page * Facebook Category:German heavy metal musical groups ","title":"Infestus"},{"id":"54864124","text":"Mar√≠a Asunci√≥n Calca√±o Ruiz, usually known as Mary Calca√±o or by her married name Mary Keeler (1906‚Äì1992), was the first Venezuelan woman to be granted a pilot's licence.

He spent a decade in the Roman Curia as under-secretary of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.  Biography  He was born on 6 June 1948 in Vasai, Maharashtra, India. He was ordained a priest on 30 October 1976 for the Diocese of Bombay. His family relations include both Christians and Hindus; one of his cousins was among the founders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the principal force behind contemporary Hindu nationalism. He was incardinated in the Diocese of Vasai on 22 May 1998. He studied philosophy at the Catholic University of Lyon and lived in the ecumenical community of Taiz√© in France for seven years, spending one of those years as a volunteer in a refugee camp in Bangladesh. He then earned a master's degree in theology at Maryknoll Seminary in New York and a doctorate from Fordham University. Machado served from 1999 to 2008 as under-secretary of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. In that position he helped organize the interreligious prayer service held in Assisi in 2002. Pope Benedict XVI gave him the personal title of archbishop and named him head of the Diocese of Nashik on 16 January 2008. He received his episcopal consecration on 8 March 2008 from Cardinal Oswald Gracias. When he first heard of the 2008 bombings in Mumbai, when the attackers were still unidentified, he said: \\"We do not have to be superficial by saying that it is all about religion. The situation is extremely complex. Sometimes these tragedies are given faces and names, but we have to go deeper in our analysis of the causes.\\" Pope Benedict transferred him to Vasai on 10 November 2009, and he was installed there on 19 December. He chairs the Office for Interreligious Dialogue of the Federation of Asian (Catholic) Bishops' Conferences (FABC); and Office for Interreligious Dialogue of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI). He has developed a good working relationship with the Sikh community and advocates dialogue with Hindus to ease their concerns about conversions to Christianity. He has repeatedly denied that conversions are ever involuntary; as early as 2000 in a meeting at the Vatican, he challenged Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to identify a specific instance of forced conversion.

He was a member of the faculty at Stanford University from 1961 to 1967. In 1967, he accepted the position of Professor at the UCLA School of Medicine and Chief of the Division or Respiratory and Critical Care Physiology at Harbor-UCLA School of Medicine in Torrance, CA. At the time of his death he was Professor Emeritus at the UCLA School of Medicine. Wasserman worked extensively on pulmonary physiology. He was one of the first persons who used exercise testing for the interaction of cardiovascular, ventilatory and metabolic responses. He is the founder of the Wasserman 9-Panel Plot, named after himself. This Nine-Panel Plot is a standard layout for the graphical representation of data produced by a cardiopulmonary exercise test. He also described the \\"gear wheel model\\" used for explaining results obtained from the exercise test in humans. He described how to determine the ‚Äúanaerobic threshold‚Äù by using ventilatory and cardiovascular gas exchange responses during exercise testing. Dr. Wasserman defined the ‚Äúanaerobic threshold‚Äù in 1964 as the exercise intensity beyond which the molecule, lactic acid, accumulates in the blood. He recognized the significance of this finding, as lactic acid accumulation may reflect health risk due to a deficit in oxygen supply. He showed that the anaerobic threshold can be used to determine a health risk due to inadequate oxygen availability. He defined the theory and practice of detecting the anaerobic threshold by analyzing changes in the composition of the expired air. The anaerobic threshold is now used in diagnosis of diseases and in the training of athletes internationally. Dr. Wasserman was a mentor to numerous physicians and scientists in training. The Wasserman Visiting Professorship at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center was established in 1999 and is awarded annually to a leader in pulmonary medicine. This is an event when trainees, some from decades ago, reunite to visit and learn the latest in advancements in pulmonary medicine. He was chief of the division of ‚ÄúRespiratory and Critical Care Physiology and Medicine‚Äù at the UCLA Harbor Hospital Medical Center in Torrance, CA between 1967 and 1997. After 1997 he continued doing research and teaching at this location. He was Professor Emeritus on Recall at the UCLA School of Medicine. He has written nearly 400 peer-reviewed articles, 5 books, several book chapters and scientific reviews in his career that spanned 70 years. Amongst the most noteworthy was his 1967 landmark paper entitled, Interaction of Physiological Mechanisms during Exercise. He is father of the physiologist Dr. David H. Wasserman of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. He died in Palos Verdes Estates, California on 22 June 2020, aged 93.

It has around 500 members and is one of the oldest air sports clubs in Germany.Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftfahrt ‚Äì History. Webpage of the Association. Accessed on 7.8.2017.  Field of activity  The association operates at two locations: The General Aviation group at Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport, the model airplane group in Diedenbergen. A glider training school at the airport Gelnhausen was closed in the 1970s. The FVL fleet includes several aircraft, from simple training aircraft such as the Cessna 150 or Diamond DA20, to full instrument rated aircraft such as Piper PA-28. Furthermore, the club has a very extensive model aircraft fleet. The club offers courses to obtain a private pilot license, as well as certifications for radiotelephony, night flight and alpine instructions, as well as pinch hitter courses. In addition, it organizes fly- in's in many places in Germany. FVL is recognized as a non-profit organization. It promotes aerospace in the region and supports its members in general aviation. Since 1958, he has initiated the \\"Rund um Egelsbach\\" flight of friends. Since then, many pilots from flying schools and clubs have been demonstrating their flying skills every year. FVL is a member of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.Membership List AOPA. Accessed 10.08.2017. The association is financed by membership fees and private donations.  History  = Foundation = At the suggestion of Franz Linke, the future director of the Meteorological and Geophysical Institute of the Goethe University Frankfurt in Frankfurt am Main, the Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftschiffahrt was founded November 1908 in the association was registered at the Register of the Royal District CourtWissenschaftliche Gesellschaft f√ºr Flugtechnik (1913) Mitgliederliste. In: Jahrbuch der Wissenschaftlichen Gesellschaft f√ºr Flugtechnik. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. = ILA 1909 = At the end of 1908, Lord Mayor Adickes took up the plan to organize the first International Airship Exhibition in Frankfurt, soon to be commonly known as the ILA. Effectively supported by the members of the newly founded association's board of directors, who are enthusiastic and influential about aviation. The opening ceremony of the ILA took place on 10 July 1909 with the participation of the citizens of Frankfurt, important aviation and science men and many foreign guests. With a happy idea, the board of the' Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftschiffahrt' enriched the festival programme of the ILA by organising an \\"aviation week\\" on the exhibition grounds. It became the first international aviation competition in Germany. = Frankfurt-Rebstock airfield = In 1911, the Frankfurt-Rebstock airfield was acquired by the Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftschiffahrt. The FVL thus became the operator of Frankfurt's first airport, even though in the beginning only balloons and airships landed here. With the general annual meeting of the Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftschiffahrt on 10 December 1912, the merger with the Frankfurter Flugtechnische Verein was decided and the Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftschiffahrt was renamed Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftfahrt. This name has been preserved to this day. Frankfurt am Main experienced a new sensation on September 30, 1929, when Fritz von Opel demonstrated the world's first independent rocket flight at the Rebstock airfield in Frankfurt. Initiated and organized by the Frankfurt Aviation Association, the legendary German giant flying boat DO-X with its twelve 500 hp engines and a wingspan of 48 metres landed on the Main west of Frankfurt in the same year. = Wartime = After the Nazi seizure of power, the Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftfahrt was \\"brought into line\\" with all other aviation associations. His considerable fortune was transferred to the Flight Sport Club Hessen-Nassau. All documents concerning the association's assets were destroyed. = After the war = The Cumulus Club for Technology, Sport and Meteorology was created on April 19, 1950 to maintain at least the tradition of aviation in Frankfurt and to keep the spirit of the sports community alive. His first chairman was Wachter. In this \\"aviatorless, terrible time\\" their comforts and encouragement came from Wolf Hirth, Jachtmann, Hanna Reitsch and Pruss. A spring festival served the purpose of social cohesion. In addition, the re-establishment of the German Aero-Club in Frankfurt on 4 August 1950 was another important driving force behind the entire German aviation industry. On August 1, 1951, when the balloon flight and gliding flight were approved by the Allied authorities, the Cumulus Club was renamed the \\"Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftfahrt\\" (Frankfurt Aviation Association) under its then chairman Richard Held. On Sunday, 19 August 1951, Frankfurt had its first Rhine-Main gliding day, which was held under the auspices of Pan American World Airways in conjunction with the Frankfurt Association for Aviation and other associations. On 22 June 1952, an International Mega-Flight Day was held at the Rhine-Main-Airport, organised by the association. He contributed to the fact that the Frankfurt Association for Aviation was able to attract many new members. = In Egelsbach = To the great joy of all German powered pilots, motor flying was allowed again on May 6, 1955. Already on 23 June 1955, the Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftfahrt bought a Piper Cub L 4 J from donations of members and contributions for DM 8,000.00 and resumed its motorised flight operations in Egelsbach, where the club had relocated its operations following the confiscation of Rebstock Airport as a result of the Second World War by the American occupation troops. Numerous volunteer flight instructors - mainly pilots from the Second World War - were available to teach theory and practice. They played a major role in causing the number of members to skyrocket. From the end of the 1960s onwards, the Frankfurt Aviation Association had a fairly continuous membership of about 500 members. Of these, about 100 were members of the model aircraft. The training also went well. Due to the good training by volunteer flight instructors, up to 40 club members earned their pilot's license here each year. The association also held training courses for night flights, Alpine instruction in Innsbruck, the radiotelephone certificate, IFR licence and CPL II. Incidentally, the Bavarian politician and later finance minister of Germany, Franz Josef Strau√ü, also acquired his IFR license here. Community service  The Frankfurter Verein f√ºr Luftfahrt together with other associations, airplanes and pilots based at Frankfurt-Egelsbach Airport provided airplanes and pilots at the AKHD Flugtag for the good cause. This enabled around 30 families with their seriously ill children of the Children's and Youth Hospital Service Frankfurt/Rhine-Main (AKHD) to make a sightseeing flight over the Rhine-Main region possible. Every year on the weekend after St. Nicholas Day, the association organizes a children's night out at the airfield together with the police flying squadron in Hesse. Santa Claus flies with his angel to the airport by police helicopter and then distributes presents and biscuits to children from the area around the airport. = 110th anniversary = On 18 and 19 August 2018, 110 years after its foundation, the association organised an airfield festival in Egelsbach under the motto \\"reachable flying\\". Together with Physikalischer Verein, this was also the occasion to hold a series of lectures on the subject in Frankfurt. Under the name \\"Der Traum vom Fliegen - Sterne, Wetter und BigData in der Luftfahrt\\" he continued the beginnings of the association when he regularly informed the citizens of Frankfurt about the weather and new experiences in flying.

In 1960, the FVL purchased an area of 10,000 square metres for the model pilots in the Diedenbergen district. As early as 1961, a runway of 12 √ó 50 metres made of lime cement was built there. This material was not winterproof and therefore unsuitable for the purpose. In 1965, a new 25 √ó 75-metre asphalt runway was therefore built in Diedenbergen. A required building was leased for this purpose. In 1969 the access road from Weilbach to the model airfield was asphalted. In 1970, the Darmstadt Regional Council granted the club's Model Flight Group official permission for the use of the airspace on the Weilbach model airfield. The importance of the model flying group in Frankfurt's aviation association grew steadily due to its sporting achievements. From 1970 onwards, the group made the national team participants available in uninterrupted succession. 7 club members became world champions. Model pilots were always among the best aerobatics and successfully represented the club at international competitions.

Geoffrey O'Brien wrote in the Village Voice, \\"The most exciting book of new poetry I've read in the last several years is a translation of a 1600-year-old Sanskrit epic. Hank Heifetz has had the audacity to take on a formally elaborate, densely allusive masterpiece in which rhythm, assonance, and wordplay are crucial--and the gift to make American poetry out of it.\\" Village Voice, Review by Geoffrey O'Brien, Issue #90, New York, December, 1990.

Publications  Throughout her life, Arlene Gottfried freelanced for many top publications, including The New York Times Magazine, Fortune, Life, and The Independent in London. In her later years, she published five books of her work: The Eternal Light (Dewi Lewis Publishing, 1999), Midnight (powerHouse 2003), Sometimes Overwhelming (2008), Bacalaitos and Fireworks (powerHouse 2011), and Mommie: Three Generations of Women (powerHouse 2015). The Eternal Light focussed on a choir Gottfried first saw at a Gospel Fest, which also led to her discovery of her love for singing. Midnight is a series of photographs that followed a man named Midnight who struggled with schizophrenia. Sometimes Overwhelming is a compilation of her photographs in the 1970s and 1980s New York. Bacalitos and Fireworks focused on New York's Puerto Rican community in the 1970s and 1980s. Mommie: Three Generations of Women was a portrait of three generations of women in her family: her immigrant grandmother, her mother and her sister. Mommie: Three Generations of Women later received Time Magazine‚Äôs Best Photobook Award in 2016.

Later in the 70s, she moved with her Jewish immigrant family to the neighborhoods of Alphabet City and the Lower East Side. When Arlene was a teenager, her father gave her an old 35mm camera, which she eventually took to Woodstock, even though she said, \\"I had no clue what I was doing‚Äù. She credited her upbringing for giving her the ability to get intimate photographs of strangers: ‚ÄúWe lived in Coney Island, and that was always an exposure to all kinds of people, so I never had trouble walking up to people and asking them to take their picture.‚Äù Gottfried graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology taking photography courses.

Ending the war was a monumental task, largely because of the tenacity and loyalty of German officers who continued to fight on even when facing disaster. Max Husmann played a crucial role in persuading high-ranking officers of the Wehrmacht and the SS to force a surrender of German troops in spite of Hitler's orders. Husmann was also central to ensuring the Operation kept going throughout the difficult months of spring 1945. Max Husmann was a teacher who founded Institut Montana, a residential school near Zug in Switzerland, in 1926, based on the belief that education could help build a more tolerant and more peaceful world.  Biography  Max Husmann was born in Proskurow, in current day Ukraine, but when he was ten years old his family emigrated to Switzerland, perhaps because of their Jewish origins. The Husmanns settled in Zurich, where Max gained the Swiss Matura and went on to study Mathematics at the ETH and then earn his doctorate in 1915. Having helped to pay for his studies by giving private lessons, he set up a college, which was to merge with the Institut Minerva, to tutor students for entry to the ETH. In 1925, Husmann bought the old Hotel Sch√∂nfels on the Zugerberg overlooking Lake Zug as a site where he could found a school. The Institut Montana opened the following year, and then expanded, acquiring the Felsenegg in 1937 making space to create sports grounds, dig a swimming pool, and equip science laboratories and workshops. By 1938 there were almost three hundred boys on the school roll. Montana only just survived the war years, suffering severe losses in numbers of students and staff, and having its buildings requisitioned for troops and refugees. In 1946, Husmann handed day-to-day management to Dr Josef Ostermayer but also founded the Max Husmann Foundation to safeguard the principles on which he had founded the school. He lived much of the rest of his life in Rome, where he died of an arteriosclerosis in 1965. He was buried in Zug.  Husmann the Peace-Broker  In February 1945, an Italian baron, Luigi Parrilli, contacted Max Husmann with information about an alleged German plan to scorch the earth of northern Italy, destroying agriculture, industry and homes as the Allied advance put the Wehrmacht into retreat. Parrilli claimed to have contacts among German officers ready to negotiate a surrender and avert this catastrophe. Husmann passed the intelligence to Colonel Max Waibel of the Swiss Nachrichtendienst, with whom he already had a working and friendly relationship. Waibel contacted Allen Dulles of the American Office of Secret Services who was working quietly, given Switzerland‚Äôs neutral status, out of Bern. Husmann‚Äôs role in the secret Operation was in part logistical, meeting and accompanying the German negotiators, Guido Zimmer, Eugen Dollmann and Obergruppenf√ºhrer Karl Wolff, on their discrete journeys from the Swiss-Italian border to meetings in Lugano, Ascona, Zurich and Lucerne. But he was also highly involved in the mediations that enabled Germans and Allies to find a point from which to pursue fruitful discussions. Max Waibel described several crucial stages of the Operation where Husmann‚Äôs skills at reasoning were the key to unlocking negotiations that would otherwise have reached an impasse. A critical episode, according to Waibel‚Äôs report, was Wolff‚Äôs journey to Zurich to meet Allen Dulles for the first time. Husmann accompanied the Germans across the Alps, ensuring that the presence of high ranking Nazi officials on Switzerland‚Äôs neutral territory remained undiscovered. Waibel described in detail the dialogue shared between the Obergruppenf√ºhrer and the school-master in a curtained compartment of the train. The words reflect those later used by Wolff about his move from absolute belief in Hitler to recognition that it was against the interests of the German people to continue the war. Husmann again acted as an intermediary at Ascona on March 19, when the Allied Generals Lemnitzer and Airey were sent from headquarters at Caserta to meet with the Germans to discuss the surrender. The following weeks, as March turned into April and Allied troops launched a fierce offensive against the German troops still holding on to Italy, the Operation met and overcame a series of setbacks - the danger that Himmler and Hitler were picking up on Wolff‚Äôs covert visits to Switzerland, increasing tensions between the Anglo-American and Soviet Allies and strenuous arguments between Wolff and the German Generals in command of the troops in northern Italy about the laying down of arms. When Allied headquarters sent orders to Dulles to call off the Operation, Waibel and Husmann held the situation together with the German emissaries at Waibel‚Äôs home near Lucerne. Their decision was vindicated when the order was rescinded and arrangements made for the signing of the surrender document on April 29, 1945. It was the first surrender of WWII and the only capitulation before the death of Adolf Hitler was announced on May 1. On Husmann‚Äôs contribution to the Operation Waibel wrote ‚Äì > No one was better qualified for such a task than Dr Husmann, an excellent > schoolmaster who possessed not only a rare ability to enter the mind of his > interlocutor but also had an exceptional facility and promptness of speech > in a discussion. With no exaggeration, Dr Husmann deserves all the credit > for exerting a decisive intellectual influence over the SS leaders who took > part in the various negotiations. This Swiss teacher would complete his task > with astonishing success; in fact, he, a civilian, managed to convince high > and very high-ranking SS officers that their ideal world and their position > of power were actually founded on error and would therefore soon collapse. ( > p38) After some initial publicity in 1945, details about Operation Sunrise were kept out of the public eye, especially in Switzerland where, for a complex set of reasons concerning the politics of neutrality and war-time economics ( pp 274‚Äì286) Husmann and Waibel were commanded not to speak or write anything about the Operation. Waibel‚Äôs report was published in 1981, the first account in which Husmann‚Äôs role was fully described. On the 60th anniversary of Operation Sunrise, in 2005, the significance of Switzerland to the negotiations, and roles played by Waibel and Husmann, was officially recognised by the Swiss government.  Husmann defends Karl Wolff at Nuremberg  On May 12 Karl Wolff was arrested and transferred to Nuremberg to face charges for his involvement in Nazi atrocities. Max Husmann appeared in court on behalf of Wolff as did the other members of the Sunrise coterie ‚Äì Allen Dulles, Lyman Lemnitzer, Gero von Gaevernitz, Terence Airey. Dulles and the rest of the Anglo-American team denied that deals had been made with Wolff during the course of the Operation, although he had shown courage and commitment to ending the war and so deserved leniency. Husmann (like Parrilli) maintained that immunity to war crime prosecution had been discussed and agreed. In August 1947, he wrote a letter at the request of Telford Taylor, chief counsel of the U.S. prosecution, stating that such promises had been made although Dulles was unable to confirm this in writing because of the delicate political situation. Although Operation Sunrise involved making ‚Äúa pact with the devil‚Äù, the advantages of securing the surrender were given precedence ( pp179/80). Research has since demonstrated that it is most likely that deals were made that traded working towards surrender against protection in war crimes trials, and that this accounts for the lenient sentence eventually served on Karl Wolff.  Husmann the Educator  Documents from the 1920s and 1930s describing the early years of Institut Montana show that Max Husmann founded the school with specific aspirations about education and its goals. These were summarised in a paper given to educators at Harrow College in 1938 by Husmann‚Äôs colleague, Huldreich Sauerwein. In Husmann‚Äôs vision, an international boarding school housing a community of learners would help develop in young people the tolerance of and respect for other cultures that would guard against war; attention to the skills of thinking would help build a generation that would be strong against the evils of propaganda; and the teachings of Pestalozzi about attention to the individual child would help create a more thoughtful society.

It is located at Jalan Bandengan Selatan, Pekojan, Tambora, Jakarta, close to Masjid Al-Anshor. It is one of the mosques that was built by the Muslim merchants from India, who used to travel and live in Batavia. The mosque has been designated as a cultural heritage by the provincial government of DKI Jakarta. Masjid Kampung Baru History The traders and merchants from Arabia and India settled in this region of then Batavia. Traders from India built a mosque in the area to meet their need to perform worship in congregation. Jami Kampung Baru Mosque was built by Syeikh Abubakar who is one of the Muslim merchants from India and who lived in the area. Construction began in 1743 and completed in 1748.In a Dutch article in 1829 the New Kampong mosque is also called the Moorsche Tempel (Temple of the Moors). It is probably from this historical origin that the mosque was built by Muslim Moors, later the Moorish term is identified as Indian Muslims. Although Moorish terminology use to identify a Muslim ethnic group in North Africa (Morocco and its surroundings), who in his time succeeded in conquering Europe and establishing an empire of Islam in Andalusia (Spain). Architecture At present the building is not in the original shape, except the remaining keranka central square, carved setandan grapes and some pillars on the windows. In the late 1980s, the old buildings in Pekojan area were dismantled for a flyover. Kampung Baru Mosque also suffered damage from the improvement effort regardless of historical values and architecture. The basic plan of the mosque is in the form of a square with a roof overlap (overlapping), the upper roof is a pyramid shape. The shape of this mosque resembles traditional Javanese building forms, where there are usually 4 pillars of soko guru in the middle of the building as a buffer of the pyramid-shaped roof. The area of the mosque is about 1,050 square meters, the floor is covered with a white-colored head and over it spread a green colored mat and partly red colored bewarna. In the sky the mosque hangs an antic lamp that has been there since the mosque was standing. This mosque once had the most beautiful pulpit, made of carved wood. The pulpit has been replaced. The original pulpit is now stored in the Jakarta History Museum.

Bryan recanted and apologized. He continued to support and promote the literacy of enslaved African Americans and their conversion to Christianity. He was a founder of the first non-Anglican church in South Carolina, the Stoney Creek Independent Presbyterian Chapel of Prince William Parish, in which both black and white worshippers were members.Redding, Isabella Remshart.\\"Life and Times of Jonathan Bryan 1708-1788\\", Savannah News Print, 1901, p. 43Schmidt, Leigh Eric. \\"The Grand Prophet,\\" Hugh Bryan: Early Evangelicalism's Challenge to the Establishment and Slavery in the Colonial South.\\" The South Carolina Historical Magazine Vol.87 No. 4 October 1986 pp. 238-250Gallay, Alan. \\"The Origins of Slaveholders' Paternalism: George Whitefield, the Bryan Family, and the Great Awakening in the South.\\" The Journal of Southern History 53, no. 3 (1987): 369-94. doi:10.2307/2209360 Andrew Bryan, an enslaved African American who worked for Hugh's brother, Jonathan, was among the worshippers. Andrew Bryan founded the First Bryan Baptist Church in Savannah. Origin and family Bryan was born near Pocotaligo in 1699. He was second of four children of Janet Cochran and Joseph Bryan, who had emigrated from Hereford in 1680. The first, also named Joseph, was born in 1697, Hannah in 1706, and Jonathan in 1708. Janet Cochran died three weeks after Jonathan was born. Hugh Bryan inherited the family's holdings in 1735. The Bryans raised beef, rice, and indigo on plantations and operated ferries in the southeastern corner of the colony of South Carolina. Hugh Bryan married three times. His first wife is unnamed and her date of death unknown. His second wife was Catherine Barnwell, who died in 1740. She was the daughter of John Barnwell. His third wife was Mary Prioleau, who survived Bryan, and married his friend William Hutson in 1758. Hugh Bryan had at least one daughter, who was a married adult in 1741, when he wrote a letter to her. He also had at least one son, to whom he addressed two letters in 1740 while the son was attending school in Charleston. In 1751 he wrote in his diary that he visited a daughter's grave.

Bryan was taken to St. Augustine and held for a year before he was released. During his captivity he was provided with a Bible and a book by William Beveridge (bishop). Bryan later wrote that these works made him receptive to the religious ideas of dissenters and George Whitefield.Living Christianity Delineated in the Diary and Letters of Two Eminently Pious Persons Lately Deceased, Viz. Mr. Hugh Bryan, and Mrs. Mary Hutson, Both of South-Carolina Participation in colonial affairs In 1733 Bryan was elected to the Royal Assembly. In 1735-37 he held positions of authority in St. Helena parish. Bryan was involved in defense of the colony, which was under threat from the Spanish and Native Americans, some of whom joined with the Spanish to try to prevent the English from taking control of more land. He and Nathaniel Barnwell (who was to become his brother-in-law) petitioned the assembly for funds to build a fort to provide refuge from a sea attack, and Bryan took it upon himself to outfit a scout boat.Jackson, Harvey H. \\"The Carolina Connection: Jonathan Bryan, His Brothers, and the Founding of Georgia, 1733-1752\\" The Georgia Historical Quarterly 68, no. 2 (1984): 159. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40581220A.S.

He returned several times to deliver more supplies and stayed to socialize and discuss religion.George Fenwick Jones, et al., eds., Detailed Reports on the Salzburger Emigrants Who Settled in America, edited by Samuel Urlsperger, 7 vols.

Whitefield's preaching converted Bryan's wife, Catherine. At her urging, Bryan met with Whitefield in the summer of 1739 and began to struggle with his own faith. Catherine attributed her recovery from a serious disease to her faith, and Hugh himself, after agonized self-criticism, declared that he, too, had been \\"born again\\" into faith.Jackson, Harvey H. \\"Hugh Bryan and the Evangelical Movement in Colonial South Carolina.\\" The William and Mary Quarterly 43, no. 4 (1986): 594-614. doi:10.2307/1923684.Living Christianity Warning of God's wrath directed at slaveholders Several events in 1739 and 1740 convinced Bryan that God was punishing white Christians for their treatment of their enslaved workers. In the summer and fall of 1739 an epidemic of yellow fever ravaged the populace. That September slaves digging drainage channels near the Stono River, about twenty miles from Charleston, broke into a warehouse seeking food at the end of a long day of heavy labor. They killed two white men in the store, took their weapons, and killed about two dozen more white people before they were caught.Wood, Peter H., Black Majority, New York Knopf, 1974, 309-323 In 1740 a fast-moving fire destroyed hundreds of buildings in Charleston.Mulcahy, Matthew. \\"The \\"Great Fire\\" of 1740 and the Politics of Disaster Relief in Colonial Charleston.\\" The South Carolina Historical Magazine 99, no. 2 (1998): 135-57. https://www.jstor.org/stable/27570297 Bryan believed that the wrath of God would continue to rain until slaveholders mended their ways, and he felt obligated to warn other members of his class. He wrote a letter to the South- Carolina Gazette warning of severe judgments from God. He accused secular authorities and the clergy of negligence and worse and exhorted them to repent or face \\"more terrible Vials of [God's] Wrath.\\" Whitefield had helped him write the letter, and both men were arrested and then released without being charged.South-Carolina Gazette, January 1, 1741 Bryan had begun to gather slaves regularly on his property for worship services and he continued to do so, although it was illegal and alarmed his white neighbors and other members of planter society. Then in early 1741 he wrote a twenty-page letter to the speaker of the Commons House of Assembly in which he prophesied that God was going to destroy Charleston and free the slaves to punish white society. A grand jury indicted him for fomenting slave rebellion and warrants were issued for his arrest. No arrest took place, because Jonathan Bryan reported that Hugh had recovered his senses. Hugh subsequently wrote a letter of apology to the Commons House. According to Jonathan, \\"The Invisible Spirit\\" had directed Hugh to obtain a rod and \\"smite the Waters of the River, which should thereby be divided, so as he might go over on dry Ground.\\" Jonathan found Hugh \\"smiting, splashing and spluttering the Water about with it, till he was quite up to the Chinn.\\" Hugh believed that he would die if he went to sleep without parting the waters, but Jonathan convinced him to go home and go to bed. When he awoke and found himself alive he became convinced that the \\"spirit\\" had been a delusion of Satan. Hugh Bryan's letter to the commons house confirmed as much.Boston Post-Boy, May 3, 1742 The actions of Hugh Bryan, called sarcastically \\"the grand Prophet,\\" were used by the Anglican establishment to warn of the dangers of \\"excessive religious enthusiasm\\" and to discredit Whitefield in particular and revivalist fervor in general.Schmidt, Leigh Eric. \\"The Grand Prophet,\\" Hugh Bryan: Early Evangelicalism's Challenge to the Establishment and Slavery in the Colonial South.\\" The South Carolina Historical Magazine Vol.87 No. 4 October 1986 pp. 238-250 Though Bryan recanted and resumed his place in the white planter class, he did not back down from his belief that he owed a duty to the souls of enslaved people, and he and Jonathan continued to support their education and their gathering to worship. Education of enslaved workers and foundational churches Whitefield supported the institution of slavery,Luke Tyerman, The Life of the Rev. George Whitefield (London: Hodder and Stoughton),II, 169. but he chastised white society for their treatment of enslaved people and preached that slaveholders were condemning their own souls for failing to give their slaves the opportunity to be saved. In the wake of his ministry enslaved African Americans converted to Christianity in large numbers for the first time.Lambert, Frank. \\"\\"I Saw the Book Talk\\": Slave Readings of the First Great Awakening.\\" The Journal of African American History, Vol. 87, The Past before US (Winter, 2002) pp. 12‚Äì25. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1562488. Hugh Bryan hired a tutor, William Hutson, to teach the slaves on his plantation. Hugh and Jonathan Bryan both encouraged African American preachers and arranged for slaves to attend worship services and to form their own congregations. The Bryans founded on their property the first non-Anglican church in South Carolina, which became the Stoney Creek Independent Presbyterian Chapel of Prince William Parish, where blacks and whites worshipped together. After the death of Hugh Bryan, his brother Jonathan continued to promote education of enslaved workers and their participation in revival Christianity. Jonathan encouraged his servant Andrew Bryan, who was converted by the free black preacher George Liele, to travel and preach on his own, particularly to and with the congregation of the African American Silver Bluff Baptist Church, founded in 1750. With a legacy from Jonathan, Andrew Bryan bought his freedom and land to build a church in Savannah, which became the First Bryan Baptist Church.

The park and statue were donated to the city of Charlottesville by McIntire. and Accompanying photo The statue, although commissioned in 1917, was not cast until 1924 and it was finally placed in the park on Saturday, May 3, of that year.

However, a lawsuit opposing the removal was filed in March 2017 and the statue remains, pending the outcome of the lawsuit. On June 5, 2017, the City Council, led by Mayor Michael Signer, voted unanimously to change the park's name to Emancipation Park. The renaming of the park and the proposed removal of the Robert Edward Lee sculpture on the site by the Charlottesville city council was the catalyst for the 2017 Unite the Right rally and a focus of controversy between those who want it removed and those who want it to remain.

Communication and dialogue between the teacher and learners that focuses on learning is one of the approaches for co-construction. The ability for learners to accept and receive feedback as well as reflect is an important part of the learning process for the co-construction approach. 'Co- construction of learning' deepens relationships and understanding between all learning partners and can lead to School Improvement. Co-construction of learning is referred to in Primary and Secondary Schools and other learning settings in the UK, and generally refers to collaboration in learning beyond delivery of learning or projects, for example in Curriculum co-construction. Co-construction learning is considered to be \\"complex, multi-dimensional, and involves everyone.\\" The process of Co-construction is made up of three areas that all contribute to the child's education. The first is the individual child, secondly the physical and social environment of the child, and lastly the educators. These areas help to \\"construct\\" the child's knowledge and understanding of the world around them. Creative Partnerships refer to 'Co- construction of learning' as the partnership between teaching staff, pupils and creative professionals to develop and deliver creative learning in schools. Wikipedia could also be considered a form of 'co-construction of learning.'  Theory Behind Co-Construction  Co-construction creates environments depicting many of the same aspects Early Childhood theorists such as that of Lev Vygotsky and Jean Piaget. Vygotksy‚Äôs work was based on the ideology that ‚Äú...cognitive development stems from social interactions from guided learning within the zone of proximal development as children and their partner's co-construct knowledge.‚Äù Vygotsky believed in the ideology that we know as co-construction, or building an environment where children interact with one another on a variety of levels and learning through these interactions. In order to create an atmosphere for quality interaction, students need to be prepared for situations such as collaborative learning and a culture of dialogue.  The Importance of Co-Construction  Co-construction is important for developing creative partnerships within the classroom. In a classroom, cooperation and collaboration is very important. It can teach students how to effectively communicate with others to solve problems. Also, this is a very important skill that students need to learn later in life. Co- construction of learning allows students to have social interactions within the classroom and to have the learning be more creative.

The players gather resources to expand their empires through the Milky Way galaxy. Although the term was not used at the time, Outreach is an example of the 4X genre. Many of the gameplay elements are adapted from the earlier SPI game, Starforce: Alpha Centauri. Gameplay Outreach continues the game universe originated in StarForce, where starflight is achieved through telepathy and occurs instantaneously. The game's fleets and stargates represent massed sentient activity that powers movement. The Outreach playfield consists of a hex map covering approximately of the galaxy. Hexes on the majority of the map are of one of three types, differing in their stellar density and the types of resources. There are an additional two types of hexes in the galactic core. Each hex is about 1200 light years across, so different race's fleets can inhabit a single hex without meeting. Combat can only be achieved by first finding the opposing force, which is subject to a number of factors. Fleets are represented by a single marker on the map, but contain multiple ships of three basic types. The details of the fleet makeup are recorded separately which adds a level of bookkeeping to the gameplay. Ship movement is effected by random events that may cause a fleet to \\"scatter\\" and be lost, so traveling long distances is very difficult until the player improves their tech level. There are a number of random events like these in the game, but they can be affected by the user spending their resources so the outcomes are rarely purely random. As is the case of the related game, StarForce, the game ultimately proceeds by building StarGates, space stations that lay claim to a hex. These generate resources which are used to build tech levels, fleets and affect the outcome of the random events. Reception Lynn Willis reviewed Outreach in The Space Gamer No. 9. Willis concluded that \\"Outreach is highly playable and wildly variable. Counting time in centuries, it is logical, realistic [...] and evocative. The components are a very high quality.\\" Eric Goldberg reviewed Outreach in Ares Magazine #1, rating it a 6 out of 9. Goldberg commented that \\"Outreach has enough play value to entertain the first few times it is played, but then degenerates into a mathematical puzzle. Still, the ideas and general direction of the design allow the enterprising player to design a much better game.\\" Notes References Category:Board games introduced in 1976 Category:Simulations Publications games ","title":"Outreach (board game)"},{"id":"54865180","text":"Satya is a 2017 Indian Bhojpuri action-romance-drama film directed by Sujeet Kumar Singh and produced by Gajanand Chauhan and Radhe Shyam Lohar.

Biography  His father Pierre Pinel was himself a lutenist, like several other members of the family (especially his younger brother Fran√ßois Pinel) and his three sons Jean-Baptiste, Jean and S√©raphin. Germain was quoted as master of lute in 1630. He entered the service of Marguerite of Lorraine Duchess of Orl√©ans in 1645. From 1647, he was called to teach the lute to the young Louis XIV, aged 9. He was one of the musicians of the King's Chamber for the lute and theorbo from 1656 on. With wages of up to 2000 livres tournois, he was one of the leading musicians. His succession shows that he had a very comfortable lifestyle. In 1658, his post passed to his son S√©raphin, who, despite his promising debut, no longer appeared as a lutenist after his father's death in 1661.  Germain Pinel's music  Over 80 pieces for the lute and an unmeasured prelude for theorbo attributed to Pinel have reached us. One-third of these works come from the manuscript Ms. Schwerin 641, written c. 1651. It was written with two hands, one of which could be that of Pinel himself. Most of his compositions are dances: allemandes, courantes, sarabandes and gigues. He is quoted by the master of Mary Burwell, who said of him, after his death, that \\"his play was gay and melodious, he composed his plays with great ease.\\" Ennemond \\"Old\\" Gaultier himself cited him as one of the masters of his time.

Name The ethnonym 'Martuthunira' reflects the word Martuthuni used to denote the lower reaches of the Fortescue River. The ra is a suffix indicating place of origin or provenience. Various theories have been advanced to analyse the word in terms of a root martu - not available in the Martuthunira language itself - and the suffix -thuni, the latter recurring in a few toponyms. In Yindjibarndi martu means 'place, space, spot.' von Brandenstein proposed an etymology which would make the word mean 'flat-' or 'river-landers'. Language An extensive knowledge of the Martuthunira language exists. A several hundred page outline was written by Alan Dench, a student of Peter Austin's, after one of the three remaining speakers, Algy Paterson, approached him asking Dench to preserve the language his own maternal grandmother had once spoken. Country Alfred Radcliffe- Brown in 1913 gave an estimation that implied that the Mardudunera's traditional lands extended over . For Norman Tindale, they covered somewhat less, and his estimate was that the tribal area covering roughly in the Pilbara, stretching over the land from the inland ranges to the coastal plain, north of Fortescue River. They included a number of islands they would visit in the Dampier Archipelago. Recently Alan Dench, an authority on the people, has endorsed Radcliffe-Brown's original determination. Their north-eastern boundary is marked by three hills, Mount Leopold, Moondle Hill and Mount McLeod, while Warluru Pool, marks their eastern limits. Dench adds that Tindale is incorrect in his island claims, for archaeology has failed to turn up pre-contact traces of their presence on Barrow Island, and modern Mardudunera do not believe it formed part of their world. History of contact with whites It is believed that the first contact with whites occurred on 26 February 1818 during the explorer Phillip Parker King's first voyage in , which took him to the north-western coast of Australia. King describes the scene: > As we advanced, three natives were seen in the water, apparently wading from > an island in the centre of the strait towards Lewis Island: the course was > immediately altered to intercept them, but as we approached, it was > discovered that each native was seated on a log of wood, which he propelled > through the water by paddling with his hands. Having hove to, close by them, > they became much alarmed, and cried out in loud tones, which were increased > when our boat was lowered and despatched after them; but it was not without > the greatest difficulty that Mr. Bedwell succeeded in bringing one on board. > On the boat's coming up with the nearest Indian, he left his log and, diving > under the boat's bottom, swam astern; this he did whenever the boat > approached him, and it was four or five minutes before he was caught, which > was at last effected by seizing him by the hair, in the act of diving, and > dragging him into the boat, against which he resisted stoutly, and, even > when taken, it required two men to hold him to prevent his escape. During > the interval of heaving to and bringing him on board, the cutter was > anchored near the central island, where a tribe of natives were collected, > consisting of about forty persons, of whom the greater number were women and > children; the whole party appeared to be overcome with grief, particularly > the women, who most loudly and vehemently expressed their sorrow by cries, > and rolling on the ground, and covering their bodies with the sand. Once on board, the captive, a six foot tall lad in his early twenties, scarified with horizontal strips from his chest to his navel, but with no nose-piercing or tooth evulsion, was treated to sugared water, and, turning to the shore, cried out: coma negra!. He was allowed to return to his camp on his log - called a 'marine velocipede' whose construction from mangrove roots was described in detail - with various gifts, such as a red cap, biscuits and an axe. On beaching, he was interrogated by his terrified companions, who held him at spear point, and then physically examined. A further bundle of gifts was delivered towards dusk.

The company purchased life insurance policies at a discount from people with AIDS, cancer, terminal illnesses or who were elderly. They then sold participation shares of the policies' death benefits to investors, promising high returns. The company operated from October 1994 to May 2004, selling $1.25 billion worth of life insurance policies to 30,000 investors. Officials of the company lied about the life expectancy of the policyholders to the investors, bribing a doctor to sign off on their statements. It operated as a ponzi scheme, using new investors money to pay premiums on older life insurance policies, pay a return to earlier investors, and provide lavish salaries and benefits for the company's owners. Mutual Benefits Corp. was shut down by the SEC in 2004. There were 13 people involved with the company who were either convicted or pled guilty. Joel Steinger received a 20-year prison sentence in 2014 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.

Rodrigues Menezes arranged for it to be transported to Salvador, however, the meteorite's excessive weight made transportation difficult. The cart it was on ran out of control down a hill and the meteorite fell into a dry stream bed, 180 meters away from the spot where it was originally found. It remained there until 1888, when it was recovered and brought to the National Museum.  Description and composition  The meteorite is an irregular mass, reminding, in appearance, an asteroid. It has numerous depressions on the surface and cylindrical holes oriented parallel to its greater length. These holes were formed by the burning of the troilite, during the transatmospheric passage of the meteorite, since the sulfide has a lower melting point than the rest of the meteorite, consuming more quickly. It is a metallic meteorite, consisting basically of iron, with the following elements: 6.6% Ni, 0.47% Co, 0.22% P, and traces of S and C in much smaller quantities, only measured in parts by million.

Its manufacturers claim the device has been designed to test components for protection from power surges and electrostatic discharge; however, there have been several instances of malicious use, and the device is not used for device testing by any major company. The device is often mentioned in articles warning readers against plugging in unknown USB drives.  Mechanism  The device collects power from the USB power source of the component it is connected to in its capacitors until it reaches a high voltage and then it discharges the high voltage onto the data pins. Versions 2, 3 and 4 of the device may generate a voltage of 215 to 220 volts. This device has been compared to the Etherkiller, a family of cables that feed mains electricity into low-voltage sockets such as RJ45.  Models  There are different models of the device, the latest being USB Killer v4. Earlier generations, including USB Killer v2, were developed by a Russian computer researcher with the alias Dark Purple. Similar homemade devices have been constructed from USB air ionisers and camera flash parts, both of which already feature high-voltage circuitry. A more recent version uses the piezo inverter transformer from a CCFL driver with a simple two transistor resonant Royer oscillator, one shot timer and a spark gap as a lightweight way to generate an 1800V sharp pulse more closely simulating a low power electrostatic discharge for mitigation and circuit testing purposes. https://www.globalspec.com/industrial- directory/rosen_type_piezoelectric_transformers The prototype has a countdown timer and ascending bleep warning to reduce the chances of accidental or malicious use.  Potential defenses  One author believes that the new cryptographic authentication protocol for USB-C authentication announced by the USB Implementers Forum would help to protect against this device by preventing unauthorized USB connections from being made, although some manufacturers now claim that they can bypass this protocol. Some developers of the device believe that an optocoupler can protect against the device but from later testing even applying a short risetime high voltage pulse to the case can damage some sensitive systems.

The number of Congressmen in the House of Representatives who openly opposed the policies of President Davis increased from 26 to 41 out of 106, while the number of antiadministration Senators went from 11 to 12. The proadministration Senators thus had a narrow majority of two with 14 out of the 26 seats in the Confederate Senate. The 2nd Confederate States Congress would be seated on May 2, 1864. General election The Confederate government did not have formal parties, and candidates ran individual campaigns. Nonetheless, some voters cast their ballots according to past party affiliations such as Democrat or Whig. The lack of parties was popularly believed to be a source of strength, however historians believe that the lack of such organizations prevented Davis from distributing patronage or commanding party loyalty from other elected officials to mobilize support for his policies. Despite this, historians have identified factions or proto-parties. One was largely supportive of President Davis's policies, or Pro-Administration, and the other was largely opposed to Davis' policies, or Anti-Administration. The Anti-Administration faction consisted of former Whigs as well as Fire-Eaters and other former Democrats. Public grievances with the administration included supply shortages, inflation, and general financial mismanagement. Other issues that featured prominently in the elections were conscription and taxation. Anti- Administration candidates decried perceived federal government overreach, including Davis' decision to suspend habeas corpus and impose martial law. Pro-Administration officials attempted to appeal to the Confederate public's loyalty and foster a spirit of self-sacrifice for eventual independence of the Confederate States of America. In the end, the Pro-Administration faction sustained electoral losses but maintained their majorities in both chambers of the Confederate Congress. Their strongest support came from Confederate soldiers and the Border States. However, this was not without anti-incumbent sentiment. For example, nine of the ten members of Georgia's Congressional delegation were defeated. In terms of policy, the overall sentiment of the Anti-Administration was in favor of the original secession and for continuing the Civil War. Exceptions existed, as none of the newly elected Representatives from North Carolina had voted in favor of secession, while anti-secessionist former Whigs gained in Mississippi. Williamson Robert Winfield Cobb of Alabama was so openly in favor of peace that he was not seated by the Confederate Congress. Overall, five candidates ran on a peace platform and won. The elections were processed over six months due to the amount of Confederate territory occupied by the Union Army, in addition to all of the absentee ballots necessitated by the large refugee population. Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas sent 32 of the 41 Anti-Administration Congressmen to the House. The majority wielded by the Confederate Congress would not have been possible without the near unified support from the occupied districts. The results of the 1863 election indicating waning public confidence in the Davis administration, and enhanced the political strength of dissenters within the Confederacy.

The house is on the edge of the North Downs between Ashford and Canterbury. It has associations with the writer Jane Austen, and is depicted on the new Bank of England ¬£10 note issued in 2017. It is now home to the Association of British Dispensing Opticians. Description Godmersham Park is a two-storey house in the Palladian style. Built of red brick, the main block is of seven bays, the central three being recessed. The north front is of Thomas May's time, while the south facade was constructed by Walter Sarel for the Trittons in the 1930s, in a complementary style. During this reconstruction, Sarel also turned the bricks on the north front, which had been painted in the 19th century, to restore the original 18th century appearance. The two wings post-date May's frontage, being of the late 18th century. The roof is of slate with a parapet, and the house is of two storeys, with cellars and attics. The interior contains two rooms which retain the original decorative schemes from May's time, the drawing room and the hall. The rest date from Sarel's remodelling. Both of May's rooms are embellished with ornate plasterwork, the hall also having a chimneypiece by John Michael Rysbrack. History Godmersham Park was built in 1732 for Thomas May, replacing an earlier Elizabethan house, Ford House, owned by the Brodnax family. In 1742, by which time May had changed his name to Knight, he enclosed a park around the estate, which was then known as Ford Park. The wings were added in 1780. Knight died in 1781 and the estate was inherited by his son Thomas. Following his death in 1794, the house was inherited by Edward Austen, brother of Jane Austen. He was a cousin of the Knights and had been adopted by them in the early 1780s. Following the death of his adoptive mother Catherine in 1812, Austen changed his name to Knight. Jane Austen was a regular visitor between 1798 and 1813. Mansfield Park is said to be based on Godmersham Park. In 1852, the property passed to Knight's son. He remodelled the south front to designs by William Burn,Colvin, Howard, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, s.v. \\"William Burn\\". which were swept away in the 1930s by Robert Tritton. Godmersham Park was later sold to John Cunliffe Lister Kay, who died in 1917. During the First World War, an airship was stationed at Godmersham Park, which served as a sub-station of RNAS Capel. Godmersham Park passed to John Cunliffe Lister, 3rd Baron Masham, who sold it in 1921 to William Legge, 6th Earl of Dartmouth. In 1935, Godmersham Park was sold to Mr and Mrs Robert Tritton, who restored the house. Walter Sarel remodelled the building, much of the interior being replaced using genuine eighteenth-century features recovered from buildings across England. Norah Lindsay advised on restoration of the walled gardens. The house became a Grade I listed building in 1952, and the gardens were separately listed in Grade II* in 1986, with other garden features listed as Grade II. Robert Tritton died in 1957. Following the death of Elsie Tritton in 1983, Godmersham Park was sold to John Bernard Sunley. The estate management company Sunley Farms Limited, which is 100% owned by Sunciera Holdings Corporation in Panama, is the owner of Godmersham Park. In 2001, Godmersham Park became the home of the Association of British Dispensing Opticians, in which capacity it is used as a training college.

It owed its birth to the widening of Cardiff's boundaries in 1875, which had taken in more Welsh- language speakers in the areas around the city. In 1900, this building was closed and the congregation moved to a newer, more prominent location on nearby Crwys Road. The building is constructed in Pennant stone and Bath stone with dressings in yellow brick, and on completion, was named Capel Heol y Crwys. The May Street building is now used by the Salvation Army. In its early years, it was a very popular Welsh-speaking chapel, with regular congregations of 500, but as with many of Cardiff's suburban churches, its attendance declined in the late 20th century, and maintenance costs became hard to meet. In 1988, the congregation moved into newer premises in Richmond Road, having acquired a building formerly used by Christian Scientists. It continues to operate at the location.

The band released its first album, The Man Who Never Was, in 2017 and is working on the follow-up, A Tower of Clocks.  History  = Formation = The band was founded in early 2016, initially settling on the line-up of Al Wynter (vocals), Mark Numan (keyboards), Peter Priestley (bass), Marcus Murray (drums) and Gary Jevon (guitar). The concept for a new progressive rock band was conceived by Wynter; he had written the song that would go on to be the title track of the debut album, The Man Who Never Was, some 10 years prior to forming the band. The band quickly became known to the progressive rock community after supporting popular English rock band Magnum on their UK tour in July 2016. Prog Magazine issue 72's cover CD featured the song \\"After Tomorrow Comes\\" that would later appear on the first album. = The Man Who Never Was = This Winter Machine's debut album was recorded during 2016 at Moorcroft Studios and Czar Street Studios in Cleckheaton and Leeds respectively. The production was handled by Wynter. This Winter Machine signed with the record label Progressive Gears ahead of the release of album. The Man Who Never Was was officially released 16 January 2017 and was met with largely positive reviews internationally, with reviewers hailing \\"the next great British Prog band\\". The album also received a full page feature on the inside cover of the Classic Rock Society magazine for that month (This Winter Machine were subsequently nominated for the \\"Best Newcomer 2016\\" award at CRS' awards ceremony in March 2017). The band held an album launch party on 4 February 2017 where The Man Who Never Was was played live and in full. The set also featured a new song called \\"The Herald\\", the band having started work on a follow-up album. Shortly after the album launch, the band parted ways with both Gary Jevon and Progressive Gears. Graham Garbett and Scott Owens were recruited to handle guitar duties. The decision to bring in more than one guitarist resulted in a broadened soundscape at the live shows, adding complex textures of guitar work in both the acoustic and electric arena. The Man Who Never Was was later re-released via F2 Records. = A Tower Of Clocks = Work on the second album had already begun by the time The Man Who Never Was was officially released. The band has stated that this will be a concept album. It will be titled A Tower Of Clocks and is expected to be released in 2018. In the latter months of 2017, This Winter Machine performed several times, including a support slot for German prog band Crystal Palace on 1 October 2017. Three new songs written for A Tower Of Clocks featured during this run of shows (these songs were \\"The Herald\\", \\"Symmetry and Light\\" and \\"Justified\\"). Drummer Marcus Murray left the band after their gig at the Summers End Festival in October 2017, with Andy Milner replacing him. Milner's first performance with the band would see them supporting Magnum once again at Warehouse23 in Wakefield on 16 November 2017. The band recorded a full live performance at Eiger Studios, Leeds on 20 January 2018 with the intention of releasing footage as bonus material alongside the upcoming album or as a live DVD. Two new songs made their live debuts at this performance; \\"Flying\\" and \\"Carnivale\\". This Winter Machine played alongside Mostly Autumn at the Classic Rock Society awards ceremony on 3 March 2018 and received the award for \\"Best Newcomer 2017\\". = A Tour of Clocks - 2018 = This Winter Machine embarked across the UK on their 'Tour of Clocks'. A bold move playing the yet unreleased second album to live audiences, however their support seems to be ever growing at the regular prog venues like the Robin2 in Bilston, Talking Heads in Southampton and The Citadel in St Helens. The tour culminated in an appearance at the HRH Prog Festival in November 2018 in Wales. = 2019 - Tour and writing sessions = Following further tour dates at O'Rileys, Hull and the Robin2, Bilston (with Crystal Palace), the band was asked to perform at the Fusion (Music Without Boundaries) Festival in Stourport. April 2019 also saw the departure of the original bass player, Peter Priestley. They have welcomed Stuart Mcauley to the outfit. The band have commenced writing sessions for their next release, however This Winter Machine toured again this year, with joint headline gigs with the German prog band Karibow. They are also due to appear live, at the one off 'Last Hurrah' show with the band The Reasoning in September.

It premiered at Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2017, and was awarded the U.S. Documentary Special Jury Award (Orwell Award). Netflix acquired the distribution rights and released Icarus globally on August 4, 2017. At the 90th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Synopsis While investigating the furtive world of illegal doping in sports, Bryan Fogel connects with Russian scientist Grigory Rodchenkov, the director of Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov creates a plan for Fogel to take banned performance-enhancing drugs in a way that will evade detection from drug-testing, helping Fogel's experiment to prove that the current way athletes are tested for drugs is insufficient. As Fogel continues his training, he and Rodchenkov become friends, and Rodchenkov eventually reveals that Russia has a state-sponsored Olympic doping program that he oversees. When allegations emerge in the international media over the possible existence of such a program, Fogel realizes that Rodchenkov is in danger of being \\"silenced\\" by the Russian government and has him flown to Los Angeles for his protection. Using Rodchenkov's knowledge of the doping program, they speak to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the New York Times, alleging that Russia has conspired to cheat in the Olympics for decades, and he was hired to ramp up the operation after the Russian team's embarrassing performance in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. On camera, Rodchenkov testifies that at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, with the help of the Federal Security Service, he and his team switched steroid-tainted urine of the Russian national team with clean samples, evading positive detection. He provides spreadsheets, discs, e-mails, and more incriminating evidence of Russian involvement, forcing the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Olympic Committee to investigate. After WADA's independent investigation (the McLaren Report) confirms Rodchenkov's claims, U.S. Law Enforcement places him in protective custody. Rodchenkov's lawyer, Jim Walden, appears briefly in the film describing the threats to Rodchenkov's life and the suspicious deaths of two of Rodchenkov's associates. The film ends stating that the Russian government continues to deny it had any involvement with the program and that Rodchenkov remains in protective custody. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Icarus is eye-opening viewing for professional sports enthusiasts, yet it should also prove thoroughly gripping even for filmgoers who might not necessarily be drawn to the subject.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has an average score of 68 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Writing for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and called it \\"a crackling documentary\\". The trailer for the film was screened during a February 2018 meeting of the U.S. Helsinki Commission (also known as the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe). During that meeting, attorney Jim Walden spoke about Rodchenkov's work as well as the need for better enforcement by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Olympic Committee in order to eliminate corruption and restore integrity to the international athletic community. At the 90th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. During his on-stage acceptance remarks at the Oscar ceremony, director Bryan Fogel said: > We dedicate this award to Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, our fearless whistle- > blower who now lives in great danger. We hope 'Icarus' is a wake-up call ‚Äî > yes, about Russia, but more than that, about the importance of telling the > truth, now more than ever. Backstage, Fogel took issue with the International Olympic Committee and their insubstantial punishment of Russia.

Through a research career spanning over six decades (1950‚Äì2014), Yaalon was an active member of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) and the International Soil Science Society (ISSS; later the International Union of Soil Sciences; IUSS). He was awarded the Sarton Medal for his contribution to the history of science, and the Dokuchaev Award. Early life and education Dan Hardy Yaalon was born as Hardy Berger on May 11, 1924, in Uherske Hradiste, Czechoslovakia (modern day Czech Republic) to a middle-class Jewish family involved in the textile business. He was the youngest child of Hugo J. Berger and Elsa Jellinek, and had two older sisters, Dita and Stella. Yaalon was a curious child and a high- achieving pupil, who showed an early interest in exploring his environment. Typical for his family background, Yaalon was part of the Maccabi youth movement, an international Zionist movement aimed at motivating Jewish youth to immigrate to \\"Eretz Israel\\". Yaalon's comfortable childhood was disrupted at the age of 10 by the death of his father. The Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia five years later in 1939 further fragmented the family. Yaalon's mother encouraged him to leave the country to escape the escalating Anti-Jewish measures. In March 1939, Yaalon left Uherske Hradiste for the Youth Aliyah School in Prague, a Jewish Youth Immigration School, where he was a student for three months. During that time, Yaalon was offered an internship at the Zionist agricultural training program in Denmark, as a preparatory step for emigrating to Israel. Yaalon left Czechoslovakia and travelled by train via Germany to Denmark, after which he never saw his mother again. In September 1943, after a long period of hiding and struggling to feed himself, he began academic studies at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen. Two months later, Denmark was also occupied by the Nazis, and Yaalon escaped to Sweden. Upon arrival in Sweden, Yaalon immediately requested admission to the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences at Uppsala. There he met the prominent Swedish soil chemist Sante Emil Mattson (1886-1980), who appointed Yaalon as his assistant. At that time, Yaalon made his first soil- profile observation. In 1944 Yaalon returned to Czechoslovakia and volunteered in the Czech Army, unaware that his family had been killed in The Holocaust. After the war, Yaalon discovered that his mother had been sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia, and then to Auschwitz- Birkenau in Poland, where she was killed. Yaalon left Czechoslovakia and returned to Denmark to resume his studies, completing a B.Sc. in Agricultural Sciences (Soil Chemistry) in July 1947.  Move to Israel  In July 1948, after a long and complex journey from Europe to the Levant, Yaalon reached the newly formed state of Israel. In 1949, he joined the recently established Israel Defense Forces (IDF), serving a year in the Scientific Service Corps (\\"Hemed\\"). Around that period, Yaalon changed his first name from Hardy to Dan, and was registered as \\"Lieutenant Dan Berger\\". During his IDF service, Yaalon participated in the first geological field surveys of the Negev desert, whose hyperarid climate and rugged terrain with reg and loessial soils was completely alien to Yaalon, and became a key area of interest throughout his later career. After demobilization from the IDF, Yaalon found employment as a schoolteacher of chemistry and agriculture in Beit Yerach school, on the southern shore of the Sea of Galilee. Dan Yaalon describing a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s In 1951 Yaalon changed his European-sounding surname \\"Berger\\" in favor of \\"Yaalon\\", a combination of two of his favorite words: \\"Yael\\" (meaning \\"little antelope\\", the Hebrew translation of his mother's Czech maiden name \\"Jellinek\\"), and \\"Aliyah\\" ('ascension' in Hebrew, referring to the immigration of Jews to Israel). Yaalon moved \\"Hardy\\" to a middle name position, and thus became known as \\"Dan H. Yaalon\\". Shortly after, at a meeting about geological surveying and mapping, Yaalon's colleagues proposed naming some mountains and wadis after themselves. The official naming committee of that time approved the idea, hence the names of \\"Mt. Ya‚Äôalon\\" and \\"Wadi Ya'alon\\" in the southern Arava region. Around fifteen years later a young Nahal group (a paramilitary Israel Defense Forces program that combines military service and the establishment of agricultural settlements) that settled in the eastern foothills of Mt. Ya'alon, adopted \\"Ya'alon\\" as their group name. One of the group members, Moshe Smilansky, himself looking for a Hebrew version of his surname, adopted the group name as his own and changed his name to Moshe Ya'alon. He went on to become the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (2002‚Äì2005) and subsequently the Israeli Minister of Defense (2013‚Äì2016).Dan Yaalon sampling a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s Academic career Yaalon's long research career spanned over six decades, from 1950-2014. In 1950, Yaalon asked Avraham Adolf Reifenberg (1899-1953), professor of soil science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, to become a student in the newly formed Soil Science Department, and was accepted as a doctoral student. His dissertation was on the subject of accumulation of salts in the soils of the Jordan Valley.Yaalon, D.H., 1954. An Investigation of the Effects of Saline Irrigation Water on Sodium Adsorption and Permeability Characteristics of Calcareous Soils. PhD dissertation, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem. His first publication was a detailed laboratory textbook written in 1952 during his studies, with his fellow student, Meir Rigby.Yaalon, D., Rigby, M., 1952. Laboratory Exercises in Soil Science and Fertilizers. Department of Geology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem (in Hebrew). Yaalon's research guidance was disrupted by Reifenberg's health problems, and when he died in 1953, Yaalon's supervision was passed over to Shlomo Ravikovitch (1899-2000). In 1954, Yaalon was awarded a Ph.D. degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and posted to a post- doctoral position at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in England. Upon his return to Israel in 1955, Yaalon worked temporarily at a fertilizer research plant in Haifa, while continuing to publish academic output, including his 1955 study on the clay mineralogy of the soils of Israel.Yaalon, D.H., 1955. Notes on the clay mineralogy of the major soil types of Israel. Bulletin of the Research Council of Israel. 5B, 168‚Äì173. In 1957, Yaalon was appointed as lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he would stay until his retirement and after. Due to his initial background in the field of soil colloids, his academic career focused on the finest fraction and texture of soils, one of his main motivations in working on aeolian dust throughout his research career. In 1965, Yaalon urged INQUA to adopt the term \\"Paleopedology\\" (ancient Pedology), establishing the subject as a commission of INQUA, and later in the IUSS.Yaalon, D., 2001. Proposal for a Commission on PALEOPEDOLOGY. Bulletin of the International Union of Soil Sciences 100, pp. 46-47.IUSS, 2004. Bulletin of the International Union of Soil Sciences 104, pp.7,13. In 1966, Yaalon presented his original concept of 'metapedogenesis', in which he defined humans as an important factor of soil formation.Yaalon, D.H., Yaron, B., 1966. Framework for man-made soil changes‚Äìan outline of metapedogenesis. Soil Science. 102, 272‚Äì277. In August 1970, a joint ISSS and INQUA symposium was held in Amsterdam, on the 'Age of Parent Material and Soils', a result of correspondence between Yaalon, Robert Ruhe (1918-1993), and Ferdinand van Baren (1905-1975). The symposium was later summarized in the book Paleopedology: Origin, Nature and Dating of Paleosols, edited by Yaalon, which collated 29 selected multidisciplinary papers, including several contributions from Yaalon. In \\"Soil-forming processes in time and space\\", Yaalon suggested a dynamic model of the soil system, distinguishing between two major groups of soil equilibrium processes: 1) those approaching an equilibrium state at different rates, and; 2) irreversible or self-terminating processes. He then further developed each group and presented a classification of diagnostic pedofeatures according to their state of origin and relative nature of persistence.Yaalon, D.H., 1971. Soil-forming processes in time and space, in: Yaalon, D.H. (Ed.), Paleopedology: Origin, Nature and Dating of Paleosols. International Society of Soil Science and Israel Universities Press, Jerusalem, pp. 29‚Äì39. In 1973 Yaalon and his former student, Eliezer Ganor (1935-2011), published a work concerning the important role of aeolian dust on the formation of soils in the eastern Mediterranean during the Quaternary.Yaalon, D.H., Ganor, E., 1973. The influence of dust on soils during the Quaternary. Soil Science. 116, 146‚Äì155. In that work, he discussed the global modes of dust and paths of distribution, and presented evidence that the red color of the Terra Rossa soils originated from the presence of iron oxides in airborne dust, while contradicting Reifenberg and others, who had attributed this color to carbon oxides from the underlying parent rock. Subsequently, Yaalon's arguments for the key role of Quaternary aeolian dust in the formation of soils gained international acceptance. When later asked what he considered to be the highlight of his career, Yaalon said that the dust-soil relations was his most significant contribution. In 1975, Yaalon published \\"Conceptual models in pedogenesis: Can soil-forming functions be solved?\\", a high-profile article in which Yaalon demonstrated the complexity of the quantifying of pedogenetic processes. Consequently, in 1977 Yaalon was elected president of the INQUA Commission on Paleopedology. Another of Yaalon's editorial works was a special issue of Geoderma entitled \\"Climatic and Lithostratigraphic Significance of Paleosols\\", summarizing a symposium of the same name held in Ottawa, Canada. In 1994, at the age of 70 and two years past official retirement, Yaalon left his office at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and only seldom returned to it, continuing his writing, editing and reviewing from his home. In 1997, Yaalon published a paper on the uniqueness of Mediterranean Soils, asking \\"What makes them different?\\". In that paper, he characterized the global nature of Mediterranean climates, while focusing on the region which encompasses the Mediterranean Sea. Discussing the soil and landscape characteristics, this paper gives a broad and detailed overview of the typical Mediterranean environmental conditions, geomorphology, geochemistry, pedology, and anthropogenic impacts on Mediterranean ecosystems. Alongside his main focus on soil forming processes, Yaalon also made contributions to the fields of the history, philosophy and sociology of soil science. He played a key role in the establishment of the ISSS Working Group on the History of soil science (today the IUSS Commission 4.5 - History, philosophy and sociology of soil science). In 1997 he co-edited the book History of Soil Science: International Perspectives. This book is a collection of treaties which show historical developments in the understanding and attitude of humans to the soil. As demonstrated in this book, Yaalon's approach to the history of soil sciences emphasized the acknowledgment of soil distinctions and the unfolding of sub-disciplines as utilized by early agriculturists. Yaalon continued publishing new work until the last days of his life. In 2012, after years of draft writing, he published his autobiography, A Passion for Science and Zion: The Yaalon Story. In the last two years of his life, Yaalon was preoccupied with reading archaeological literature, and geoarcheology. In the summer of 2013 Yaalon's health deteriorated, and on 29 January 2014 he died at home in Mevaseret Zion, Israel, surrounded by his family. Personal life In 1952 Dan Yaalon married Rita Singer (1926-2010), and soon after their marriage they chose to live in Kiryat Moshe in western Jerusalem. The couple had two sons: David (1953) and Uri (1956). In 1975, the family moved to Givat HaMivtar, a neighborhood on the northern side of Jerusalem, and in 1997 they moved out of Jerusalem, to Mevaseret Zion. By the time of his death, Yaalon had seven grandchildren. Awards, honors, and legacy Yaalon received numerous awards over his career. In 2000, Yaalon received the Sarton Medal, the top award of the History of Science Society, from Ghent University in Belgium for outstanding contribution to the History of Soil Science. In 2010, Yaalon received the Dokuchaev Award from the IUSS, in recognition of his life contribution to pedology and soil sciences. Yaalon was also an Honorary Fellow of the British, German, and Russian Soil Science Societies, and received an Honorary Membership from the Israeli (2001) and American (2008) Geological Societies, an Honorary Membership from the IUSS (1998), was an Honorary Life Fellow of INQUA, and received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Tbilisi in Georgia. In April 2015 a special IUSS symposium in honor of Yaalon was held at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) in Vienna and Uherske Hradiste.Stahr, K., Sauer, D., Ottner, F., Itkin, D., (Eds.) 2015.

She was requisitioned by the Royal Navy during World War I and renamed HMS Barryfield serving during the Gallipoli Campaign where she was the last British ship to leave Suvla Bay evacuating British soldiers. After the war she returned to passenger service, was refitted in 1920 and renamed PS Waverley in 1926. Requisitioned by the Royal Navy at the outbreak of World War II she was renamed again, this time to HMS Snaefell to avoid confusion with another paddle steamer Waverley which had already been requisitioned from London and North Eastern Railway, and assigned to the 8th Minesweeping Flotilla. She was one of the flotilla of ships at the Dunkirk evacuation making two trips across the channel, credited with rescuing 981 soldiers and freeing another ship which had run aground, the Glen Gower.

Aged 18, he entered in the army and participated in all the wars of his time. He was present at the Battle of Sinsheim (1674), Battle of Turckheim (1675), Siege of Cambrai (1677), Siege of Philippsburg (1688) and Battle of Neerwinden (1693). In 1695 and 1696, he commanded the Army of the Moselle as a lieutenant general. In 1697, he was appointed extraordinary ambassador to Spain, which was in a crucial period when King Charles II of Spain died without a successor. It is unknown which role he played in the intrigues following Charles's death, but it resulted in the installation of a Bourbon on the throne of Spain. When he returned to France, the grateful Louis XIV made him a Duke in 1700 and a Marshal of France in 1703. During the Spanish War of Succession, he commanded the Army of the Rhine in 1709, 1711, and 1712, when he suffered a stroke and was forced to retire.

The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) is a contemporary art museum located at the V&A; Waterfront in Cape Town, South Africa. It is the largest museum of contemporary African art in the world. The museum opened on September 22, 2017.  Inception and development  The public not-for-profit museum was commissioned through a public/private partnership between the V&A; Waterfront and German businessman, Jochen Zeitz. The Waterfront invested over R500-million towards its construction and infrastructure development, and although not a shareholder, Zeitz has loaned his extensive art collection for his lifetime. Considered by many to be one of the world's leading collections of contemporary art from Africa and its Diaspora, Zeitz's collection includes works by such eminent artists as Chris Ofili, Kudzanai Chiurai, Kehinde Wiley, Glenn Ligon, Marlene Dumas, Wangechi Mutu, and Julie Mehretu. The Waterfront had been investigating a number of proposals regarding what to do with the historic Grain Silo since it was decommissioned in 2001. According to their CEO, David Green, the decision to transform and renovate the building for the new museum would \\"breathe life into the Silo district and act as a draw card to a venture that is non-commercial in nature ... specifically for the enjoyment of all the continent‚Äôs citizens\\". While others have noted that the strategic partnership with Zeitz also serves to connect the existing properties of the Waterfronts's owners (Growthpoint Properties and the Government Employees Pension Fund) with the developing financial district in Cape Town's lower CBD. The conversion of the Silo building began in 2014 under the direction of London-based designer, Thomas Heatherwick. In 2020 William Kentridge exhibited his apartheid-era work at the museum.  Location and architecture  The museum is located in the V&A; Waterfront, on the banks of Table Bay overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The Waterfront is considered a prestigious retail and hospitality property, and already receives around 24-million visitors per year. The museum's immediate surroundings, the Silo District, is also scheduled for further development. The museum building was constructed from the conversion of the 57m tall historic Grain Silo, originally built in 1921 and decommissioned in 2001. The architects, Heatherwick Studio, aimed to conserve and celebrate the original structure's industrial heritage, while simultaneously excavating large open spaces from the 42 densely-packed concrete cylinders from which it was comprised. Using a variety of concrete-cutting techniques, the interior of the building was carved out to create a number of galleries and a large central atrium. Disagreements between the architects and director Mark Coetzee over the number of galleries that the museum had to contain ended in what South African art critic Sean O'Toole has described as \\"poky, low-ceilinged galleries, which often struggle to hold or reflect the ambition of the exhibiting artists\\". The remaining concrete shafts were capped with strengthened glass in order to allow natural light to enter and create a \\"cathedral-like\\" interior. From the exterior, the most noticeable change to the original structure was the addition of pillowed glass panels in the building's upper floors. Overall the 9,500sqm complex consists of nine floors with 6,000sqm of dedicated white cube exhibition space. Additionally there are 18 educational areas included on one floor, a sculpture garden on the lower part of the roof, as well as a restaurant and shop. The higher part of the building operates as The Silo Hotel, which opened its doors in March 2017. The building made it onto the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) International List 2018. Governance Zeitz MOCAA is a registered public benefit organization. The museum's founding Executive Director and Chief Curator was Mark Coetzee. Coetzee resigned from the post in May 2018 following an inquiry into his professional conduct. As of 2018, the Board of Trustees includes Zeitz, Jody Allen, Roger Ross Williams and Albie Sachs as well as artist members Isaac Julien, Wangechi Mutu.Board of Trustees Zeitz MOCAA.

Wing specialized in immigration law, working with hundreds of Chinese immigrants who sought to make a new life in the United States. Chinese immigrants who came to San Francisco were detained at Angel Island for as much as two years, while immigration officials determined their eligibility for entry. Wing also brought more than 30 lawsuits against the San Francisco Police Department for the harassment of the Chinese. Because the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was in effect, anti-Chinese sentiment was widespread.

The soil salinity on the x-axis is represented by electric conductivity (ECe). In this example the crop has a salt tolerance (threshold) of ECe = Pb = 7 dS/m beyond which the yield diminishes. The Maas‚ÄìHoffman model is a mathematical tool to characterize the relation between crop production and soil salinity. It describes the crop response by a broken line of which the first part is horizontal and the second is sloping downward.Maas EV, Hoffman GJ, 1977. Crop salt tolerance-current assessment. Journal of the Irrigation and Drainage Division, American Society of Civil Engineers 103: 115-134. The breakpoint (Pb) or threshold is also called tolerance because up to that point the yield is unaffected by the salinity, so the salt is tolerated, while at greater salinity values the crops are affected negatively and the yield goes down. Mathematics Mathematically the two lines are represented by the equations: : Y = C [X < Pb] : Y = AX + B [X > Pb] where Y = crop production or yield, C = maximum yield, X = soil salinity, A = slope (regression coefficient) of the descending line, and B = regression constant of that line. In the example of the figure: C = 1.2, A = ‚Äî0.10, Pb = 7.0 The value of Pb is to be found by regression analysis and optimization so that the goodness of fit of the data to the model is maximum. The Maas‚ÄìHoffman model is used in crop tolerance to seawater. Inverted Maas-Hoffman model for the relation between crop yield and depth of the watertable Inverted model For growth factors, like the depth of the watertable, that affect crop production negatively at low values while there is no effect at high values, the inverted Maas‚ÄìHoffman model can be used.

It was the state purchase of food supplies from farmers. As a means to control the price of grains and foods, it is an early example of Government procurement. The policy was adopted in the year of 488 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei as a counter measure of drought. The state purchases food supplies and stock them. When drought attacks, the stocked foods were sold in order to prevent famine. Later, the purchased foods were also used as rations for the frontier force of Northern Wei dynasty. The policy had always kept the price of state purchased foods higher than the market price of these foods. However, during the reign of Emperor Dezong of Tang, the imperial court purchased foods with a price that was lower than the market price. Chancellor Lu Zhi critically pointed out that, when purchasing food with such low price, the government was turning the policy of Hedi into a type of tax which aggravated the burden of tax payers(since they had to \\"sell\\" their harvests with a price that would never benefit them). During the Mongol invasion of Song dynasty, Song army had to constantly engage the Mongols. The cost of war was extremely high and the imperial court began to forcefully purchase food supplies from farmers. The official price by then was considerably lower than the market price. Government officials also acknowledged the fact that the policy had become pure robbery. Since the forced purchase of harvests did not compensate sellers, the policy discouraged the development of agriculture. Between 1159 and 1259, the annual amount of forced purchase of food supplies from farmers had increased from 2,300,000 Picul to 5,600,000 picul. In Yuan dynasty, most of the cases of Hedi were not voluntary. The policy of Hedi continued to exist in Ming and Qing dynasty until the fall of the last dynasty in 1911. The abuse of Hedi did not originate from the late Song dynasty. Recorded abuse of Hedi date back as early as the year of 787. In 1114 and 1126 two different cases of abuse were reported. Local government officials reportedly lowered the price of purchase or collected additional tax without any authorization. Despite of the later abuses, Hedi did provide farmers benefits. The policy was especially effective in a surplus of food supplies which causes the price of grains to drop. With the state purchase of excessive food supplies, farmers do not need to sell them in a low price in years of surplus  References  Category:Economic history of China ","title":"Hedi (policy)"},{"id":"54866864","text":"Truncospora is a genus of 10 species of fungi in the family Polyporaceae. Taxonomy The genus was originally proposed by Czech mycologist Albert Pil√°t in 1941, but this publication is invalid because a type species was not designated, contrary to the rules of botanical nomenclature. He published the genus validly in 1953 with two species: Truncospora oboensis, and the type, T. ochroleuca. Leif Ryvarden placed the genus in synonymy with Perenniporia in 1972, but molecular studies have shown that Truncospora is distinct genetically, and comprises part of the \\"core polyporoid clade\\", a grouping of fungi roughly equivalent to the family Polyporaceae. The generic name Truncospora is derived from the Latin trunco (\\"I cut off\\") and the Ancient Greek (\\"spore\\"). Description Truncospora is characterized by relatively small, cap-forming fruit bodies that generally measure about long, wide, and thick.

Premise The series centers on Poppy, a young neckerchief-wearing kitten heroine, leading her eccentric team of friends who are stuffed animals, Alma the bunny, Zuzu the Dalmatian puppy, an owl named Owl and Mo the mouse that belong to a little girl named Lara. Like all animals, they walk upright, talk and go on many extraordinary adventures to faraway lands of wonder by any kind of transportation they need that matches her neckerchief, like a sailing ship, a train, an airplane, a hot-air balloon, a submarine, a rocket ship, a campervan, a horse and carriage and their very own car. But they have to stay away from Egbert, a badger who is rude and makes fun of them. Characters *Larahttp://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv- shows/Poppy-Cat/Lara/ ‚Äì the narrator of the show. A six-year-old girl with an active imagination who writes and reads stories and draws pictures about the adventures of her pet kitten Poppy, the beloved young kitten leader and her eccentric team of friends, Alma the rabbit, Zuzu the puppy, Owl and Mo the mouse, and not the villain, Egbert the badger. Voiced in the UK by Maddie Page and in the US by Cindy Robinson. *Poppy Cat ‚Äì the main protagonist in the series. She is the leader of the group. She is a feisty, imaginative, cheerful and happy-go-lucky young six-year-old orange ginger tabby kitten girl with a big white face and long whiskers and she wears a magic multi-colored neckerchief that takes her and her stuffed animal friends on extraordinary adventures by any type of vehicle they need that matches her neckerchief. She's an adventurer, a heroine, an imagineer, a dreamer, and a devoted best friend to her stuffed animal friends. Poppy's heroic gusto and unquenchable curiosity propel each adventure for her and her friends, often leading to unexpected experiences and discoveries. She is highly conscious of those around her and will go to the ends of the Earth to solve a problem. Poppy likes adventure, but her top priority is always her friends, which is why she is the unspoken leader of her little gang. She's the glue that holds them all together. On her birthday adventure, she wears a pink hat and serves as the Birthday Captain.

Alma, who fancies herself quite a singer, often coaxes her best buddy Mo to sing a duet. Mo has an unspoken little crush on Alma and worries about her a bit. The chatty rabbit is a loyal, affectionate friend who likes jewelry, the color pink, and picnics. She treasures a special seashell that Mo gave her to hear the ocean.

Owl may complain about Zuzu's inadvertent path of destruction, but he has a soft spot for each of his friends. He's especially supportive of the timid Mo, and like everyone, has great respect for Poppy Cat. Owl likes the finer things in life: a soft coconut-leaf nest, a cup of hot chocolate, and a quick nap whenever he can catch one. He also likes to perform. He is the oldest of the group. Voiced in the UK by Chris Neill and in the US by Donald King. **In the episode \\"Royal Toad\\", his singing voice is provided by Spanish tenor opera legend Pl√°cido Domingo. *Egbert ‚Äì the main antagonist of the series. He is an arrogant, stout, sneaky, greedy, grumpy and adenoidal young six-year-old stuffed toy honey badger boy and the master of disguise with an English accent in both the UK and US. He is desperate to be part of the group, although only by his rules. But rather than accept their invitation to play (or go on an adventure), Egbert always has 'top secret stuff' to go to on his way, only to always meet the group again, in their adventure. There, he will insert himself into their journey, costumed as a ridiculous antagonist of his own invention. Depending upon their location, Egbert may fancy himself to be a pirate, troll, or sea monster. His nerdy, eccentric energy elicits groans from everyone but Poppy. Egbert pretends to not know 'this Egbert', and always stays in character. He hates their friends' fun.

Conception Brenda and her twin brother, Brandon Walsh, were living in Minnesota until their father, Jim Walsh, was promoted and moved to a job in Beverly Hills in 1990. The series initially focuses on their stories and the cultural shock of living on the West coast, and their relationship with their new friends Kelly Taylor, Dylan McKay, Donna Martin, Andrea Zuckerman, David Silver and Steve Sanders. Season 1 The early development of Brenda Walsh was focused on her feelings about moving to a new town, making new friends, and trying to fit in to the new Beverly Hills lifestyle. In the pilot episode, Brenda fantasizes about making big changes in her life, alluding to the idea that she wasn't very popular at her old school. She meets Kelly Taylor and struggles internally with impressing her and the other kids at school. Her desperation to fit in and be counted among the popular is highlighted by her sudden rule breaking and sneaking around. She gets a fake ID and gets entry to a club, where she meets the character Jason, a lawyer in his early 20s. Brenda lies to him and pretends to be a college student, embarking on a relationship that proves to be moving too fast for her. An example of Brenda's naivete was when she disclosed her real age to Jason believing that he would continue dating her despite her being a 16-year-old high school student. We see Brenda's youthful heartbreak and the realization that love doesn't conquer all. It's in that moment that the audience is most drawn to Brenda, as the direction for the character led us to believe that an honor roll student with the loving family and good looks had it all together and lived a perfect and grown up life even while still in high school. Her vulnerability at this point brought a touch of reality to the character that fans appreciated and helped move the season into the second episode with a larger fan base. Brenda Walsh further displays her desire for popularity with her hot and cold relationship with Andrea Zuckerman, the nerdy editor of the West Beverly High newspaper. When in front of her friends, Brenda pretends to dislike Andrea, subtly mocking her. However, in episodes where Brenda and Andrea are alone together, Brenda treats her with a grudging respect, but they would become good friends later on. This behavior is repeated with other, less popular students as well, shining a light on the magnitude of a teenager's desire to fit in and be popular. Brenda Walsh is no exception to this common theme. The main season one arch for the Brenda Walsh character came during a series of episodes involving a surprise romance with Brandon's solitary friend, Dylan McKay, who had long been misunderstood as an outsider and bad boy. Brenda and Dylan's relationship quickly became serious in season one after a frantic dispute with his father on one of their first dates. Dylan was consoled by Brenda and shared a passionate kiss with her. This scene jumpstarted one of the most talked about pairings at West Beverly High. Brenda's father was initially against the relationship due to the bad reputation of Dylan's father, however, Brenda continued to date Dylan in secret. After two months of their relationship, Dylan wanted to have sex, but Brenda was not ready. During a trip to Palm Springs, Brenda went to meet Dylan in a hotel room, but saw him with another girl and jumped to the conclusion that they had made love. Showing her temper, Brenda stormed off, but shortly returned only to throw the girl out of the hotel room and confront Dylan. Brenda and Dylan quickly reconciled, but not before an uncomfortable argument that ended with Brenda essentially demanding that Dylan sleep with her since that was all he was apparently concerned about. As a result, Dylan agreed to wait until Brenda was ready, and the couple left the hotel and went to spend the rest of the holiday with their friends at David Silver's grandparents' house in Palm Springs. Despite the show's focus on the relationship between Brenda and Dylan, her character was developed in other areas as well, forming an identity separate from simply being \\"Dylan's girlfriend\\". In multiple episodes, Brenda proves herself to be a funny, smart and driven young woman who cares about her friends and family and puts them first, along with her own personal goals. The character definitely has a streak of pride that shows that she isn't perfect and makes plenty of mistakes, but the directors and writers made sure to include Brenda's vulnerable side to keep the character relatable. Episodes such as \\"Its Just A Test\\" show an uncertain girl who is learning about life and the struggles that take place, however episodes like \\"The Perfect Mom\\" also show how good friends and a supportive family plays such a strong role in her life. Brenda's relationships aside from the one she has with Dylan are prioritized in every episode, and she verbalizes this in the episode \\"Sleepover\\" when she tells her friend Kelly that she won't let a stupid boy come between her and her friends. At the West Beverly High spring dance, Brenda and Dylan make the decision to have sex for the first time. As their relationship is taken to a new level, Brenda has to deal with the news that her family will be moving back to Minneapolis for her father's promotion in the season finale \\"coming Home\\". It seems as though all the friends that she made will be left behind, and many tears are shed as Brenda says her good-byes to her friends and ends her relationship with Dylan, fearing that long distance dating will cause Dylan to cheat while she's away. The culmination of the season comes when Brenda's father decides to stay in Beverly Hills for the sake of his family's happiness, and Brenda informs Dylan that she is \\"late\\". Season 2 Season two begins with the pregnancy scare between Brenda and Dylan. Brenda has to tell her parents after her mom finds the pregnancy test, and after struggling with the responsibilities that come with a sexual relationship, Brenda decides to end the relationship with Dylan. Brenda withdraws back to her close inner circle of friends to reclaim her identity as an individual, and begins pursuing an acting class during the summer. She keeps her distance from Dylan, not trusting her ability to end their romance for good, but after he suffers a surfing injury and has to stay at the Walsh's to recover, Brenda rekindles the affair. The situation causes a struggle between Brenda and her father, as he continues to see Brenda as a little girl even as she becomes a young woman. The change between season one Brenda and season two Brenda is that rather than trying to find her place in her new social circle, Brenda is becoming her own person and claiming her space as an adult in the Walsh family circle. Dylan decides to move to Hawaii to live with his mother, and Brenda continues finding herself at home in Beverly Hills. They talk infrequently, and Brenda still struggles with whether she wants to end the relationship for good, and when Dylan returns from Hawaii they continue to see each other without the sexual aspect of the relationship. The series' second season introduces new characters and begins to focus on Brenda's twin brother Brandon more, developing his character in the storyline. Brenda's character seems to develop on the sidelines while she and Dylan navigate their relationship, but she isn't disregarded in the plot. Brenda continues to learn her way out of the naivety that defined her season one character in side stories throughout season two, and towards the end of the season, makes decisions that go against her parents' wishes. During a fateful weekend, Brenda and Dylan abscond to Baja, Mexico and Mr. Walsh decides to keep them from seeing each other at all. The season finale ends with Kelly and David's parents' marriage at the Walsh's house, and to Brenda's dismay, a blow out fight between Dylan and Mr. Walsh. Season 3 Season three begins during the summer before Brenda's senior year of high school. After the fight between Dylan and Mr. Walsh, Brenda was forbidden from seeing Dylan, but she continues to do so in secret. When her parents find out that she's been lying to them, Brenda stands up to them and demands to have her feelings for Dylan taken seriously. She goes so far as to pack up her clothes after the fight and leave home to be with Dylan at his house. She is distraught, but is frustrated that she's been forced to hide the most important relationship in her life from her family. The cohabitation is more stressful than Brenda realized before moving in, and before long her and Dylan are fighting about everything. In an effort to cool things off, Brenda decides to go to Paris, France, for a French immersion program in lieu of Kelly, who has taken her responsibility as a big sister very seriously and decided to stay home. Mr. Walsh and Dylan both support Brenda's summer trip to France; Mr. Walsh, as a way to get Brenda away from Dylan, and Dylan as a way to get Brenda's father off his back. In Paris, Brenda focuses on exploring the sites and soaking up the French culture, deciding to hold off from calling Dylan so she doesn't get distracted. She wants to evolve as a person, and not be directed by the men in her life; her father or Dylan. In Beverly Hills, Dylan and Kelly's friendship gets closer while Brenda is studying overseas. Brenda pretends to be a French native when she meets a young man named Rick, and their relationship becomes romantic. When Brenda returns home and leaves Rick behind in Paris, her relationship with Dylan gets back to normal, but even though she tells Dylan about Rick, he doesn't tell her about Kelly. When Rick suddenly shows up in Beverly Hills and runs into Brenda, Dylan discloses to Brenda that there was a girl over the summer, but doesn't tell her that it was her best friend. After a dramatic break up, Brenda starts to see Rick, and Dylan immediately goes to Kelly's. As the season three directors develop the other characters' storylines, the plot surrounding Brenda, Kelly and Dylan seems to be a natural progression for the series. The love triangle that followed Brenda's return from France quickly became a milestone in the series that helped increase her popularity and gave rise to the rumors of rivalry announced between Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth off set. The final confrontation between Brenda, Dylan and Kelly - in which he informs Brenda that he has chosen her best friend - was listed by Entertainment Weekly as one of the greatest moments of television. As the tension between the three continues, Brenda considers leaving Beverly Hills behind and applies to a Minnesota college. She feels abandoned by her friends as they are all more consumed with their respective romantic relationships and she is single and pining for her lost love with Dylan. After several months, Brenda moves past her disappointment that Dylan had moved on with Kelly, and as the group starts making plans for after graduation, Brenda makes her decision to attend college in Minnesota, leaving her friends in Beverly Hills behind. Season 4 Brenda began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. She chose to go to university in Minnesota to prove that she could make it on her own, away from her family and out from underneath Brandon's shadow and more so, to distract herself from the painful feelings she experienced after Dylan chose to be with her best friend Kelly instead of her. However, after realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common anymore and deciding to take control of her own destiny regardless of her geographical location, she decides to return to her family in Beverly Hills. This is another big step for Brenda's character, as it's the turning point where she stops running from her mistakes and the heartbreak of her past, faces reality, and takes responsibility for creating the life she wants for herself. The Walsh parents struggle to understand the reasons behind Brenda's dropping out of Minnesota's university program and moving home, but are more concerned that Brenda is choosing not to go to university in California either, and saying that her failure to succeed in Minnesota was proof that she isn't cut out for higher education at all. Despite the character's desire to be the master of her own destiny, Brenda Walsh continues to teeter between making rational and irrational decisions, and struggles with the \\"all or nothing\\" mentality that plagues most young adolescents, ironically narrowing their opportunities at the very time they are trying to spread their wings and join the world as adults. While settling back into being home in Beverly Hills, Brenda spends the first few days of her return hanging out at the Peach Pit and cruising around town with Dylan, as he has decided not to enter university either. But after some heart to heart discussion, both Brenda and Dylan decide to give California University a chance, and they both enroll. Brenda participates in rush week with her friends Kelly, Donna and Andrea upon arriving at the university. The friends hope that by pledging the same sorority, they'll be able to maintain their close friendships during their college years. Despite wanting to maintain close friendships, Brenda isn't impressed with the non-stop party scene that pervades the sorority life. After putting her energy towards finding a job instead of pledging, and not having any luck, Brenda decides to work for her dad for some real job experience. The job experience was going well, but Brenda was frustrated that between school, work and homework, she would never find time to date. Brenda's parents set her up on a blind date with the son of one of Mr. Walsh's clients, and while she was hesitant at first to go, she and her date, Stuart, became serious very quickly, announcing their marriage engagement at the Walsh's 20th wedding anniversary only two weeks after they first met. The Walsh's did not forbid the marriage at first, but had their concerns that Brenda was being rash, as she tends to do. Brandon had serious concerns though, after Dylan told him that he had known Stuart years ago as a dealer of drugs. Once Dylan spoke to Mr. Walsh about his concerns, Mr. Walsh encouraged Dylan to convince Brenda not to marry Stuart, implying that Brenda still loved him. Because Kelly and Dylan had broken up at this point, he actually considered the possibility of getting back together with Brenda, now with Mr. Walsh's blessing. Even though Brenda and Stuart have a whirlwind romance, when she finds out that Stuart has a prenuptial agreement for her to sign prior to marrying him, Brenda gets upset and storms out. She and Dylan have coffee after running into each other at a poetry reading, and Dylan begs Brenda to end the engagement, telling her that her marriage would end any chance that they might get back together. Brenda quickly surmises that he's spoken to her father, and is furious that her family and friends would go behind her back and try to manipulate her. After confronting her father about his part in it, she packs her things and leaves to move in with Stuart at his condo. Hoping to team up with Stuart's parents and discourage their children from marrying so soon, the Walsh's invite them over for lunch, but are surprised to learn that Stuart's parents not only support the marriage plans, but have already started planning the wedding with event coordinators. Brenda and Stuart become overwhelmed and decide to elope to Las Vegas in secret, but Brenda spills the beans to Brandon and he tells their friends. Everyone books plane tickets and flies to Vegas in an effort to stop her, but knowing how hard headed she is, they decide to persuade her using reverse psychology and pretend that they are in favor of the marriage. Brenda starts to doubt her reasons for marrying Stuart and calls off the wedding. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After her arrest, the only person in the group who supported her was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not test animals and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not go and look for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism. As a result, all Brenda's friends apologized for their behavior towards her. During the fourth season, Brenda is interested in the drama department but it also led to problems: she spoiled her first audition and then went to the director of the play to try again and convince him. She then got the role, but a student made a rumor saying that she had slept to have the role. Unfortunately, this student was the girlfriend of Steve Sanders and the latter believed the rumors, others refusing more or less to believe the denials of Brenda. Steve understood his mistake when the student asked him to attack Brenda to make her miss rehearsals. A little later, Steve's friend tried to commit suicide, but Brenda and Steve joined forces to save her and Steve was finally compensated by following Brenda's debut on stage. The director's praise led her to accept the latter at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in London for a year. After Kelly and Dylan last broke up, Brenda finally learned that a relationship was possible between Kelly and Brandon and expressed her blessing. She later spent her last night with Dylan, telling him she would not be gone forever. The couple will reconcile briefly in the final scene of the fourth season, though (because of Shannen Doherty's departure) Brenda's character was removed from the script and she never returned to Beverly Hills. Conflicts with Beverly Hills 90210 staff Shannen Doherty was notorious for being late and being in conflict with staff. Tiffani-Amber Thiessen replaced Brenda Walsh as a character called Valerie Malone. After the departure Despite the fact that Brenda never appeared on the screen, she was nonetheless present during occasional story lines during the following six seasons of the series. The most significant among them is her reconciliation with Dylan, who was going to move in with her. It is assumed that they were together for most episodes of the seventh and eighth seasons of the series, as during an episode of season 8 where it is learned that Dylan's half-sister was saved from a life of prostitution and then left to live with Dylan and Brenda in London and Kelly and Brandon mentioned going to visit them for part of their honeymoon. Later, when Dylan returned in season 9, he told his friends that he and Brenda had separated two years earlier. However, it frees Dylan to resume his relationship with Kelly. In Season 5, Dylan rages against Valerie, the Walsh family friend, blaming her for wanting to imitate Brenda and not having the guts to confront the Walsh parents, as Brenda was able to do before. She will also send an announcement to Dylan at the latter's wedding. Or, in the last episode of the series illustrating the marriage of Donna and David, it is alluded to a slumber party that Brenda had organized when they were still in high school. 90210 14 years after her departure, Brenda is back in Beverly Hills. On the advice of Kelly to the new counselor, Brenda, becomes an actress and is led to direct the musical of the high school. She will have to deal with the drug problems of the high school girl who plays the lead role in the show and will help her get out of it, which will follow a mutual attachment of the latter. She will also spend a lot of time with Kelly although at times, they will recover some tensions due among others to Dylan.

Although intending to stabilize the country's silver shortage, it, in effect, pushed the United States closer to abandoning bimetallism entirely and adopting the gold standard. Smaller silver denominations in the United States were disappearing as the bullion value of silver far exceeded the face value of U.S. silver coinage. In response, Congress debated a bill which would overvalue most forms of silver coinage and authorize the U.S. Mint to purchase bullion for the new coins. The legislation lowered the silver content of most silver coins by seven percent and was signed into law on February 21, 1853. The 1853 act increased the circulation of small coinage, ending the United States' silver shortage crisis, and provided an adequate supply of silver coinage for the first time in the nation's history. However, by the time of the outbreak of the Civil War, most metallic coinage became hoarded and the country largely switched to Greenbacks. It would be in 1873 when the debate between silver and gold was finally resolved, with all pretenses of bimetallism replaced in favor of the gold standard.  Background  Since 1792, both silver and gold were legal tender in the United States and citizens could deposit either of the metals in bullion form to the U.S. Mint, which would then give the depositor gold or silver coins based on a legally defined weight ratio of gold and silver, respectively, to dollars. This bimetallic standard was prone to instability, as the value of gold and silver bullion could float on the world market, making U.S. gold and silver coins either over-valued or under-valued depending on the circumstances. This resulted in most U.S. gold and silver being exported to be sold as bullion and most coinage circulated in the country was foreign in origin. President Jackson intended to increase the circulation of both gold and silver by slightly overvaluing gold in 1834, matching 16 ounces of silver in value to an ounce of gold. The 1834 Coinage Act was initially successful, as the Mint ratio of 16:1 remained fortuitously close to the world price ratio of gold to silver, limiting the advantage speculators would get from melting down silver coinage and selling it as bullion overseas while incentivizing depositors to turn their gold bullion into coins. The United States experienced a net in-flow of gold and silver throughout the early 1840s, and small silver coinage became the major medium of exchange in smaller business transactions.  Coin shortage  Depiction of Australian gold diggers However, by 1847, the world ratio of silver ounces to gold had declined to 15.66:1, setting on a collision course with the Mint's legal ratio. In 1849, this ratio was worsened dramatically with the onset of the California Gold Rush and the discovery of new gold deposits in Australia in 1851. These new gold discoveries more than quadrupled annual gold production from an average of 36 million dollars in the 1840s to 155 million dollars by 1853. As gold flooded the monetary markets of the world, its commodity price declined due to its higher supply. This, in turn, caused the price of silver relative to gold to skyrocket. American silver became a premium. With the bullion value of silver far exceeding the face value of U.S. silver coins, melting became rampant as speculators could sell off their silver coins as bullion for its more profitable world market value. Small silver coinage, which retail businesses and consumers relied upon for minor transactions, soon began to disappear, forcing some businesses to pay premium values just to obtain change.  Inception  Throughout the early 1850s, Congress debated numerous proposals which would debase silver coinage to overvalue silver and stem the out-flow of the metal from the United States. But there was significant resistance among some congressmen to any attempt to tamper with the value of money, despite the fact that Congress in 1834 had already established a precedent by effectively debasing gold coinage to improve its circulation. = Intentions of the bill's authors = By December 1851, the Treasury Department submitted a report which indicated that the disappearance of U.S. currency had reached a critical point, and put forth recommendations to reduce the silver content in all forms of silver coinage. Following the recommendations of the Treasury, a bill passed through the Senate Finance Committee in March 1852 which would reduce nearly all U.S. fractions by around 7 percent, but‚Äîcontrary to the Treasury's report‚Äîleft the silver dollar unchanged. This was to make explicit, in the words of the Committee chair Robert M. T. Hunter, that the Committee had apprehension towards tampering with what they viewed as money's inherent value, and only intended the bill to be a temporary measure to restore some circulation of silver to the country. The bill would not be a drastic change, but would only mandate the smallest deviation possible necessary to \\"accomplish the object of retaining a specie currency for small transactions\\". Still contending with the objections of some senators, Senate Bill No. 271 passed the Senate and moved to consideration in the House of Representatives in December 1852. = Passage through the House = Future president Andrew Johnson from Tennessee was one of several congressmen fiercely opposed to the bill Senate No. 271 ran into numerous obstacles in the House. Then Tennessee representative and future president Andrew Johnson was one of many vociferous opponents of the proposal to debase silver, calling the idea of Congress fixing the value of currency an exercise in the \\"merest quackery--the veriest charlatanism\\". Additionally, the bill was encumbered by numerous House amendments led by a cadre of congressmen who wished to see the United States switch entirely to the gold standard. The most important amendment, authored by Representative Cyrus Dunham, would have removed legal tender status from any new silver coins in private transactions, so as to eliminate silver as a medium of exchange. Dunham's amended version of the bill ran into heavy opposition, however, both from proponents of bimetallism that wanted to see the Senate No. 271 pass unaltered and those congressmen fiercely opposed to any change to the status quo. Finally, on February 15, 1853, the bill was passed through the House in exactly the same form that it left the Senate months earlier, and was signed into law six days later.  Provisions  The Coinage Act of February 21, 1853 lowered the weight (i.e. the silver content) of all silver coinage except for the silver dollar by approximately 7 percent. The Act also fixed the legal tender status of silver to transactions worth a maximum of five dollars. It also authorized the U.S. Mint to purchase silver bullion using the Mint's bullion fund to create the new coins, and only sell the silver coins to the public in exchange for gold. Finally, the Act forbade private depositors from having their bullion struck into half dime, dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar denominations. In essence, the Act turned silver into a fiduciary currency, transforming the value of silver coins from something goods and services were sold for into a medium by which goods and services were exchanged. The silver dollar, which was left untouched by the alteration, has been theorized as the Senate Finance Committee's way of signaling that Congress still held to a de jure bimetallic standard even as the Act eroded against traditional conceptions of silver as a currency.  Design of new coins  1853 Seated Liberty silver quarter, with its distinct arrows and rays. Mint officials decided that the new, lower-weight coins should have distinct markings to distinguish them from earlier, full-weight coins. But the necessity of minting as many of the new coins as quickly as possible, to meet the demand of the silver coin shortage, led officials to decide upon simply stamping arrows on either side of the date on the coin and adding a halo of rays on the reverse side of the quarter and half-dollar. Even this caused issues, as the rays complicated and slowed down die production to an unacceptable degree. The rays were removed from the quarter and half-dollar before the end of 1853, although the arrows were kept on new denominations for several more years.  Aftermath  Controversy arose due to Mint officials' maladministration of the law. The Act only allowed the Mint to purchase silver bullion from the Mint's bullion fund to create the new coins. However, Mint Director James Ross Snowden purchased silver bullion from private owners using the new, under-weight silver coins. Even when the market price of silver bullion had fallen, Snowden continued this practice and effectively allowed for free coinage of silver coins as the Act had neglected to set a ceiling limit on the amount of bullion the Mint could purchase. As the silver coins had a legal tender limit of $5, a glut arose of the lightweight silver coins on the market in the late 1850s. Treasury Secretary James Guthrie briefly suspended the coinage of quarters and half dollars as a result of the surplus, but never investigated the Mint policy responsible for creating the oversupply. The nation's silver redundancy lasted until 1862, when the pinch of the Civil War caused coins to disappear from circulation. Ultimately, the Act achieved what it set out to do and cured the nation's silver shortage. By reducing silver, small coinage reached a level where it could once again circulate in private transactions. The net outflow of silver slowed as the new coins were no longer worth their weight in silver, and were worth more for their face value within the United States than as bullion abroad. The Act was the beginning of an economic debate between gold and silver which lasted until the late 19th century, but the fundamental discussion about the role of fiduciary currency in the United States would only truly be resolved in 1970 when the U.S. dollar was removed from its peg to the gold standard.

From around 1865 until 1927 it was the largest mining company in Algeria, delivering ore of exceptional quality for processing in France. In 1878 the original Mokta El Hadid mine near B√¥ne (now Annaba) was said to be capable of supporting 25% of Europe's steel production. Before this mine was exhausted the company opened additional mines in Algeria. Later it extended its operations to countries such as Tunisia, Morocco, Niger, C√¥te-d'Ivoire and Madagascar, and mined manganese, chromium and uranium. In October 1970 the Soci√©t√© le Nickel, soon to become the Im√©tal holding company, took over the Mokta company. The company was later renamed Compagnie fran√ßaise de Mokta (CFM), specializing in uranium mining. First discovery The mine is about from the port of B√¥ne in the Mokta hill beside at the foot of a mountain chain that runs from south to north, then turns east to B√¥ne. The name \\"Mokta-el-Hadid\\" (the iron pass) indicates that the presence of iron has long been known, but there is no sign that it was worked before the first small-scale attempts in 1840. The geologist Henri Fournel discovered the deposits of magnetite in 1843. The businessman Paulin Talabot had a \\"Mediterranean dream\\" involving \\"the exploitation of the mines of the B√¥ne region, which would feed his coal mines in the Grand-Combe by means of rapid transport in his ships of the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique, relayed by his Algerian railroad cars and those of the PLM.\\" Before Fournel's survey was complete, in 1845 the Talabots or their associates had obtained three of the four concessions in the B√¥ne region. Algeria in the 19th century did not have coking coal, so did not process its iron ore. Instead, the ore was shipped to the coast and sold to a shipper, who in turn sold it to European steel mills for about twice the price. Talabot thought of building an ironworks at B√¥ne, but abandoned the idea in 1848 part due to the danger of attack by the Algerians and in part to a threatened boycott of Algerian iron ore by the Schneiders of Le Creusot. A report by Fournel to the Acad√©mie des sciences on 14 May 1848 said, \\"to the north of Lake F'Zara there is a whole mountain, the Mokta-el-Hadid (the quarry of iron) which emerges from the gneisses and literally presents from foot to top, that is to say over a height of more than one hundred meters, a mass of pure oxidized iron, with no admixture of rock. To the east of this deposit, which few deposits known elsewhere could parallel, the oxidized iron pierces several other points.\\" Talabot asked the geologist √âmilien Dumas to assess the deposit. He contacted the polytechnician and engineer of mines Alphonse Parran to form the new company and start exploitation. Due to shortage of both labour and capital, little progress was made and in 1849 the government revoked the three Talabot concessions. In 1852 they were restored after Napoleon III had taken power. In 1857 the Mokta el Hadid mine was found, and the Talabots gained the concession. The ore was in a vein long and wide. The magnetite ore was 70% pure iron. This ore, free of sulfur and phosphorus, was much more suitable for the Bessemer and Martin processes than the poorer ores high in phosphorus that are typical of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. Plans for a merger with the steelworks at Alais in the Gard were drawn up, possibly part of a larger merger with the mines of the Grand-Combe, but stalled. In 1863 the Soci√©t√© de Mokta el Hadid was established definitively. Plans were drawn up to combine the Mokta el Hadid mines with the Firminy, Loire, steelworks, the Gard coal mines and the Saut-du-Tarn steelworks near Albi, Tarn. 20 million francs of capital would be needed, including 8 million of fresh capital for upgrades at the various sites. These plans also dragged out. Mokta el Hadid mine Extensive construction was undertaken at B√¥ne in 1856‚Äì69 to build an sheltered port facility to handle the ore from Mokta el Hadid. A short railway line was built from the mine at Ain Mokra to the B√¥ne docks. The line was opened in 1864, the first railway line in Algeria. Full-scale production began in 1865. Before the mine was opened B√¥ne had 10,000 inhabitants. By 1924 there were 41,000 and the port was being used to export phosphates, lead and zinc ore. The arrival in large volumes of Algerian ores from Mokta-el-Hadid upset the supply chain in France. The success at the Firminy plant in making steel rails using only ore from the Algerian mines was a major argument for installation of furnaces based on the Martin process at Le Creusot. In 1865 Eug√®ne Schneider had reached an agreement with Paulin Talabot to obtain a large supply of Algerian ore, making it possible to start intensive steel production. Napoleon III dining in a tent at the mine site (1965) In 1865 Napoleon III came to Algeria and made a trip to the mine and the city of B√¥ne. A photograph survives of the emperor and his entourage taking refreshment under a tent at the mine site. Paulin Talabot founded the Soci√©t√© General Alg√©rienne (SGA) in 1865 to promote economic growth in the colony of Algeria, which created five villages for French colonists. It was granted of land in exchange for a 100 million franc loan to Napoleon III, which was spent on Algerian public works. After experiencing some financial difficulties the SGA was reorganized as the Compagnie Alg√©rienne in 1877. In 1865 the mine produced 22,000 tons, rising to 255,000 tons in 1869. The abundant ore was extracted from underground galleries and shipped from B√¥ne to the main French steelworks. In 1870 Algeria as a whole exported 84,710 tons of iron ore. In the 1870s 2/3 of all miners in Algeria were working the Mokta-el-Hadid mine. In 1874 the Mokta el Hadid mine alone shipped 430,000 tons of ore, containing 260,000 tons of iron. At this time Britain was producing a total of 500,000 tons of steel. The mine was said to be capable of supporting 25% of Europe's steel production. In 1875‚Äì76 the Bou Djima River, which was carrying silt into the port, was diverted to the Seybouse River. The railway could now be extended to the port, considerably reducing transport costs. Alphonse Parran remained head of the company until 1900. Philippe de Cerner took over management of the Mokta-el-Hadid mine in 1875. Output from the 14 iron ore mines in Algeria rose to 511,000 tons in 1876, then started to decline. In 1879 the country exported 400,000 tons, of which 320,000 tons came from Mokta-el-Hadid. Very little of the ore was smelted before export. The port of B√¥ne shipped only 148,695 tons of ore in 1893. Mining at Mokta el Hadid ended in 1904. Lake of Fetzara Lake of Fetzara in 1857 before being drained by the company The mine is beside the Lake of Fetzara. When it started operation the lake's surface elevation would have reached in winter, with an area of . The lake was bordered with reeds and rushes, used for nesting by migratory birds, and was rich in fish. The lake was considered a source of fever, and a drainage channel flowing into the Oued Meboudja was proposed, but although the SGA had rights to the northern and eastern shores of the lake it did nothing. In the 1870s the company planted many eucalyptus trees around the Lake of Fetzara. A report published in 1901 said, \\"The example of Lake Fetzara has been much quoted; its marshy miasma infected the large mining works of Mokta-el-Hadid, decimated the staff, and rendered existence in this locality insupportable. Now, thanks to well developed forests of Eucalyptus, it presents all the conditions of a tolerable hygiene.\\" The report then noted that the improvement could also be attributed in part to better medical attention and the fact that most of the staff commuted to work from B√¥ne. The trees were all killed by salt water seeping from the lake. In 1877 the Mokta El Hadid company gained permission to drain the lake in exchange for free transfer of the reclaimed land. A channel led from the center of the lake, crossed the western flank and led to the Meboudja. The surface elevation had dropped to by 1880, but the lake remained swampy in summer. After 1903 the company ceded its rights to the Lake of Fetzara to the SGA colony, which took over the work and completed it in 1935. Other operations The docks at B√©ni Saf As of 1878 the company had also opened the Korezza, Bou-Hamra and Marouaina mines. Before the Mokta deposits started showing signs of running out Alphonse Parran obtained the deposit of Rar El Baroud near B√©ni Saf in 1879. The ore in the B√©ni Saf region near Montagnac (now named Remchi) is hematite with 2% manganese. Between 1867 and 1947 the region produced 30 million metric tons of ore. Alphonse Parran was also involved in the Kryvyi Rih iron ore mine in Russia in 1881 and the Gafsa phosphate deposits in Tunisia in 1886. In Tunisia as of 1893 the company owned concessions at Ras Radjid, Bou lanague, Dj Bellif and Ganara in the Kroumine between Tabarka and Cap Serrat. The ores, which had not yet been worked, were brown and red hematites with an average of 50% iron. By 1895 the company had bought all the iron ore beds in the Ouelhasses Cheragas ore district of Algeria apart from Boukourdan. These included the Das rih and Bar el Baroud beds of B√©ni Saf, and the Ten Kreut, Djed el Haouraia and Sidi-safi groups of ore beds. Only the Bar el Baroud was being worked, using open-cut mining to extract ore with at least 55% iron. The port of B√©ni Saf was operated privately by the company, which had built it and had a 99-year lease. Estimated output was 291,547 metric tons in 1892 and 203,338 tons in 1893. Destinations, in order, were England, the Netherlands, France, the US and Belgium. The company obtained the Boukhadra deposits near the Tunisian border in 1902. In the period from 1900 to 1930 the company was among the powerful capitalist groups in the French colonial empire that provided exceptional rates of profit. Alphonse Parran was succeeded as head of the company in 1900 by √âdouard de Billy (1866‚Äì1919). Billy was replaced in 1918 by Charles-√âmile Heurteau (1878‚Äì1961), who took the simple title of Director while L√©on de Nervo (1873‚Äì1973), the heir of Paulin Talabot, took the title of Managing Director. L√©on de Nervo was also president of the Soci√©t√© Commerciale de Navigation, which operated three 6,800 ton cargo vessels that carried North African iron ore to European ports and to the US. Heurteau left in the 1920s to take a position as Managing Director at the Marles coal mines. Andr√© Duby joined as chief engineer of technical services in 1927, then became co- director with L√©on de Nervo, and sole director in the 1940s. Algerian governor Charles Jonnart blocked construction of local steelworks to process the iron ore From 1901 the company began using Moroccan workers in its B√©ni Saf mines. The Compagnie des mines du Djebel-Djerissa was created in 1899 with a capital of 4.5 million francs divided into 9,000 shares of 500 francs. In 1905 the nominal share value was reduced to 400 francs and the capital was reduced to 3.6 million francs. The Soci√©t√© du Djebel-Djerissa became in effect a subsidiary of the Soci√©t√© Mokta El Hadid of Algeria, which took a stake of 5,200 shares in the mine in 1906. In 1905 the small Mokta railway was connected to the departmental network, connecting the port of Bone to the Jemmapes (Azzaba) region, and now extended as far as Saint-Charles (Ramdane Djamel). Philippe de Cerner, the company manager in B√¥ne, had convinced the government to extend the railway west from Ain Mokra to connect with the main line to Philippeville (Skikda), and then persuaded the government to assume responsibility for running the line in the public interest. Philippe de Cerner was appointed director of the new line from 1908 until his retirement in 1917. In 1912 the Compagnie des min√©rais de fer magn√©tique de Mokta-el-Hadid had a capital of 20 million and made a profit of 4.5 million. When World War I began Mokta-el Hadid was one of only two privately owned French colonial companies other than banks and railways with capital of over 20 million francs, the other being the Soci√©t√© Le Nickel in New Caledonia. In 1917 the Soci√©t√© Mokta El Hadid and the Soci√©t√© des Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen agreed to form a joint venture to exploit the Boukhadra deposits, which was supported by the minister Albert Thomas. However, the administration of governor Charles Lutaud submitted an alternative proposal to the government that required the company to build blast furnaces in B√¥ne and to pay higher royalties to Algeria. The agreement and specifications for this project were signed early in 1918, with 85% of the capital supplied by Mokta and Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen, and 15% by Denain-Anzin and a consortium of Algerian banks. Two blast furnaces would be built with combined annual capacity of 80,000 tons. However, after Charles Jonnart returned to Algeria as governor the project was delayed and eventually cancelled. In May 1919 the company's miners went on strike in solidarity with strikers in other industries, but the strike quickly fizzled out. Mokta el Hadid was the largest mining company in Algeria until 1927, when it was overtaken by the Soci√©t√© de l'Ouenza. The Mokta el Hadid iron ore mining company was responsible for creation of SACEM in 1929. SACEM (Soci√©t√© anonyme ch√©rifienne d'√©tudes mini√®res), based in Casablanca, Morocco, was founded to exploit the Imini manganese mines. The ratio of Soci√©t√© Mokta El Hadid share prices to earnings fluctuated from 3.0 in 1929 up to 11.0 in 1933, falling back to 1.8 by 1937. Post-World War II After World War II (1939‚Äì45) the Mokta El Hadid iron ore belonged to the Mirabaud Group. As of 1950 the company was capitalized at 5.1 billion francs, one of the top 2 on the Paris Bourse. In 1951 the Soci√©t√© de l'Ouenza produced 60% of Algerian iron, 85% in Ouenza and 15% in Bou-Kadra. Mokta-el-Hadid was the second iron ore mining company in Algeria, with many subsidiaries and several concessions, including in Morocco. Henri Lafond was head of the Banque de l'Union Parisienne from 1951, which controlled Mokta El Hadid, and was also head of SACEM. Lafond headed the Mokta company until his death in 1963. Moanda, Gabon, location of a manganese mining joint venture On 24 April 1953 a joint corporation was established to mine a deposit estimated at 50 million tons of manganese ore in Gabon owned by the Bureau of Mines of Overseas France (21%), Eastern Tjbangi Mining Company (15%), Mokta el Hadid group (15%) and the U.S. Steel (49%). A railway had first to be built to the coast, so full production was not expected until at least 1960. The Compagnie mini√®re de l'Ogoou√© (Comilog) had initial capital of CFA 150 million. The first ore was shipped from Moanda on 2 October 1962. In 1957, Georges Perrineau was appointed a director of the Mokta company and a member of the Executive Committee. In 1962 he became vice-president and, at the end of 1962 replaced Henri Lafond as president of the SACEM subsidiary that exploited the Imini manganese deposits in Morocco. Henri Lafond was assassinated in Paris on 6 March 1963, apparently by an OAS member because he refused to support the OAS with the companies in his group. He was succeeded as head of the Mokta company by Perrineau, who also became head of the Compagnie des Mines de Huaron, in which Mokta had a large stake. Perrineau was president of Mokta until 1970. In 1965 Perrineau presided over the company's centenary celebrations in C√¥te-d'Ivoire, which were attended by President F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny. In 1965 the company took a minority stake in the company formed to exploit chromium ore in Madagascar, directed by Ugine. In July 1967 France and Niger made agreements that included recognition of a uranium mining concession in Niger to be capitalized 45% by the Atomic Energy Commission, 40% by the private French companies Mokta El Hadid and French Uranium-ore, and 15% by the state of Niger. The exploitation company was Soma√Ør. Also in 1967 the merger activity between Suez and the Banque de l'Union parisienne caused Suez to become a direct shareholder in Mokta, and also in Huaron and Comuf. In 1968 Mokta joined forces with Pechiney to form the P√©chiney Mokta mining company, which would manage various uranium operations and fund research activity, particularly in Saskatchewan, Canada. In October 1970 the Soci√©t√© le Nickel, soon after to become the Imetal holding company, took over the Mokta company through a share swap. Perrineau remained a director and advisor. In 1980 Imetal absorbed Mokta, which was renamed Compagnie fran√ßaise de Mokta (CFM). As of 1991 the Compagnie fran√ßaise de Mokta was a wholly owned subsidiary of COGEMA (Compagnie g√©n√©rale des mati√®res nucl√©aires), a French company involved in mining and processing uranium.

It is found on shallow reef slopes, particularly those with strong wave action, and on vertical surfaces, in tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Description Detail of corallite Pavona maldivensis can be encrusting or massive, or a mixture of the two, and can form clumps over a metre in diameter, although colonies smaller than across are more usual. In areas with strong water movement they tend to form cylindrical, finger-like growths while elsewhere they may form horizontal plates, often with \\"leafy\\" edges. The corallites (stony cups in which the polyps sit) are circular and of irregular sizes, and have individual but indistinct stony walls. This coral is usually some shade of greyish-brown or green but can be bright orange. Distribution and habitat Though named \\"of the Maldives\\" (maldivensis), P. maldivensis has a wide distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. Its range extends from the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Madagascar, through the southwestern and central Indian Ocean, northern Australia, southern Japan and the South China Sea, to the western, central and eastern Pacific Ocean. Ecology Pavona maldivensis is a zooxanthellate species of coral; this means that its tissues contain symbiotic single celled algae which provide part of its nutritional requirements. These contain chlorophyll and tend to be some shade of brown or green, but in this coral there is an additional photosynthetic pigment, phycoerythrin. In daylight, this absorbs light at one wavelength and transmits it at another, giving a bright orange fluorescence. In aquaria Pavona maldivensis and other species in this genus are kept in reef aquariums where they are said to be easy small stony corals for beginners to care for.

It was founded in August 1895 to \\"cater to industrialists\\" such as Amzi Barber, J. P. Morgan, the Rockefeller brothers, and Cornelius Vanderbilt II. History =Original development= In 1892, Amzi L. Barber bought the property known as \\"Ardsley Towers\\" in Irvington, New York. The property was built by Cyrus W. Field for his son, whose financial difficulties made a sale of the property necessary. Barber developed the property into Ardsley Park and Ardsley Country Club.Oberlin College Archives Barber, a real-estate developer, had the idea that the homes he developed in Ardsley Park would be purchased by members of a neighboring country club. According to the New York Times, \\"this sense of symbiotic interchange between the residents of the surrounding community and the club helped create a cozy, if undeniably exclusionary, enclave.\\" The Ardsley Country Club was founded in August 1895 to cater to industrialists. Original members included Amzi Barber, William and John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt II. Ashbel P. Fitch was a member of the Ardsley Club upon his death in 1904. Founding members also included members of the Gould and Whitney families. According to author and club member Kate Buford, the club was \\"proof that two groups of society - the robber barons and old New York - would blend.\\" As of March 1896, the club's board of governors had 21 members, including John D. Archbold, Amzi Barber, Walston H. Brwn, William L. Bull, Frederick L. Eldridge, Samuel Goodman, Edwin Gould, E. G. Janeway, Cyrus Field Judson, William F. Judson, George H. Mairs, Major O. J. Smith, Philip Schuyler, General Samuel Thomas, John T. Terry, John T. Terry, Jr., Roderick Terry, Henry Villard, Charles C. Worthington, John Brisbain Walker, and Lucien Warner. Among other prominent members at the time were H. Walter Webb and Walter W. Law,. =Founding features= After the club was incorporated in 1895, the Ardsley Casino Clubhouse was finished in the spring of 1896, on a plot of 500 acres overlooking the Hudson River. The clubhouse had sleeping rooms on the upper floors to accommodate forty or fifty members, with several baths and a large swimming tank at 25 feet by 15 feet. The main floor had a large clubroom, card and billiard rooms, and a large dining room. A private railroad station was built below the clubhouse with express trains available. Around 200 trees were felled to allow a clear drive to the property, with many of the logs used to bank up the sides of a golf course. Architect Willie Dunn oversaw all aspects of the golf course's development. Founding attractions included golf, polo, tennis, and space for the anchoring of yachts. It had a pool for swimming. Members would play the new sports of tennis and golf from the beginning, of both genders. According to Buford, the club was set apart from other smaller clubs by \\"a massive, hotel-like clubhouse and spectacular golf course. It was a symbol of the gilded age.\\" Contemporaries included Knollwood in Elmsford, founded a year before Ardsley, and Bonnie Briar in Larchmont. Early on, some members would sail from Manhattan up the Hudson river to dock their yachts in boat slips at the club. The club also arranged it so that the private train at Ardsley-on- Hudson, now Metro-North property, would match the style of the clubhouse. The clubhouse, now a cooperative known as Hudson House, was of a neo-Elizabethan style. In 1898, the club held the opening of the Women's National Golf Championship Tournament. By noon on October 11, around 1,000 persons were present at the match. =Modern years= It became an increasingly family club in the 1930s. Between 1935 and 1965, many of the club's members and their families lived in the nearby Ardsley Park area. In 1935, may of the old furnishings were sold for low prices at auction. The original Ardsley clubhouse and grounds, once assessed at $850,000, was at the time being foreclosed on for a mortgage of $350,000, with the expectation that the clubhouse would be razed and the property used for country homes. By June 1966, it had 60 members under president Edwin L. Sibert Jr. In 1966, three new curling rinks were planned at the Ardsley Country Club. As of 1995, membership of the club played tennis and golf, swam, and attended social events on the same site. It had 450 member families, with president Harvey Appelle.

In recognition of his war service, he was decorated with the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in 1940, invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1945, and admitted to the Royal Company of Archers. Later life After the war Hope had business ties to English Electric Company Ltd., Napier Aero Engines Ltd., and Airwork Ltd. Family General Sir Archibald Hope's Grave, Inveresk Parish Kirkyard In 1938, Hope married Ruth Chamberlain Davis, the daughter of Carl R. Davis of Fryern, Storrington, Sussex. The couple had two sons: Sir John Carl Alexander Hope, 18th Baronet (1939‚Äì2007) and Charles Archibald Hope (born 1945). Hope's mother, Lady Hope, was appointed an OBE in 1920, and served as a Justice of the Peace for Midlothian. Lady Hope made her home at Pinkie House. Hope's sister, Katharine Anne Hope (1916‚Äì1987) was married to Hope's No. 601 Squadron mate, Carl Raymond Davis. A brother, Lieutenant Colonel John Cecil Hope (1913‚Äì1945), served with the 1st Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Military Cross, before he died on 24 April 1945 on active duty in Italy. A second brother, Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Alexander Hope (1914‚Äì1982), also fought in the Second World War with the King's Royal Rifle Corps, being appointed an OBE and awarded the Military Cross, but survived the war. Hope died on 27 July 1987 in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He and his wife are buried in the Hope Baronets' plot at St. Michael's Parish Church, Inveresk, Scotland.

She, her infant son (named by the English as Nutaaq) and an Inuk man named as Kalicho were among the first Inuit and first indigenous people from North America to visit England and among the best documented of the Tudor period. They were brought back to the English port of Bristol at the end of September 1577 and died in November of the same year. Life Arnaq was most likely born in the Frobisher Bay area of Nunavut in the 16th century. The name used for her by her captors is very similar to the Inuit word for \\"woman\\", so her real name is unknown. She and her twelve-month old son, Nutaaq, were amongst four Inuit brought to England against their will by Frobisher. According to the 1578 account of George Best, who accompanied the 1577 expedition, Arnaq was captured with her son on 1 August on the Hall Peninsula near Kodlunarn Island (Countess of Warwick Island),Kodlunarn Island National Historic Site of Canada where the English were mining for what they supposed to be gold ore.The three voyages of Martin Frobisher, in search of a passage to Cathaia and India by the North-west, A.D. 1576-8. Reprinted from the first ed. of Hakluyt's Voyages, with selections from manuscript documents in the British Museum and State Paper Office. By Rear-Admiral Richard Collinson. pp. 141-44 Captain York of the expedition had come across an abandoned Inuit settlement in which he found items of European clothing he assumed came from five members of Frobisher's 1576 expedition who had disappeared further up Frobisher Bay. Captain York sought to capture some of the local Inuit to serve as hostages that could be exchanged for the missing men. However, after a bloody fight in which five or six Inuit men died, they only succeeded in capturing an old woman (who they let go) and Arnaq with her baby. Arnaq was then brought back to the main expedition, where she was introduced to another captive Inuit, Kalicho, later that day. Attempts to arrange a hostage exchange failed and all three of the Inuit were brought back to England when the expedition returned home on 23 August. They arrived at the port of Bristol in England around the end of September. Arnaq was buried as a \\"heathen\\" in St Stephen's Church in Bristol In England the three Inuit attracted considerable interest. Frobisher planned to present them to Queen Elizabeth and seems to have hoped that they might be taught English so that they could reveal more about their country and serve as interpreters on later expeditions.Neil Cheshire, Tony Waldron, Alison Quinn and David Quinn, Frobisher‚Äôs Eskimos in England, Archivaria, 10 (1980), 23-50 The family were taken to the mayor's house, Thomas Colston, and Kalicho performed numerous displays of his kayaking and hunting skills in Bristol harbour around 9 October. Four 'official' paintings were commissioned of Arnaq by Cornelis Ketel, a Flemish artist. Two of these paintings were later given to the Queen and were hung in Hampton Court Palace for many years.Cheshire et al. 'Frobisher's Eskimos', p. 34. These paintings were later lost but paintings by the artist John White survived and were copied many times. Kalicho died on 8 November, as a result of an infection stemming from broken ribs most likely sustained during his capture. After he had been given a post- mortem by Dr. Edward Dodding, Arnaq was obliged to witness his burial at St Stephen's Church in Bristol on 8 November 1577. Dodding commented on what he saw as her stoicism at Kalicho's fate. Dodding's motives for making Arnaq witness the funeral was because he wanted to ensure that Arnaq did not think that the English were cannibals. Dodding showed Arnaq dead human bones to illustrate his point. Shortly after the funeral, Arnaq, became ill from what is thought to be measles. She died within days and was buried on the 12 November at St Stephen's Church. Kalicho and Arnaq were called Collichang and Egnock respectively in the church's burial records. Arnaq's death left Nutaaq an orphan. Nutaaq was given a nurse and taken to London for a prospective audience with Queen Elizabeth. Nutaaq also died, probably from measles. He was buried without record at St Olave's Church. Legacy Arnaq and her son were not the first people from the Americas to visit Europe. Its is estimated that 200 may have visited France in the sixteenth century. However England was behind in transatlantic journeys and only a small number of people from the Americas had visited before Arnaq had arrived. Despite not living long, Arnaq, Nutaaq and Kalicho did become well known due to the pictures drawn of them. The most noted of these are by John White who may have been on Frobisher's 1577 voyage. Another two pictures were commissioned by Queen Elizabeth who was disappointed to have not seen 'Frobisher's Inuit'.Alden T.

He made foundational contributions to the fields of wastewater treatment and applied phycology, or as he called it, \\"algology\\". Throughout a career spanning more than five decades, Oswald was the primary academic advisor to more than two dozen doctoral students, sat on more than 100 additional masters and doctoral thesis committees, and taught seminal courses in applied algology. Early life, military service, and education Oswald was born in King City, California in 1919. He grew up on a ranch in that area, where the arid climate stoked his interest in water supplies, wastewater treatment, and water use. In World War II, he served in the Army Air Forces and was responsible for water safety at one of the D-Day invasion camps. Oswald remained in the Army in Europe after the war, working in a hospital where he cared for patients suffering from waterborne ailments and met his lifelong wife, an American nurse. Returning home to California, he obtained a degree in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1950 on the G.I. Bill. He then continued his studies and was awarded an M.S. (1951) and Ph.D. (1957) in sanitary engineering, biology and public health. Oswald joined the faculty of the university the same year and went on to become a full professor in 1970. He remained in the position his entire career, staying on as an emeritus professor after his retirement. Career Oswald studied the role of algae in wastewater treatment as a student, winning recognition from the American Society of Civil Engineers for his early work. He continued investigating the use of microalgae in sanitation throughout his career, developing strategies for combining engineered algae ponds to obtain specific water treatment goals. He developed the \\"high rate pond system\\" of shallow, mixed raceway ponds to maximize algae productivity. This design is still in use today, responsible for over 90% of the world's commercial microalgae production. His work led to the development of the \\"Advanced Integrated Wastewater Pond System\\", in which wastewater flows through a series of ponds, starting with deeper \\"facultative\\" ponds, then high rate ponds, and finally maturation ponds. The research undertaken by Oswald and his students and collaborators provided the foundations for much of modern microalgae wastewater treatment technology. Wastewater treatment plants based on his designs operate throughout the world today. With broader implications in energy and nutrient cycles, Oswald‚Äôs work often crossed over into related fields such as waste energy recovery, biofuels, animal feeds, and waste nutrient reuse. The Air Force‚Äôs interest in waste and nutrient recycling for long term space missions led to Oswald‚Äôs development of the Algatron‚Äìa device that would grow microalgae on astronaut waste, treating water and also producing oxygen and food. An archive of Oswald's work is maintained by former student and long time collaborator Tryg Lundquist, now a professor of Environmental Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Awards and honors Oswald was recognized throughout his career. He received the Harrison Prescott Eddy Medal in 1953 from the Water Pollution Control Federation (now known as the Water Environment Federation) for describing photosynthetic oxygenation. The American Society of Civil Engineers awarded him both the Rudolf Hering Medal and the James Croes Medal in 1957 for work describing the fixation of nutrients and capture of solar energy by microalgae and the Arthur M. Wellington Award in 1966 for various investigations of life support systems for extended space travel. In 2005 he was awarded the lifetime achievement prize of the International Society for Applied Phycology and in 2006 he was nominated for the Stockholm Water Prize.

It ruled over the Yenisei Kyrgyz people, who had been located in southern Siberia and Central Asia since the 6th century. By the 9th century, the Kyrgyz had asserted dominance over the Uyghurs who had previously ruled. The empire was established as a khaganate from 840‚Äì1207. The khaganate's territory is now part of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia, China and Mongolia. History The earliest records of Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate were written during the Tang dynasty. The Kyrgyz did not keep reliable written records during this period. In 50 BC, Xiongnu leader Zhizhi Chanyu defeated the Dinglings in the north of China. He also conquered the Gyangun country located 7,000 li (4,000 km) west of Ordos ‚Äì the center of his country. During those times, Kyrgyz people lived in the Borohoro Mountains and the Manas River valley on east Tengir-Too. As a result, in Chinese historiography, Kyrgyz Khaganate is assigned the misnomer \\"Gyegyesy\\". They were largely subordinate to the G√∂kt√ºrks from 560s to 700s. Kyrgyz khagan Bars Bek was a brother-in-law to Bilge Khagan. His son ruled Kyrgyzs after Bars Bek's defeated in hands of Qapaghan in 710. After Turkic downfall, they submitted to Uyghurs. Their leader Bayanchur killed the Kyrgyz leader and appointed a new Kyrgyz khagan named Bilge Tong Erkin (ÊØó‰ºΩÈ†ìÈ†°Êñ§). = Relations with China = First embassy to Yenisei Kyrgyz was sent during reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, in 632. He received Kyrgyz ambassador named Shiboqu Azhan (Â§±Èâ¢Â±àÈòøÊ£ß) who was later appointed to the Yanran (ÁáïÁÑ∂) Commandery. The Kyrgyz khagans claimed descent from the Chinese general Li Ling, grandson of the famous Han dynasty general Li Guang. Li Ling was captured by the Xiongnu and defected in the first century BCE. And since the Tang royal Li family also claimed descent from Li Guang, the Kirghiz Khagan was therefore recognized as a member of the Tang Imperial family. This relationship soothed the relationship when Kyrgyz khagan Are (ÈòøÁÜ±) invaded Uyghur Khaganate and put Qasar Qaghan to the sword. The news brought to Chang'an by Kyrgyz ambassador Zhuwu Hesu (Ë®ªÂêæÂêàÁ¥†). In 845, Are khagan was created Zong Yingxiong Wu Chengming Khagan () by Emperor Wuzong. But Wuzong died before his ambassadors departing Chang'an. The new emperor Xuanzong did not rush to create him khagan. At a general council of senior officials, they decided that the titles were given to the Uyghurs when they were strong, and if the Yenisei Kyrgyz were awarded as well, they would become proud and become dangerous. The emperor revoked the letter. After Are's murder by one of his officials in 847, new Kyrgyz khagan was created Yingwu Chengming Khagan (Ëã±Ê≠¶ËØöÊòéÂèØÊ±ó) by Xuanzong, who sent Li Ye (ÊùéÊ•≠) to award him the title.  Downfall  Not much is known on downfall of Yenisei Kyrgyz, but according to Drompp, they were certainly not invaded by Liao dynasty, because the Kyrgyz did not occupy the Mongolian Plateau in the first place. They had conflicts with Qara Khitai and probably submitted to Genghis Khan by 1207/8.

Created in January 2017, the group is currently co-chaired by Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and Tom Reed (R-NY).  History  Writing in The New York Times about the formation of the Caucus, Reed and Gottheimer said: \\"We all knew the partisanship in Washington had gotten out of control and felt the need to create a bipartisan group committed to getting to \\"yes\\" on important issues. We have agreed to vote together for any policy proposal that garners the support of 75 percent of the entire Problem Solvers Caucus, as well as 51 percent of both the Democrats and Republicans in the caucus.\\" The Problem Solvers Caucus developed over time as an outgrowth of informal meetings organized by the political reform group No Labels. = Healthcare reform = During the week of August 4, 2017, the 43-member House Problem Solvers Caucus released a compromise to shore up the struggling insurance exchanges. The proposal focused on the skyrocketing cost of individual health insurance premiums. At the time, the Trump administration considered suspending cost- sharing payments that defray out-of-pocket payments like deductibles and co- payments, a move which insurers said could cause premiums to rise by 15 percent or more. The second part of the Problem Solvers plan would have provided relief to help states deal with the high cost of pre-existing and chronic conditions. The relief is provided through a dedicated stability fund that states could use to reduce premiums and limit losses for providing coverage for these high-cost patients. The third part of the plan provides relief to certain businesses from the mandate that they provide insurance to full-time employees. It also defines \\"full time\\" as a 40-hour workweek to discourage businesses from manipulating employees‚Äô weekly hours to skirt the mandate. The plan would have also eliminated the Medical Device Tax, an excise charge of 2.3 percent that is often passed onto consumers and reduces funds for research and development.

It will be part of the A2 motorway, in Serbia more often called Corridor XI. Preparatory works on the bridge began on 12 February 2017 and it was ceremonially opened, with the adjoining Obrenovac- Surƒçin section of the motorway, on 17 December 2019.  Location  On Obrenovac side, the bridge is located west of the town itself and just north of Bariƒç. On Surƒçin side, it crosses into the uninhabited area of Boljevci, southeast of the village.  Construction  Preparatory works began on 12 February 2017. Ceremony marking the official beginning of the construction, attended by the Minister of Construction, Zorana Mihajloviƒá, was held on 23 May 2017. The construction of the long Surƒçin-Obrenovac section of the A2 motorway began on 1 March 2017, and both the motorway and the bridge, should be finished by the end of 2019. By August 2017 all 252 piles projected on the ground section were finished and the construction of the piles for the main beam across the Sava, from the Obrenovac direction, began. Construction of the body of the bridge should began by the end of 2017. In October 2018 it was announced that the bridge will be open for the pedestrians in April-May 2019. The opening of the completely finished bridge was set for 5 January 2020. It was also stated that the Surƒçin-Obrenovac motorway itself, without which the bridge has no purpose, will be finished by the end of 2020 or early 2021, and not at the beginning of 2020, as previously stated. Beginning of the construction of the final, long Surƒçin-New Belgrade section, which will connect the motorway and the bridge directly with Belgrade, was announced for 2019. The construction company which builds the bridge is the CCCC, China Communications Construction. In August 2019, section of the A2 motorway below Obrenovac was opened for traffic and named \\"Milo≈° Veliki\\". Section of the motorway which should connect the bridge to it, on both sides, wasn't finished and after numerous changes it was announced that the new price will be ‚Ç¨9 million per km, which is deemed way to much by the experts, as the road is being constructed in the low, flat, non-urbanized area. As the access to the opened section of the motorway from the Belgrade direction wasn't done properly, this caused traffic collapses and long traffic jams. Authorities claim that the traffic will be relieved when the remaining part of the motorway, including the bridge, will be finished and functional, by the end of 2019. The bridge was ceremonially opened on 17 December 2019, jointly with the adjoining section of the Obrenovac-Surƒçin motorway. That way, the bridge was connected with the motorways on both sides. Despite the claims that the construction of the access roads was without any problems, the fact that the terrain was easy for the construction and that work was finished almost a month before deadline, the total price of the bridge motorway grew to ‚Ç¨12 million per km in the end.  Characteristics  The length of the future bridge, which spans two rivers, Kolubara (near its mouth into the Sava) and Sava, was variously reported as , and . of concrete will be built into the bridge.

He has investigated production of melt from the Earth's interior and the chemical consequences of the return of solidified melts to depth via the plate tectonic cycle. In particular, he has assessed elemental fluxes from descending plates and has highlighted how the rise of atmospheric oxygen has been remarkably recorded in the isotopic composition of the deep, solid Earth. His recent focus on planetary growth has identified the rapid formation of metallic cores, how bulk chemistry is notably modified during early accretion and distinctively embellished in its terminal stages. =Awards and honours= Elliot was awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London in 2017 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2017.

It is run by the government-controlled Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and trains pastors and evangelists for it. Founded in 1901 as the Pyongyang Chosun Jesus Presbyterian Seminary, the seminary has historically been associated with Presbyterianism. It became the center of Korean Christianity of the early 20th century. By 1916 its founder Samuel Austin Moffett was in disagreement over practical matters with another teacher, James Scarth Gale. The row developed into a schism on doctrinal matters and in 1959 the seminary split into the conservative Chongshin University and the liberal Presbyterian College and Theological Seminary. In 1938, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, the seminary had been temporarily closed down after students defied orders to bow to Shinto shrines. After the division of Korea, the seminary was relocated to Seoul in South Korea and renamed the Presbyterian Theological Seminary. The Pyongyang-based seminary resumed operations in 1972 after having been assumed by the KCF. When its funds ran out in 1995, the Korean Methodist Church (KMC) of South Korea assumed a share of its financial responsibilities. History =Presbyterian roots= Originally called the Pyongyang Chosun Jesus Presbyterian Seminary, it was founded in 1901 by Samuel Austin Moffett, the father of Samuel H. Moffett. Samuel Austin was motivated to found the seminary in Pyongyang because the city had been badly damaged in the First Sino- Japanese War. Initially, the seminary would consist of two years of preparatory courses and the actual seminary lasting three years. In the beginning, Samuel Austin taught his students at home. He was its first president until 1918 and a faculty member until 1935. The Seminary was the center of Korean Christianity of the early 20th century. In 1905 the seminary became affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in the United States. The first class graduated in 1907. A building was constructed in 1909 and renewed in 1922. By 1916 Moffett was in disagreement with a teacher at the school, James Scarth Gale. Their differences concerning the quality of teaching, materials, and admission would develop into a schism between conservatives and liberals. Initially, the seminary remained conservative and mission-oriented. The seminary was temporarily closed in 1938 following the Japanese occupation of Korea. The Japanese occupiers demanded that students of the seminary would bow to Shinto shrines, something that they could not agree to. Until 1940, the seminary had been the only seminary in Korea maintained by the Presbyterian Church. After the division of Korea, the seminary was relocated to Seoul in South Korea in 1948 and renamed the Presbyterian Theological Seminary. In 1959 the seminary finally split due to the doctrinal differences into the conservative Chongshin University and the more moderate Presbyterian College and Theological Seminary. =Under government control= In 1972, the seminary was reopened and assumed by the government-controlled Protestant body Korean Christian Federation (KCF). The seminary operated under KCF until 1995 when it ran out of funds. In April 1999, the Korean Methodist Church (KMC) of South Korea offered to fund the seminary to secure the continuation of its operation. KMC bid $600,000 to provide funding for three years. It reopened in 2000, and a new building was completed in 2003. Operation The Seminary is run by the KCF, which chooses its students and devises its curriculum. KMC, however, is consulted each semester. The seminary is located in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. The seminary trains pastors and evangelists for the KCF.

She was one of the delegates to the 1977 National Women's Conference, a major U.S. women's conference held in conjunction with the International Women's Year celebrations of the United Nations. In 2012, her name was inscribed on an arch recognizing women who were Native American leaders at the University of Arizona. Early life Vera Brown was born on May 23, 1924 at the Indian Reservation of Camp Verde, Arizona to Mary and Sam Brown, members of the Mojave-Apache. She was the youngest of three siblings. Her father was a miner, working in the United Verde Mine near Jerome, Arizona and the smelters in Clarkdale and Clemenceau. Until she was school age, the family lived in a wickiup near Clarkdale. She attended the segregated public school in Clarkdale, which allowed whites to attend in the mornings and Hispanics and American Indians to attend afternoon classes and though she was placed in the morning session, she remembered experiencing discrimination and did not speak English. When she was eleven, her father died on April 19, 1935, from silicosis, having worked the mines without any protective respiratory equipment. She was sent to the Valentine Indian School under the American Indian boarding school program and graduated from the Indian High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Though she earned a scholarship to the University of New Mexico, Brown returned to Carkdale to care for her mother because the pension her father earned had ended after one year and her mother was denied social security. After World War II, Brown married Antonio L. Moreno (1924‚Äì1968), a veteran and miner, from Clarkdale. The couple originally made their home in Jerome, where their children Anthony Jr. (1948‚Äì2009) and Petra (1949‚Äì2011) were born. In 1949, they moved to Ajo, where Antonio worked at the Phelps-Dodge smelter. Tribral council career In 1967, against her mother's recommendation, Moreno decided to run for a seat on the tribal council of the Yavapai-Apache Nation. After her husband's death in 1968, Moreno remarried with Henry Starr. She was successful in attaining a seat in 1969 and served for six years, before becoming the first woman to serve as the Tribal Chair in 1975. After serving two-years as Tribal Chair, the 1977 election was fraught with factionalism, causing a contested election, a court battle, and finally a new vote. Starr did not win her re-election bid as Chair. Starr joined the North American Indian Women's Association (NAIWA), an organization formed to foster inter-tribal betterment for Native Americans. In 1977, she attended the National Women's Conference, which was held in conjunction with the United Nations' International Women's Year celebrations. As one of Arizona's four Native American delegates, of specific interest to her were the anti-discrimination resolution passed by the women which addressed minority rights, including the removal of American Indian children from their homes and tribes, as well as the discussion of the failure of Arizona to pass Medicaid legislation to provide health care to low-income families. Though defeated in her bid for re-election to the chair, Starr continued to serve on the council, being returned in 1978 as a council member. In 1981, she was elected as treasurer of the tribe and held that post until her election as vice chair of the tribe in 1982. She returned as vice chair in 1983. Issues on which she focused during her time on the council were those that would improve the lives of tribe members. She advocated for improved housing, health care initiatives, and protection of water rights. Death and legacy Starr died on March 4, 1985 in Cottonwood, Arizona at the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Hospital. Posthumously, her name was inscribed in 2011 on the Native American Women of Arizona Arch on the University of Arizona campus, after having been selected to represent their tribe by the Yavapai-Apache Nation.

He was the Director of the Baroda Museum & Picture Gallery, and the Director of history of art at the Heidelberg University's S√ºdasien- Institut (South Asia Institute). Early life Goetz was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, on 17 July 1898, and was educated at the Real-gymnasium in Munich. He served in the Germany military during the World War I. Early in his career, during the World War I, Goetz was mainly interested in the Ottoman Turks. Later, he became interested in Iran (Persia), and subsequently, in the Persianate Mughal Empire of India. His work on the Indian art history started with the studies of the Mughal miniature painting. The map collection of the Berlin State Library included the \\"Jahangir album\\", a collection of Mughal-era paintings. Goetz studied this collection in detail, using his knowledge of figurative art, ethnography, and history. In the 1920s, Goetz obtained a doctorate from the Munich University. The title of his thesis was Kost√ºm und Mode an den indischen F√ºrstenh√∂fen in der Grossmoghul-Zeit (\\"Costume and fashion at the Indian princely courts in the Great Mughal period\\"). He then joined the Ethnological Museum of Berlin as an assistant curator. In 1931, when the German Weimar Republic was declining amid the Great Depression, Goetz migrated to the Netherlands. There, he became the assistant secretary of Leiden University's Kern Institute for Archaeology and Indian History, and the editor of Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology. His superior Jean Philippe Vogel, a reputed Indologist, became his mentor and Goetz started pursuing India-related research. At that time, there was a flood of foreign refugees in the Netherlands, and consequently, certain restrictions had been imposed on the employment of foreigners. As a result, Goetz was unable to take up a permanent position at the Leiden University. Under these circumstances, he decided to accept a grant to work in British India. In India Baroda Museum Hermann Goetz and his wife Annemarie moved to India in 1936. Goetz spent a substantial time studying the art of ancient and medieval India. In 1939, the Baroda State's ruler Sayajirao Gaekwad III appointed him as the Director of Baroda Museum & Picture Gallery. Goetz was opposed to the Nazi regime of Germany. Despite this, when the World War II broke out, he was interned by the British administration of India because of his German nationality. During this internment, he spent time consolidating his research. After the war ended, he published a large number of works. Goetz worked at the Baroda Museum until 1953. During this time, he also established the journal Bulletin of the Baroda State Museum And Picture Gallery in 1942, and remained its editor until 1954. He help set up a Department of Museology at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, and served a professor of art history there. Subsequently, he moved from Baroda to New Delhi, where he became the Director of the National Gallery of Modern Art. Over the next two years, he reorganized the Gallery. Back in Germany After having spent 19 years in India, Goetz contracted a tropical disease. Because of this, he decided to move back to Germany in 1955. There, he organized several displays and exhibitions of Indian art, and gave lectures on related topics. He returned to India in 1958 and then again in 1960-61. During these shorter stays in India, he organized another museum at Baroda. In 1961, he moved back to Germany permanently. In Germany, Goetz became a professor of Oriental Art at the Heidelberg University's S√ºdasien-Institut (South Asia Institute). He later served as the Director of history of art at the Institute. He visited India in 1971 to receive the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for his work on Indian art. By his 75th birthday, Goetz had 383 published works, which included 32 books. In addition, he had written over 100 book reviews. He died on 8 July 1976.

It was one of the precursors of the Liberian Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU). 1951 foundation and 1954 re-foundation LCL was founded as the first trade union centre in the country in 1951, but the organization soon became defunct. LCL was re-founded in February 1954, with Leroy Francis, a West Indian, playing a leading role. As of mid-1955 LCL had five affiliates: the General Workers' Union, the Dock Workers' Union, the Mine Workers' Union, the Railroad Workers' Union, and the Rubber Workers' Union. LCL claimed to have 50,000 members, although more conservative estimates put the number of due-paying members at around 1,000. Outside of Monrovia LCL established branches at Greenville, Sinoe County and Bomi Hills. 1955 strikes In 1955 the LCL-affiliated GWU organized a strike of road construction workers, demanding increase in wages. Negotiations lasted for 8 weeks. The Liberian government took part in facilitating negotiations with the road construction company. Another 1955 strike, a strike at the Bomi Hills Mining Company, was put down by military police. The union leaders were jailed, and LCL went defunct. 1958 re-foundation LCL was once again re-founded in 1958 by T. Dupigny-Leigh (Social Secretary in the Liberian government). Like the previous Labor Union of Liberia, LCL under Dupigny-Leigh was backed up by the Liberian government. LCL was led by William V.S. Tubman, Jr., the son of the Liberian president William Tubman. Union fees of LCL went directly to the governing True Whig Party. LCL was affiliated to ICFTU. 1959 split In 1959 LCL underwent a split, and the break-away Congress of Industrial Organizations was formed. The split begun when the independent-minded Monrovia mechanics union moved away from the pro-government LCL. LCL was divided into the Leigh group (favoring close relations with the government) and the McGill group (favoring independent unions). Later period LCL became largely defunct after the split. CIO overtook the membership in ICFTU. As of 1964 LCL was estimated to have around 1,000 members. As of the mid-1960s LCL reportedly had only one affiliated union, maintaining a presence amongst dock workers. In 1977 President William R. Tolbert Jr. urged the different trade union centres to unite into a single body. The Liberian Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU) was founded, re-uniting LCL and CIO.

It is the 39th Anglican province, created in a ceremony that took place in All Saints Cathedral, Khartoum, on 30 July 2017. The first archbishop and primate is Ezekiel Kondo. History The entire country of Sudan comprised the Province of the Episcopal Church of Sudan, created in 1976. After the secession of South Sudan, in 2011, it was decided to create an internal (or metropolitical) province comprising the dioceses of Sudan, but to maintain the overall unity of the church across Sudan and South Sudan, at the General Synod, in November 2013. The Internal Province of the Episcopal Church of Sudan was created, comprising the 5 dioceses situated in Northern Sudan. Ezekiel Kondo, the Bishop of Khartoum, was elected the first archbishop on 4 April 2014. Many in Sudan believed that this internal province should be given full autonomy as a new Anglican province, with the expectation that the metropolitan archbishop would become archbishop and primate. In 2016 a formal application was made to the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) for the internal province of Sudan to be granted autonomy. In July 2016 a team led by the archbishop of Adelaide and the vice chairman of the ACC carried out a fact-finding mission in northern Sudan. This team reported back to the ACC to enable a formal response to the application for autonomy.Report on visiting team at ACNS. In March 2017 it was announced that the ACC had decided that the internal province of Sudan would become the 39th province of the Anglican Communion, with Ezekiel Kondo, Archbishop of Khartoum, as the first archbishop and primate. The constitution of the new province took place on 30 July 2017, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Membership There are approximately 1,000,000 Anglicans in Sudan.

Ophelia's father, an international sword expert, has temporarily moved Ophelia and her older sister Alice to an unnamed northern European city where he is curating an important museum exhibit. The head curator at the museum is Miss Kaminski, a beautiful woman with blonde hair who often wears white clothing. However, she is cold and unkind to Ophelia. While her father is working on the exhibit, Ophelia is mostly left alone to wander through the mysterious old museum. One day, she finds a small room with a faded mural of a boy with a sword, captioned \\"The Marvelous Boy.\\" Hidden in the mural is a small door and when Ophelia peers through the keyhole, she discovers that someone is looking back at her from the other side of the door. The boy on the other side of the door tells Ophelia that he was sent from another world, centuries ago, to defeat the Snow Queen, but that she imprisoned him, instead. The boy's name was taken from him by a group of wizards so that it could not be used against him and he was put under a spell of protection that magically extended his life, but the spell is about to wear off and the Snow Queen will be able to kill him when it does. The boy tells Ophelia that she must complete a number of tasks, including finding the key that unlocks his door and finding a sword that can kill the Snow Queen. Ophelia sets out to complete these tasks without being caught by Miss Kaminski or the museum guards. As she begins to complete the tasks, she hears her dead mother's voice offering her advice and encouragement. Meanwhile, Alice begins to admire Miss Kaminski's beauty and fashion sense and begins dressing and acting more like her. Ophelia discovers that Miss Kaminski is the actually Snow Queen in disguise.

Ophelia finds the key to the boy's door, but discovers that he is partly transparent and in danger of disappearing, entirely. The snow queen finds him and leaves him outside, where he almost dies. Ophelia and the boy are chased by wolves. Ophelia finds the sword and kills the Snow Queen. The boy tells Ophelia that he is going to return to land and the town where he grew up and he fades away, his mission completed. Ophelia, her father, and her sister return home. Major themes Navigating loss and grief are major themes in this novel, with Ophelia having lost her mother and the boy having lost everything he ever knew, including his name. On the subject, Foxlee has said \\"Grief is devastating, but it can also give you the chance to change your destiny.\\" Background This story began with the idea of a boy imprisoned in a museum. The characters of Ophelia and the Snow Queen were added to the story later. Foxlee had grown up listening to Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales as a child and she was fascinated by the Snow Queen as a villain. She also felt a connection to the Nordic setting of the original fairy tale because her grandparents had emigrated from Finland to Australia. The museum in the novel was inspired by many different museums, including the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Reception Ophelia and the Magical Boy received starred reviews in Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, Booklist, The Bulletin, and School Library Journal. Publishers Weekly described the writing as \\"elegant and accessible, with a pervading melancholy.\\" Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"A well-wrought, poignant and original reworking of Andersen's 'The Snow Queen.'\\" It was also included on the \\"Best Books of 2014\\" lists from Publishers Weekly and School Library Journal, and on the \\"Best Children's Books of 2014\\" list from the Wall Street Journal.

Overview Historian Susan Rimby, who holds a Ph.D. in United States history from the University of Pittsburgh, began researching the book in 2001 while serving as Scholar-in-Residency at the Pennsylvania State Archives. Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania's Center for Faculty Excellence in Scholarship and Teaching assisted her research travels for this book with two grants. Rimby is currently a Founding Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Education at Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. Mira Lloyd Dock (1853‚Äì1945) was at the forefront of the Progressive Era environmental and conservation movement, and in 1901 became the first woman to serve on the Pennsylvania Forest Commission or any public forest commission. Rimby begins by stating her case on why Dock's story is relevant, framed against the background of late 19th century and early 20th century emergence of civic activism in the fields of conservation and ecology. As Dock began to receive public and institutional support for her horticulture lectures, she was elected to represent Pennsylvania at the International Congress of Women to be held that summer in London. The author weaves Dock's accomplishments around her eagerness to constantly ingest more knowledge, such as her month-long tour of Germany's forests made possible by botanist Dietrich Brandis. Rimby follows Dock's decades-long career toward the conclusion of Dock's legacies that remain today. Reception Kevin C. Armitage of Miami University of Ohio, in reviewing the book for the Ohio Valley History journal, noted that Rimby meticulously provided an historical framework for Dock's life that made the connection between women's suffrage, civic activism and environmental conservation. He stated that the book should inspire more scholarly output on gender's role in environmental activism. The H-Net review by Jessica DeWitt noted that the book was light-weight on documenting the conservation movement. But otherwise, DeWitt wrote that the book's strengths were in presenting Dock's story well-framed within the historical, environmental and social times in which she lived. Goodreads gave the book four stars out of five, and said the book created a \\"a vivid and accessible picture of Progressive Era conservation in the eastern United States and Dock's important role and legacy in that movement.\\" Detailed release information * References External links * * Category:Books about women Category:Forestry ","title":"Mira Lloyd Dock and the Progressive Era Conservation Movement"},{"id":"54870605","title":"Una Kang Naging Akin (film)"},{"id":"54870606","text":"Florian Pick (born 8 September 1995) is a German professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for 1.

It was then composed of church and belfry, a dormitory, a chamber with two cellars, a cemetery, two orchards, and two parks or gardens containing two acres. St Dominic's was granted to Walter Fleming in 1543-4. In 1756 there were five fathers attached to the convent of by 1800 there was only one.

The hospital is located in the Belmont neighborhood of The Bronx in New York City. The hospital is a level 2 adult trauma center.  History  St Barnabas Hospital, originally known as the Home for the Incurables, was founded in 1866 by Reverend Washington Rodman, of the Grace Episcopal Church in West Farms, Bronx. The hospital became the first chronic disease hospital and was housed in a modest frame house and could serve 33 patients. The hospital moved to its present location on Third Avenue in 1874 where by 1911 it could accommodate 300 beds. Support for the non-profit hospital came from New York Society including Cornelius Vanderbilt (who served on the hospital's Board of Managers), John Jacob Astor, Theodore Roosevelt and Frederick Law Olmsted. Between 1926 and 1931, the hospital added three new buildings to the hospital and in 1947, the hospital changed its name to St Barnabas Hospital. In 1969, St Barnabas broke ground for a six-story West Wing with 188 beds, a cafeteria and kitchen. St Barnabas Nursing Home was founded in 1972, and is located on the hospital's campus at 2175 Quarry Rd. In 1983, Dr. Ronald Gade was promoted to the hospital's president from head of radiology and worked to make the hospital more efficient in its care of patients. He reduced the staff size, discouraged long hospital stays, and greatly increased income from Medicaid due to improvements. His implementations at St Barnabas challenged the medical establishment by creating a managed-care revolution in American medicine. By the late 1990s, the hospital won two city contracts worth almost $450 million, one to provide doctors for Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx, the other to care for prisoners on Rikers Island. In the 1990s, the hospital received state designation as a Level 2 Trauma Center and created an AIDS Center and Stroke Center. In 2016, the hospital became the primary clinical affiliate of the CUNY School of Medicine and the program was designed to recruit underrepresented minorities into medicine, increase medical care in underserved communities, and boost the number of primary care physicians. In addition, the hospital is a clinical affiliate to the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

Biography Margaret Mary Plues was born in Ripon, Yorkshire, to the Rev. William Plues and Hannah (Swire) Plues.

In her early twenties, she published books for the general public on her botanical collecting trips, with titles beginning Rambles in Search of.... Plues was writing in an era when books popularizing science were taking off as a genre, and her work compares to that being done by such authors as Phoebe Lankester and Elizabeth and Mary Kirby. Plues later wrote more scientific volumes on British ferns and grasses that covered such topics as geographic distribution, structure, propagation and cultivation, and diseases. She also published some novels and stories, most of them under the pseudonym Skelton Yorke. In 1866 she converted to Roman Catholicism, and in the 1870s she moved to London, where she was put in charge of a workhouse recently founded by Monsignor Thomas John Capel. Bad with finances, he borrowed from Plues, thereby ruining her when he himself went bankrupt. By 1885, Plues was in charge of a women's home elsewhere in London.

It can happen when the infant is put back onto breast-feeding. Nipple confusion can turn into nipple refusal in which the infant refuses both the bottle and breastfeeding. Preventing nipple confusion requires avoiding bottles and pacifiers for the first few weeks after birth. An infant that is used to feeding at the breast and gets switched to a bottle cannot use the same technique as latching on to the breast. An infant who gets used to nipple on a bottle and fast-flowing milk can have trouble making the transition. Nipple confusion or nipple preference may occur when an infant switches from the breast to an artificial feeding method before the proper breastfeeding routine is established. Young infants who are exposed to artificial teats or bottle nipples might find the switch back and forth from bottle to breast a little tricky as the feeding mechanism of both breasts and bottle differ. An infant learns to feed on different nipples differently.  Causes  How an infant feeds from the breast to bottle differs. A breastfed infant regulates the suction required for the flow of milk from the breast by using small pauses to breathe and to swallow. On the other hand, for a bottle-fed infant, they do not have to create suction as the flow from the bottle allows for a continuous flow. When switched back to the breast, the infant faces sudden confusion regarding the lack of continuous flow that they got adapted to. Bottle-feeding requires no serious effort whereas breastfeeding demands the usage of at least 40 muscles in the infant‚Äôs face. This could make it difficult for the infant to latch efficiently and be breastfed well after being fed from the bottle.  Prevention  If the parent does not wait for the infant to perfect their breastfeeding skill, there is a risk the infant might give up breastfeeding sooner than preferred. While some infants easily go back and forth from bottle to breast, not all infants find this constant transitioning easy. However, infants are born with strong instincts to get breastfed. With patience and practice, the infant can be soothed into good feeding habits. Since there is no way to predict whether an infant might face nipple confusion, the use of a bottle or pacifier should be delayed, at least until the infant is four weeks old. This allows the infant to get used to breastfeeding at an early stage. Breastfeeding is advocated for the first two to three weeks. It is important that the infant is latching on well and that the breast milk reserve is well established. In case giving supplements to the infant is medically necessary, they can be given in ways that do not involve artificial nipples. Nipple confusion can result in sub optimal nutrition for the infant and using artificial nipples is discouraged by the World Health Organization. The American College of Paediatrics recommends the use of pacifiers to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. This, however, conflicts with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation to discourage the use of artificial nipples because it may cause nipple confusion and then inadequate nutrition.  \\"Un-confusing\\" the infant  For getting the infant habituated, what is recommended is breastfeeding only when the infant is calm, not switching the infant back to the breast when they are extremely hungry, and more skin-to-skin contact (during breast-feeding) would help reacquaint them. For some special instances, the usage of a nipple shield can be considered to lure the infant back to breastfeeding. To switch to a bottle, a slow-flow nipple is recommended so that the infant has time to adapt to the new technique of feeding. A bottle system that imitates the natural breastfeeding motions of the infant makes the transition of bottle to breast easier. A parent can provide instant gratification to the infant by making it easier for them to feed from the breast. This can be done manually or by pumping your breast milk before the feeding starts, so the process of breastfeeding is a little less hard. Parents facing difficulties can consider a Lactation Consultant or advice from their paediatrician.

Antonije was born into the Serbian Sokoloviƒá family that gained prominence during the course of the 16th century. Its Christian branch gave several Serbian Patriarchs and Metropolitans, while a second branch (which converted to Islam) gave several viziers of the Ottoman Empire, including the Grand Vizier Mehmed Sokoloviƒá (1565‚Äì1579). During the patriarchal tenure of his uncle Makarije I (1557‚Äì1571), Antonije became Metropolitan of Herzegovina. In 1571, the old patriarch fell ill and convoked a church synod in the Banja Monastery near the city of Priboj. There he relinquished his throne, and Metropolitan Antonije was elected his successor and new Serbian Patriarch. He lived in the Patriarchal Monastery of Peƒá. In that time, western eparchies of the Serbian Patriarchate were affected by the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1570‚Äì1573) and massive demographic migrations.

Unusually, their lyrics are exclusively in Low German, a minority Germanic language of northern Germany and the eastern Netherlands. History De fofftig Penns was founded in 2003, purely for fun, by three schoolfriends from , a district of the port city of Bremen in north-west Germany. They were Malte Battefeld (\\"Riemelmeester Malde\\"), Jakob K√∂hler (\\"Kommodige Jaykopp\\") and Torben Otten (\\"Plietsche Torb√§n\\"). Until near the end of their schooldays, they knew hardly any Low German at all. They chose the name as a tongue-in-cheek tribute to American rapper 50 Cent; their first song was a parody of his song \\"P.I.M.P.\\". They were attracted by the idea of performing in a modern musical genre using a dialect most often associated with their grandparents' generation. Jaykopp has said that their first song was not free of linguistic mistakes, but that after a while they all learned to speak good Low German. His grandmother was delighted that they had learned how to chat with their grandparents in their native tongue. Torb√§n's grandmother has even attended one of the band's more recent concerts; but left rapidly, because it was too loud. The band broke up after its members graduated from school, but reformed in 2007. They began to perform live in 2009, as a supporting act for other bands in northern Germany. In October 2009, they competed as the representatives for Low German at Liet International, a music competition for the regional and minority languages of Europe, where they placed eighth but attracted favourable critical attention. In early 2010, they began to tour as a headline act. In August and September 2010, they performed live at seven schools in northern Germany, on the invitation of the . Jaykopp said that the band had to get out of bed at the same time as the schoolkids so that they could carry out soundchecks at 8 AM - but that when they saw the kids dancing on tables at 10 AM, they knew that the kids were now awake. The band represented the German state of Bremen in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2013 with their song \\"L√∂ppt\\" (English: \\"It Works\\"), where they placed seventh. For inspiration, they largely rely on songs by better-known musicians; such as , Egotronic, Mediengruppe Telekommander, Saalschutz and . Their 2016 song \\"An de Nordseek√ºste\\" is a version of the 1985 song \\"An der Nordseek√ºste\\" by - with backing vocals in Low German by the original performers.

Set in an alternate history 1920s Europe, in Scythe players control factions which produce resources, build economic infrastructure, and use giant dieselpunk war machines called mechs to fight and control territory. Players take up to two actions per turn using unique player boards, with the game proceeding until one player has achieved six achievements, at which point the players receive coins for their achievements and territories controlled, with the player with the most coins winning. The game was originally released via Kickstarter, raising over $1.8 million. Scythe received very positive reviews, with particularly strong praise for the game's artwork, which was produced by Polish painter Jakub R√≥≈ºalski under the name World of 1920+. As of 2020, Scythe is ranked 11th among all board games on BoardGameGeek. The 1920+ universe is also featured in the video game Iron Harvest planned for release in September 2020.  Gameplay  In Scythe, players represent different factions in an alternate history 1920s Europe recovering from a great war, where each faction is seeking its fortune. Players build an economic engine by choosing one of four main actions each turn, listed on the top of their personal player board, which cannot be the same as the main action they selected in their previous turn. They can also take a corresponding second action listed on their player board. These actions allow them to move units on the board, trade for or produce goods, bolster their military, deploy mechs, enlist recruits for continuous bonuses, build structures, and upgrade their actions to make them stronger or cheaper. Each player has six stars that they will place on the board upon completion of certain goals, such as deploying all four of their mechs. When one player has deployed all their stars, the game immediately ends, with each star and territory controlled granting a certain amount of money depending on how much popularity the player has achieved during the game. The player who has the most money is the winner.  Release and reception  Scythe was initially sold via Kickstarter, with backers contributing over $1.8 million during the campaign. It was delivered to backers in July 2016 and released in retail stores the following month. Scythe won 5 Golden Geek awards for 2016 from BoardGameGeek, winning for Board Game of the Year, Artwork & Presentation, Strategy Game, and Solo Game, and placing as a runner-up for Most Innovative. Scythe also won the Origins award for 2016 board game of the year. The game was featured as one of Geek and Sundry's best board games of 2016, with reviewer Charlie Theel saying that \\"Scythe is a fantastic design that will not soon be forgotten.\\" Popular Mechanics also dubbed Scythe \\"the best game of 2016.\\" Scythe's artwork has received exceptional praise from reviewers for its images of agrarian life juxtaposed with giant war machines. Scythe: The Wind Gambit won a Golden Geek award for the best expansion to a game in 2017. Scythe: The Rise of Fenris is the best received expansion by critics, for its introduction of a cooperative mode, a campaign mode and 8 modules that can be combined or played independently. Scythe is rated as one of the top ten board games of all time at Board Game Geek.  Expansions and digital edition  The first expansion, Scythe: Invaders From Afar, was released in July 2017, adding two new factions to the game and increasing the maximum player count from 5 to 7. The second expansion, Scythe: The Wind Gambit, was released in December 2017, adding airships and variable end-game conditions to the game. The third and final expansion, titled The Rise of Fenris and released in the third quarter of 2018, added an 8 game campaign with 11 modules that can be used in different combinations, as well as a cooperative play mode. Asmodee Digital released Scythe: Digital Edition via Steam in September 2018. In December 2018, Stonemaier Games released Scythe Encounters, a mini-expansion containing 32 promotional encounter cards, many of which were created from fan submissions.

The estate was created in 1774 but the current, Neo-Gothica main building is from 1876. History =J√∏rgen Wichfeld Christopher Sch√∏ller B√ºlow= J√∏rgen Wichfeld The entire island of M√∏n was up until the second half of the 18th century crown land. Nordfeld is one of many manor houses in eastern Denmark that was created when Frederick V and later Christian VII began to sell off crown land as part of the agricultural reforms of the time. The intension was to sell the land to the local tenant farmers but Count Conrad Holck and Tyge Thygesen, who were put in charge of the sale, were opposed to the reforms. They divided M√∏n into five large estates which were sold in auction in 1770. The local farmers showed up in large numbers at the auction to buy the entire island but only managed to buy three of the estates due to a requirement that guarantees for the payment should be provided the following morning at 10 am at the latest. Nordfeld was therefore not sold until a new auction was held in March 1774. After Johan Friedrich Struense's progressive government had been replaced by a more conservative one, it was no longer possible for farmers to buy manors and Nordfeld was instead acquired by J√∏rgen Wichfeld. He immediately constructed a new manor house on the land. =Peder S√∏lling and Christopher Sch√∏ller B√ºlow= Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg:Scene from Nordfeldt Manor on M√∏n In 1787, Wichfeld sold Nordfeld to Peder S√∏lling. He sold many of the farms to the tenant farmers before selling Nordfeld to Christopher Sch√∏ller B√ºlow in 1806. He was already the owner of several other manors and had embarked on a promising career as civil servant but experienced economic difficulties during the agricultural crisis of the 1810s and went bankrupt in 1820. He fled the country after being indicted for embezzlement with public funds and was sentenced to prison in 1821. =The Danneskiold- Sams√∏e family= The new main building from 1876 Nordfeld was sold to Christian Conrad, Count of Danneskiold-Sams√∏e. In 1823, he passed it on to his youngest son, Otto Danneskiold-Sams√∏e, who was director of the Royal Danish Mail Services. He constructed a new main building. After Otto Danneskiold- Sams√∏e's death in 1894, Nordfeld was passed on to his son Christian Conrad Sophus Danneskiold-Sams√∏e who became known as the \\"theatre count\\" after being appointed to director of the Royal Danish Theatre later that same year. After his death in 1908, Nordfeld was passed on first to his widow Wanda Danneskiold-Sams√∏e and then his son Viggo Danneskiold-Sams√∏e who became the last member of the family to own the estate. Architecture The current main building was built by Frederik Wilsbech for Otto Danneskjold-Sams√∏e in 1774-76\\\\. It is a one-story red brick building in Gothic Revival style with Crow-stepped gables. On each side of the building is a three-bay central projection tipped by a Crow-stepped gable. The central projection on the front side contains the main entrance while the one on the rear side features as large ceranda overlooking the garden. The central projection is flanked by two crow-stepped gable dormers on both sides of the building. Ro, the south of the main building, is a complex of buildings: Avlsg√•rden (farm building) consists of four one-story buildings in red brick with details in yellow brick and red- painted timber, arched windows and tin roofs, Forvalterboligen (manager's house) is a one-story red brick building on a stone foundation. It has a red tile roof with three chimneys, Herskabsstalden (stables) is also a one-story brick building. It has a slate roof. A tall gabled dormer opens to the jayloft. A brick cornice runs below the roof. A total of 11 individual buildings have been listed. They include the main building, the four-winged complex of farm buildings, the farm manager's house with the stables and outbuilding and the gardener's house with another outbuilding. Today Nordfeld is today owned by Jens Krarup Haubroe. The estate covers a total area of 1,151 hectares.
