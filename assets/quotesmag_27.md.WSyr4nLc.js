Aganirsen is a candidate for the treatment of ocular neovascularization in patients suffering from front of the eye (cornea) or back of the eye (retinal) diseases, including progressive corneal neovascularization in patients suffering from infectious keratitis and wet age related macular degeneration (AMD). Aganirsen actively inhibits the production of IRS-1 by binding IRS-1 mRNA (antisense therapy). Aganirsen therefore induces an upstream inhibition of the neovascularization pathway, most notably by inhibiting excess VEGF and Il-1Œ≤ expression. Structure Aganirsen is a 25-mer (5‚Äô-TATCCGGAGGGCTCGCCATGCTGCT-3‚Äô), first-generation antisense oligonucleotide (phosphorothioate linkage). Aganirsen has a molecular mass of 8036 (Da), a melting point of approximately 64.2 ¬∞C, and a GC content of 64%. Aganirsen is highly soluble in water. Mechanism of action IRS-1 is an intracellular docking protein deprived of enzymatic activity.Sun, Xiao Jian, \\"Structure of the insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 defines a unique signal transduction protein.\\" Nature 352, no. 6330 (1991): 73-77.

The heroes and villains are each described on a double-sided sheet, and full-color illustrations appear for each of the major characters. The sheets come drilled so that they can be placed in a three-ring or two-ring binder for the purpose of storage and removal of characters during gaming sessions. The first four volumes of the Gamer's Handbook of the Marvel Universe are supplements for the Advanced rules of heroes and villains, each full described and color- illustrated on a separate hole-punched sheet, alphabetical. Volume one features Abomination thru Dreadnought, volume two features Eel thru Mad-Dog, volume three features Mad Thinker thru Sentry, and volume four features Serpent Society thru Zzzax. The next two volumes in the series were titled 1989 Character Updates and 1990 Character Updates. Publication history The first four volumes of the Gamer's Handbook of the Marvel Universe were designed by David A. Martin, Chris Mortika, and Scott Bennie, and were published by TSR, Inc., in 1988 as 256-page five-hold punched books. The fifth volume was designed by Scott Bennie, David Martin, Chris Mortika, David Rogers, and William Tracy, and was published in 1989, and the sixth volume was designed by David Martin, Chris Mortika, Scott E. Davis, William Tracy, and Raymond Maddox, and was published in 1990; both featured covers by Jeff Butler and were the same size as the first four volumes.

Father and Son: Kingsley Amis, Martin Amis, and the British Novel Since 1950. University of Wisconsin Press, p. 135. The couple bought the Georgian five-bay villa, built around 1830, for ¬£48,000 at auction in 1968, along with its eight acres of land, and lived there until 1976. The house had been registered as a Grade II listed building in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir, previously known as Gladsmuir House.Leader Zachary (2006). The Life of Kingsley Amis. Jonathan Cape, pp. 607, 617. Jane Howard restored an earlier name, Lemmons; the next owners changed it back to Gladsmuir.Howard, Elizabeth Jane (2011) [2002]. Slipstream. Pan Macmillan, p. 374\\\\. For the change back to Gladsmuir, see Norrie, Ian (1993). Barnet in old photographs. A. Sutton, p. 113. Jane and Kingsley lived at Lemmons with Jane's mother and brother, two artist friends, and Kingsley's three children, including the novelist Martin Amis. Several of the family's novels were written at Lemmons: Kingsley's The Green Man (1969) and The Alteration (1976); Jane's Odd Girl Out (1972) and Mr. Wrong (1975); and Martin's The Rachel Papers (1973) and Dead Babies (1975).Leader 2006, pp. 614, 633, 645. The poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis stayed at Lemmons in the spring of 1972, when he was dying of cancer, accompanied by his wife, Jill Balcon, and their children, Daniel Day-Lewis and Tamasin Day-Lewis.Sansom, Ian (3 April 2010). \\"Great dynasties of the world: The Day-Lewises\\". The Guardian. He wrote his last poem in the house, \\"At Lemmons\\", and died there shortly afterwards.Stanford, Peter (2007). C Day-Lewis: A Life. Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 318. Ian Sansom writes that, for the brief period that the Amises, Howards, Day-Lewises and others were in residence, Lemmons became \\"the most brilliantly creative household in Britain\\". History of the house=16th‚Äì19th century= Frances Trollope (1779‚Äì1863) may have lived in the house from 1836 to 1838. The land and an earlier house were owned by Henry Bellamy in 1584. The Quilter family owned the land from 1736 to 1909; it consisted of 23 acres in 1778. A Major Charles Hemery appears to have lived in the house in or around 1881.Clarke, William Spencer (1881).

Harrison, p. 2162. The writer Frances Trollope, mother of novelist Anthony Trollope, rented a house on Hadley Common from January 1836 until the early summer of 1838, possibly Gladsmuir, shortly after the death of her husband and one of her sons. According to Robert Bradford's biography of Martin Amis, Jane Howard discovered the Trollope connection from the house's papers and maintained that Frances Trollope had purchased it, although a purchase seems unlikely given the Trollope family's finances.Bradford, Robert (2012). Martin Amis: The Biography. Pegasus, p. 94. Frances Trollope and four of her children moved to Hadley Common from Belgium, where they had fled to escape debtors' prison in England. When Trollope's husband (the debtor) died, the threat of prison receded.\\"Frances Trollope\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Her daughter Emily had tuberculosis, and her doctor advised that winter in England would benefit her. Trollope described the property as \\"her pretty cottage\\" and a \\"pleasant house with a good garden on the common at Hadley, near Barnet\\". R. H. Super writes that Trollope invited eight guests to stay with her one Christmas, in addition to her family, so referring to it as a cottage was somewhat misleading.Super, R. H. (1991). The Chronicler of Barsetshire: A Life of Anthony Trollope. University of Michigan Press, pp. 31‚Äì34. The move did not, in the end, help Emily, who died in February 1836. She was buried in the nearby churchyard at the Church of St Mary the Virgin. Anthony Trollope later placed one of his characters in The Bertrams (1859) in a dull country house in Hadley.Super 1991, p. 32; Anthony Trollope, The Bertrams, 1859. =20th century= Jane Howard found that the house had previously been called Lemmons, and decided to restore that name.Howard 2011, p. 374. It was known as Gladsmuir when they bought it‚Äîfrom Gladsmuir Heath, the former name of Hadley Common, site of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses.Cussans, John Edwin (1879). History of Hertfordshire. Chatto, p. 221. The house had been registered under that name as a Grade II listed building in 1949, previously known as Gladsmuir House, with an address in Hadley Wood Road. As of 2014 the address was listed as Hadley Common. Made of red brick with a stucco trim, the house has five bays, two storeys, sash windows, and a central Doric porch with fluted columns and entablature with triglyphs. There is a later extension and a detached housekeeper's cottage, Gladsmuir Cottage. The panelled double doors lead to two internal staircases and over 20 rooms, including eight bedrooms, three reception rooms and a large kitchen. One room contains late-18th-century medallions.Amis, Martin (2000). Experience: A Memoir. Miramax, p. 184. In the three-acre garden, when Jane and Kingsley lived there, there was an old barn that was itself a listed building, a conservatory, a gravel drive, three descending lawns, a rose garden, cedar trees, a mulberry tree (where Lucy Snowe, their cat, was buried), and a weathervane dating to 1775. At the end of the garden, through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two local women for their horses.For the weathervane, Cherry and Pevsner 1998, p. 186; for the rest, Amis 2000, pp. 183‚Äì184, and Howard 2002, p. 372, 407. Lemmons household=Residents= Amis and Howard married in 1965 after meeting two years earlier at the Cheltenham Literary Festival, which she had helped to organize. She had been married twice: in 1947 she had left her first husband, Peter Scott, with whom she had a daughter, and in 1963 she divorced her second, Jim Douglas-Henry.Howard 2011, pp. 219, 332‚Äì338, 348.Brown, Andrew (9 November 2002). \\"Loves and letters\\", The Guardian. Kingsley was still married to his first wife, Hilly Bardwell, when he and Jane began an affair.Amis 2000, pp. 31‚Äì33. The couple first lived together in an Edwardian house at 108 Maida Vale, London, W2. They bought Lemmons at auction for ¬£48,000 in 1968, and lived there from 28 November that year.Howard 2011, pp. 364, 372, 374. Kingsley wrote to the poet Philip Larkin in April 1969: \\"This is a bloody great mansion, in the depths of the country though only 15 miles from the centre, and with lots of room for you to come and spend the night.\\"Leader, Zachary (2000). The Letters of Kingsley Amis. HarperCollins, p. 714. Martin Amis wrote his first two novels at Lemmons. The core household consisted of Jane and Kingsley; Jane's mother, Katherine (\\"Kit\\"), a former ballerina, who died in the house in 1972; one of Jane's brothers, Colin Howard (\\"Monkey\\"); and artists Sargy Mann and Terry Raybauld.Keulks 2003, p. 135. The housekeeper, Lily Uniacke, lived in Gladsmuir Cottage.Leader 2006, p. 609; Howard 2011, p. 375. Kingsley's children, Philip, Martin and Sally Amis, lived in the house from time to time, mostly outside term time, or at weekends in the case of Philip and Martin; the children were 17, 16 and 12 when Kingsley and Jane married.Leader 2006, pp. 630, 668.

Jane finished Something in Disguise (1969), Odd Girl Out (1972), and Mr. Wrong (1975), although she spent most of her time looking after the house.Keulks 2003, p. 136. Martin wrote his first two novels, The Rachel Papers (1973) and Dead Babies (1975), in his bedroom above Kingsley's study.Amis 2000, p. 363; Bradford 2012, p. 104. The first draft of The Rachel Papers was started in July 1970 and finished in September 1972; it won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1974, which Kingsley had won in 1955 for Lucky Jim (1954).Bradford 2012, p. 104. =Guests= Daniel Day-Lewis in 2013 Alexandra \\"Gully\\" Wells, step- daughter of the philosopher A.

The Day-Lewises moved into Lemmons in the spring of 1972 when Tamasin's father, the poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis, was dying of cancer. The families were close: Cecil and Jane had been lovers after her first divorce, and Jane was Tamasin's godmother.Watts, Janet (2 January 2014). \\"Elizabeth Jane Howard obituary\\", The Guardian. Tamasin and Martin had also started dating. Tamasin and her brother, Daniel, and their mother, Jill Balcon, stayed at the house for five weeks, until Cecil died on 22 May. Jane wrote: \\"Nobody was better at getting the utmost pleasure from the simplest things as Cecil: a bunch of flowers, a toasted bun, a gramophone record ... a piece of cherry cake, a new thriller ...\\"Howard 2011, p. 384.

The company decorated a room and took a photograph of Kingsley and Jane sitting in it, published under the headline \\"Very Kingsley Amis, Very Sanderson\\".Leader 2006, p. 643. The couple sold Lemmons shortly after this for ¬£105,000, and moved to a smaller house, Gardnor House, in Flask Walk, Hampstead, London NW3. Kingsley was apparently tired of living so far from central London.Leader 2006, p. 667; Bradford 2012, p. 164, for ¬£105,000. Jane loved Lemmons but was exhausted from the effort of running it. Kingsley expected her to do most of the cooking and domestic work, for the family plus assorted guests, as well as drive him around and sort out the finances and much of the gardening. Women for Kingsley were \\"for bed and board\\", as Jane put it.Howard 2011, pp. 374‚Äì375, 413. She ended up on Tryptizol and Valium.Howard 2011, p. 383; Leader 2006, p. 609.

His father was a member of the family which owned the Smith's Bank group of companies, and Martin joined the family business, becoming a partner in the London bank Smith, Payne and Smiths. =Career= Like his father and many of his ancestors, Smith entered politics. At the 1831 general election he was elected as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Midhurst in Sussex, a rotten borough in the control of his first cousin Lord Carrington. However, the borough's representation was reduced to one member in 1832, and Smith stood down. He did not re-enter Parliament until the 1847 general election when he was elected unopposed as one of the two MPs for the borough of Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. He was re-elected at the next three general elections, before standing down at the 1865 general election. =Personal life and death= In 1831, he married Louisa Ridley, the daughter of Sir Matthew White Ridley, 3rd Baronet; they had ten children. His third son Gerard Smith (1839‚Äì1920) was a British Army officer and banker who served as MP for Wycombe from 1883 to 1885, and as Governor of Western Australia from 1895 to 1900.

While most railroads referred to these 2-8-4 locomotives as Berkshires, the C&O; referred to them as Kanawhas after the Kanawha River which flows through West Virginia. Used as dual service engines, the 2716 and its classmates served the C&O; in a variety of duties until being retired in 1957. Donated to the Kentucky Railway Museum of New Haven, Kentucky in 1959, No. 2716 has been restored to operation in excursion service twice since its retirement from the C&O.; First in 1981 for the Southern Railway's steam program until 1982, and again in 1996 for a few brief excursions in Indiana. Today, the locomotive is undergoing restoration to operating condition for a third excursion career, under lease by the Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation. The restoration is currently estimated to be completed sometime in 2020. History=Revenue service and retirement= No. 2716 was the seventeenth member of ninety Kanawhas built for the C&O; by both the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and the Lima Locomotive Works (LLW) between 1943 and 1947. These locomotives were used for heavy freight trains, as well as fast passenger trains. After only thirteen years of service, the C&O; retired No. 2716 in 1957 in light of dieselization. With the exception of thirteen, including No. 2716, the C&O; withdrawn most of their Kanawhas in 1961. In May 1959, the locomotive was donated to the Kentucky Railway Museum in New Haven, Kentucky, where it sat on display.. Twenty years later, the Clinchfield Railroad leased No. 2716 for their steam program. However, as the locomotive was taken apart for restoration, the Clinchfield steam program was cancelled due to its parent company, the Seaboard Coast Line Industries oust the Clinchfield Railroad General Manager Thomas D. Moore Jr. Moore was fired for participating in a scandal of misappropriated money, the result of returning the disassembled 2716 to the Kentucky Railway Museum. =1981‚Äì1982 Southern excursion service= Luckily in 1980, No. 2716 was leased by the Southern Railway to pull the longer and heavier passenger trains for their popular steam excursion program.. Southern brought the locomotive to their Irondale, Alabama steam shops, where some modifications were made to No. 2716 by Master Mechanic Bill Purdie... Purdie's general idea was to make the locomotive appear if the Southern would have purchased a 2-8-4 type from new; No. 2716 was painted black with gold pinstriping as well as its headlight moved from its pilot to the center of its smokebox door, decorated with brass flag holders, and General Counsel Jim Bistline's brass eagle.. In addition, No. 2716 had its bell swinging from the top of its smokebox, and carried the round \\"SR\\" emblems on its air pump shields. After operating on a test run on October 10 and 11, 1981, No. 2716 pulled its first Southern Railway excursions on October 17 and 18, running a round-trip from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Rockwood, Tennessee.. In November, No. 2716 pulled excursion trains in Alabama and Georgia. In April 1982, the locomotive resumed its excursion duties, pulling trains through North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. But three months later, a very inexperienced fireman cracked the locomotive's firebox... This resulted in No. 2716 to be taken out of excursion service for repairs and Nickel Plate Road No. 765, another 2-8-4, based in Indiana, was called into service as a replacement. Following the merger between the Southern Railway and the Norfolk and Western to form the new Norfolk Southern Railway,. No. 2716 was retired in favor of Norfolk and Western No. 611 serving as the main motive power for the steam program. It was put in storage at the Irondale Steam Shop in 1985,. after attempts to weld cracks in the firebox failed. =1995‚Äì1996 excursion service= After Norfolk Southern ended their steam program in late 1994, the Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society (FWRHS), same owner as No. 765, moved No. 2716 to their facilities a year later.. In July 1996, the FWRHS restored it to its original C&O; appearance, repaired its firebox, and operated it on brief push-pull excursions through Logansport, Indiana before the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) inspectors ordered to give either No. 2716 new flues, or No. 765 a complete overhaul; the latter was the end result. The FWRHS decided to return the former back to its display site at the Kentucky Railway Museum in 2001. =Third restoration= On February 7, 2016, the Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation (KSHC) was formed and announced that it had signed a long-term lease with the Kentucky Railway Museum to restore and operate No. 2716. By May 2018, the KSHC partnered with the CSX Transportation to move the locomotive to a former Louisville and Nashville rail yard in Ravenna, Kentucky to build a new rail-based tourist and community development center. In November 2018, the KSHC acquired three items of rolling stock from the Indiana Transportation Museum (ITM) such as an auxiliary tender No. 251958, which was originally used behind Norfolk & Western No. 611 in the 1980s, and went to ITM in 1988 for use behind Nickel Plate Road 587. In addition, the KSHC purchased a railway post office car No. 6565 and baggage car No. 9036, which were both originally owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. In early 2019, the Big Rivers Electric Corporation in Henderson, Kentucky salvaged a pair of Buckeye three- axle, roller bearing trucks from a flatcar, which was abandoned at their facility property in Hawesville, Kentucky; and donated them to the KSHC to replace the old friction bearing trucks underneath No. 2716's tender. From July 26th to 28th, 2019, No. 2716 was moved out of the Kentucky Railway Museum to Ravenna, Kentucky for restoration along with the help of CSX Transportation and R.J. Corman Railroad Group. The locomotive was officially moved into the Ravenna workshop on July 31 and the restoration work on No. 2716 started shortly after. The restoration of 2716 is currently expected to be completed in 2021 if all work goes as planned.

The plantation's produce was shipped directly from the riverbank; the successful plantation's Queen Anne mansion, built by Frank and Lillian Rabb in 1891‚Äì1892, was adaptively remodeled in 2013 to serve as the Sanctuary's visitor center. With modern transportation, much of the Valley's land was replanted for industrial citrus farming. In 1971, the Sanctuary parcel became the property of the National Audubon Society, which continued to own it as of 2015. In 2010, the Gorgas Science Foundation, a Valley-based nonprofit organization, leased the Sanctuary from the Society to operate and interpret it for the public. The Sanctuary currently operates approximately 5 miles (8 km) of signed nature trails through the palm grove and adjacent habitats, including an old oxbow lake that is currently evolving into a wetland resaca. Other trails visit a butterfly garden and the shore of the Rio Grande.

It was first observed as by NEAT at Palomar Observatory on 29 June 2002, and by the WISE space telescope on 29 December 2013, under its current, principal provisional designation. This object was the first possible discovery of the reinstated NEOWISE program of the WISE telescope, following the program's hibernation in 2011.  Orbit and classification  belongs to the Apollo asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. They are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members. This object orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.76‚Äì4.0 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,357 days; semi-major axis of 2.40 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.68 and an inclination of 1¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Due to this close proximity, NASA has classified this object as a potential threat. At the time of the first WISE observations, this object was moving at a rate of 3.2¬∞ per day (for comparison the apparent diameter of the Moon is 0.5¬∞). = Close approaches = has a minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth of , which corresponds to 1.6 lunar distances (LD). In August 2002 and December 2013, approached Earth at 4.1 LD and 94 LD, respectively. On 12 December 2069, it will pass Earth at a nominal distance of , or nearly 3 LD. It also makes close approaches to Jupiter, Venus, Mars and the Moon.  First WISE observations  The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer's Near-Earth Object WISE (NEOWISE) program was put into hibernation on 1 February 2011, following several program extensions, from which approximately 34,000 asteroids were detected. On 21 August 2013, however, the program was reactivated. The new mission of the NEOWISE was to identify the population of potentially hazardous near-Earth objects. was first observed on 29 December 2013, at a distance of from Earth, marking the first object detected since the program's reinstatement. The infrared brightness was the primary attribute used for ascertaining the approximate size of the asteroid. Over the course of half a day, the trajectory of the asteroid was observed against the stationary positioning of the stars in the background. The data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer was transmitted to the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology, located in Pasadena, California. To confirm the discovery, researchers at the University of Arizona utilized the Spacewatch telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson, Arizona. is considered by NASA to be the first in what is expected to be thousands of objects to be detected by NEOWISE's new mission. Due to the trajectory of the asteroid, which puts it within a potentially dangerous range in over one hundred years following its discovery, NASA stated that they would keep a watchful eye on it.  Physical characteristics  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, measures 0.402 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an exceptionally low albedo of 0.025. Estimates from 2014 gave a somewhat larger diameter of 0.650 kilometers (0.404 miles). Its very dark surface, has an albedo comparable to a piece of coal.

Ballinger has represented the 5th District, stretching from Missouri to Oklahoma across a rural section of the Ozark Mountains, since January 2019. He previously represented the 97th District in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 2013 to 2019. Personal life and education Born in Bremerton in northwestern Washington, Ballinger was raised near Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he graduated from Daniel Webster High School. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Social Studies Education from Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. In 2004, he received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville. Early career From 1999 to 2002, Ballinger taught history in Sapulpa near Tulsa. From 2006 to 2011, he was director of operations of Kings River Title Company in Berryville, Arkansas. He has practised law since 2006 and is a former chairman of the Berryville Chamber of Commerce. Ballinger's law office is in Berryville, the seat of government of Carroll County, where he and his wife, the former Jessica Lynn Thomas, reside. The Ballingers have eight children. He is a Baptist and affiliated with Kiwanis International. Political life In 2012, Ballinger won the Republican nomination for the District 97 House seat over Jeremy Miller, 1,362 (52.4 percent) to 1,238 (47.6 percent). He then defeated Democrat Robert D. Berry of Eureka Springs, 6,706 (56.2 percent) to 5,226 (43.8 percent). The position opened when the incumbent Republican Representative Jonathan Barnett was transferred to the reconfigured District 87. Ballinger serves on these House committees: (1) Agriculture, Forestry, and Economic Development, (2) Energy, (3) Judiciary, and (4) Performance Review. He is the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice and Child Support. In 2013, Ballinger co-sponsored amending state income tax rates. He co-sponsored a proposed spending cap on the state budget, but the measure failed by two votes on the House floor. He voted to override of the vetoes of Democratic then Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He was a co-sponsor of both of those measures. He supported related legislation to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases, and to forbid abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected. Ballinger co- sponsored legislation to allow officials of religious institutions and universities to carry concealed weapons. He opposed the bill to reduce the fees for obtaining a concealed-carry permit. He co-sponsored the House-passed measure to prohibit the governor from regulating firearms during an emergency. He voted against approved legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. He supported failed legislation to prohibit the closure of public schools after a two-year period of declining enrollment. He voted for legislation to establish a tiered system for lottery scholarships. Ballinger co-sponsored the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. Ballinger won his second term in the House in the general election held on November 4, 2014, a strong year politically in Arkansas for Republican candidates. He defeated the Democratic choice, Charles \\"Sonny\\" Carter, 6,234 votes (65 percent) to 3,384 (35 percent). In February 2015, Ballinger authored House Bill 1228, designed to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, seventy-two to twenty. One of the opponents, Representative Camille Bennett, a former city attorney for Lonoke, Arkansas, called for a reworking of the legislation. Bennett claimed the Ballinger bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature. The measure was subsequently signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. Ballinger was the state co-chairman of the presidential campaign for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whom he hosted on a campaign swing through Arkansas in August 2015. Working with Ballinger on the campaign was former gubernatorial candidate Curtis Coleman, who was defeated in the 2014 primary election by Governor Hutchinson. On March 6, 2019 Ballinger failed to get his \\"Stand Your Ground\\" bill (SB 484) out of the Senate Judiciary Committee after a three hour hearing, which included testimony against the bill from law enforcement agencies, Moms Demand Action, the NAACP and others.

Robbins (January 15, 1932 ‚Äì January 14, 1995) was an American art historian, art critic, and curator, who specialized in avant-garde 20th- century art and helped encourage the study of it. Robbins' area of scholarship was on the theoretical and philosophical origins of Cubism.Dictionary of Art Historians His writings centered on the importance of artists such as Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier and Jacques Villon.Daniel J. Robbins, Rhode Island School of Design Museum Notes 83 (1996): 2‚Äì3 [obituary] He was a specialist in early Modernism, writing on Salon Cubists (the Section d'Or group) and championed contemporaries such as Louise Bourgeois and the Color Field painters.Kimmelmann, Michael, Daniel Robbins, 62; Was Art Historian And a Modernist, The New York Times, January 18, 1995 Art historian Peter Brooke referred to Robbins as \\"the great pioneer of the broader history of Cubism\\".Peter Brooke, On \\"Cubism\\" in context, Gleizes, Metzinger and 'Salon Cubism, online June 2012 Biography=Education and career= Daniel Robbins (Jeremiah Drummer and George Gregory Dobbs, pseud.) attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate, receiving an A.B. in 1951 at age 19. He then attended Yale University receiving an M.A. in Art History in 1955. He had initially applied at Yale to study painting, but switched to art history when he realized the painting department was overshadowed by the painter Josef Albers. After graduating from Yale in 1955 he taught at Indiana University for one academic year (1955‚Äì1956). He then began doctoral work at New York University Institute of Fine Arts. In 1958, at the instigation of his professor Robert Goldwater, Robbins began writing a PhD dissertation on the Cubist artist and theoretician Albert Gleizes. At the time when, writes art historian David Cottington, \\"the expansionary momentum both of the New York art market and of post-war art-historical scholarship in the USA were creating a favorable climate for the recovery of salon cubism.\\"David Cottington, Cubism and Its Histories, Manchester University Press, 2004 The year before, a section of Gleizes' memoirs were published, offering insight into the artistic milieu of pre-1914 Paris. One of the most characteristic features of the Salon Cubists who exhibited in the public salons (e.g., Salon d'Automne and Salon des Ind√©pendants), unlike Picasso and Braque, was that they often worked on a large scale, and they had an interest in large \\"epic\\" subjects. Daniel Robbins had coined the term Epic Cubism to distinguish their work from the more intimate painting of Picasso and Braque. Robbins completed his course work for the degree in 1958 in the joint Certificate of Museology program under A. Hyatt Mayor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Robbins continued to paint, exhibiting under the pseudonym Jeremiah Drummer, and wrote art criticism for the Village Voice under the name of George Gregory Dobbs. Following a stay in Paris as a Fulbright scholar at the University of Paris in 1958, Robbins became research assistant to the Chief Curator of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1959, a position he would hold through 1961.

Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris; Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund. Robbins moved to New York City in 1961 and worked as a curator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. There he curated Albert Gleizes, 1881‚Äì1953: a Retrospective Exhibition and wrote a seminal text on the artist for the exhibition catalogue.Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 (Guggenheim website)Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 He left the Guggenheim to become Director of the Rhode Island School of Design Museum from 1965 to 1971. As director of The RISD Museum he curated shows of new art, notably one called Raid the Icebox, for which Andy Warhol participated in choosing works from the museum's collection. At RISD, Robbins made exhibiting and collecting contemporary art a priority, something the Museum had not done for six decades. He then became director of the Fogg Museum at Harvard University. At Harvard he continued to champion modern art, including leading the restoration of the Mark Rothko murals in the penthouse of Harvard University's Holyoke Center. In the fall of 1972 he conducted a seminar on Jacques Villon, and collaborated with the students to organize the first major Villon retrospective held in the U.S. (at the Fogg Museum) from 17 January to 29 February 1976. After resigning from the directorship of the museum in 1974 he lectured in Fine art at Harvard, completed his dissertation (delayed due to professional demands and responsibilities), and in 1975 received his degree from New York University. Robbins held a professorship at Dartmouth College from 1975 to 1980 and became a Senior Fellow at the National Endowment for the Humanities (1976). He lectured at a variety of institutions including Yale University (1977), Williams College (1978‚Äì79), Hunter College (1984), the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, and the University of Iowa (1985), where he co- authored a catalogue created for an exhibition of works by Cubist artist Jean Metzinger.Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Joann Moser, Daniel Robbins, 1985.

With 240 illustrations. In 1980 Robbins accepted a permanent position as the Baker Professor of the Arts at Union College, where he directed a catalogue raisonn√© on Albert Gleizes. =The history of Cubism= Robbins had not contented himself to merely enrich the historical account of the beginnings of Cubism, as might have art historians John Golding (1929‚Äì2012) and Robert Rosenblum (1927‚Äì2006). He \\"challenged its very scope\\", writes David Cottington. In his PhD on Albert Gleizes, with access to the Gleizes published memoirs and unpublished papers, and following from personal interviews with the artists widow, Juliette Roche Gleizes, Robbins began to reveal an account of Cubism that pointed towards other influences within the burgeoning movement than those generally accepted. He boldly charged 'an historical tradition which regards the Demoiselles as the origin of cubism' to be unhistorical. As pointed out by Cottington, Robbins \\"insisted on both a distinct set of interests, and a separate artistic genealogy, for the group of artists within which Gleizes' work and ideas developed\\". > The lack of history consisted in the reductivism and exclusivism of a view > that, placing Picasso's picture at the beginning of cubism's formal > development, under-acknowledged or ignored the symbolists' interest in > geometry, the particular structure and subject matter of neo-impressionism > paintings and the parallel concerns of writers and social thinkers, and > misread the relation of Braque's fauvism to his subsequent work. > (Cottington, 219) The distinct interests of the artists of Gleizes's circle, writes Cottington, \\"were registered by the commonalities of subject matter that Robbins identified in their paintings\\". > These involved the interaction of vast space with speed and action, with > simultaneous work, commerce, sport and flight; with the modern city and the > ancient country, with the river, the harbor and the bridge and above all, > with time, for the sense of time‚Äîinvolving memory, tradition, and > accumulated cultural thought‚Äîcreated the reality of the world. (Robbins, > 1964)Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, 1881‚Äì1953, a Retrospective Exhibition, > Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964, internet archive Robbins argued that such iconography partially explained why there was no period in the work of Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Fernand L√©ger or Henri Le Fauconnier closely corresponding to the analytic cubism of Picasso or Braque. It explained too, as Cottington points out, the move by Gleizes and Delaunay into abstraction, \\"and their sympathy with the theoretical motions of artists such as Kandinsky and Mondrian\\". The parallel genealogy Robbins extracted from Gleizes's memoirs was the inspiration generated through post-symbolist literary activity around Alexandre Mercereau, Paul Fort's Parisian review Vers et ProsePaul Fort, Vers et Prose, 1905 and the Abbaye de Cr√©teil. The 1964 Guggenheim essay on Gleizes developed these notions that Robbins summarized as: > A synthetic view of the universe, presenting the remarkable phenomena of > time and space, multiplicity and diversity, at once was his painted > equivalent to the ideals which were verbally realized in the Abbaye poetry. > (Robbins, 1964) Daniel Robbins, Joann Moser, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, 1985 (catalogue cover) Capitalizing on the occasion presented by the first major retrospective of a prominent salon cubist, Robbins' Guggenheim essay greatly opened the field of Cubist studies to novel approaches, and, writes Cottington, his example was invaluable for a rising generation of historians of modernism. Notwithstanding, the impact of Robbins radical conclusions remained somewhat overshadowed by the work of other mainstream art historians, such as Douglas Cooper, whose Cubist Epoch exhibition and 1970 publication gained in both impact and authority. During the 1980s however, Robbins began a major essay for a retrospective of the work of another key salon cubist: Jean Metzinger. This gave him the opportunity to take his thesis beyond the broad generalizations of the Guggenheim text. This text titled Metzinger, At the Center of Cubism, placed Metzinger at the intersection between the gallery cubists and the salon cubists. In a 1910 publication Note sur la peinture Metzinger explicitly relates, for the first time, the interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. Metzinger's Note sur la peinture not only highlighted the works of Picasso and Braque, on the one hand, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay on the other, but it was also a tactical selection that highlighted the fact that only Metzinger himself was positioned to write about all four. Metzinger, uniquely, had been closely acquainted with the gallery cubists and the burgeoning salon cubists simultaneously.David Cottington, Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905‚Äì1914, Yale University Press, 1998Jean Metzinger, Note sur la peinture, Pan, Paris, Oct‚ÄìNov 1910 Robbins focused on the question of Picasso and Braque's influence, if any, on the work of Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay; the group first named as Cubists in 1911. Robbins died on January 14, 1995, at the Dartmouth‚ÄìHitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, shortly before his sixty-third birthday. He was 62 and lived in Troy, New York, and Braintree, Vermont.  Selected publications  * C√©zanne and structure in modern painting, Solomon R.

It was originally built in 1899 as the Newcastle Municipal Chambers, then substantially extended in 1910, with further extensions in 195657 and 199092. The building includes two halls: the \\"Lesser Hall\\" or \\"Foyer\\" (the original 1899 building), and a larger auditorium with a stage.  History  The Municipality of Newcastle was established in 1877, and based in the town then known as Newcastle (now Toodyay); council meetings were held in the Mechanics' Institute building. However, by 1894, councils meetings were being held at hotels as were the meetings of the Toodyay Road Board due to limited availability of the Mechanics' Institute building, and the public were complaining that they did not have access to the meetings. After two requests to Premier John Forrest, in 1894 and 1895, the government agreed to fund municipal chambers. By 1899, Charles Henry Whiteford had designed the building, and the foundation stone was laid by Hannah Emily Leeder, the wife of the Mayor William George Leeder, on 12 April 1899.Foundation stone on the front wall of the building Forrest opened the building on 18 October 1899. The Newcastle Municipal Council held its first meeting in the new building on 4 December 1899. The Toodyay Road Board also held their monthly meetings in the hall from 1900, on separate days to the Council, until they merged in 1912. Laying the foundation stone of the Toodyay Town Hall 1910 Up until 1908 the town's Oddfellows Hall had provided a venue for larger entertainment events. When it was converted into stores, a need became apparent for a town hall, and one was proposed in 1909. The town hall was built adjoining the existing municipal chambers with a contract price of ‚Ç§850. The foundation stone was laid in August 1910 by Catherine Somers, wife of Mayor Jonathan Somers,\\"Toodyay Memorial Hall Stone\\" plaque on the west side of the main hallFoundation stone on the west side of the main hall and the hall was officially opened on 7 October 1910 with a charity ball to raise funds for the local hospital. The town had officially changed its name from Newcastle to Toodyay in May 1910, so the new hall was known as the Toodyay Town Hall. It was renamed as the Toodyay Memorial Hall in 1957. The Municipality of Toodyay merged with the Toodyay Road District in 1912, and the front section of the building was renamed from the Newcastle Municipal Chambers to the Toodyay Road Board Chambers. Electric lighting was installed in 1920, and electric fans in the main hall in 1928. In 195657 the auditorium was extended, a new stage was built, and an additional room added on to the back. This work was partly funded by the Toodyay RSL,Plaque on the front wall of the building a condition of which was the renaming to the Toodyay Memorial Hall. The auditorium was regularly used as a picture theatre up until the 1960s. The dual-faced clock on the front of the building, a locally-made replica of a railway clock, was added in 1988 as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations.Plaque on the front wall of the building In 199092 major renovations were carried out to the entire building, including addition of a new kitchen and bar. During these renovations the hall's foundation stone was removed and stored in the Newcastle Gaol Museum. It was subsequently re- installed in 2010 near its original position. In the 2000s digital projection equipment and a retractable screen were installed.

Her paintings are in the collections of Tate, Museums Sheffield, Government Art Collection, Arts Council Collection and other museums and galleries. Early life, education and marriage Elinor Bellingham-Smith was born in London on 28 December 1906 to Guy and Ellen (Nell) Buxton Bellingham-Smith, who were married in 1901. Her father, who collected art, was a registrar, surgeon and obstetrician at Guy's Hospital. The painter Hugh Bellingham-Smith was her uncle. She had an older brother and sister. Bellingham-Smith was a proficient ballet dancer and pianist. She gave up dancing, though, following an injury. Bellingham-Smith studied at the Slade School of Fine Art beginning in 1928. In 1931 she finished her studies at Slade and married English painter Rodrigo Moynihan. Career Her works were exhibited in 1931 at the London Group. In 1948 she had a solo exhibition at Leicester Galleries and began exhibiting at the Royal Academy of Art. She painted primarily landscapes and still life. She worked for both Harper's Bazaar and Shell as an illustrator. She illustrated the children's book Candlelight Tales by Alison Uttley (Faber & Faber, 1936). For the 1951 Festival of Britain the Arts Council commissioned 60 painters to make large paintings, or more, to be displayed at the festival. There were also 12 commissioned sculptors. Ultimately the works were given to new hospitals, libraries, schools, and health centres that emerged after the war. There were five cash prizes awarded and Bellingham-Smith took one of the prizes with The Island. M. H. Middleton reviewed the Leicester Galleries exhibition of Bellingham-Smith's paintings in November 1952: Later in life, The Fens and East Anglia were featured in many of Bellingham-Smith's landscapes. During her career she exhibited at the Women's International Art Club. Personal life Bellingham-Smith and Moynihan had a son, John, who was born in 1932. The family had a governess for John and a cleaning lady for the upkeep of their home on Old Church Street. Bellingham-Smith and her husband had a busy social life. Their home became a salon to writers and other artists. In 1946, Princess Elizabeth was accompanied by her mother to the house six times to sit for Moynihan, who had been commissioned to make her portrait. Their evenings were often spent smoking and drinking in restaurants, bars, clubs or at parties. When he turned 20, John went along with them on their evenings out. John wrote the book The Restless Lives: The Bohemian World of Rodrigo and Elinor Moynihan, which was described by writer Frances Spalding as a \\"clear- eyed chronicle of a lost era, when high living, creativity and Bohemianism momentarily went hand in hand.\\" Their social life and Moynihan's affairs took a toll on the marriage. They separated in 1957 and divorced in 1960. From about 1958, she lived in Boxford, Suffolk and died on 4 November 1988 in Ipswich.

A favourite student of Bishop Fulbert of Chartres, he eventually became acting treasurer of the church of Poitiers from 1024 to 1026. According to Adelman, another pupil of Fulbert's, Hildegar imitated his teacher's mannerisms and speech. When Hildegar was appointed treasurer of Poitiers, Fulbert wrote to congratulate him and give him advice. Hildegar was a subdeacon at Chartres Cathedral in 1022, when he wrote a letter requesting a horse to his friend Siefried, to whom he had shown hospitality during the latter's stay in Chartres. He told Siefried that friendship was \\"not only for its own sake but also for usefulness\\" (non propter se tantum sed et propter utilitatem). He collected his correspondence with Fulbert, in which he writes as a friend and the latter responds with friendly advice on his duties as treasurer. Hildegar even admits to missing the presence of Fulbert's secretary, Sigo. At one point, Fulbert exclaims, \\"Your absence often reminds me how important your presence was\\". Hildegar also corresponded with Duke William V of Aquitaine, whom he calls a \\"friend\\" (amicus) in the technical sense of a lay supporter of a cleric. He may have written some of the duke's official correspondence, such as the letter to Anselm, bishop of Vercelli.

It is a Non-governmental organization (NGO) which is working for the protection and full implementation of intersex people's human rights in Europe.  History  OII Europe was founded on Human Rights Day (10 December) during the Second Intersex Forum in Stockholm in 2012 as a network of national intersex NGOs and intersex activists. The network started immediately to provide trainings and information for policy-makers, NGOs and the general public and to offer expertise on intersex human rights violations to EU and UN institutions and about the living situation of intersex people and the human rights violations they face. Three years later, in 2015, OII Europe was registered as a non- profit NGO based in Germany. The same year, the organisation, together with other intersex organisations all over the world was given its first funding through the Astraea Intersex Human Rights Fund. In 2019 OII Europe published the organisation's first Strategic Plan for the years 2019‚Äì2022.  Current Work  OII Europe works on the grounds of the Malta Declaration, formulated at the 3rd International Intersex Forum 2013. The organisation advocates for intersex rights, fosters and conducts research on the issues faced by intersex people, supports national-level intersex movements and collaborates internationally. OII-Europe has more than 20 member organisations, including almost all existing intersex-led organisations across Europe. It also works with individuals and emerging initiatives in Europe, and Central Asia. Key goals of the organisation include the full implementation of human rights, bodily integrity & self-determination for intersex people, legal prohibition of non-consensual medical & psychological treatment, promotion of self- awareness, visibility and recognition of intersex people, full protection against discrimination & the adoption of \\"sex characteristics\\" as a protective ground and education of society on intersex issues from a human rights perspective.https://oiieurope.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/05/strategicplan2019-OII_Europe_webversion.pdf OII Europe advocates and works with EU Institutions, the Council of Europe and national governments to achieve these goals. The organisation has also published several important toolkits and documents that introduce intersex issues to allies and law and policy-makers, as well as a toolkit for parents of intersex children. Many of the publications are available in several European languages. The organisation also provides two regularly updated resource lists with links to important intersex human rights documents.

The building was the location of the first bank in Toodyay.  History  The land was bought by J.G.C. Carr in 1860. The original dwelling was constructed by John Henry Monger circa 1870, on Town Lot #1. His son, Charles Samuel Monger, resided in the dwelling and operated the family store located opposite the house and adjacent to the Bolgart Bridge (crossing the Avon River). In 1889 the building was converted to accommodate the Western Australian Bank. This was the first bank in Toodyay. The manager of the Northam Branch, James Mitchell, who later became the Premier of Western Australia and Governor of Western Australia, rode over twice a week to also manage the Toodyay branch. In 1898 the bank vacated the premises, moving into a newly constructed premises on Stirling Terrace, and the Monger family resumed occupancy. In 1910 the residence was acquired by Mr Angus and Mrs Emma Butterly (n√©e Monger), who undertook extensive remodelling of the dwelling. From 1954‚Äì80 the cottage was owned and occupied by Miss Kathleen Gladys Butterly, who sold the house and land to the Shire of Toodyay in 1981. In March 1981, the Shire Council leased Butterly House to the Toodyay Homes for the Aged Association (now Butterly Cottages Association (Inc.)). In 1997 the Association received a grant from the Heritage Council and in 1998 funding from Lotteries Commission to restore the building. In 1999 the building was officially re-opened and is used by the Association for recreation and as a living museum with collections of photographs and memorabilia.

Early life Mardesich was born in San Pedro, California, to Nicola \\"Nick\\" and Mary (n√©e Felando) Mardesich, two Croatian immigrants. His father was an avid fisherman, originating from the island of Vis. After the family relocated to Everett, Washington in 1928, Mardesich attended schooling in that same city, and later Seattle University, along with his brother, Tony. After serving in the United States Army during World War II, Mardesich attended the University of Washington Law School, graduating in 1948 and admitted to the bar. The following year, when the Mardesich family was on a fishing trip to the Bering Sea, their boat capsized, and amongst five crew members, his father, and brother Tony, who had recently been elected to the Washington House of Representatives, were lost at sea. August Mardesich survived the ordeal and would later be appointed to fill his brother's unfilled House term. He would later run the family's fishing business. Legislative career Mardesich served in the Washington House of Representatives for District 38 (parts of Snohomish County) from 1950 to 1963, as a Democrat. He served as majority leader in the 1950s, during his third term. In 1962, he ran for election to the Washington State Senate for the same district, on the premise of the four- year terms that it offered, rather than the two-year terms that the house offered. In 1972, he became majority leader, replacing Senator R.R. (Bob) Grieve, who had previously held the position for 16 years. In 1975, he was indicted by a grand jury on charges of extortion and tax evasion, charges he was later to be found innocent of, on July 3, 1975. Later in 1975, he was sued by Attorney General Slade Gorton on charges of influence peddling and violating public disclosure laws regarding payments between Mardesich and two banks. He resigned as majority leader later that year. Three years later, in 1978, he lost re-election to the state senate, effectively ending his political career. He would later attempt to win re-election to his old senate seat held by Larry Vognild, but was defeated in the primary. Later, he served on the Industrial Insurance Appeals Board, appointed by Governor Dixy Lee Ray, and also worked as a lobbyist. Though he had survived another fishing accident when a boat with him and his daughters capsized in Alaska, in 1976, he also returned to fishing. During his legislative service, Mardesich was regarded for his ability to simplify and explain confusing bills and pieces of legislation. He was also widely regarded as one of the most powerful persons in the state. He is married to Rosemary and with her has six children. They reside in Mill Creek, Washington. He was still remembered as one of the most influential legislators the political history of the state. Mardesich died on February 8, 2016, in Mill Creek, Washington.

Its mouth is located at the opposite bank of the ‚ÄúRivi√®re-aux-Rats‚Äù hamlet (Rat River hamlet), which is on the east side of Saint-Maurice River, at 29.5 km (by Route 155) south of Downtown La TuqueGeographical audit conducted on January 2, 2014 by historian Ga√©tan Veillette (Saint-Hubert, QC) from the Google Map website and maps.  Geography  ‚ÄúRivi√®re aux rats‚Äù is a tributary of the Saint-Maurice River, by the west bank, and its mouth is 500 meters upstream from the road bridge of ‚ÄúRivi√®re-aux-rats‚Äù, spanning the Saint-Maurice River and one kilometer upstream from the mouth of the Wessonneau River which flows northeast. ‚ÄúRivi√®re aux rats‚Äù flows mainly in the territory of the Zec Wessonneau. The source of the ‚ÄúRivi√®re aux rats‚Äù is the area near the Vermillion River (southeast bank), comprising the discharge of lakes Nathalie, Blazer and ‚ÄúLac aux rats‚Äù (Rat lake). In its course, the river receive waters from the ‚ÄúPetite rivi√®re aux rats‚Äù (Little Rats River) which drains the lakes Pierre-Antoine, the ‚ÄúPetit Lac aux Rats\\" and Moose Lake. From this junction, the river often flows in coils, heading first to the south, then to the southeast. A forest road goes along the river from the south or west side, according to the segments of the river. Another discharge flows into the ‚ÄúRivi√®re aux rats‚Äù from the lakes Cinconcine and Dumoulin, located north of the ‚ÄúRivi√®re aux rats‚Äù.  History  From the seventeenth century through the establishment at the mouth of a trading post by Hudson's Bay, Rivi√®re aux rats was a preferred method of communication for trafficking in furs for the area between the rivers Saint-Maurice and Vermillion River. This trading post was in service until the mid-nineteenth century. In 1806, Jean-Baptiste Perrault, traveling merchant, mentions the \\"Fort of the Rivi√®re aux rats\\" in his writings. Journals of the House of Assembly of Lower Canada, 1823-1824, quote Francis Verreault: \\"... there is a station established at a place called Utsasht- ushipi (Rivi√®re aux rats)\\". From the mid-nineteenth century, following the granting of rights to cut timber on public lands, many forest projects were implemented by loggers, near the \\"Rivi√®re aux rats\\". In 1887, John Baptist, who owned much of the forest concessions, managed to develop a large farm on the grounds of alluvium from the mouth. This farm used to supply the logging sites. During this period, the village of \\"Rivi√®re-aux-Rats\\" grew on the eastern shore of Saint-Maurice, in front of the Baptist farm. Various hamlets along the Saint-Maurice River developed on the east shore, because of the coastal road linking Grand-M√®re to La Tuque. In the 19th century, the services of the Catholic religion with the various tasks of the Middle and Upper Mauricie were generally provided by members of the clergy assigned to Saint- Tite. In addition, forest contractors and workers could generally buy from traders Saint-Tite, Saint-Stanislas, Saint-Narcisse and Sainte-Genevi√®ve-de- Batiscan.

Dontigny and Bishop Cloutier Canot , Riviere-aux-Rats, 1900.jpgBishop Cloutier and Paul Lamy In 1910, under the auspices of Bishop Cloutier, Bishop of Trois-Rivi√®res, a Catholic mission was founded in \\"Rivi√®re-aux-Rats\\" under the patronage of \\"Saint-Jean-Baptiste\\" (St. John the Baptist). This canonical designation honors simultaneously French Canadians and also the oldest inhabitant of the place, Jean-Baptiste Hennesse. Forestry companies maintained logging camps in operation near the mouth of the \\"Rivi√®re aux rats\\" until 1984. The ferry connecting the two banks of Saint-Maurice River was in operation until 1980, before the construction of the bridge over the Saint-Maurice River. Located on the Rivi√®re aux Rats, the \\"Jet√©e d√©boulante Dickey\\" (Dickey Tumble Down Pier) was named in honor of Jimmie Dickey. The latter worked as a \\"foreman\\" in the forest sites; he was the Adams' brother-in-law. The term \\"Dickey\\" is also used for \\"Dickey's Cove\\", \\"Dickey's Lake\\" and this pier.

In literature Arwenack is the setting for the historical novel The Grove of Eagles by Winston Graham, which chronicles the lives of the Killigrew family in the 1590s. The narrator, an illegitimate son of John Killigrew, notes the extraordinary unhappiness and ill-fortune which visited so many of those who lived in Arwenack in his lifetime, and led to a local legend that Arwenack was under a curse. The narrator's own view was that the only curse was excessive ambition: his great-grandfather, Sir John Killigrew, had built his new house on a scale so lavish that it drained the family's resources, so that \\"from his time on, there was always a hint of the feverish and the insolvent in our lives\\".

Mackinnon one of the most enterprising of the pioneer colonists of Victoria (Australia) and one of the proprietors of the Melbourne Argus from 1852 until his death. Mackinnon was born in Kilbride, Isle of Skye, Scotland, the second son of John Mackinnon, a Presbyterian minister of Strath, Skye, and his wife Ann, daughter of Lauchlan Mackinnon of Corriechatachan, Skye. After being educated partly at home and subsequently at Broadford, Mackinnon entered the office of his uncle Mr. Lauchlan Mackinnon, a Writer to the Signet in Glasgow; but preferring a more active life, he in 1838 proceeded to Sydney. In Australia Mackinnon at once engaged in the hazardous business of \\"overlanding\\", and succeeded in his dangerous mission of conveying stock from Sydney to Adelaide‚Äîa feat which attracted much attention at the time, as it was the first overland journey made between these distant points. A little later (in 1840) he made one of the earliest overland journeys with sheep from Sydney to Melbourne. The pastoral capabilities of the country attracted his attention, and he determined to settle in Australia Felix. He took up a run in the western district on the Loddon River, and subsequently removed to Mount Fyans. He was for some years associated in business with the late James Montgomery, and in 1852 he joined Edward Wilson, and became one of the proprietors of the Argus. Prior to this he had taken a prominent part in political life, particularly interesting himself in the agitation for the separation of Port Phillip District from New South Wales. He was one of the representatives for the Electoral district of Port Phillip in the Parliament of New South Wales in 1848, and vigorously supported its claims for justice from the governing authorities of New South Wales. He was a strong and earnest supporter of the anti-convict movement, and took a prominent part in the demonstration which was held in Melbourne in 1849, when the inhabitants resolved to oppose the landing of convicts from the ship Randolph by physical force, and to undergo any extremity of suffering rather than permit the colony to become a receptacle of felons. After separation had been secured, Mackinnon represented the Belfast and Warrnambool district in the old unicameral Victorian Legislative Council, and assisted to pass a measure intended to prevent the introduction of convicted offenders into the colony. He energetically combated the efforts of the imperial authorities to prevent the effective administration of the enactment; and on the popular opposition proving successful he proceeded in 1853 with William Westgarth to Tasmania to assist the anti-transportation party in the colony. Indeed, he took a strong interest in all the public movements of the day; and his vigour and courage were so well recognised that, in the early days when bushrangers were prevalent, he had been offered the command of the police force of Port Phillip‚Äîa position which, however, he did not accept. He was one of the members of the original Council of the University of Melbourne, and first Chairman of its Building Committee. When the gold discoveries in Victoria gave such a wonderful impetus to the colony, the vigorous judgment and business ability of Mackinnon, with the brilliant literary qualities of his partner, Edward Wilson, placed the Argus in the van of the Australian press. After some years of arduous work, Mackinnon returned to England, where he remained. He was twice married, his first wife being a daughter of Robert Montgomery, and sister of James Montgomery; and his second, Emily, daughter of Capt. Bundoch, R.N. Mackinnon died in Torquay, Devon, England on 21 March 1888.

May 14, 934?Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279.Academia Sinica Chinese- Western Calendar Converter.It was clear that Feng Yun's colleague Zhu Hongzhao committed suicide on that day. The historical records also indicate that the general An Congjin, upon hearing of Zhu's suicide, killed Feng, implying that it was on the same day, but not completely establishing it as such.) was an official of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state known as the Later Tang, serving both as chancellor and chief of staff (Shumishi) during the reigns of its second emperor Li Siyuan and Li Siyuan's son and successor Li Conghou.  Background  It is not known when Feng Yun was born, but it is known that he was from Taiyuan. All that was recorded in history about his origins was that his father Feng Zhang ‚Äî given variously as È¶ÆÁíãNew History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 27. or È¶ÆÁ´†Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. ‚Äî was the doorkeeper for Li Siyuan, the future Later Tang emperor. In Feng Yun's childhood, he was understanding and intelligent, and Li Siyuan liked him greatly. Later, when Li Siyuan served as a military governor (Jiedushi) under his adoptive brother Li Cunxu ‚Äî unclear whether referring to a commission while Li Cunxu still used the Tang Dynasty-bestowed title of Prince of Jin or after Li Cunxu claimed imperial title as emperor of Later Tang ‚Äî Feng became his liaison officer at the imperial court.  During Li Siyuan's reign  In 926, Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at then-Later Tang capital Luoyang. Li Siyuan, who had earlier rebelled against Li Cunxu, quickly arrived at Luoyang thereafter and claimed imperial title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Sometime after Li Siyuan took the throne, he made Feng Yun a protocol officer (‰∏≠ÈñÄ‰Ωø, Zhongmenshi) and director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi). In 928, when Li Siyuan made his then-oldest-surviving son Li Congrong the military governor of Hedong as well as the defender of its capital Taiyuan, he made Feng the deputy defender of Taiyuan, apparently in actual command. It was said that Li Congrong was arrogant in his youth and not paying proper attention to governance. Li Siyuan felt compelled to send, among his own associates, a man whom he believed Li Congrong respected (the man's identity is lost to history) to serve on Li Congrong's staff to try to positively influence him. The man informed Li Congrong that his younger brother Li Conghou had a much better reputation and that he should better himself so that his reputation can at least match Li Conghou's. Li Congrong was displeased by the advice, and informed this to his officer Yang Siquan (). Yang subsequently threatened the man, claiming that man was helping Li Conghou to overtake Li Congrong in succession. The man, in fear, informed the threat to Feng. Feng informed Li Siyuan, and Li Siyuan called Yang to his presence in order to disassociate him from Li Congrong, but, on Li Congrong's account, did not punish Yang. When Feng was subsequently recalled to the imperial government to again serve as the director of palace affairs, he warned the key officials in charge of government that Li Congrong had a harsh character and was acting frivolously, and needed good counsel. Shortly after, Li Congrong was recalled from Hedong to serve as the mayor of Henan Municipality (i.e., the Luoyang region) and the commander of the imperial guards, and Li Conghou, who previously held both titles, was made the military governor of Hedong, effectively swapping positions with Li Congrong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 930, Feng was made the defender of Taiyuan,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. and apparently also the military governor of Hedong. He later served as the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan). In late 932, he was recalled from Zhongwu to again serve as director of palace affairs, and was also made the acting director of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies). In 933, Li Siyuan was prepared to make him a chancellor ‚Äî usually, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () ‚Äî but as this would violate naming taboo for Feng (as his father was named Feng Zhang), Li Siyuan gave him the unusual designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Erpin () as chancellor, and also made him full director of the three financial agencies. By that time, Li Siyuan's chiefs of staff, Fan Yanguang and Zhao Yanshou, both were apprehensive of Li Congrong, and wanted to leave their posts to avoid confrontations with him. Despite Li Siyuan's displeasure (as he felt that they were abandoning him in his illness), he first allowed Zhao to leave to become the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), replacing him with Zhu Hongzhao; and later also allowed Fan to leave to serve as the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), replacing him with Feng. Shortly after, Li Siyuan became deathly ill. Li Congrong wanted to forcibly enter the palace and take control, but his overtures to Zhu and Feng, asking them to go along with his plans, were rebuffed. He subsequently launched his troops and tried to seize control of the palace, but the imperial guards, under orders from Zhu and Feng, resisted and defeated Li Congrong, who was subsequently killed. Li Siyuan then decided to summon Li Conghou back from Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), effectively designating him as heir. Before Li Conghou could arrive, Li Siyuan died, and when Li Conghou arrived at Luoyang, Zhu and Feng supported him to be emperor.  During Li Conghou's reign  As Zhu Hongzhao believed himself to be the person most instrumental to Li Conghou's enthronement, he tried to dominate the court scene. That caused him to eject Li Conghou's most trusted follower, Song Lingxun (), out of Li Conghou's proximity, to be the prefect of Ci Prefecture (Á£ÅÂ∑û, in modern Handan), despite Li Conghou's displeasure. He and Feng Yun similarly distrusted the imperial guard generals An Yanwei () and Zhang Congbin (), and An and Zhang were sent out to be the military governors of Huguo and Zhangyi (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), respectively, and replaced with Zhu Hongshi () and Huangfu Yu (). In spring 934, Li Conghou bestowed on Feng (as well as Zhu and Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong) the greater chancellor title Zhongshu Ling (). Feng, however, tried to decline it as he claimed to be unworthy of it, and so was instead given the slightly less prestigious title of Shizhong (). Meanwhile, Zhu and Feng also distrusted Li Conghou's older adoptive brother, Li Congke the Prince of Lu, who was then serving as the military governor of Fengxiang, and Shi Jingtang, as Li Congke and Shi had long served as generals under Li Siyuan and were respected by the imperial army. Due to their distrust of Li Congke, they ejected Li Congke's son Li Chongji (), who was at that time an officer in the imperial guard corps, to be the military prefect of Bo Prefecture (‰∫≥Â∑û, in modern Bozhou, Anhui), and ordered Li Congke's daughter Li Huiming (), who had previously become a Buddhist nun in a temple at Luoyang, to live in the palace so that they would have control over her. These actions caused Li Congke to become very apprehensive. Shortly after, Zhu and Feng decided that they did not want to allow Shi to remain at Hedong for too long, and they also wanted to recall the eunuch Meng Hanqiong, who had been overseeing the governance of Tianxiong ever since Li Conghou was recalled from Tianxiong. They thus issued a series of orders as chiefs of staff, recalling Meng, and moving Fan Yanguang from Chengde Circuit to Tianxiong, Li Congke from Fengxiang to Hedong, and Shi from Hedong to Chengde. Despite the seriousness of these orders, no edicts were issued by the emperor. Li Congke, fearing that these moves were targeted toward him, rebelled. The imperial government sent the general Wang Sitong to command the operations against Fengxiang, and initially, it appeared that Wang would prevail, as his siege against Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality almost caused it to fall. However, at that time, a group of soldiers, led by Yang Siquan, defected to Li Congke, causing the imperial army, to collapse, with most of the army surrendering to Li Congke. Li Congke then took his army and headed for Luoyang, announcing that all who surrendered to him would be forgiven, except Zhu and Feng. Upon hearing this news, Li Conghou panicked and considered surrendering the throne to Li Congke, and Zhu and Feng were not sure how to react. The imperial guard general Kang Yicheng (), however, who was secretly considering defecting to Li Congke as well, offered to command the remaining imperial forces against Li Congke. Li Conghou agreed. (Meanwhile, Li Chongji and Li Huimin were executed.) Even before Kang's army could meet Li Congke's advancing forces, however, the soldiers began to desert and surrender to Li Congke. Kang himself then did so as well. Upon hearing this, Li Conghou summoned Zhu to try to think of what to do next. Zhu, however, interpreted the command summoning him to be a sign that Li Conghou intended to punish him for his wrong advice, and committed suicide by jumping into a well. The imperial guard general An Congjin then killed Feng and delivered Zhu's and Feng's heads to Li Congke. (Li Conghou fled Luoyang, and was subsequently killed by Li Congke's emissaries after Shi also refused to support him.) Feng's mother had recently died, and both her body and his were abandoned on the road. Feng's wife and children were also killed, except a three-year-old son, who was hidden by his former subordinate Zhang Shousu ().

During the early part of the decade, Doerr proposed a new tax on the city's parochial schools. The tax proposal, which was opposed by the city's Catholic community, was defeated following an effort led by John P. McEnery, the father of a future San Jose mayor, Tom McEnery. Doerr supported the policies of city manager, A. P. Hamann, who spearheaded much of the city's urban expansion during the 1950s and 1960s. Hamann also had San Jose City Hall moved to a new location outside Downtown San Jose in 1958. Doerr served one term as Mayor of San Jose from 1956 to 1958. At that time, the Mayor was chosen from members of the city council, rather than through a direct election. As mayor (and a World War II veteran), Doerr pushed for closer ties between the city and Japan. He established a sister city relationship between San Jose and Okayama. He traveled to Okayama to mark the occasion, where he delivered a speech in Japanese from memory. The city of San Jose also celebrated its centennial in 1957 during his tenure as mayor. At the time of his term of Mayor, a part-time job in a city of little more than 100,00, Doerr taught Civics at Willow Glen High School. He advised all of his students to buy real estate, that San Jose was going to be a big city. Speaking as a former student of that time, I wish I had heeded that bit of wisdom. Doerr resided at the Atrium senior home in South San Jose during his later life. He died on December 5, 2013, at the age of 99.

He was a squatter on land owned by George Washington in Washington County, Pennsylvania. At that time, Washington owned a large parcel of land, totaling 58,000 acres, across Western Pennsylvania, then part of the American frontier. The land had been given to Washington in the District of West Augusta by the Colony of Virginia in consideration of his service during the French and Indian War. In 1777, David Reed, his brother John Reed, brother-in-law Samuel McBride (husband of David and John Reed's sister Lydia) and several other Seceder (or Associate) Presbyterians, moved from Lancaster County to what later became Washington County, Pennsylvania, to take possession of land that they believed themselves to have purchased from Colonel George Croghan,Boyd Crumrine.

Page 27. In 1784, following the end of his service in the Continental Army, Washington traveled to survey his land holdings. Reed and other Scotch-Irish pioneers/squatters had arrived in the 1770s and had settled the land, building fences, log cabins, and communities, which they felt gave them the right to the land. The group referred to themselves as Seceders,Boyd Crumrine. History of Washington County, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co., 1882. Page 858, Column 2, first full paragraph. (Quoted below.) an 18th-century movement within Scottish Presbyterian which spread to the north of Ireland. Washington was intent on enforcing his legal rights to collect back rent. Attempts were made to arrive at a peaceful solution. On September 14, 1784, Washington met with the squatters at his gristmill near present-day Venice. On September 20, 1784, a second meeting was held between Washington, Reed and a group 13 of other squatters. The efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The meeting was recorded in Washington's journal thusly: In October 1786, a trial on the issue was held in Washington, Pennsylvania, with Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Thomas McKean riding circuit as the presiding judge. Though Washington won the suit, he absolved the settlers of back rent, asking only for future rent. Many of the Seceder squatters left the area in response. The Reed brothers acquired farms in Cecil township in Washington County. Samuel McBride settled on a farm in what later became Lawrence County, Pennsylvania.C. F. McBride. Record of Samuel McBride with Lineal Descendants. Youngstown, Ohio: Vindicator Press, 1891. Page 6. In 1950, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission erected a historic marker at the site of his log cabin near Venice, Pennsylvania noting the historic importance of Reed and the squatters. The historical marker mistakenly identifies the Washington County squatters as Covenanters. Reed's descendants include James A. Reed and David A. Reed. One of Samuel and Lydia (Reed) McBride's descendants, Grace Elizabeth (McBride) Crile (1876-1948), was the wife of George Washington Crile.

In western sources, \\"Hulubalang\\" is roughly translated as \\"warlord\\", \\"commander\\", \\"general\\" or simply \\"warrior\\". An early literary reference to the word Hulubalang appears in the Malay Annals. It is mentioned in the text that among four senior nobles of Kingdom of Singapura (1299‚Äì1398), there was a position called Hulubalang Besar ('Grand Hulubalang'), first held by Tun Tempurung, that equivalent to chief of staff of the army, who commands several other Hulubalangs. The legendary strongman of Singapura, Badang, was among the notable Hulubalang of the kingdom, promoted to the rank during the reign of Sri Rana Wikrama. In the 15th century Melaka Sultanate, the rank of Grand Hulubalang as the head of all Hulubalangs was preserved but more commonly known with the title 'Seri Bija Diraja' in the Malay Annals. Among the most notable Seri Bija Diraja of Melaka was Tun Hamzah who lived during the reign of Mansur Shah. He was commonly known for his role along with Tun Perak, in leading the Melakan army to victory against the Siamese invaders and in the conquest of Pahang. As Melaka experiencing rapid expansion of its influence as a maritime empire in mid 15th century, it requires a similar office to control its naval forces separately, thus the rank of Laksamana ('grand admiral') was created, first held by Hang Tuah. In Aceh Sultanate, Iskandar Muda (1583‚Äì1636) established a new nobility of warlords called ule√´balang, whom he gave districts (mukim) in feudal tenure. After his reign, however, the elite often supported weaker sultans, in order to maintain their own autonomy. In Brunei Sultanate, the rank of Manteri Hulubalang (officials of defence) refers to lower ranking non-noble traditional officials.

It ran from 28 December 2019 to 7 January 2020 This Jamboree, unlike earlier ones, has 1 central command centre (known as the hub), with 4 villages surrounding. Villages used to be known as subcamps. Within these villages, there will be a \\"Village Green\\" - A central area to meet with other scouts, trade badges and more. The Jamboree hub is located at the central pavilion. At the hub, you can pay for gas, retrieve birthday cakes, purchase ice, or locate lost items. There is also a charging space and merchandise shop present. Villages were named after lakes which connect with Mystery Creek. These are Maraetai, Arapuni, Waipapa and Ohakuri. This Jamboree has also changed the patrols system to the \\"Teams system\\". Each team consists of a Team Leader, Assistant Team Leader, and team members. There are 6 teams in a troop, similar to previous Jamborees, with 6 patrols to a troop. Each night at Jamboree, each troop has a Team Leader's Council, where each Team Leader decides what they want their Team to do the next day. The Duty Team Leader attends the Jamboree Team Council, with all other Duty Team Leaders that day.This has been promoted due to the new Scouts NZ policy, \\"Youth leading, Adults Supporting\\". Some programme activities have been leaked. These include; Survival; Water; Challenge; Adventure; Lake Karapiro (Overnight base). 21st New Zealand Scout Jamboree The 21st New Zealand Scout Jamboree was held at Renwick Domain, Marlborough in the South Island from 29 December 2016 to 7 January 2017. Giesen Park in Renwick will host the main camp site with four other activity hubs in Picton, Blenheim, Omaka and in Pine Valley. As in almost all Jamborees, the event is divided into a number of sub-camps and attending Scout troops are allocated to a specific sub-camp. Each sub-camp has its own administration and support, provided by volunteers. The event has been welcomed locally with the 4500 participants expected to bring and economic boost to the area. Special transport arrangements have been put in place to get all the Scouts and supporters to and from the site. = Staff = Jamborees provide opportunities for both adults and young people to work as volunteer members of staff (often called the \\"support team\\" to provide a number of services to the Jamboree. Staff members arrive a number of days before the jamboree begins and usually depart on the same day or a few days later to set up the site so that it is ready for the scouts to arrive on opening day. = Youth Staff Team = The Youth Staff team (YST) is a group of about 150 people aged from Yr 12 (in 2016) to 26 years old. These volunteers come from Venturer groups all over the country and some may be from overseas. YST‚Äôs role is to give service and a chance to give back to Scouting.  20th New Zealand Scout Jamboree  The 20th New Zealand Scout Jamboree (also known as NZ20 or MPWR) was held at Manfeild Park, Feilding, New Zealand between 28 December 2013 and 6 January 2014. Manfeild Park, near Feilding, was the main venue for the Jamboree. Some activities were held outside Feilding - for example, the caving base was held on a farm north of Pohangina, near Ashhurst. On the final day of activities, the full-day water-based \\"Water'M\\" activity was cancelled and the Scouts scheduled to attend were taken to the Lido Aquatic Centre in Palmerston North for the afternoon. The 20th New Zealand Scout Jamboree was attended by over 3,000 Scouts and Leaders from New Zealand, Australia, Samoa, the Cook Islands, Indonesia, South Korea, and several other countries. The theme of NZ20 was 'MPWR' - the empowerment of patrols to be independent and responsible scouts at the Jamboree. The patrol leaders were given more responsibility than at the previous Jamboree and had to manage their own timetable and their patrol without an adult leader with them. The Jamboree was split into three sub camps: MBLZN (yellow), MBRK (blue) and MBLDN (red). Each subcamp had a subcamp office that was responsible for running the subcamp.

Instrumental in its formation were Bernard Maurice Connor, Dr. Crawford and Charles Maxwell Lukin. Vernon Hammersley was president in 1906 and initial meetings were held in a disused store. In January 1908 local builder James Barker Meredith of Newcastle won the contract to build the premises, now known as Stirling House. The Perth architect was Richard Joseph Dennehy. The building was opened for meetings in about August of the same year; the official opening ceremony was performed by Admiral Sir Frederick Bedford. (Although no reference is made in the club minutes the old clubrooms were vacant by September.) One of the club's most distinguished members in earlier years was John Forrest who retained his membership until his death in 1918. By July 1975 the Toodyay Club and the Toodyay Bowling Club had amalgamated, and on 12 February 1977 officially celebrated the opening of their new premises in Oldfellows Street (on the site of the old railway stockyards). In the meantime, in October 1976, the Toodyay Shire Council acquired the property.

The screenplay concerns a reporter in search of government corruption who falls for a congressman. Plot On her first trip to Washington, D.C., aspiring reporter Alice Kingsley is shown around by Gilbert Nunnally, a successful radio commentator. Nunnally has a cynical view of the Capitol and everybody in it, expressing his belief that every politician can be bought. Alice wants to see if there is any truth to that, so she chooses a young Massachusetts congressman with a squeaky-clean image, Joe Gresham, and introduces herself. Joe is wary of the press and makes a telephone call to check her credentials, but Alice, having anticipated this, gives him a number for Nunnally, who pretends to be the reporter's editor and vouches for her credentials. Following him around, Alice is impressed by Joe's work ethic and personality. She wonders if veteran politician Charles Birch is a corrupting influence, only to learn that Birch has been a mentor to Joe and is greatly admired. Nunnally persuades Alice that something is going on between Joe and a lobbyist named Phil Emery, who is trying to get Joe's key vote for a bill to pass. Joe is more concerned about its effect on his own constituents than its greater impact. Alice isn't sure what to make of that, or of Joe's seeming disinterest in an elderly immigrant's possible deportation. After a late-night meeting, apparently with Emery, colleagues in Congress end up applauding for Joe after he has a change of heart about the bill. Alice is now persuaded by Nunnally that he sold his vote for a price. She is made aware by Birch that the reason for Joe's attitude toward the press is that he has a libel suit pending against Nunnally in two weeks' time. Nunnally confronts the congressman and offers to suppress the story about Joe selling his vote if the lawsuit is dropped. Joe punches him instead. Alice runs into the immigrant, who tells her how Joe went to great effort making sure he could remain in the country. It was he, not Emery, that the all-night meeting was with, and Alice also learns that Joe had an honest change of heart about the bill, recognizing it was for the greater good. Alice writes a column singing Joe's praises, and they also realize they are in love.

The novel is a sequel to Wong's book John Dies at the End, which was initially published as a webserial and later as a printed novel. This Book Is Full of Spiders was first published in hardback on October 2, 2012 through Thomas Dunne Books and chronicles the further adventures of John and Dave, who are living in an Undisclosed American Midwest town, which has a long history of horrific occurrences with supernatural roots. John and Dave have the unique ability to see things that ordinary people cannot after taking a mysterious drug known as the \\"Soy Sauce\\" during events of John Dies at the End. Synopsis While attending court-ordered therapy session with Dr. Bob Tennet, David shows him a video of a man walking through a door and disappearing instantly, suggesting that the man was teleported someplace else, neglecting to mention that he and John have found and used multiple such doors throughout the city of [Undisclosed]. That night, David is attacked by a spider-like creature in his bedroom, but manages to fight it off. Police officer Burgess arrives to investigate the disturbance, but even looking directly at it, he cannot see the spider, who climbs into his throat. Dave and John take him to the hospital, where the creature takes control of Burgess' body and escapes after killing several people. John proceeds to track him down, but Burgess comes back after David in his home, who manages to decapitate it, before discovering that the spider has laid eggs in his room, which are now hatching. Superstar police detective Falconer arrives to question David, who manages to convince him of the invisible threat. Falconer attempts to quarantine the room, but John and Dave decide to burn the spiders along with the house instead. This backfires when the spiders escape and begin attacking firefighters on the scene, instantly turning their bodies into the violent monsters \\"like Optimus Prime made of meat\\". The entire town is locked off by military, and John and Dave escape through a portal door, but become separated and John believes David to be dead. John travels to a town two hours away where David's girlfriend Amy is attending college and convinces her that they will go back for David soon, and proceeds to spend a week drinking heavily to numb his pain, while panic spreads throughout the country. David is put into the hospital grounds, where a government agency known as REPER had established a quarantine area and uses his unique ability to see the spiders to identity the infected among the new arrivals, who are then immediately executed and burned, keeping the hospital infection-free. Dr. Albert Marcony arrives to investigate the outbreak and reveals to Dave his findings: many of the infected remain completely lucid for days and may potentially never \\"turn\\" into monsters at all. An old tunnel in the basement is discovered and a group attempts to make a break through it. Amy decides to get to David by turning herself it, but is stopped by a group of zombie enthusiast survivalists, and John is captured instead. He is taken to the REPER command center in an asylum next to the hospital and discovers Bob Tennet running the operation before meeting with Falconer. The two decide to break out and John improvises by blowing up oxygen tanks, compromising the containment area and causing the entire REPER force to pull out of town. Amy joins the zombie enthusiasts who travel to [Undisclosed] believing they could help the situation. They venture into the now abandoned asylum building and when the group from the hospital arrives through a tunnel, they panic and massacre them all, only for the sounds to attract the actual monsters, who slaughter them in turn. David's dog Molly leads Amy into the REPER command center, where Amy begins to gain access to their system. John improvises a rescue mission for David by ramping his Cadillac over the quarantine's security perimeter, then using it to breach it from the inside. A town mob that believes everyone inside the hospital to be infected and beyond hope attempts to stop them, but John and Dave escape through a portal door and reach the asylum, where they reunite with Amy. They meet an infected man named Carlos, who reveals to them the true extent of the situation: there are way, way more infected than anyone estimates, and it had been that way for a very, very long time. However, most of the infected either have no idea or manage to keep their parasites in check, and the outbreak happened only because Tennet and others like him have found an infrasound frequency that causes the spiders to turn their hosts into monsters and go into frenzy. Because anyone, anywhere can be carrying a parasite and the infected are clearly recognized as no longer human, the entire scenario was engineered to cause a mass paranoia, which will lead to the breakdown of society, and the government now plans to carpet-bomb the entire town to hide the fact that only a small minority was ever infected. John, David and Amy decide to stop the aerial bombardment by destroying the REPER signal jammer which prevents the inhabitants from getting the truth out. They bring out the \\"furgun\\" - a weapon they acquired on a previous occasion which can shape reality according to its wielder, but is extremely dangerous and difficult to control. They reach the jammer, where they are apprehended by REPER and Dr. Tennet, but Falconer, disguised as a REPER operative, busts them out and together they take Tennet into the blast zone, but he refuses to call off the attack. With only minutes left, John arranges the town inhabitants into the shape of a giant human penis, proving to the pilots that people inside [Undisclosed] are undeniably human. The bombs are still released onto the REPER command center, destroying all signs of their involvement. Desperate to finish his mission Tennet emits the special signal, which turns out the entire REPER force, who have been infected all along, into monsters who begin attacking the military. The \\"shadow men\\" - malevolent beings outside of time and reality - begin closing in on John and David, who in panic uses the furgun to summon a traditional depiction of Jesus, which burns the shadow men as well as the spiders that control the REPER force. A stray bullet is about to hit Amy, but David's dog Molly puts herself in its path, and with the signal jammer down John livestreams the video of small, harmless, definitely non- zombified girl crying over her dog to show that the people of [Undisclosed] are still human to the entire world. In the end, only 68 people are confirmed to have been truly infected, while 406 more have been killed during the mass hysteria. David makes a hobby of telling a brand new version of the events to each reporter who approaches him and plans to make up an even crazier one for his eventual book, revealing to the reader that not everything written was true..  Characters  * David Wong: Author surrogate and the primary protagonist. He holds a job in a video rental store and has to attend court- mandated therapy sessions after accidentally injuring a bystander during his latest encounter with a supernatural threat. During the initial outbreak, a misunderstanding causes David to believe that his girlfriend Amy might be inside the town, which leads to him going back and becoming separated from John. While in quarantine David is administered a drug which causes him to lose a chunk of time, after which he has to rediscover his own actions during the last week. A single remark during the novel hints that David is not quite human himself; he was in fact killed and replaced with a doppelg√§nger of unknown origin with all of David's memories during the events of John Dies at the End, of which only he, John and Amy are aware. * John: David's best friend and the secondary protagonist during the sections of events in which David is not present. John is capable of quick thinking, but is also very reckless, and at several points his involvement only makes the situation worse. After an accident with a teleporting door leads him to see only a splatter of brains where David should be, John believes his friend to be dead, but doesn't have the nerve to tell Amy and a tries to drink his pain away instead. After breaking himself and Falconer out of the asylum, John takes a dose of the Soy Sauce, which allows him to stop time, but leaves him completely unable to manipulate any of the environment while doing so. * Amy Sullivan: David's girlfriend who attends college in a nearby town, who becomes a point of view character after having only supporting role in the previous book. Amy struggles with constant back pain and is missing her left hand as a result of the car accident a few years ago, and during the climax of the novel one of the Shadow Men passes through Amy's left hand, erasing it from history retroactively. After hearing about the initial attack by the infected officer Burgess on the news, Amy takes the bus to [Undisclosed] despite David's protests and arrives just in time for the outbreak, which leads David to believe that she might be in danger, while she is in fact stopped by the military before she can enter town. Amy spends a week planning on how to reach Dave, and when John proves to be of no help, attempts to turn herself in before taking a ride back with a group of zombie enthusiasts, despite never taking them seriously and viewing them as children. After she reaches the main headquarters of REPER which were abandoned in a great hurry, Amy uses both her computer knowledge and social engineering to gain access to their systems, which provides the invaluable knowledge and allows her to call for outside help. * Lance Falconer: A famous police detective who arrives to [Undisclosed] to investigate the original attack by officer Burgess. Falconer instantly suspects David Wong and is about to arrest him after finding him with Burgess' body, but David manages to convince him of what is really going on by allowing a spider to bite him on his arm, which to Falconer looks like a patch of skin instantly disappearing. After John and Dave accidentally violate his initial orders to keep the spiders contained, Falconer begins to blame them for the outbreak and the resulting deaths, but changes his mind after he is apprehended by REPER, allowing him to see that the whole thing was specifically orchestrated. Throughout the novel, Falconer is described as wearing impossibly cool clothes, driving a Porsche which no cop could possibly afford and being recognized from his previous famous exploits everywhere. In the aftermath of the events, Falconer reveals that while many key participants managed to secure book deals, he did not because his perspective was too familiar to John's and David's, whom he spend the majority of his time with. David agrees to take him on as a collaborator for his own book and promises to embellish both his role and his character to an absurd degree, which evidently happened. * Doctor Albert Marconi: A television personality with actual knowledge of the supernatural, who became an acquaintance of John and David during the events of John Dies at the End. John contacts him after the outbreak and Marconi willingly enters the quarantine area, where he spends a week tending to the patients. Marconi discovers that David's method of detecting the infection is imperfect, as he was only checking the patients' mouths while the parasite can also enter the body through the anus. Despite this, Marconi finds that the infected in the hospital show no discernible symptoms and do not \\"monster out\\" for days, while those infected during the initial outbreak did so immediately, under the live cameras. This allows Marconi to deduce that the goal of the outbreak was not to infect the population, but to spread fear and paranoia, breaking down the fabric of trust that allows the society to function. The novel also contains excerpts from Marconi's fictional book \\"Science and Beyond\\". * Owen: An acquaintance of John who is put into the quarantine, where he discovers the only working gun left there by mistake and uses it to give himself the authority to establish rules. Owen and his followers proceed to execute and burn everyone identified as infected by David, relying on his ability to see the spiders, despite not trust his character. * Dr. Bob Tennet: David's court-appointed therapist and an expert on mass panic and crowd behavior, which leads the government to turn to his expertise during the outbreak. Tennet's exact nature is left unclear: he himself claims to have a wife and kids and insists that he does not known the identities of his superiors and only does what needs to be done; Marconi theorizes that Tennet's decades of practice and multiple published works are real because he retroactively made them so, creating the exact persona that would be in the position to take control when time came as needed; while Carlos reveals that he sees Tennet as one of the Shadow Men, but he does not behave in the way that other Shadow Men encountered by John and David do. * Carlos: An man infected with a parasite and a father of an eight-year old named Anna. She turns into a monster when she is scared, but for her that situation is not new and Carlos has been aware of it the whole time. The revelations made by Carlos confirm Marconi's information and complicate the situation for Dave, John and Amy, as the infected are not only proved capable of being non-hostile, but are shown to be far more numerous and widespread to eliminate completely. Reception Critical reception for This Book Is Full of Spiders has been predominantly positive. Publishers Weekly and Tor.com both praised the novel, Tor.com highlighting the character of Amy as one of their favorite parts of the book. SF Signal gave This Book Is Full of Spiders an overwhelmingly positive review, stating that it was \\"Kevin Smith's Clerks meets H. P.

The area served covered the Australian Capital Territory, as well as parts of New South Wales including the South Coast, Southern Tablelands, Central West and Riverina regions as far south as the border with Victoria. SouthCare operated a single Bell 412 (VH-NSC) through CHC Helicopters Australia, with medical crews provided by the Capital Region Retrieval Service, a part of the ACT Government Health Directorate. The service was backed by significant funding from Hydro-electric energy company Snowy Hydro. By the time the service ceased, SouthCare had conducted 6,963 missions. Missions flown by the helicopter included primary, or rescue missions where patients are stabilised and transported to major hospitals from accident scenes. Secondary missions involved patient transfers between major and regional hospitals to access urgent specialist treatment. Other missions include search and rescue and aerial firefighting. The aircraft was based at a dedicated facility for emergency services helicopters located in Symonston, adjacent to the Monaro Highway. In April 2017, Toll Group commenced operating an Agusta-Westland AW139 from the Canberra SouthCare base as part of the NSW Ambulance's new statewide helicopter retrieval network. History Established in October 1998, the SouthCare helicopter service participated in a major maritime rescue operation in December of that year when the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race fleet encountered severe weather conditions, resulting in the loss of 6 lives and 5 yachts. The SouthCare crews rescued nine sailors from two stricken vessels, Stand Aside and Midnight Special. As recognition for their role in the rescue, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia made a donation of $20,000 to the service in 2002. In 1999, Canberra International Airport signed a five-year agreement to allow SouthCare to operate from the airport exempt from rent. The interim measure allowed the service to maintain its operations while planning and construction of a dedicated facility progressed. On 13 January 2003, the helicopter was carrying Chief Minister Jon Stanhope with the Territory's Chief Fire Control Officer surveying bushfires burning in the Namadgi National Park near Canberra. The helicopter responded to an emergency call when a second helicopter involved in water-bombing operations crashed into Bendora Dam. Both Stanhope and Fire Officer Peter Lucas-Smith joined the SouthCare paramedic in the subsequent rescue, stripping down to their underwear and swimming to the sinking helicopter and pulling the unconscious pilot from the sinking aircraft. All three men received bravery medals for their role in the rescue. In the following days the helicopter was engaged in water bombing activities during the 2003 Canberra bushfires disaster. In June 2013, SouthCare successfully applied for a $500,000 grant from the Australian Government's Regional Development Fund. The money was to be used to fund the construction of an administration- and training facility at the Symonston base. From 2017, the service will be part of the NSW Helicopter Retrieval Network and will upgrade to an AgustaWestland AW139. In November 2016, the entire board of Snowy Hydro SouthCare resigned over incoming Helicopter Provider Toll's takeover of sponsorship arrangement for the service, include the naming rights sponsor. Toll Air Ambulance began operating the ACT region's service on 3 April 2017. Funding In addition to naming rights sponsor Snowy Hydro, the service is widely supported through local business and community sponsorship as well as volunteer participation to help raise awareness for SouthCare. In 2013, sponsorship raised just over $1,000,000 while donations from the community raised a further $623,000. Additionally, the service sells merchandise and holds regular fund raising events, such as public open days at its Symonston base. Additionally, the ground infrastructure is jointly funded by both the ACT Government and NSW Health who provide 24 hour medical staff as well as training facilities.

Rose has been introduced in Canadian heraldry from the late 20th century. It is now considered a colour in Canadian heraldry, along with azure (blue), gules (red), vert (green) and sable (black). The colour features in the coat of arms of former Canadian prime minister Kim Campbell. It remains to be seen whether the tincture will be used in heraldic arms in other countries. Although similar, it should not be confused with the tincture carnation used in French heraldry. Carnation is the color used to depict pale human skin, and tends to be light pinkish-peach. Rose is much brighter, more highly saturated, and closer to pink than carnation. No hatching pattern has been given to rose, since this colour is more recent than Fox-Davies' Complete Guide to Heraldry, the source of hatching patterns used in modern heraldry. As such, a logical option for hatching might be a semy of right-leaning slashes‚Äîmixing purpure, represented with right-leaning solid lines, and argent, represented with blank space.

Catalogue of the exhibition Miralda De gustibus non disputandum, 2010 and chef Montse Guill√©nCraig Claiborne. Sampling the Zesty Catalan Cuisine, The New York Times, August 18, 1982 in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It was an initiative which blended contemporary art and cuisine. The restaurant's became an iconic symbol of the New York scene of the 80s. The project engaged food, sensorial experiences and installation art as vehicles and rituals for transmitting and subverting traditions and blending social practices of the time. El Internacional was seen as a point of convergence for the artistic community, and, at the same time, as a real place that engaged neighbors and celebrities alike in its culinary inventions and exotic allure. El Internacional was an ongoing process of the almost 3-year day-by-day creation of a work of installation and performance art. El Internacional was a team project and a collective work of art. The space framed the experience and interactions around food as clients ended up being participants in a multi- layered experience few had imagined. The visit led to unexpected situations and stimulating relationships between art, design, architecture and the mass media.  History  El Internacional was the first restaurant to introduce the tapas in the United States.Gael Green. The Tapa Dance Kid, New York Magazine, November 12, 1984 The tapas recreated the presence of Spain, the Mediterranean, Catalonia, and Barcelona, as filtered by through the personal visions of Miralda and Montse Guill√©n. At the time, Miralda was preparing his traveling work, Honeymoon Project, in which a series of ceremonial events would commemorate the imaginary wedding between the monuments of Columbus in Barcelona and Statue of Liberty in the Upper New York Bay from 1985 to 1992.Maria Llu√Øsa Borr√†s. Colon & Liberty: Luna de Miel Honeymoon. Catalogue of the Spanish Pavilion. 44 Biennale di Venezia, Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores. Ambit Servicios Editoriales, Barcelona, 1990 = Location = The Archaeological Sandwich display case The El Internacional project began with the choosing of its location. In the 1970s, Miralda had lived across the street from Teddy's, a Tribeca restaurant, and was fascinated by the presence of this restaurant, unaware of its history. Between 1920 and 1945 Teddy‚Äôs was believed to have been a popular restaurant serving German food, located at 217 West Broadway where Edgar Allan Poe had supposedly lived. In 1945 the owner, Teddy Bartel, sold the restaurant to Sal Cucinotta who would build, at 217 and 219 West Broadway, the luxuriously emblematic Italian restaurant Teddy‚Äôs, which attracted numerous stars from the movie and entertainment industry in the '50s and '60s. At the end of the '60s, while under new management, the fa√ßade and interior of the building were renovated once more, but the restaurant ended up closing supposedly due to Mafia connections. Miralda and Guill√©n described the El Internacional project as a contemporary archaeological space, an actual Archaeological Sandwich5 Ronald Christ. El Internacional An Archaeological Sandwich, Sites 14, New York, 1985 that Miralda reproduced on one of the walls and on which he placed elements found and collected during rebuilding, encrusting them into the walls rather like the layers of an ancient archeological site. The El Internacional project thus became the melding of Teddy‚Äôs and El Internacional as a dynamic melting pot of design, architecture, art, fashion and cuisine.  Description =Interior= The Turquoise Dining Room, on the back the open kitchen The carpet Flag Entrance, on the way of the bar The fa√ßade was redrawn on the existing one, like an optical illusion, and the building underwent a total transfiguration without erasing its previous architecture. Beneath the new fa√ßade, the camouflaged name of Teddy‚Äôs was still present. From the street, the restaurant appeared to be like an enigmatic construction site/work of art causing unexpected reactions from the onlookers. The first thing visitors saw when arriving at the Terraza Sol y Sombra that had cans of beverages encrusted into the sidewalk (Coca-Cola and other soda cans) like relics or fossils, and a window where the Video Menu was shown on a monitor that presented the dishes, drinks and experiences available inside. Through the front window one could see the bar, and at the end, the kitchen window, this being one of the first open kitchens that existed in the city. Patrons got to the restaurant through the Flag Entrance, a floor comprising flags from numerous countries symbolizing and celebrating the diversity of New York, and then on to the Columbus Trophy Bar, with the presence of the Columbus Column of Barcelona on the bottles, and the famous cocktail Blue Margarita created at El Internacional. The tour continued through the 4 theme rooms. First was the Turquoise Dining Room which incorporated a wall of tiles, white, turquoise and gilt from the 20s found during refurbishment. After that was the Carnation Room, a dining room in which the walls became an atlas of kisses where the diners would make the place their own by writing comments on the walls and leaving their kisses. Then, the Sentimental Room had the video installation of images of the celebrities that frequented the golden era of Teddy‚Äôs ‚Äì Elizabeth Taylor, Groucho Marx, Anthony Quinn, and Sophia Loren, among others. Finally, the Marina Room where four dried and salted cods presided over the dining room from the floor and the Sweet Ceiling was decorated with meringue- like stalactites. The wall that separated the Turquoise and Carnation Rooms was an aquarium from which visitors could see the Mermaid - brought back by Miralda from Bahia, Brazil - representing Yemoja, the goddess patron of the ocean and of motherhood. Other objects such as the Lobster Dream Lamp, the Matador Candelabra, the Black World Expresso, the Barcelona-New York Wedding Cake and the Liberty Crown Brochette marked the restaurant as a cultural destination, unusual museum, and adventurous cuisine and lively social spectacle. = Events = At El Internacional events were a hybrid of celebration, food and performance such as Face to Face in which 70 pairs of twins on Valentine‚Äôs Day would sit in front of identical dishes with different tastes, or the Crowning Ceremony during which the roof of the building was fitted with a life size replica of the crown of the statue of liberty. Others included the Porr√≥n Olympics, the Miami Vice Shooting, The Original Rapper by Lou Reed and the Saturday Night Live Show. El Internacional Newspaper was given to clients as they entered, as part of the menu. Four issues were published, each one printed in a different color, with texts about the environment and the food. The international, multi-lingual staff of the restaurant was integrated into all aspects of the operation and even the customers were influenced by the aesthetics of the place and ended up wearing black and white like the fa√ßade. = Legacy = El Internacional was part and witness of a social and cultural chronicle of Tribeca, originally an industrial area to which the artistic community started to move at the start of the 1980s. It was a destination, especially at night, with the Palladium in Midtown and the Area Night Club in Tribeca, both places that also began to mean fusion at the time. Celebrities among its clientele included Andy Warhol, Sara Montiel, Jean Michel Basquiat, Pina Bausch, Robert de Niro, David Byrne, Umberto Eco, Antonio Gades, Keith Haring, Michael Douglas, Grace Jones, Diane Keaton, John F. Kennedy Jr., David Lynch, and Frank Zappa, among others. The interest generated by El Internacional, also had great repercussions in the media: television, press and magazines such as The New York Times, New York Magazine, The Village Voice, The Face magazine, Architectural Record, Metropolis, and Gourmet magazine. For years the image of the crown of the Statue of Liberty on the roof of the restaurant and the bar became the opening title sequence of the NBC TV Network‚Äôs Saturday Night Live Show. El Internacional and its Tapas Bar was the unofficial landmark of cool downtown in 80‚Äôs New York. Shortly after Miralda and Montse Guillen withdrew from the day-to-day running of El Internacional to inaugurate in the same year, 1986, the Honeymoon Project, the identity of the restaurant and the management changed. The restaurant became El Teddy‚Äôs, specializing in Mexican food. In 2000, Steven Elghanyan, from the Epic development firm, bought the building from Sal Cucinotta for nearly 3 million dollars and started what was to be a long, intense debate seeking to prevent the immediate demolition of the building, its memory and its iconic crown, with the support of the City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the neighbors. The case was lost and the restaurant was demolished to make way for a new 7-story apartment building in 2004.

It is bounded by Plaza Santa Cruz and Escolta Street to the west, Carlos Palanca Street (formerly Echague Street) to the south, and Carriedo Street to the east. Although the plaza is not considered the center of Santa Cruz, as it is located behind the Santa Cruz Church rather than in front of it, the plaza is considered to be one of the most important squares in Manila. Originally named after Martin de Goiti, who founded the City of Manila in 1571, it was renamed by Mayor Lito Atienza in 2003 after Arsenio Lacson, who previously served as mayor of Manila from 1952 to 1962. History A print of the pre-World War II Plaza Goiti. Prior to World War II, Plaza Lacson was considered the heart of Manila, and constituted part of the city's downtown area, which also included Plaza Santa Cruz, Rizal Avenue and Escolta Street. Commercial activity shifted to here from Binondo in large part due to infrastructure improvements made during the American colonial period to improve access to the northern half of the city, which were centered on the plaza. These included the completion of the Santa Cruz Bridge in 1902,City of Manila (1903). \\"Report of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila, 1902\\", pg. 28. Bureau of Printing, Manila. and the opening of the Manila tram system a few years later, which had its central terminal at the plaza. The area around the plaza was largely commercial, with bars and restaurants that catered largely to American servicemen either visiting or stationed in the Philippines, complementing the luxury stores along Escolta and the theaters around Plaza Santa Cruz. On June 21, 1919, the Philippines' first transport-related terrorist attack took place at the plaza, when a bomb hidden inside a parcel was lit by a Meralco mechanic as a tram was about to enter the Plaza Goiti station. Though discovered by the conductor, thus avoiding passenger casualties, the bomb killed a thirteen-year-old newsboy and injured eight other pedestrians after the conductor threw the bomb onto the street. The attack, which culminated five weeks after some 600 Meralco employees affiliated with the Congreso Obrero de Filipinas went on strike, not only derailed tram operations until mid-July, but also indirectly led to the 1920 Manila massacre, which led to the deaths of 11 people, including six policemen. Santa Cruz was largely spared from bombing during World War II, and after the war the plaza was still a center for business and commerce throughout much of the 1940s and 1950s. However, heavy traffic congestion contributed to the area's decline, with businesses eventually relocating to Makati. In the 1970s, under Mayor Ramon Bagatsing, a statue of Arsenio Lacson was erected in the middle of the plaza, created by Eduardo Castrillo. In 2003, under Mayor Lito Atienza, the plaza was renamed Plaza Lacson and was pedestrianized as part of a wider pedestrianization of Rizal Avenue. However, in 2007, with the election of Alfredo Lim as mayor of Manila, the pedestrianized portions of the plaza were reopened to vehicular traffic. Surrounding buildings and structures The Roman R. Santos Building is the major landmark of Plaza Lacson. First built in 1894, it is one of Manila's few surviving examples of pre-World War II neoclassical architecture. A number of notable buildings and structures have been built in and around the vicinity of Plaza Lacson. Aside from the Santa Cruz Church on its north side, the plaza's most famous landmark is the Roman R. Santos Building, one of Manila's few surviving examples of pre-World War II neoclassical architecture. The building, first built in 1894 and expanded in 1957, was the headquarters of Prudential Bank until 2005, when it was acquired by Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI). BPI continues to maintain a branch on the building's ground floor. Previously, however, the building was the headquarters of the Monte de Piedad Savings Bank, the former banking institution of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, from 1894 to 1937, and also served as an American Red Cross- operated hospital from 1945 to 1947. Other Philippine financial institutions have had their headquarters around the plaza at some point in their history. Security Bank was headquartered at the ground floor of the Roman R. Santos Building from its establishment in 1951 until 1954, when the building was still under the ownership of its prior owner, Consolidated Investments.Lao Chit v. Security Bank & Trust Co. and Consolidated Investments, Inc. , G.R. No. L-11028, 17 April 1959. Philtrust Bank opened its headquarters at the plaza in 1950, located beside the Santa Cruz Church, and remained here until it relocated to its current headquarters along United Nations Avenue. The building still houses the bank's Santa Cruz branch. Located beside the Philtrust Bank building was the Ideal Theater, the first major building designed by Pablo Antonio, said to be the Philippines' foremost Modernist architect. Unfortunately, the building was demolished in the 1970s to make way for a shopping mall. There are also significant transport-related structures which are in the vicinity of the plaza. The Philippines' first traffic light was installed in the plaza in 1938, and although Manila's tram network was dismantled after World War II, the LRT Line 1 Carriedo station is located on the opposite end of the plaza, at the intersection of Carriedo Street and Rizal Avenue.

It is owned and operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jinja. Location The hospital is located in the village of Buluba, in Mayuge District, Busoga sub-region, Eastern Region of Uganda. This location is approximately , by road, north-west of Mayuge, where the district headquarters are located. Buluba is approximately , by road, south of Iganga, the nearest large town.

Overview St. Francis Hospital Buluba, is a rural community hospital, that serves the population of Mayuge District. It is the only General Hospital in the district. Due to the good quality of services rendered, many patients travel from other parts of the country to seek services at this facility. History The hospital was founded in 1934 by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters for Africa. Eventually, the Franciscan Sisters handed over the hospital to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jinja. The diocese entrusted the management and administration of the hospital to a native religious congregation of Franciscan Sisters, the Little Sisters of St. Francis. In the beginning, the hospital specialized in the treatment of leprosy, which was endemic in the area. Wanda B≈Çe≈Ñska, a Polish expert in tropical diseases, worked there from 1951 to 1994 and developed the hospital into an internationally recognized centre for leprosy treatment. Later, the hospital added tuberculosis to the diseases it specializes in. Buluba Hospital maintains a prosthetic unit (initiated by B≈Çe≈Ñska), one of the few in the country. As of January 2014, while the hospital attended to all general medical problems, they were adept and experienced in handling patients with leprosy and tuberculosis. Often, these patients also suffered from HIV/AIDS.

He was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. He was born at Stoney Stanton in Leicestershire. Cricket career Pratt was just 16 when he made his first-class cricket debut for Leicestershire in 1955, and only 17 when he took 10 Somerset wickets for a total of 60 runs in a match in 1956. But after this promising start he largely disappeared from county cricket for the next three seasons, making only occasional appearances for Leicestershire while he was doing his National Service, but playing also in a handful of first-class games for the Combined Services cricket team. In one of those occasional Leicestershire games in the summer of 1959 he revealed hitherto unseen batting skills: it was his 19th first-class game, and his innings of 80 against Essex was a bigger total than all of his previous innings combined, and was to remain his highest score. Pratt returned to county cricket in 1960 and for the next four seasons was a fairly regular member of the Leicestershire first team, usually acting as the third seam bowler after Terry Spencer and, often, Brian Boshier and batting around No 7 in the order ‚Äì Leicestershire in this period had a very long tail. He had some successes as a batsman: in June 1960, for example, he made 71 against Hampshire and later in the same month there was 62 against Nottinghamshire. He did not improve on his previous best bowling figures in 1960, but in 1961 against Glamorgan, opening the bowling with Spencer, he took seven for 47 and these were the best bowling figures of his career. He took 65 wickets in 1961, and this was the best seasonal return of his career. Pratt missed the whole of the first half of the 1962 season, not appearing in the first team until July, a period in which Leicestershire failed to record a single victory in 13 County Championship matches. He then took 50 wickets and, although Leicestershire still finished at the bottom of the Championship table, in the last game of the season they came close to beating the Champions, Yorkshire, with Pratt taking 11 wickets in the match. Pratt's first-class career then tailed off in the 1963 and 1964 seasons: in 1963, he was a regular in the team until the end of June, but then reappeared in only the last two games; and in 1964, he made only eight first-class appearances. In both seasons, he played in Leicestershire's single matches in the Gillette Cup one-day competition. He scored 25 and took the first three wickets, albeit expensively, in the first- ever English List A match in 1963; Leicestershire were so comprehensively thumped in 1964 that he did not even get on to bowl. At the end of the 1964 season, he left the Leicestershire staff.

Argentina has long suffered from widespread and endemic corruption. Corruption remains a serious problem in the public and private sector even though the legal and institutional framework combating corruption is strong in Argentina. A 1996 New York Times article noted that \\"payoffs, kickbacks and government corruption are considered part of everyday life\\" in Argentina. Bribery and fraud are also found common among the private sector, and the lack of transparency in government regulations and laws has triggered an increased uncertainty among investors.Business-Anti-Corruption Portal Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 85th place out of 180 countries The Financial Action Task Force removed Argentina from its \\"gray list\\" in October 2014, noting significant progress made by the country in improving its legislation and procedures against money laundering and illicit financing.  Extent  Argentina was ranked 106th out of 177 countries in Transparency International's 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index. It ranked 11th out of 20 countries surveyed in Latin America. Argentina fared even more poorly in the corruption rankings on the 2012‚Äì13 Global Competitiveness Report, issued by the World Economic Forum. Out of 152 countries surveyed, Argentina was named the 145th least corrupt, meaning that only seven countries in the world were more corrupt according to the WEF. The Financial Times noted in 2013 that in Argentina corruption is widely considered to be \\"engrained\\", and \\"there is the sense that public officials are untouchable\\". In May 2013, sociologist Atilio Bor√≥n lamented that \\"the Argentinian is very accustomed to the idea that governments are corrupt, and does not seem shocked at acts of corruption,\\" and that the corruption of politicians therefore does not prevent their reelection. \\"This is an economy that for the past 20 years has tolerated a legal drain of over 160 billion dollars,\\" he added, \\"and this it now coming to take its revenge.\\" A CIPCE (Center for the Investigation and Prevention of Economic Crimes) study concluded that public sector corruption alone cost the national treasury around US$10 billion from 1980 to 2006. A major Argentine newspaper, La Naci√≥n, editorialized in October 2013 that although corruption has been a major problem in Argentina since the 1890s, it has been \\"on the increase\\" since the 1990s. WikiLeaks cables released in 2011 revealed that diplomats from the United States and several other Western countries had expressed deep concern about the current levels of corruption in Argentina. \\"Under President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner,\\" reported the Heritage Foundation in 2013, \\"respect for markets and the rule of law has deteriorated and corruption has boomed.\\" According to Transparency International, Argentina has sufficient legislation and institutions dedicated to the prosecution of corruption in the public sector, but enforcement is highly inadequate, with the result that \\"impunity continues to trump integrity.\\" History There is a long history of serious corruption in Argentina. \\"Ever since independence, almost 200 years ago Argentina's foreign debt has been a source of impoverishment and corruption and the biggest scandals.\\" Likewise, rumors or allegations of corruption have frequently been publicized by feuding political figures or factions in Argentina by way of undermining rivals. =Baring Brothers incident= The earliest major episode in the history of corruption in Argentina began with an 1824 loan from the British banking house Baring Brothers, which was \\"the leader in financing Argentina's economic development for upwards of sixty years and the major issuer of that country's loans,\\" with Baring Brothers' Argentine loans totaling ¬£19.2 million by the late 1880s (nearly US$100 million). In August 1888, however, Baring Brothers was unable to place ¬£10 million of shares and debentures in Buenos Aires Water Supply & Drainage Company, a firm that was \\"denounced as a feeding trough for corrupt politicians and rapacious foreign capitalists.\\" Baring Brothers' inability to dispose of these and other Argentinian holdings placed the firm in acute distress, forcing the Bank of England to arrange a rescue in which J.P. Morgan & Co. played the major role. The Baring Brothers episode was an important chapter not only in the history of Argentinian economics but also in the history of the global stock market. According to one source, \\"scandals surrounding corruption claims in connection with the loan damaged both Buenos Aires and London.\\" =Miguel Ju√°rez Celman= President Miguel Ju√°rez Celman, who was in office from 1886 to 1890, came to the presidency as a result of electoral fraud. Through a policy known as \\"Unicato,\\" Ju√°rez Celman, who opposed universal suffrage and considered it to be always an error \\"to consult the people,\\" assumed total power in Argentina, bringing together the forces of business and politics in ways that enabled both to profit at the expense of the state treasury. An English newspaper of the time is quoted as describing Argentine corruption as follows: \\"Today there are dozens of men in government who are publicly accused of malpractice, who in any civilized country would be quickly punished with imprisonment, and yet none of them have been brought to justice. Meanwhile Celman is at liberty to enjoy the comfort of his farm and no one thinks to punish him.\\" Ju√°rez Celman was, however, eventually removed from office in the Revolution of 1890, amid allegations of corruption. =The Infamous Decade= The period between 1930 and 1943, starting when General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu came to power in the 1930 coup, was known as the Infamous Decade owing to the high degree of corruption involving business, and both the ruling Concordance party and its opponents. This period was marked by electoral fraud, persecution of political opponents, and government corruption generally. The key scandal of the era centered on CHADE (Compan√≠a Hispano Argentina de Electricidad), a supplier of electricity, whose bribery of officials was so transparent that the recipients of the bribes were known as \\"chad√≠stas.\\" Another widely reported case at the time was that of the President (Speaker) of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, Juan Kaiser, who resigned in 1940 following revelations that he had profited from the sale of of Army land in the upscale Buenos Aires suburb of El Palomar. =\\"Prosecutor of the Nation\\"= Lisandro de la Torre, who was a Senator in the 1930s, earned the nickname \\"Prosecutor of the Nation\\" for the investigation into the corruption-ridden Argentine beef trade that he spearheaded in 1935. During the investigation, a disciple of de la Torre's, Enzo Bordabehere, was murdered by Ram√≥n V√°ldez Cora, who was believed to have been out to kill de la Torre himself. =Juan Domingo Per√≥n= Brink Lindsey of the Wall Street Journal noted that before Per√≥n took power (Per√≥n ruled Argentina from 1946 to 1955, and then again from 1973 to 1974), Argentina's Supreme Court justices experienced little political tampering, and that \\"at the beginning of Per√≥n's first administration in 1946, Supreme Court justices averaged 12 years on the bench.\\" Since 1946, wrote Lindsey, \\"It's been downhill,\\" with the Supreme Court \\"reduced to a puppet of executive power.\\" In 1950, writes one source, \\"Argentina's postwar export boom tapered off, and inflation and corruption grew.\\" Per√≥n was overthrown in September 1955 by a military coup; but while around 2,000 Peronist officials were detained, only 167 were charged with any crime (corruption or otherwise) despite confessions extracted under duress, and ultimately none were convicted. One of Per√≥n's salient legacies was the rise of the CGT labor federation, which remained among the nation's most powerful institutions even after his overthrow. The CGT diversified their growing resources through investment banking via the Banco Sindical, captive insurance, and real estate, such that by 1965 union dues accounted for only a third of the CGT's income. While these profits financed an array of generous benefits for the rank-and-file, a thriving balance sheet also increasingly engendered corruption among union leaders. Many solicited bribes from employers using the threat of strike action and one ‚Äì Commercial Union leader Armando March ‚Äì was convicted in 1969 of embezzling up to US$30 million from his union's accounts over the course of the decade. =Isabel Per√≥n and the Triple A= Per√≥n returned to Argentina in 1973 and died in office a year later. His widow and successor, Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, was ousted in a March 1976 coup amid mounting political and economic chaos as well as congressional investigations into embezzlement charges of her own. She was indicted two months after the coup for the use in 1975 of around a million dollars from the Cruzada de Solidaridad charity fund to settle a probate dispute with the late Eva Duarte's family. The Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A) death squad, which claimed 1,100 to 2,000 lives, reached the height of its influence during Mrs. Per√≥n's tenure. Organized in 1973 by Per√≥n's secretary, Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, it was largely financed by funds embezzled from the Ministry of Social Welfare (to which L√≥pez Rega was appointed Minister). Some Triple A squad leaders ‚Äì notably Rodolfo Almir√≥n, An√≠bal Gordon, and Ra√∫l Guglielminetti ‚Äì perpetrated numerous high-profile ransom kidnappings in subsequent years with the cooperation of both criminal gangs such as the Puccio family and rogue elements in the police and intelligence services. =Montoneros and David Graiver= The Triple A's chief nemesis at the time, the far-left terrorist group Montoneros, claimed up to 1,000 lives from 1970 until their elimination in 1976. They also perpetrated a number of high-profile ransom kidnappings, notably that of Jorge and Juan Born in September 1974. The Born brothers, directors of what was then one of Argentina's largest conglomerates (Bunge y Born) paid US$60 million for their release in June 1975, a world record at the time. At least US$14 million of these proceeds were laundered by David Graiver, a real-estate developer. Graiver fled Argentina in 1975 and settled in Manhattan, from where he bought controlling stake in a variety of banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. He reportedly died in a plane crash near Acapulco in August 1976, however, leaving US$45 million in bad debts that resulted in the collapse of American Bank & Trust ‚Äì at the time the 4th largest bank failure in U.S. history. District Attorney Robert Morgenthau was skeptical that Graiver died in the crash, and indicted Graiver for the failure of American Bank & Trust; Graiver's banks in Argentina and elsewhere also failed. New York Judge Arnold Fraiman ultimately ruled in January 1979 that Graiver was deceased, although he did so with reservations. =Military junta= Argentina was subsequently ruled for seven years by a right-wing dictatorship that oversaw a reign of terror. General Jorge Videla, who was dictator of Argentina from 1976 to 1981, presided over most of the Dirty War abuses, including extensive kidnapping and torture, thousands of forced disappearances, the murders of some 13,000 to 30,000 dissidents and political enemies and their families at secret detention camps, and the kidnapping and sale of around 500 babies born at the camps. Their property was often seized without due process via an agency created for the purpose known as CONAREPA (National Reparations Commission), which had liquidated an estimated US$200 million in absconded valuables by the time it was dissolved in 1983. The Dirty War likewise served as cover for numerous ransom kidnappings, which continued even after the return of democracy in 1983 at the hand of a number of the same officers. The Director of Battalion 601, the Army Intelligence unit where most of these ransom kidnappings originated, was the hard-line General Guillermo Su√°rez Mason. His appointment as head of YPF in 1981 was followed by a period of severe mismanagement at the state oil concern. He installed many of his hard-line Army Intelligence colleagues in managerial posts, and they in turn diverted large quantities of fuel into the director's newly established company Sol Petr√≥leo ‚Äì a dummy corporation used by Su√°rez Mason and his appointees for embezzlement as well as to divert funds to the Contras and the fascist organization P2 (to which Su√°rez Mason belonged). YPF debts thus rose 142-fold during Su√°rez Mason's tenure, at the end of which in 1983 the company recorded a US$6 billion loss. The 1976 coup ushered in what would become the costliest, most consequential wave of corruption in Argentina up to that point. The Economy Minister during most of the dictatorship, Jos√© Alfredo Mart√≠nez de Hoz, advanced twin anti-labor and financial deregulation policies that interrupted industrial development and upward social mobility while sharply increasing the nation's debt burden. Industrial output thus fell by 20%, real wages by at least 36%, and the public debt soared from US$8 billion to US$45 billion; by 1983, interest charges alone reached US$6.5 billion, creating a balance of payments crisis that weakened the economy for years. While chronic budget deficits (exacerbated during the dictatorship by growing tax evasion and military spending) accounted for around half the new debt, the remainder originated in banking deregulation enacted in 1977 and in a crawling peg enacted in 1978 that by 1980 made the peso one of the most overvalued currencies in the world. At least US$20 billion borrowed by private parties from foreign banks in just two years were wired to offshore banks by 1981, around US$15 billion of which was absorbed into the public debt the following year. The total cost of these bailouts rose to US$23 billion by the time they were curtailed in 1985. These costs included bailouts for two firms in which Mart√≠nez de Hoz was the chief shareholder: the insolvent CIADE electric utility (US$395 million) and steel maker Acindar (US$649 million). At least one Mart√≠nez de Hoz subordinate who objected to the CIADE bailout (Juan Carlos Casariego) joined the ranks of the disappeared in 1977. Following Judge Norberto Oyarbide's repeal in 2006 of the immunity that had shielded civilian officials in the dictatorship from prosecution (Mart√≠nez de Hoz was the highest ranking such civilian), the former Economy Minister was formally charged with ordering the extortion kidnapping of textile industrialists Federico and Miguel Gutheim in 1976, and banker Eduardo Saiegh in 1981. Mart√≠nez de Hoz returned to the world of banking in later years, and was fined US$5 million for his role in the US$170 million Banco General de Negocios failure in 2002. He was placed under house arrest in 2010, and died in 2013. The dictatorship eventually called elections and stepped down, though not before further damaging Argentina's international standing with the disastrous Falklands War in 1982. The war itself became a backdrop for corruption when, at the height of the brief conflict in May 1982, a Patriotic Fund was organized for the benefit of the underequipped troops at the Falklands front. The May 9 Public Television telethon and other fundraising efforts yielded US$54 million in donations (including in gold) by the time the Argentine military surrendered five weeks later. Most donations never served their intended purpose, however: the cash and gold were mostly used by the Central Bank to offset the cost of the war; food and clothing donations were impeded from reaching the troops by the fighting; and a sizable percentage would remain unaccounted for. The only donor who successfully sued to recover his donation (vintner Renato Vaschetti) found that the three kilos of gold returned to him in 1984 had been stamped by a Swiss bank. Videla, convicted of homicides, kidnapping, torture, and other crimes, was sentenced to life in prison, was pardoned by President Menem in 1990. Menem's pardon was ruled unconstitutional on President N√©stor Kirchner's initiative in 2006. Videla returned to prison in 2012, where he died the next year. =Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n= Although Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, who was president from 1983 to 1989, won international recognition for human rights reforms, for initiating the Trial of the Juntas in 1985, and for fighting corruption, Argentine business and government continued to be marked by severe corruption during his period in office. The Central Bank was defrauded in 1986 by Banco Alas (the 13th largest in Argentina at the time) for US$110 million in export credits; and Alfons√≠n's National Customs Director, Juan Carlos Delconte, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1998 for aggravated smuggling a decade after it was discovered that he had been running a secret \\"parallel customs\\" system. =Carlos Menem= Corruption allegations \\"swirled\\" throughout Carlos Menem's two terms as president (1989‚Äì99). Menem reportedly \\"used the resources coming from privatizations to strengthen his inner circle and the Per√≥nist corrupt clientelistic machine working at provincial levels.\\" He \\"allowed provincial and local governments to contract loans, contributing thus to an increase in the national debt that would contribute to the severe financial crisis years later, prompting the downfall of President De La R√∫a.\\" Swiftgate (1990) When the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, Terence Todman, informed the Argentine government in 1990 that Menem advisor and in-law Emir Yoma had solicited a bribe from Swift, the U.S. meat packing firm, it led to a scandal known as Swiftgate. The scandal resulted in the resignations of Yoma, Economy Minister Antonio √ârman Gonz√°lez, and other officials in January 1991. The whistleblower, economist Guillermo Nielsen, had to move to Uruguay as a result of threats. Yomagate (1991) A cocaine trafficking operation revealed in 1991 involved the shipment of large sums of drug money from New York City to Argentina, where it was laundered through the purchase of real estate, jewelry, or businesses, or diverted to Uruguay. Amira Yoma, who was at the center of the scandal, was Menem's secretary and sister-in-law, and was eventually cleared of all charges. Domingo Cavallo and Alfredo Yabr√°n Menem's Finance Minister, Domingo Cavallo, \\"built his reputation on fighting corruption inside Government agencies and privatized industries,\\" reported the New York Times in 1996. As a result, he was \\"unpopular within the Government\\" and \\"sparred publicly\\" with Menem. Cavallo accused businessman Alfredo Yabr√°n in 1995 of being a sort of mafia boss who enjoyed political and judicial protection, who covertly ran several major transport and security companies including Correo OCA (which handled 30% of the Argentine postal market), and whose firms were involved in drugs and weapons trafficking and money laundering. After Jos√© Luis Cabezas, a photojournalist who was investigating Yabr√°n, was murdered in 1997, it was shown that Yabr√°n had connections at the highest levels of government and had bought Menem a mansion. Yabr√°n was found dead in 1998, a supposed suicide ‚Äì although some observers questioned whether he had in fact killed himself, and some raised doubts as to whether the body was even his. However, there have been no sighting reports, and the DNA testings on the corpse confirmed that it was Yabr√°n. Mar√≠a Julia Alsogaray Mar√≠a Julia Alsogaray, the daughter of prominent conservative politician √Ålvaro Alsogaray, was appointed by Menem to oversee a number of the privatizations carried out from 1989 to 1991. Her role in these negotiations resulted in the sale of these state firms for a fraction of their stated book value. Alsogaray's tenure at Environment Secretariat, which was elevated to a cabinet-level post by the president in 1991, was also marked by a number of scandals. These included bid rigging for the refurbishment of the Haedo Palace (the secretariart's headquarters) and, particularly, of a 1993 plan to decontaminate the Riachuelo (a heavily polluted waterway along Buenos Aires' industrial southside). Alsogaray obtained a US$250 million loan from the IADB for the purpose; of this, however, US$150 million were destined to unrelated social projects, six million were lost in IADB fines, US$90 million were never allocated, and only one million was used for the actual cleanup. Upon stepping down when President Menem left office in 1999, financial transactions in her name totaling over US$200 million came under scrutiny, and Alsogaray was ultimately convicted of misappropriation of public funds in 2004. She was sentenced to three years in prison and served 21 months, thus becoming the only Menem administration official to serve time in prison. The statute of limitations expired on a number of other charges in 2013; but she was ultimately convicted to a second term in prison in February 2015 over the Haedo Palace charges. Privatizations (1990‚Äì94) Privatizations were viewed by the World Bank and the IMF in the 1990s as the preferred solution for developing countries such as Argentina to overcome the debt crisis. Accordingly, the Menem administration secured special powers from Congress, which enacted new legislation in shortly after his inaugural in 1989 authorizing the sale of some 300 state enterprises for US$24 billion. The proceeds were largely channeled toward repayment and monetization of the US$65 billion foreign debt (90% of which was found in a 1984 Economy Ministry audit to be fraudulent in nature). The US$31 billion in Brady Bonds issued for this purpose deepened the nation's debt crisis, however, because while Argentina serviced them at face value, the bonds typically traded at a steep discount. Large public service rate increases, added to weak regulatory frameworks and constant renegotiation of concession contracts, brought outsized profits to the privatized companies. Between 1993 and 2000, the 200 largest companies in Argentina accumulated US$28.4 billion in profits, 56.8% of which were earned by privatized companies, and 26.3% by firms that had ties to those companies. Prices and wages were virtually frozen in Argentina from 1995 to 2001; but utility fees rose in line with the U.S. inflation rate, constituting an additional source of earnings for the newly privatized companies. The linking of public services fees charged in Argentina to the U.S. inflation rate enabled privatized companies to pocket US$9 billion by 2000. Additionally, privatized firms sent 70% of their earnings abroad while failing to pay the annual concession fees or to make all the investments stipulated by the contracts. The companies also imported large quantities of inputs and goods produced by associated firms, contracting heavy trade debts in dollars while violating a law that required them to prioritize Argentine products when making purchases. The terms of the privatizations themselves often included lopsided benefits to the buyers. Some of the most notable cases included the ENTel state phone company, privatized in 1990 with US$180 million in land gifted to its buyers and at a further loss of US$250 million to the state; the Somisa state steel works, sold to Techint in 1992 for one seventh the book value of US$1 billion that Jorge Triaca, Alsogaray's predecessor at Somisa, had estimated; and Aerol√≠neas Argentinas, sold free of liabilities in 1990 (at a cost to Argentina of US$800 million) to Spain's Iberia, which indebted the airline by US$900 million over the next decade while selling off 29 of the 30 airplanes the firm owned when it was privatized. IBM scandal (1995‚Äì98) Allegations emerged in 1995 that IBM-Argentina had paid US$37m in kickbacks and bribes in 1993 to win a US$250m contract with the government-run Banco de la Naci√≥n. In 1998, arrest warrants were issued for four former IBM executives and Judge Angelo Bagnasco charged ten people with crimes, including a former president of Banco de la Naci√≥n and IBM-Argentina's former CEO and former COO. The New York Times noted in 1996 that six months after the initial revelations, the IBM scandal was \\"still front page news in Argentina, as new disclosures emerge almost weekly, tainting the computer giant's reputation for honesty here.\\" In 2000, IBM was ordered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a civil penalty of US$300,000. IBM was concurrently involved in no bid contracts awarded by Social Security Director Arnaldo Cisilino, which later resulted in the latter's indictment for fraud in 1998. Arms- shipment deal and other Menem scandals Menem was finally arrested in 2001 \\"for his alleged role in an illegal arms-shipments deal,\\" involving the wartime export of weapons to Croatia and Ecuador in 1991 and 1996, only to be set free \\"after five months of house arrest...by his hand-picked Supreme Court.\\" After his release, Menem and his second wife, Cecilia Bolocco, moved to Chile, from which Argentine authorities sought to have him extradited to face embezzlement charges. After the arrest warrants were canceled, Menem and his family returned to Argentina in December 2004. The case of the 1995 R√≠o Tercero explosion, which killed seven people and was believed by prosecutors to be linked to the Croatia/Ecuador arms sale scandal, was likewise closed in 2006 with no indictments. A 2008 settlement between Siemens and the U.S. government revealed that Menem administration officials had accepted about US$106 million in bribes from Siemens in exchange for being awarded a 1.2 billion-dollar National ID card and passport production contract in 1998, a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In 2012, Menem was ordered to stand trial for obstruction of justice in an investigation of a 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in which 85 people died; he was accused of covering up evidence connecting the attack to Hezbollah and Iran. In 2013, after an Appeals Court ruling found Menem guilty of smuggling weapons to Ecuador and Croatia, he was sentenced to seven years in prison. As a Senator, however, he was immune from incarceration, and was instead placed under house arrest. Oscar Camili√≥n, who had been his Defense Minister, was sentenced to five and a half years. =Fernando de la R√∫a= Fernando de la R√∫a, President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001, was investigated in 2006, along with several members of his administration, on charges of financial irregularities and malfeasance during his presidency allegedly involving such international banks as Credit Suisse, First Boston Corporation, HSBC Bank Argentina, JP Morgan Securities, and Salomon Smith Barney. The charges pertained to the 2001 Megaswap negotiated between Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and said banks. Cavallo attempted to avoid a bond default by offering bondholders a swap, whereby longer-term, higher-interest bonds would be exchanged for bonds coming due in 2010. The Megaswap was accepted by most bondholders (particularly banks, which used the Megaswap to shed rapidly depreciating bonds), and delayed up to US$30 billion in payments that would have been due by 2005; but it also added US$38 billion in interest payments in the out years, and of the US$82 billion in bonds that eventually had to be restructured (triggering a wave of holdout lawsuits), 60% were issued during the 2001 megaswap. He and President de la R√∫a were indicted in 2006 for malfeasance in public office related to the Megaswap, but were cleared of all charges in 2014. De la R√∫a was also indicted in 2008 on a charge of \\"aggravated active bribery.\\" He was accused in October 2000 of having bribed senators that April for their vote in favor of a labor flexibilization law requested by the IMF. Several senators were also indicted on charges of accepting the bribes. He was also indicted on homicide charges in 2007, on the grounds that he had ordered attacks on demonstrators in 2001; de la R√∫a escaped conviction in all these cases. =N√©stor Kirchner= N√©stor Kirchner, then governor of the Province of Santa Cruz, and his wife, Congresswoman Cristina Kirchner, \\"intensely and successfully lobbied President Carlos Menem in 1992 to sell the state oil company YPF\\". Upon its privatization in 1993, the federal government paid Santa Cruz Province US$654 million in long-outstanding royalties owed by YPF (minus a US$100 million tax debt). Governor Kirchner transferred the funds to Credit Suisse and other foreign banks in 2001. Kirchner became president in 2003, and pledged to repatriate the funds. Amid delays, a civil suit was filed against Kirchner in 2004; but it was dismissed in 2005 by the judge, who was Kirchner's nephew-in-law. A 2006 inquiry found that of the US$520 million fund, US$390 million remained in Credit Suisse. Santa Cruz Governor Daniel Peralta ultimately announced in 2008 that US$554 million had been repatriated. One of the cables made public by Wikileaks noted that while N√©stor Kirchner based his 2003 campaign largely on an anti-corruption platform the government had in fact placed less emphasis on efforts to combat corruption since 2004. =Cristina Kirchner= Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner currently faces some of the most serious charges of corruption since the return of democracy in 1983. She is popularly dubbed by political opposition as \\"Ladrona de la Republica Argentina\\" (Thief of the Argentine Republic) Suitcase scandal (2007) Another case with foreign origins is that of Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, a self-identified member of the entourage of Hugo Ch√°vez, who arrived in Argentina in August 2007 on a private flight paid for by Argentine and Venezuelan state officials. Wilson was carrying US$790,550 in cash, which he did not declare and which the police seized on arrival. A few days later Wilson, a Venezuelan-American and a close friend of Ch√°vez's, was a guest at a signing ceremony involving Kirchner and Ch√°vez at the Casa Rosada. He was later arrested on money laundering and contraband charges, and it was established that the cash was to have been delivered to the Kirchners as a clandestine contribution to Fern√°ndez's campaign chest. The incident led to a scandal and what Bloomberg News called \\"an international imbroglio,\\" with the U.S. accusing five men of being secret Ch√°vez agents whose mission was to cover up the attempt to deliver the cash. Skanska case (2007) In 2007, Federal Judge Guillermo Montenegro was leading an investigation into bribes allegedly paid by Swedish firm Skanska to former government officials working on a gas pipeline project, and Carlos Stornelli was serving as prosecutor on the case, when both men received job offers that were viewed as motivated by a government attempt to stall the investigation. Montenegro received an offer from Buenos Aires Mayor-elect Mauricio Macri to join his cabinet as Security and Justice Minister, while Vice President offered Stornelli a job as Security Minister in Buenos Aires Province. If both men accepted the offers, the result would be a year-long halt in the investigation and prosecution of the Skansa case. Ombudsman meeting with U.S. ambassador (2008) An April 2008 cable later made public by Wikileaks noted that the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, Earl Anthony Wayne, had met with Argentina's National Ombudsman Dr. Eduardo Mondino, who had told him about \\"a case he is investigating involving possible corruption related to commissions being charged on government contractual transactions, the proceeds of which are being deposited in a U.S. bank.\\" Bendini case (2008) Army Chief of Staff Roberto Bendini resigned in September 2008 in the wake of an Appeals Court's decision to proceed with charges against him for \\"peculado,\\" or the improper diversion of funds. Bendini had been promoted over more senior generals by Kirchner despite Defense Minister Nilda Garr√©'s apparent lack of confidence in him. Bendini was described as having operated a \\"parallel\\" bank account into which he diverted large sums of government money. Francisco de Narv√°ez (2009‚Äì13) Congressman Francisco de Narv√°ez, a senior member of the center-right Federal Peronist caucus, was discovered in 2009 to have placed numerous phone calls from his cell phone to Mario Segovia, the \\"king of ephedrine\\" (whose use as a recreational drug is illegal in Argentina). Subpoenaed by Judge Federico Faggionato M√°rquez, de Narv√°ez initially announced he would resign from Congress, but later recanted, claiming a ranch hand in his employ used his phone to place the calls in question. Faggionato M√°rquez's successor, Judge Adri√°n Gonz√°lez Charvay, dismissed the case in 2010. He similarly came under scrutiny after declaring a 2008 taxable income of 670,000 pesos (around US$200,000) against 70 million pesos in exemptions, 30 million in inter vivos gifts to his children, and another 30 million in personal expenses. Accordingly, his tax liability was estimated to be at least 100 times what he actually paid, and in 2010 a tax lien was placed on his assets for 87 million pesos (US$22 million at the time). Another significant case ‚Äì failure on the part of the La Rural-Ogden group (of which de Narv√°ez is a partner) to repay a US$106 million loan from the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires ‚Äì expired via statute of limitations in 2013. Santa Cruz property case (2011) One of the Wikileaks cables mentions an investigation of members of the Kirchner administration and its business allies in Santa Cruz province. The investigation focused on the purchase and resale, at massive profits, of large tracts of public land by nearly fifty top level politicians and businesspeople during N√©stor Mendez's final years as the mayor of El Calafate, from 1995 to 2007. As of March 2011, the investigation into this case was being directed by prosecutor Natalia Mercado, the Kirchners' niece. Shared Dreams case (2011) In a 2011 article entitled \\"Corruption in Argentina\\", The Economist noted that Shared Dreams, the \\"social-work arm\\" of the respected Association of Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, had become mired in corruption. Granted $45m of public funds to build housing for the poor, the group hired Meldorek, a company that was owned by Sergio Schoklender, who had been imprisoned for 14 years for murdering his parents, and that, according to other contractors, \\"was charging twice the market rate for homebuilding.\\" After Schoklender left the firm, the courts began \\"investigating allegations of fraud, money- laundering and illegal enrichment.\\" The Economist noted that President Fern√°ndez's closeness to the Association of Mothers risked \\"becoming an embarrassment\\". Siemens case (2011) The Argentine Securities and Exchange Commission (CNV) charged former Siemens executives with bribing two consecutive Argentine presidents ‚Äì Carlos Menem and Fernando de la R√∫a ‚Äì with $100 million to secure a contract for a $1 billion national ID card.\\" Kurtz concluded. \\"If the football federation launders money, if 13,000 police officers can be arrested for crimes, and if 60% of Argentines in a national survey believe they can pay law enforcement officials to avoid infractions, this society's problems might run deeper than mere technocratic adjustment.\\" Ralph Lauren (2013) In April 2013, Ralph Lauren paid $1.6 million to the SEC to settle allegations that it bribed Argentine customs officials $580,000 in cash between 2004 and 2009 \\"to improperly obtain paperwork necessary for goods to clear customs; permit clearance of items without the necessary paperwork and/or the clearance of prohibited items; and on occasion, to avoid inspection entirely.\\" Buenos Aires municipal contracts (2013) Civic watchdog group Poder Ciudadano ('Citizen Power') expressed concern over the Buenos Aires Public Contracts Law passed November 2013 by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and urged that it be vetoed by Mayor Mauricio Macri, who promoted and signed the bill. The concern was that the laws, dealing with municipal government contracts, would reduce transparency and eliminate control mechanisms, thus promoting corruption. Poder Ciudadano similarly denounced the municipal waste management bidding process and service (20% of the city's budget) for its lack of oversight in a 2013 report. Mayor Macri, elected to the post in 2007, privatized numerous city services and made unprecedented use of subcontractors in the construction of municipal public works; expenditures on city contracts reached US$500 million in 2013 out of a municipal budget of US$8.8 billion. Some of the most controversial such contracts include those for the construction in 2013 of the Metrobus bus lanes on 9 de Julio Avenue, which cost 166 million pesos (US$30 million at the time) for of lanes when routes completed in 2012 had cost 2.5-5.3 million pesos (US$0.5-1.1 million) per kilometer. A similar controversy arose with Macri's purchase in 2011 of 178,000 school netbooks for US$274 million from PRIMA S.A., a subsidiary of the Clar√≠n Group (the country's most influential media group). The contract yielded PRIMA a price premium of US$185 million, based on a similar purchase that year by the UTN. Documents related to the contract were subpoenaed in 2013 amid a money laundering investigation involving JP Morgan Chase's Argentine offices; PRIMA is one of 15 Clar√≠n Group subsidiaries included in the JP Morgan case. Freedom of information laws in Argentina allow access to all public contracts records; but as of 2013, out of 500 such requests filed at Buenos Aires City Hall, fewer than 10% were answered. Boudougate (2010‚Äì13) The Argentine Revenue Administration (AFIP) called for the printing house Ciccone Calcogr√°fica to declare bankruptcy in July 2010, but two months later, after Ciccone received 2.3 million pesos (US$600,000) from the Old Fund, a shell corporation whose representative, Alejandro Vandenbroele, thereupon became president of Ciccone, the AFIP rescinded its request and, on orders from then Minister of Economy Amado Boudou, allowed Ciccone time to refinance its debts. After Laura Mu√±oz, Vandenbroele's ex-wife, publicly accused him of being a front for Boudou, the latter denied the charge, but in April 2012 a judicial investigation revealed that Vandenbroele had paid the rent for a flat belonging to Boudou. Members of Congress tried unsuccessfully to impeach Boudou. In September 2013, a Federal Court permitted Boudou to file for a dismissal of charges. Despite the scandal, the Central Bank of Argentina commissioned Ciccone in March 2012 to print banknotes. L√°zaro B√°ez case (2013) A massive and complicated scandal that emerged piecemeal over the course of much of 2013 focused on the Kirchners' relationship to public-works contractor L√°zaro B√°ez, an longtime friend and business associate of theirs whose companies had been awarded many public works contracts during both Kirchners' presidencies. Journalist Jorge Lanata, on successive episodes of his highly rated Sunday-evening public- affairs program \\"Periodismo para todos\\" (\\"Journalism for All\\"), served up numerous allegations regarding B√°ez and Fern√°ndez. Lanata claims that B√°ez would appear to have funneled taxpayer money from his government contracts back to the Kirchners in the form of rent payments for rooms at hotels owned by the couple. The official books of B√°ez-owned companies showed that they had spent millions of dollars \\"to reserve a third of the Kirchners' hotel rooms, whether the rooms were used or not\\". The state-owned airline Aerol√≠neas Argentinas \\"guaranteed another third of the rooms, providing a steady flow of profits to the presidential couple's private businesses\\". Lanata also covered the fact that B√°ez, who was described as monopolizing all public works in Santa Cruz province, had bought several estates in Santa Cruz for US$28 million in 2007, allegedly having been informed that the province intended to build hydroelectric dams on the land. In addition, Lanata's program aired hidden-camera footage in which a B√°ez associate, Leonardo Fari√±a, admitted to involvement in a money-laundering network that handled proceeds from government corruption. Fari√±a had deposited 55 million euros of B√°ez's funds in Switzerland and said that Kirchner knew all about B√°ez's operations and was a partner in all of them. Furthermore, Lanata revealed that a vault holding cash and sensitive documents was emptied and refitted as a wine cellar. One of the workers who took part in the conversion of the vault into a wine cellar took photos to protect himself, fearing he was involved in an illegal activity. Lanata sardonically congratulated B√°ez, who only a few years earlier had been a low-level bank employee, for amassing a fortune quicker than Henry Ford or Bill Gates. Lanata also devoted some attention on his program to the Argentine judges and prosecutors who were reluctant to take the case, since it had been transferred to R√≠o Gallegos courts, which were known to have Kirchner ties. On an August 2013 episode of his program, Lanata charged that Fern√°ndez had stayed in the Seychelles, a tax haven, in January 2013 as part of a money- laundering operation involving B√°ez. A week later Lanata hosted on his program Nella De Luca, a Venezuelan journalist who claimed to have stayed in the same hotel as Fern√°ndez in the Seychelles at that time. Shortly after the program aired, the Casa Rosada issued a statement to the effect that Fern√°ndez's plane had made a \\"technical stop\\" in the Seychelles. After Lanata's report about B√°ez and the Seychelles, Oscar Parrilli, Secretary General of the Presidency, called Lanata a \\"media hit man,\\" in response to which Lanata said on CNN that he would take the matter to court. At one point, the government chose to blunt the impact of Lanata's show by scheduling evening matches between two very popular soccer teams, Boca Juniors and River Plate, directly opposite the Sunday-night program. Initially, more viewers watched Lanata's show than the soccer matches. His ratings later declined, however. Zannini case (2013) Carlos Zannini, the Executive Legal Advisor for the Kirchner administration, was accused in 2012 of several charges, including embezzlement of public funds, money laundering, and corruption. From 2003 to 2011 his personal wealth was reported to have increased by nearly thirty-eightfold (in pesos). A complaint was filed to this effect with Judge Norberto Oyarbide; the case was suspended for a time and only recently was the complaint further pursued. It has been reported that members of Kirchner's administration and of the government have stalled the case and interfered in many ways. For instance, when Oyarbide ordered an investigative raid on Zannini's property to attain evidence, Carlos Liuzzi, a presidential secretary and subordinate of Zannini's, reportedly called him and ordered him to cancel the raid and offered him a bribe. Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich was asked to comment on the accusation, although no clear answers have been given. Press Secretary Oscar Parrilli stated that such accusations were false and that no call was ever made. Oyarbide, however, has publicly stated that he did receive a call from Liuzzi asking him to halt the raid.  Areas =Political corruption= Several parties announced in 2013, under the slogan \\"No more to corruption\\" (Nunca m√°s a la corrupci√≥n), that they would propose that the Argentinian parliament create a bicameral commission to investigate government corruption. Margarita Stolbizer, a candidate in the 2013 elections, released a \\"Corruption Report\\" in August 2013, saying: \\"Corruption is dramatically black, because it is a corruption that has cost lives.\\" Another candidate, Ricardo Alfonsin, submitted a set of proposals for increased transparency. Quoting Pope Francis's description of corruption as \\"a weed of our times that infects politics, economy, and society,\\" the editors of La Naci√≥n accused Argentinian officials in October 2013 of \\"embezzlement, bribery, extortion, illicit enrichment, negotiations incompatible with the exercise of public functions, concealment and laundering,...influence peddling and misappropriation of public funds,\\" and blamed official corruption for 194 deaths at a dance club in 2004, 51 deaths in a train crash in Once in 2012, and 60 deaths in floods in 2013. The newspaper also attributed deficiencies in public access to housing and health care to various forms of corruption, ranging from outright embezzlement to the placement of medical aircraft at the service of officials instead of patients. In a December 2013 editorial triggered by Argentina's poor performance in that year's corruption ratings by Transparency International, the editors of La Naci√≥n stated that the Argentine government \\"encourages lying, concealment and illegality.\\" The newspaper's editors complained about the \\"very high level of impunity\\" for corrupt officials, and called on the government to promote a \\"culture of transparency\\" which would make possible a \\"culture of legality.\\" La Naci√≥n has been at odds with the federal government over an injunction issued in October 2003 that allowed it to continue in subsequent years to claim an expired corporate tax credit on payroll taxes paid; were the injunction to be lifted, a US$50 million tax debt, including interest, would result. There were 25 public cases in 2012 in which former and current government officials were accused of illicit enrichment. In September 2013, Ricardo Jaime, who had been Kirchner's Transportation Secretary, was given a six-month suspended sentence on charges of withholding evidence in a case of unjust enrichment. Ombudsman Eduardo Mondino told U.S. Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne in 2011 about allegations that the Argentine government charged a 15% commission on all private international contracts, and wanted Wayne to help find out whether the earnings were being deposited in a U.S. bank. A German CEO also told Planning Minister Julio De Vido that one of the latter's aides had asked him for a bribe. Patronage jobs As an example of Argentine political corruption, Brink Lindsey of the Wall Street Journal has noted that Tucum√°n Province's public sector has been used almost exclusively to enrich politicians and fund patronage jobs. Elected officials are alleged to embezzle enough funds to create fortunes for themselves,with the annual salary of provincial legislators amounting to roughly $300,000. Such corruption, stated Lindsey, is common elsewhere in Argentina. In Formosa Province, Argentina's poorest, roughly half of the workforce is on the government's payroll but many only show up to work once a month. Such corruption, according to Lindsey, contributed to Argentina's financial crisis. He noted that while many blame the free market for Argentina's woes, it is rather the control economics in place that have caused such problems. Intelligence Secretariat and Battalion 601 The Secretariat of Intelligence (SI) was established by President Juan Per√≥n in 1946 as the State Information Coordination Secretariat (CIDE); it was renamed SIDE in 1958, and SI in 2001. Its first director was Rodolfo Freude, one of the principal figures in the ODESSA Nazi post-war ratline. Since its inception, the SI was responsible for spying on politicians, journalists, intellectuals and trade unionists; gathering information that even today remains \\"classified\\". As both the Cold War and leftist political violence intensified in the early 1970s, however, the SIDE would acquire a prominent role in the persecution, murder, and disappearance of thousands of people during Argentina's Dirty War in the mid 1970s. The CIA contributed to this policy with intelligence training and technical assistance, including arson techniques for \\"clean\\" fires whose origin was made difficult to detect. This collaboration, as well as similar arrangements with other South American dictatorships, was known as Operation Condor, and was formally implemented in 1975. SIDE worked closely with the Triple A right-wing death squad initially, and with the Argentine Army Intelligence unit, Battalion 601, after the March 1976 coup. SIDE operated the Automotores Orletti detention facility in Buenos Aires in which around 300 people were killed, with the victims' property distributed among the torturers. Two of its managers, SIDE officer An√≠bal Gordon and Battalion 601 officer Ra√∫l Guglielminetti, had also belonged to the Triple A and later perpetrated numerous ransom kidnappings. The \\"Gordon Group\\", as it was known, worked with the cooperation of mafiosi such as the Puccio family, SIDE colleagues including Alejandro Encino (whose father-in- law, General Otto Paladino, headed SIDE during the dictatorship), General Eduardo Cabanillas (who headed the 2nd Army Corps in the 1990s), and Fran√ßois Chiappe (a convicted bank thief and French Connection heroin trafficker). President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, elected to succeed the dictatorship in 1983, sought to demilitarize SIDE by appointing its first civilian director and ending its partnership with Battalion 601. Some SIDE agents implicated in human rights abuses, such as Luis Sarmiento, fled the country. Others, however, made attempts to infiltrate sensitive government posts ‚Äì notably Ra√∫l Guglielminetti, who in 1985 was discovered to have infiltrated the president's security detail. The most serious case of intelligence agency wrongdoing involved banker Osvaldo Sivak. Sivak had been kidnapped for ransom by Battalion 601 agents in 1979, and again in 1985; his buried corpse was found two years later. A subsequent investigation by Federal Police Chief Juan √Ångel Pirker revealed that Sivak had been kidnapped and murdered by former Federal Police captains who had worked for both Battalion 601 and SIDE during the dictatorship. Because Sivak was a top fundraiser and close personal friend of President Alfons√≠n, the murder was interpreted as a threat against Alfons√≠n and his efforts to reform the two agencies. The \\"Captains' Band,\\" as it became known, was responsible for numerous other high-profile ransom kidnappings from 1978 to 1991, including those of Karina Werthein and Mauricio Macri. Like their military and police counterparts, intelligence officers implicated in the Dirty War benefited from Full Stop and Due Obedience laws signed by Alfons√≠n in 1987, and pardons signed by Menem in 1990. Many, however, were convicted in the decade after the repeal of amnesty in 2003 to prison terms ranging from 6 to 25 years for criminal conspiracy. =Lack of transparency= Another linchpin of official corruption in Argentina is the lack of public access to government information. There is a 2003 decree that provides for such access, but it applies only to executive entities and companies that receive state funds. Transparency International has called for a federal law that would increase transparency and accountability. =Banking and money laundering= Numerous large bank fraud and asset stripping cases have taken place in Argentina since banking deregulation was enacted by the last dictatorship in 1977, most of which led to the insolvency of the banks involved; some were resolved by the Central Bank, but at considerable cost to public coffers. The most notable early case was probably that of the BIR, whose US$3 billion Ponzi scheme collapse in March 1980 triggered a nationwide financial crisis. Its chairman, Jos√© Trozzo, shared ownership of the bank with among others Admiral Emilio Massera (the second most powerful figure in the military junta during its first three years); Trozzo evaded justice by fleeing to Mexico, leaving the bank's last director, Ra√∫l Pi√±ero Pacheco, to pay US$20 million in Central Bank penalties. Other significant such cases include Banco Internacional (1981), which collapsed under US$1.2 billion in securities fraud orchestrated by its chairman, R√≥mulo Seit√∫n, and led to the bankruptcy of the largest agroindustrial firm in Argentina at the time, Sasetr√∫; Banco Alas, the nation's 13th largest when it was shuttered in 1986 for defrauding the Central Bank; Banco Mayo (1998), whose US$200 million collapse led to a prison term for former DAIA president Rub√©n Beraja; Banco Rep√∫blica (1999), whose chairman Ra√∫l Moneta obtained an US$89 million rediscount from the Central Bank four days before his bank collapsed and had a US$26 million tax debt condoned despite fleeing the country; and Banco Velox (2002), whose owners, the Peirano Basso brothers, transferred US$800 million in deposits to a Cayman Islands offshore bank, leading to the insolvency of Velox, Banco Alem√°n (Paraguay), and Banco Montevideo (Uruguay). With the exception of Rub√©n Beraja (who is Jewish), the chairmen involved in each of these bank collapses were members of the right-wing Roman Catholic group, Opus Dei. Another major category of corruption has been money laundering. In a March 2009 cable, the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires reported on the controversy over Argentina's new tax amnesty law and allegations by opposition politicians that it facilitates money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had told the Argentine press that \\"It's not enough to have a good law, you have to apply it.\\" In 2011, however, Transparency International commended Argentina for a law enacted that year that recognizes money laundering as an offense in and of itself and prescribes substantial punishments, and in October 2014 the Financial Action Task Force removed Argentina from its \\"gray list\\" and noted the government's improving control over money laundering. The seriousness of the issue was again highlighted, however, by a February 2014 fire at a southside Buenos Aires corporate records warehouse owned by U.S. based Iron Mountain Incorporated. The fire, which killed nine firemen and a civil defense officer, followed charges by the AFIP revenue bureau that Iron Mountain South America Ltd. and Iron Mountain Chile S.A. are front companies operating from tax havens. Money laundering investigations were subsequently initiated against 24 firms (out of 642) with documentation stored at the warehouse. Similar fires had recently taken place in four Iron Mountain facilities in North America and Europe. =Tax evasion= Tax evasion has long saddled Argentina's public finances, shifting the burden to the middle and working classes by way of high value-added taxes (which are easier to collect). Improvements in enforcement since the 1990s have abated the problem from its peak in the 1980s, when fully half of all tax liabilities (and most income taxes) were evaded. Nevertheless, Hern√°n Arbizu, a former JP Morgan Chase executive, testified in 2013 and 2014 on how Argentine firms and wealthy Argentine clients still evade billions of dollars in taxes using local banks and exchange houses. Among those implicated were the Clar√≠n Media Group; energy firm Petrobras Argentina; electricity distributor Edesur; the late Mar√≠a Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat and her executor, Congressman Alfonso Prat- Gay; former YPF head Sebasti√°n Eskenazi; and the late television host Bernardo Neustadt. During his testimony, he described how he helped clients move funds to offshore accounts (mainly in Switzerland), using private banking offices and legal loopholes. He stated that around US$85 billion had been transferred from Argentina to around 4,000 such accounts as part of a massive scheme that began in 2000, resulting in tax evasion losses of 60 billion pesos (US$7 billion); with the sole exception of Banco Credicoop, all 60 major banks in Argentina, including several local offices of foreign banks, had been involved. Another similar case was that of HSBC Bank Argentina, which the 2014 SwissLeaks scandal revealed to have facilitated tax evasion on US$3.8 billion by over 4,000 local account holders. Accordingly, the AFIP revenue bureau had the courts issue an international arrest warrant on Miguel Abadi, whose GEMS fund accounted for at least US$1.4 billion of this total. =Media groups= The larger media conglomerates in Argentina, particularly the Clar√≠n Group and La Naci√≥n, oppose anti-trust laws passed during Cristina Kirchner's administration to replace media ownership laws enacted in 1980 under the last dictatorship. Media consolidation has become the greater threat to freedom of the press in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, according to UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression Frank LaRue, and he, the IFJ, and a majority of journalist respondents in a 2011 Argentine Journalism Forum (FOPEA) survey consider the new law a partial or even substantial progress compared to the previous one. The shared ownership by the Clar√≠n Group, La Naci√≥n, and the Argentine Government in Papel Prensa (the largest producer of newsprint in Argentina), has also been marked by controversy. The administration alleged that the sale of Papel Prensa by the family of the late David Graiver in 1976 was done so by illicit means and in collusion with the dictatorship. The government presented a report in 2010 claiming that during the Dirty War, while being coerced, the Graivers were forced to sell the newsprint maker at a bargain price. Another source of contention between the government and its private partners in Papel Prensa was a preferential pricing scale that allowed La Naci√≥n and the Clar√≠n Group's numerous dailies to buy newsprint at a 25% discount while other dailies were charged prices based on expensive Chilean imports; the practice was made illegal in 2010. The Clar√≠n Group and La Naci√≥n are also at odds with federal regulators over a 2008 case of securities fraud by the Clar√≠n Group against pension funds holding Clar√≠n stock, and the continued use since 2003 of an expired corporate tax credit on payroll taxes (worth over US$50 million) in the case of La Naci√≥n. =Pharmaceuticals and narcotics= In late 2008, the then Minister of Health of Argentina, Graciela Oca√±a, informed U.S. Ambassador Anthony Wayne that pharmaceutical corruption was one of many major problems afflicting the country's health-care system. Citing allegations of price manipulation and fraudulent products, Oca√±a called for greater transparency on the part of the agency responsible for distributing drugs. Also, the Argentinian government was purchasing \\"fraudulent medicines\\" from pharmaceutical manufacturers that had contributed to Fern√°ndez's 2007 election campaign. Oca√±a said it was a challenge to effectively run her ministry when the money allocated for public health was in fact going to \\"other places.\\" A 2013 report by the U.S. State Department indicates that the Argentine Government does not actively produce or encourage the production of narcotics. Nevertheless, \\"several security force members, including high-ranking officers,\\" were accused in 2012 of cocaine and marijuana trafficking on a grand scale or protecting trafficking schemes. According to one 2013 source, the epicenter of the country's drug trade is the city of Rosario. There were minimal import restrictions on these \\"precursor chemicals,\\" including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are used to produce drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine, and the Kirchner and Fern√°ndez administrations were loath to impose restrictions on pharmaceuticals, since pharmaceutical companies were among the Kirchners' largest campaign donors. =Political finance= Another area in which there is extensive corruption in Argentina is political financing. There is an insufficient degree of transparency and accountability, and although recently passed legislation forbids donations by companies to political campaigns, there are ways for businesses to skirt the law and cover non-campaign expenses by politicians and parties. Incumbents also enjoy a decided advantage. Campaign finance corruption may originate abroad, as well. NML Capital Limited, the Cayman Islands-based vulture fund demanding US$832 million for Argentine bonds purchased for US$49 million in the secondary market in 2008, was found in 2013 to be the principal backer of the NGO run by Congresswoman Laura Alonso of the right-wing PRO; this NGO ‚Äì and Congresswoman Alonso ‚Äì had been vocally lobbying for NML up to that point. =Judicial integrity= Argentine courts \\"are slow, inefficient, and vulnerable to corruption and executive branch influence,\\" according to a 2013 Heritage Foundation report. The general perception is that many members of Argentina's judiciary are political appointees who enjoy a close relationship with the executive branch. Another major problem is that the judicial system is plagued by inefficiency, delays, and insufficient administrative support. It is a common practice for government officials to offer political jobs to judges in charge of important cases, thereby derailing the cases. The Centre for the Study and Prevention of Economic Crimes has noted that corruption cases in Argentina take an average of 14 years to be resolved. Out of 750 cases tried during a certain period, only 15 resulted in convictions. This is said to be the result of Fern√°ndez's \\"neuter[ing]\\" of \\"government oversight,\\" which she has accomplished by \\"giving auditing posts to cronies compromised by conflicts of interest.\\" La Naci√≥n accused the government in October 2013 of seeking \\"to impose an absurd judicial reform\\" designed largely \\"to guarantee the impunity of those in power.\\" The newspaper also accused the government of amending the \\"reform\\" of the civil and commercial codes in order to enhance the impunity of public officials, \\"thus distorting the original initiative.\\" In November 2013, the Court of Criminal Appeals canceled the prosecution of 25 individuals who had been government ministers and high officials under Menem and who had been accused of accepting inappropriate bonuses. The prosecution was canceled on the grounds that the defendants' right of due process had been violated. Among the defendants were former Labor Minister Jos√© Armando Caro Figueroa, former Justice Minister Elias Jassan, former Interior Secretary Adelina D'Alessio de Viola, and former Secretary of Trade and Investment Carlos S√°nchez. The case was remanded to a lower court. Public perceptions In July 2013, 72% of Argentines thought that corruption in their country had increased during the previous year, with politicians and parties identified as the most corrupt institutions. =Buenos Aires street protests (November 2012)= Thousands of Argentines held a street protest against their government in Buenos Aires in November 2012, waving signs that read: \\"Stop the wave of Argentines killed by crime, enough with corruption and say no to constitutional reform.\\" The Guardian noted that Argentines were plagued by \\"increasingly bold home robberies, in which armed bands tie up families until victims hand over the cash that many Argentines have kept at home since the government froze savings accounts and devalued the currency in 2002. The vast majority of the crimes are never solved, while the death toll is rising.\\" =Nationwide protests (April 2013)= Nationwide demonstrations on April 18, 2013, focused largely on corruption and \\"the sense of official impunity.\\" \\"A giant wave of peaceful protesters took to the streets of Argentina,\\" reported The Guardian, \\"banging spoons against kitchen pots, in a rally that attracted even larger crowds than a similar mass demonstration in November against corruption, inflation and insecurity under Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner.\\" Organized via Facebook and Twitter, the rally \\"was fuelled by anger against judicial overhaul being pushed through Congress that could give the government virtual control of the courts\\" and came in the wake of \\"allegations that businessmen laundered tens of millions of euros obtained from public work contracts through offshore accounts.\\" Protesters carried signs reading \\"Argentina, wake up!\\" and \\"Corrupt Cristina.\\" =Concerns by foreign powers= In 2011, Wikileaks cables revealed that diplomats from the United States, Germany, Spain, and Finland had grown concerned about the increasing levels of corruption. In May 2008, for example, the Secretary General of the Spanish cabinet, Bernardino Le√≥n was quoted in a Wikileaks cable as saying that Spanish companies doing business in Argentina were growing concerned at the populist sentiments and polarization of the Argentine government, as well as the corruption level among the Kirchner network. In February 2008, German ambassador Wolf Rolf Schumacher also expressed concern with the Cristina Kirchner administration's attitude towards corruption. A great number of the Wikileaks cables indicate that the U.S. Embassy in Argentina has been actively involved in anti-corruption efforts on the part of Argentinian officials and others in Argentina. The Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s reported in 2011 that \\"official corruption in Argentina worries the U.S., whose embassy in Buenos Aires sent to the State Department over a hundred confidential dispatches over several years warning about the fragility of the judicial system in the South American country and about the impunity of those who commit crimes.\\" Anti-corruption institutions The principal government entities whose role is to fight official corruption are the Auditor General 's Office and the Anti-Corruption Office. There are similar entities in each province and in the Buenos Aires municipal government. Transparency International has complained that such agencies as the Anti-Corruption Office, the Auditor General's Office, and the General Comptrollers Office \\"need a more robust mandate to hold public officials to account\\" and should \\"be independent and more proactive in corruption investigations.\\" Leaked Wikileaks cables revealed that in 2007, Dr. Abel Fleitas Ortiz de Rozas, then head of Argentina's Office of Anticorruption, told the US ambassador of the challenges Argentina faces in combatting corruption, among them a perceived tolerance of corruption, no transparency, and an ineffective legal system. =Manuel Garrido= A May 2009 report noted that Argentina's lead District Attorney of the National Prosecutor's Office for Administrative Investigations, Manuel Garrido, initiated more than a hundred investigations, but during a more than five-year period obtained no convictions. After his March 2011 resignation, Garrido was replaced by Julio Vitobello, a close friend to the Kirchners known for arranging soccer matches at their residence. Among the cases in which Garrido had been involved were Guillermo Moreno alleged manipulation of the Argentine statistical agency, INDEC; the Skanska scandal wherein the company was billing false invoice; a case of a literal bag of cash being discovered in the office of Felisa Miceli; the allegations of N√©stor Kirchner's and Daniel Marx's illicit enrichment; a contract for electrical cable installations being one by a company with close ties to the Kirchners; and contracts for rail repair being won by Ricardo Jaime, the Transport Secretary. Garrido had also filed criminal complaints against Claudio Uberti, who had been implicated in the 'Valijagate' scandal wherein Hugo Ch√°vez was alleged to have funneled Venezuelan money for Cristina Kirchner's campaign, and Jorge Simeonoff for alleged collusion in contract negotiations for highway construction jobs.

It was led by the skilled engineers and firemen, who demanded higher wages, seniority rights, and grievance procedures. It was fought bitterly by management, which rejected the very notion of collective bargaining. There was much less violence than the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, but after 10 months the very expensive company operation to permanently replace all the strikers was successful and the strike was a total defeat for them.Donald L. McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888: A Case History in Labor Relations (Harvard UP, 1956) Background The Burlington system of railroads was one of the great transportation networks of the 19th Century, operating about 6,000 miles of line in 1888, the year of the great strike.Donald L. McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888: A Case History in Labor Relations. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1956; pg. 4. The system consisted of seven individual railroads, of which the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) was the core unit, headed by company President Charles Elliott Perkins from 1881 and young General Manager Henry B. Stone.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 4, 20. The line was conservatively managed and profitable, paying its largely Boston-basedMcMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 7. investors healthy annual dividends of 8 percent throughout the decade of the 1880s. left The profitability of the Burlington line rested on the twin pillars of maintenance of high shipping rates through pricing agreements with competitive linesMcMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 6-8. and the suppression of wage rates, with President Perkins taking the view that wages were set by the simple market principle of supply and demand, leaving no room for misguided external intervention practices such as arbitration.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 15-16. Perkins was hostile to the notion of unionization and to the strike movement, approving a local decision to terminate striking Chicago freight handlers in 1886 and seeking to \\"go for\\" the Knights of Labor (KOL) in the wake of that union's strikes upon other rail lines in that year.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 16-17. The company formally served notice on its workers that membership in the KOL and continued employment by the Burlington line was incompatible, forcing many members to quit the union to keep their jobs. During the era of steam locomotion, operation of an engine was a two-person job, with an engineer controlling the throttle and responsible for the vehicle's safe operation, alongside a lesser-paid fireman, who broke coal into combustible-sized pieces and stoked the boiler which provided the train's motive energy.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 26. These two cab-dwelling operators were together known as \\"enginemen,\\" with the typically young fireman subordinate to the engineer and generally an aspirant to later promotion to the rank of engineer.Eugene V. Debs,The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen Locomotive Firemen‚Äôs Magazine, vol. 10, no. 7 (July 1886), pp. 385-393, passim Despite their proximity in the workplace and their commonality of interests, these two groups maintained their own distinct craft organizations, which frequently stood a cross-purposes with one another, divided by jurisdictional jealousy. Membership in these craft brotherhoods, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (B of LE) and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (B of LF), which were historically fraternal benefit- societies and which had taken a bleak view of the efficacy of striking, was still tolerated.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 28. These seem to have represented little risk to the company, with the B of LE having engaged in no strikes anywhere since its various local defeats in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877,McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 31. and the firemen a seemingly easily replaceable group of lesser skilled workers with a similar tradition of antipathy to strikes and collaboration with employers.For an example of the B of LF's hostility to direct action, see editor Eugene V. Debs in the official organ of the group, \\"Boycotting,\\" Locomotive Firemen‚Äôs Magazine, vol. 10, no. 6 (June 1886), pp. 326-329.  Strike = Cause = On January 23, 1888, a meeting of the grievance committee of the B of LE was convened at Burlington, Iowa, joined by the adjusting committee of the B of LF.C.H. Salmons, The Burlington Strike: Its Motives and Methods, Including the Causes of the Strike... Aurora, IL: Bunnell and Ward, 1889; pp. 126-127. the two bodies met individually for two days to identify their own specific concerned before holding a joint session on January 25, at which a negotiating committee of 14 engineers and 14 firemen was elected. The cause of an engineer terminated the previous week by the CB&Q;, ostensibly for failing to maintain a schedule, which the B of LE believed was mitigated by a defective watch, was placed near the top of the joint committee's agenda.Salmons, The Burlington Strike, pp. 129-131. Adding fuel to the fire was the terminated engineer's important place in the B of LE as a member of the brotherhood's previous grievance committee.Salmons, The Burlington Strike, pg. 129/ The Burlington strike was a protracted and bitter affair, exemplified by this June 1888 poster produced by strikers warning potential passengers of peril in the hands of incompetent strikebreakers in charge of train operations. A meeting of the joint grievance committee with General Manager Stone over the fate of the fired engineer was sought without success, and he left to Burlington to take a new position with the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad in short order.Salmons, The Burlington Strike, pg. 144. Bad will remained in the aftermath. The fate of the fired engineer was not the primary cause of the strike. A further and far more intractable division between the employees and the railroad related to a new schedule of pay for enginemen put forward on February 15 by the grievance committee, which sought to eliminate a much maligned system of differential pay based upon the time employees had spent with the company and specific conditions of various routes, and instead basing pay upon raw mileage traveled ‚Äî a method of wage calculation which would have had the effect of significantly increasing wages across the board.Salmons, The Burlington Strike, pg. 148. The profitable Burlington system and its method of pay according to a myriad of classifications was seen by employees as significantly less remunerative than the pay scales in use by other railroads in the Chicago area, which tended to be based upon mileage traveled. The summary rejection of the change to a mileage-based system by the unyielding General Manager Stone via a circular letter dated February 22, reaffirmed in a series of face-to-face negotiations over subsequent days, set the stage for a work stoppage.Salmons, The Burlington Strike, pp. 158-171. The nature of the pay increase was frankly admitted. In a contemporary history of the strike, B of LE official John A. Hall acknowledged that > \\"It is true that the Brotherhoods have demanded ... 'a considerable average > increase of pay,' but the public must understand that they did not demand > this increase from the Burlington over what is paid by its competitors in > business. Had the Burlington conceded this increase of pay, it would only > have been called upon to pay precisely what its neighbors and rivals have > been paying for years. A large average increase of pay must be made before > the employees of this road are placed upon an equal footing with those of > other roads. For many years the Burlington road had the advantage of a > first-class equipment of enginemen at rates of pay far below what its > competitors have been compelled to pay for the same service.\\"John A. Hall, > The Great Strike on the \\"Q.\\" Chicago: Elliott and Beezley, 1889; pg. 36. In an effort to break the impasse head of the B of LE Peter M. Arthur and head of the B of LF Frank P. Sargent were brought into Chicago on the morning of February 23.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 64. In discussions with General Manager Stone, Arthur noted that 90 percent of neighboring roads paid their enginemen by the mile; an offer was made to accept a lower rate of mileage pay ‚Äî 3.5 cents per mile for engineers running passenger lines rather than the 4 cents per mile previously demanded. Stone refused to move from the current pay schedule and rates on behalf of the railroad, effectively ending the initiative. The brotherhood chiefs sent a telegram to President Perkins declaring their men to be \\"determined to strike\\" but \\"we want to prevent it\\" and offering to accept the \\"same terms as made with the Chicago and Alton Railroad and Santa Fe system ‚Äî that is, 3.5 cents per mile for passenger trains and 4 cents per mile for the slower freight trains for engineers, with firemen receiving 60 percent of these rates.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 64-65. Perkins responded that while \\"the CB&Q; is ready and expects to pay as good wages as are paid by its neighbors,\\" at the same time \\"the railroad situation is not such as to justify any general increase at present\\" and indicating plans to arrive in Chicago in about a week's time.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 65. This vague offer proved unsatisfactory, however, and the joint committee of engineers and firemen, in consultation with the brotherhood heads, voted to strike for the new methods and rates of pay.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 66. The strike was slated to begin early in the morning of Monday, February 27, and the various delegates of the grievance committee departed for their respective homes along the Burlington line to announce the decision in person and make preparations for a strike. No announcement was to be made to the company until noon on February 26, in the hopes that a last-minute settlement might be arranged or alternatively company preparations for the stoppage be left wanting.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 66-67. =Launch= Aftermath of a wreck of a strikebreaker-operated CB&Q; train at the crossing of the line of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, Feb. 27, 1888. At the appointed time of 4 am on February 27, engineers and firemen across the CB&Q; Railroad abandoned their engines at their terminal points, halting their routes and returning to the nearest terminal point if they were already on the road.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 77. The company, having been formally notified of the strike date only the day before and believing that more time remained for negotiations, was taken by surprise.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 70-71. Company officials in Chicago immediately determined that their top priority was to keep suburban commuter trains running if possible, with the line standing as the second largest suburban commuter line in the region.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 72. No freight traffic would be run until passenger service was restored, company officials determined. The loss of CB&Q; freight service was particularly damaging to the massive Chicago meatpacking industry, with the road the number one importer of live cattle into the city for slaughter. The line also was positioned to have a dominant transportation role for the city's lumber industry, which would be quickly submerged by filled railroad cars unable to reach other lines save over gridlocked Burlington tracks.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 72-73. Emergency crews consisting of an engineer and fireman had been chosen to run passenger trains on the morning of February 27 if regular crews failed to show up for work at the appointed hour.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 73. Company officials expected that about 40 percent of regular crew members would remain on the job despite the strike; brotherhood officials predicted a total walkout.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 75. Ultimately union officials were more correct, with only 22 engineers out of 1,052 and 23 firemen out of 1,085 remaining on the job after the strike deadline, barely 2% of the company's enginemen. Strikers anticipated that the railroad could not function without them and anticipated a speedy settlement on favorable monetary terms, with some of them leaving personal belongings in the roundhouses after the strike deadline.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pp. 75-76. In this they greatly miscalculated. During the first three days of the strike company employees were called in from around the region to don overalls and operate passenger engines.McMurry, The Great Burlington Strike of 1888, pg. 76. These included the Superintendent of the CB&Q;'s Iowa lines, the superintendents of the telegraph and water service, 14 of the line's conductors, and several brakemen. Sundry employees were used as temporary firemen, running the gamut from mechanics to an assistant superintendent. Only four new engineers hired as strikebreakers were sent out on the road during this period. Hiring of replacement workers ‚Äî contemptuously known as \\"scabs\\" by striking workers ‚Äî began apace, with the emergency conscripts from the ranks of management returned to their jobs as rapidly as the quantity of new hires allowed. =Developments= Perkins brought in strikebreakers and Pinkerton agents.\\"Boycott and Strike,\\" Los Angeles Herald, vol. 30, no. 1 (April 3, 1888), pg. 1. On March 5, the union asked unionized workers on other railroads to boycott the CB&Q; by refusing to load freight onto its trains; Perkins went to federal court on March 8,Salvatore, Eugene V. Debs, pg. 76. to seek an injunction that would require the other railroads to load freight onto the CB&Q.; The federal court issued the injunction on March 13, and almost every aspect of labor relations on every railroad engaged in interstate commerce came under court control. =Termination= The strike was effectively broken within a month, but it lingered in some western states for another 10 months. Legacy Several workers were killed in violent episodes.Leonard C. Schlup and James G. Ryan (eds.), Historical Dictionary of the Gilded Age. London: Routledge, 2003; pg. 405. One was striking engineer George Watts, fatally shot in the temple by a deputized Burlington foreman on March 3, in Brookfield, Missouri.The victim is identified in news reports as \\"John Roxy\\" but an entire chapter (Chapter 35) in Salmons identifies him as Watts; Reports from Chicago at the end of March described riots, assaults, and arson of rolling stock and shop buildings. On April 28, in Galesburg, Illinois, a strikebreaker named Albert Hedberg shot two Burlington strikers and claimed self-defense. One of those two, longtime Burlington engineer Herbert W. Newell, died from his wounds. On July 13 a criminal trial began for six saboteurs, held responsible for a series of dynamite attacks on the railroad. Another two were arrested on the 17th. Nobody was hurt in the explosions and failed attacks, which happened in and around Aurora and Galesburg, Illinois. One of the defendants, \\"J.Q. Wilson\\", was identified in court as an infiltrator named Mulligan working for the Pinkertons. Mulligan calmly changed sides in the courtroom and his charges were dropped. Plotter and union official John A. Bauereisen received the longest sentence: two years. The two unions officially ended their strike unilaterally in January 1889. They both remained in operation and they both strongly oppose the Pullman Strike led by Debs in 1894, which also was a failure.

It is located in Quezon City, Philippines. Sherwin O is the President and founder Niel Dagondon is the Chairman of the Board.  History  CIIT Philippines - College of Arts and Technology was established in 2007 as Cosmopoint International Institute of Technology by Niel Dagondon. He is the founder and chief executive officer of Anino Games, a pioneer third-party game developer in the Philippines, and the director of Game Developers Association of the Philippines (GDAP). Founded in 2007 in response to the outsourcing boom and the shortage of qualified Filipino IT and multimedia professionals, Anino Games partnered with technological organizations to establish an ideal school that will meet the practical demands of the Philippine workforce. CIIT stresses practical knowledge and applications as much as theories to students. In 2008, CIIT introduced itself as a technical-vocational school offering two-year diploma courses and specialist programs to students in digital arts and IT. Its first diploma programs include Computer Graphic Design, Multimedia Application, Software Engineering, Network Design, and E-business. Three years later, 3D Animation and Game Development were added to its list of course offerings. CIIT is a previous member of the Cosmopoint Education Group from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and a partner of Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan University (KLMU). Through these tie-ups, students were given the option to proceed with their diploma courses, continue their studies in KLMU, and earn an International bachelor's degree in Malaysia.  Academic Programs  In 2013, however, the college has developed its own curriculum and acquired certification from the Commission on Higher Education to have its own bachelor's degree programs. These are Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts with specializations in Digital Graphics Design, 3D Visualization, and Video and Motion Graphics; and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with specializations in Software Engineering, Game Development, and Network Design. Along with the two bachelor's degree programs, it also offers a diploma course based on the bachelor's degree courses. Besides diploma and degree programs, the school also offers short courses in multimedia, web design, 3D animation, and game development. In addition, CIIT offers corporate training to companies needing customized instruction regarding the use of the latest software applications. In January 2014, its BA Multimedia Arts Program was accredited by the Commission on Higher Education. As part of the implementation of K-12 education system, CIIT Philippines also has a Senior High School program. Under the program, the students can specialize in multimedia arts, animation or programming. These specializations may then be transitioned into CIIT's corresponding college degree programs. In addition to being created to ensure a smooth transition, the SHS programs are also formed in such a way that the students will be able to pass the national certification exams for their chosen programs. To cater to its growing population, CIIT moves to a new six-floor building (Interweave Campus) in Kamuning, Quezon City in January 2018.

It is located at 1202 Bleury Street in the borough of Ville- Marie. It was adjacent to the Coll√®ge Sainte-Marie. History Ignace Bourget, the second bishop of Montreal, wanted the churches of his diocese to replicate the architecture of Roman churches. This was reflected in the design of Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral after St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Similarly, the Church of the Ges√π was based on the Church of the Ges√π in Rome. Construction began in 1864, and the church opened on July 10, 1865. The Ges√π witnessed the first \\"electric candle \\" lit in Canada in 1878. The Jesuit-run Coll√®ge Sainte-Marie was built south of the church. It was demolished in 1975, but the Ges√π was preserved and restored in 1983. Architecture Interior of the Church of the Ges√π. Experienced Irish- American architect Patrick Keely developed plans that drew heavily on the Church of the Ges√π in Rome, a grand Roman Baroque church in which Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus, is buried. The Church of the Ges√π in Montreal retained the Italian name of Jesus, found in its Roman counterpart. The Ges√π in Montreal is a not an exact replica of the Ges√π in Rome. It is nevertheless a large church of about with a vault height of above ground level. This is the only entirely baroque-style church in Montreal. The church was to be topped by two bell towers on either side of the entrance. The bases were constructed, although the towers were never completed for financial reasons. A large part of the funds raised for construction of the church were used instead to support the Coll√®ge Sainte-Marie. The vault of the Ges√π consists of five arches. It is adorned with frescoes by American painter Daniel Muller, who replicated work from the German school of D√ºsseldorf, depicting the life of Jesus. In this church, there is a statue of Notre-Dame- de-Liesse, brought from France in 1877, which contains the ashes of the original statue burned during the French Revolution. The basement of the Ges√π was converted into an auditorium and is one of the oldest cultural centers in Montreal. It has played an important role in Montreal's cultural life, welcoming both local and foreign actors, including the Compagnons de Saint- Laurent, under the direction of Father √âmile Legault, and the Th√©√¢tre du Nouveau Monde.

She studied art under the Post-Impressionist Percyval Tudor-Hart, with her brothers Sydney and Richard, and then at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks. She had a promising early start with her works being shown at the London Group, Royal Academy and New English Art Club. In 1925 she married fellow artist Stanley Spencer with whom she had what has been described as \\"the most bizarre domestic soap opera in the history of British art.\\" During the time that Carline lived with Spencer she rarely painted and it was not until they separated that she began painting more frequently. Carline's physical and mental health was poor starting several years after her divorce and after 1937 she lived with family members. Spencer became obsessed with his ex-wife with whom he corresponded and painted. In her later years she made religious works with pastels. She died in 1950, having struggled for several years with breast cancer. A touring exhibition of her works, The Art of Hilda Carline: Mrs. Stanley Spencer, was held in 1999. Early life Hilda Anne Carline was born on 20 November 1889 to the artist George Francis Carline and Annie Smith Carline, who had been adopted by a relative and never knew her mother or father, John Smith. Carline was one of five children born to the family. Of her brothers, Richard and Sydney became artists, and George chose another career. The family moved many times when she was a child. She lived in London until 1892 when the family moved to Oxford. After that, they lived in Switzerland, Derbyshire and returned to Oxford. Adulthood=Education and World War I service= George Carline taught his daughter to paint until October 1913, when she enrolled in the school that Percyval Tudor-Hart had established in Hampstead. Prior to that, Tudor-Hart had a school in Paris where her brothers Sydney and Richard had studied. Now, Sydney, Richard and Hilda lived and studied together, sharing their opinions about art. Hilda focused on making watercolour paintings and sketching. Tudor-Hart, a Post- Impressionist who was an early proponent of colour theories of Wassily Kandinsky, introduced them to avant-garde continental art that was \\"expressive, bold, abstract and 'primitive.'\\" From 1916 to 1918 Hilda did farm work for the Women's Land Army near Wangford, Suffolk. She made Return from the Farm, in a Gauguinesque style that reflected her connection to and appreciation for the countryside. After the war she enrolled at the Slade School of Art, where she studied part-time over five years. Under Henry Tonks, Carline studied line and formalism, which was different from the instruction she received from Tudor-Hart. She was able to leverage what she learned from Tudor-Hart to make works that were nearly abstract landscapes, and she also made refined landscapes and figures from Tonks instruction. She earned prizes for her drawings and paintings. In the early 1920s, Hilda participated in the gatherings of artists and intellectuals ‚Äì including Stanley Spencer, John and Paul Nash. ‚Äì that met at her family's house on Downshire Hill in Hampstead. Henry Lamb called them \\"cercle pan-artisque of Downshire Hill.\\" She and her brothers exhibited at the London Group, Hilda in 1921. She also exhibited at the New English Art Club and the Royal Academy. =Marriage= In December 1919 she met Stanley Spencer. He liked the fact that she was a devout Christian Scientist, talented, imaginative and striking. Spencer said of her: \\"I felt she had the same mental attitude to things as I had. I saw myself in that extraordinary person. I saw life with her.\\" The Carline family travelled for painting retreats and Stanley Spencer accompanied them on the 1920 Seaford, Sussex, 1922 Yugoslavia and 1924 Essex and Suffolk trips. Spencer and Hilda Carline often painted landscapes side-by-side, making similar works. He proposed to her six times before they were married, Spencer got cold feet and called the wedding off, only to ask her again. They were married quietly on 23 February 1925 and lived in the Vale of Heath Hotel, near Hampstead Heath. A shared studio was established at the Vale of Heath. In 1927 they moved to Hampshire and by 1931 they were living in Burghclere, Hampshire. They had two daughters, Shirin (born 1925) and Unity (born 1930). While the girls were young Carline was unable to paint much, needing to tend to them and household duties. Her self-confidence waned during her marriage to Spencer. He was a man of \\"idiosyncratic vision, unassailable conviction, egocentricity, and brilliance.\\" They could both be stubborn and argumentative. Richard Carline's wife, the artist Nancy Carline, contended that Spencer was frustrated by Hilda's lack of time to devote to paintings and housekeeping, and felt the time she spent gardening and sewing was unnecessary. Although Carline was not painting, she was the subject of several of Spencer's works, the drawings Hilda Nude and Hilda with Hair Down. She made Stanley Nude, which is similar in composition to the sketch Spencer made of her. All three were made in 1931 and ended the first period of works made of Hilda. Spencer and Carline moved in 1932 to Cookham and bought a large house called Lindworth. Spencer pursued a relationship with Patricia Preece, a neighbor, who had a lesbian lover, Dorothy Hepworth. Preece's actions were like that of a con-artist. Both women were artists, but Preece signed and exhibited Hepworth's works as if they were hers. In 1932 Carline made only two paintings, which journalist John Henshall attributed to depression. From 1932 the Carline-Spencers became increasingly independent of each other, and Spencer began painting and drawing Preece. Although he faltered on his obligations to provide support for Hilda and the girls, Spencer bought Preece gifts, including jewellery. By the mid-1930s the couple were living apart, their daughter Shirin was sent to live with a relative, and two of her brothers had died. Throughout the emotional crisis, her sister-in-law, Nancy Carline (wife of Richard) said that painting was therapeutic for her. One of the works, Lady in Green, was made of Preece, and she travelled to Cookham to make the painting. Carline and Spencer were divorced in May 1937, and Preece and Spencer were married the next week. The marriage was not consummated, they never lived together and Preece had him evicted from the house in 1938 after he had signed over his financial business and house to her. Spencer then lived in Hampstead in a single room. From 1937 on Carline and the girls lived with family members including her mother that year. Subsequently there began a decline in Carline's mental health. Spencer began visiting his ex-wife regularly after his relationship with Preece ended, although they remained legally married. via Questia (subscription required) Spencer made paintings of Carline, some of which were realistic portraits and others were imaginative paintings. =Art= When she began she made daring, unique paintings. She then was immersed in what Alfred Hickling of The Guardian phrased was \\"the most bizarre domestic soap opera in the history of British art.\\" She was one of the early British modernist painters and made important works and interacted with other artists in the movement. She never developed a theme or signature style, largely because of the long periods of not painting when she was married. Carline struggled to see herself, and have others see her, as a serious artist: when she was studying with her brothers she thought she just needed some space in a hall, while her brothers had their own rooms in the studio building. When she was married she shared a small room with her youngest daughter, Unity, and her things were cramped and hard to get to. She said: \\"I cannot even have my paintbox about ‚Äì it has to be packed away.\\" Carline shared some space at times with her husband but did not have the time or space to paint seriously. She became an artist during the Edwardian era, when there were strict responsibilities and limitations for single and married woman. The pathos of her lot seems borne out by the self- portrait that she made not long before she married. She seems trapped, shaded under her hat, and yet slightly defiant. Carline retained her own artistic style, like the portrait she made of Elsie, their housekeeper. It was a \\"meticulous and candid\\" portrayal. The quality of her work improved after her divorce. Towards the end of her life, Carline created works that expressed her devout religious beliefs using pastels. =Ill health and death= Her health began to falter in the 1940s. In 1942 she had a nervous breakdown, and was in a mental hospital for eight months, during which time she was visited every Sunday by Spencer. After their divorce, Spencer continued to be \\"obsessed\\" with her and that only increased after her breakdown. He became a prolific writer and painter. In 1947 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. On 1 November 1950 she died at Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, where Stanley had often been at her bedside. She was buried in Cookham, Berkshire. Spencer continued to be inspired by Carline after her death, continuing his stream of works from his memory and writing letters to her until his death. via Questia (subscription required) Carline's reputation has grown following her death. She is recognized for her talent, specifically for \\"her incisive portraits and atmospheric landscapes.\\" A touring exhibition of her work entitled The Art of Hilda Spencer: Mrs. Stanley Spencer, curated by Timothy Wilcox and Alison Thomas, was conducted in 1999. It was shown at Lincoln's Usher Gallery and Kenwood House. On the 60th anniversary of Carline's death, an exhibition was held in her honour. Her daughter Shirin opened the event on 10 April 2014. The works made by Stanley Spencer of her were exhibited at the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham.

It sits at the junction of three glens, Glenshee, Strathardle and Glenericht and is centred round the bridge over the River Ardle 200m before it joins the Black Water (which drains Glen Shee as Shee Water) to form the River Ericht. The A93 road from Perth to Aberdeen crosses the bridge where it forms a junction with the A924 road to Kirkmichael and Pitlochry. The village is on the Cateran Trail long distance path, and is popular in winter as it is near the Glen Shee skiing area. The village has a hotel, a post office / general store, an angling book shop, a village hall and a large holiday park. The hotel was originally a temperance establishment with alcohol being served for the first time in the 1960s. Until that time it served as the local petrol station and the proprietor operated a daily bus service along the A93 from Blacklunans to Blairgowrie. The Post Office and general store The local one-teacher school, known as Strone of Cally School, closed in 2011 and the site has been sold for house building. Pupils now attend school in Kirkmichael. The bridge, for which the village is named, is a Category B listed building and nearby Cally House, an early 19th-century house, is Category C listed. The village is in two parts with Bridge of Cally strictly comprising the hotel, post office and the houses and holiday park on the Kirkmichael road and Strone of Cally the houses and old school on the ridge above the bridge. A third settlement called Netherton lies half a mile away on the Drimmie road around a bridge over the Blackwater beside which is the old water powered wool mill. This closed in the 1950s and is now a house. The local parish church was built here in 1890 as part of the United Free Church of Scotland which amalgamated with the church of Scotland in 1928. Falling numbers led to a linkage with Glenshee & Cray parish which then linked with Kirkmichael and Straloch before a final merger with Rattray. Netherton kirk finally closed its doors in 2010 and is now the property of a local family.

He was also the fiction editor of the school literary magazine Vernissage and a member of the ironically-named physics and science enthusiasts club the Flat Earth Society. He attended the University of Virginia School of Architecture in 1976. It was at UVa that he first discovered D&D; through a gaming group led by Pete Fenlon, who was running a campaign set in Middle-earth. While at UVa, he took a number of classes in architectural history, focusing on Greek, Roman, and Pre-Columbian architecture. He also took graduate-level classes in advanced mathematics and art history. Amthor went on to graduate in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Design, while maintaining his close associations with the Fenlon group throughout his college years. This association led to his participation in the founding of Iron Crown Enterprises. Amthor's first published work was a Star Wars parody, \\"Raker Wars,\\" for the University of Virginia weekly paper The Declaration. Career at ICE Though Iron Crown Enterprises was founded and incorporated in 1980, initially it could afford few full-time employees. From 1980 to 1982, Terry Amthor worked at UVa's Fiske-Kimball Fine Arts Library and what was known then as the Sci-Tech Library Engineering and Science Library, serving in the bibliography departments of both libraries, and also contributing to the initial Library of Congress conversion from a card catalog to an online catalog, via OCLC. Terry K. Amthor was one of the original founders of Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) in 1980, along with Pete Fenlon, S. Coleman Charlton, Richard H. Britton, Bruce Shelley, Bruce Neidlinger, Kurt Fischer, Heike Kubasch, and Olivia Johnston. Amthor wrote Court of Ardor (1983),http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Court_of_Ardor an early Middle-earth campaign game book published by ICE as a Rolemaster supplement. It was the only published ICE supplement set outside of 'known' Middle-earth, and in many ways did not follow the 'feel' of Middle-earth. Pete Fenlon in an interview years later referred to Ardor as a 'rogue' module. Perhaps ironically, Court of Ardor has since become one of the most sought after ICE Middle-earth sourcebooks on bidding sites. Amthor was a major contributor to the original Rolemaster system, including Arms Law and Character Law, but mainly to Spell Law, working with Olivia Johnston.http://index.rpg.net/display- search.phtml?key=contributor&value;=Terry%2BK.%2BAmthor&sort;=system,systemversion In particular, Amthor and Johnston worked to create the realm of Mentalism Amthor wrote the first Middle-earth solo adventure book Spy in Isengard, after the line was re-licensed to George Allen & Unwin, and had to be approved by a 'Tolkien Scholar.'. \\"Spy in Isengard\\" was eventually translated into several languages. Amthor also collaborated with Kevin Barrett in the creation of Spacemaster (1985), the science-fiction version of Rolemaster, which also had a second edition in 1988. While at ICE, Amthor also wrote many game supplements for Rolemaster, MERP, and Spacemaster, including some Spacemaster supplements under the pseudonym A. Brooke Lindsay. In the early 80's he also wrote a multi-issue mystery story set in Spacemaster for Alarums and Excursions under another, even more fanciful, pseudonym, Preston Eisenhower IV, which he also used as editor of the ICE's irregular tabloid, the IQ, or Iron Crown Quarterly.http://rpggeek.com/rpgperiodical/1571/iron-crown- quarterly He later gave over editorial duties to become Production Manager and eventually Art Director at ICE, as the company grew and the founders needed to assume new duties. He worked with acclaimed artist Angus McBride, at first through ICE's Art Director Rick Britton, and then personally, to help create some of ICE's most iconic Middle-earth covers, including Lorien.http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/L%C3%B3rien_and_the_Halls_of_the_Elven_Smiths The second edition of Rolemaster (1989) was supported by Amthor's Shadow Worldhttp://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory8.phtml campaign setting, which combined the older Loremaster background into a larger whole. ICE needed its own fantasy world, and tapped Amthor to build on Fenlon's original Iron Wind and Vog Mur concepts, and create a unified fantasy world. He created a high-fantasy world with science-fiction legacy elements. While superficially similar to standard fantasy (e.g., Elves, Wizards...), it has a complex history featuring numerous factions, good and evil, vying for control. Elves are portrayed as technology-obsessed, even to the point of being 'steampunk.'http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9735.phtml Amthor also wrote an article for White Wolf Magazine,Queer as a Three-sided Die, about being gay and a gamer. Amthor was guest of honor at the Boras Spelkonvent 8, a gaming convention in Sweden, November 1990, and led a Middle-earth tournament. Later work After leaving ICE full-time in 1992, Amthor co-founded Metropolis Ltd. in order to produce the English-language version of the controversial Swedish modern-horror game Kult. In 1992‚Äì1994, Amthor edited, co-authored and art-directed several books for the line. He also wrote one module for Dungeons & Dragons: Thief's Challenge II: Beacon Point.Thief's Challenge II: Beacon Point Amthor says that it was initially difficult to get inspired about a generic adventure, and that he finds it much easier to write Shadow World and Space Master material. (Despite that initial difficulty, the adventure has received some good acclaim.)http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/17317/HHQ7-Thiefs-Challenge-II- Beacon-Point-2e?it=1 In 1992 Amthor founded Eidolon Studio, writing Shadow World supplements under license from ICE. He published the third edition of his Shadow World Master Atlas (2001) through Eidolon. He continues to write and produce RPG supplements for the current incarnation of Iron Crown Enterprises, Guild Companion Publications. Mjolnir published the Shadow World Master Atlas Fourth Edition (2003), Amthor's 224-page overview of the Shadow World. Shadow World Player Guide: The World (2010) by Amthor was a brand-new introduction to the Shadow World, and was published by Guild Companion Publications. He published his first fantasy novel, Loremaster Legacy, (set in the Shadow World environment) in 2013. Personal After graduating from the University of Virginia in 1980, Terry Amthor continued to live in Charlottesville, Virginia until 1992. Then he moved to Arlington, VA, until October 2015, when he moved back to Charlottesville. where he currently resides. He has travelled extensively, and has been to the U.K. several times, has travelled to Italy (Florence, Siena and Venice), Greece (Athens, Olympia, and several islands, including Crete, Mykonos, and Santorini), Turkey, Switzerland, and several countries in Central America to visit Maya Pre- Columbian sites, including Chichen Itza, Tikal, Cop√°n, and Tulum.http://www.eidolonstudio.com/Shadow_World/Travel_Pages.html Partial Publications List At Iron Crown Enterprises *The Iron Wind.

Woewiyu served as Defense Minister and Spokesman for the NPFL a rebel faction deemed responsible for over 60,000 violations, consisting of war crimes such as rape, slavery, conscription of child soldiers, and massacres, during Liberia's First Civil War (1989 - 1996). Woewiyu has held legal permanent resident status in the United States since 1972. There, he founded the Association for Constitutional Democracy in Liberia (ACDL) among the Liberian expatriate community in the U.S., an organization that advocated against the regime of the Samuel Doe, then President of Liberia. Woewiyu is also known for, at times, speaking out publicly against two former Liberian presidents Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Charles Taylor. Upon Woewiyu's return from a visit to Liberia, he was arrested at Newark Liberty International Airport accused of lying on immigration applications by omitting his role and authority within the NPFL. Notably, the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended that Thomas Woewiyu not take public office for thirty years based on his association in warring factions during the First Liberian Civil War.https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/3B6FC3916E4E18C6492575EF00259DB6-Full_Report_2.pdf  National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL)  The NPFL created and led by Charles Taylor and Thomas Woewiyu catalyzed the start of the First Liberian Civil War in 1989. The NPFL is reported to have campaigned for ethnically- targeted killings, the conscription of child soldiers, the forcing of individuals into sexual slavery, and the alleged organization and participation in \\"Operation Octopus.\\" The infamous Operation Octopus, one of the deadliest armed attacks in the history of West Africa,https://www.civitas- maxima.org/sites/default/files/docs/2018-07/180603_press_release_verdict_woewiyu_0.pdf led to the violent attempted seizure of Monrovia which resulted in the murder of thousands of combatants and civilians, including the executions of five American nuns.https://www.civitas- maxima.org/sites/default/files/docs/2018-06/cm_180608_press_release_woewiyu_trial_beginning_eg_and_fr_4.pdf By April 1990, the NPFL controlled almost 90% of the country. While the NPFL was committing these crimes, Thomas Woewiyu served as the faction's Spokesman and Defense Minister. At the height of the conflict in the early 1990s and due to the nature of his role as spokesman for NPFL, Woewiyu had conversations with U.S. State Department officials and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) about the NPFL's frustrations about the political state in Liberia.  National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council (NPFL-CRC)  In 1994, as a result of ideological dissent, Woewiyu broke away from Taylor's forces and created his own movement: the NPFL-CRC (National Patriotic Front of Liberia, Central Revolutionary Council). He, Samuel Dokie, and J. Lavela Supuwood led the movement. Woewiyu later made multiple accusations of war crimes against Taylor, claiming that Taylor not only murdered his rival Jackson Doe, but drank Doe's blood.Stephen Ellis, The Mask of Anarchy: the Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of an African Civil War, C Hurst & Co, 1999. . p 85 NPFL-CRC had limited resources but still engaged in small battles with similar tactics as the NPFL, ULIMO-J, ULIMO-K, and the LPC, however they were not a major force in the conflict. Later, Woewiyu reunited with Charles Taylor after his election as President in 1997, serving as his Minister of Labor from 1997 to 1999.  Association for Constitutional Democracy in Liberia (ACDL)  The ACDL was established by Woewiyu and members of the Liberian expatriate community, many of whom were in exile.https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2014/140513philadelphia.pdf This movement was resolutely against Samuel Doe, then Liberian President who gained office through a coup d'√©tat in 1980. The ACDL is known for their letter published in Front Page Africa which details the movements of the NFPL, their grievances against Samuel Doe, and calls for donations from \\"citizens as well as friends of Liberia.\\"https://allafrica.com/view/resource/main/main/id/00081608.html Another notable member of the ACDL was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who later went on to become President of Liberia and was jointly awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. Woewiyu publicly claimed that the ACDL had raised substantial funds, given by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to financially contribute to the war through the NPFL.  Arrest  On Woewiyu's return from Liberia back to the United States in May 2014, he was arrested due to a criminal investigation that began in January of that year, by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Newark Liberty International Airport on charges of lying on his immigration application for U.S. citizenship omitting his involvement in the NPFL and in other war crimes. This arrest coincides with the launch of his bid for senator in Liberia. While filing naturalization papers in 2006, 34 years after obtaining legal permanent resident status, Woewiyu failed to disclose his membership in the NPFL, and later NPFL-CRC, both of which were rebel factions during the First Liberian Civil War. He omitted his participation in advocating for a government overthrow, he denied persecuting people discriminately, and he failed to disclose a previous criminal conviction. He pleaded not guilty and was denied bail. The FBI had originally indicated that it planned to charge Woewiyu in relation to the 1992 killing of 5 American nuns Liberia. = Charges = In his indictment file, Thomas Woewiyu was charged with 16 counts relating to immigration fraud and perjury: * 2 counts of fraudulently attempting to obtain citizenship under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1425 * 4 counts of fraud in immigration documents under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1546(a) * 3 counts of false statements in relation to naturalization under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1015(a) * 7 counts of perjury under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1621 Specifically, Woewiyu allegedly lied when asked: * If he has ever been a member of or associated with any organization, association, fund, foundation, party, club, society, or similar group in the U.S. or any other place. ** Answering yes, however mentioning only one association in the U.S., Union of Liberia Associations, and not disclosing his membership to the NPFL or NPFL-CRC. * If he ever advocated (directly or indirectly) to overthrow any government by force or violence. ** Answering no and not disclosing his advocacy to overthrow the government of former Liberian President Samuel Doe. * If he ever persecuted (directly or indirectly) any person because of race, religion, national origin, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ** Answering no and not disclosing NPFL membership and persecution of others based on political opinions and race (Krahn and Mandingo tribes). * If he ever was convicted of a crime or offense. ** Answering no and not disclosing a 1970 conviction in New York State for falsification of business records  Trial  Woewiyu was not charged with war crimes, but with immigration fraud based on connections to war crimes in Liberia. Because he was arrested in 2014 and didn't face trial until 2018, Woewiyu felt his right to a speedy and fair trial was violated. As such, on December 20, 2017, Woewiyu filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, which was later denied on January 31, 2018.https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/18D0366P.pdf On June 11, 2018, Woewiyu's trial began at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania at the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse. The prosecutors were United States Attorney William M. McSwain, Assistant United States Attorney Linwood C. Wright, Jr., and Assistant United States Attorney Nelson S. T. Thayer, Jr.. The defense attorneys included Catherine Henry, a Senior Litigator with the Federal Community Defense Office and Mark T. Wilson, of the Defender Association of Philadelphia. The trial lasted for 13 days and included the testimonies of 66 witnesses of which over 30 were Liberians. = Defense Strategy = The defense claimed Woewiyu answered the complex and unclear questions on the immigration application to the best of his ability. Largely through cross-examination of U.S. officials, the defense argued that the government already knew about Woewiyu's ties to the NPFL, because he served as Spokesman and due to the prior investigations on him. His defense attorneys assured that Woewiyu had nothing to do with the persecution of Liberians based on ethnicity, and that Doe's regime was not a legitimate government and he therefore did not lie when he denied ever having participated in the overthrow of a government. The defense called on Woewiyu's immigration lawyer to testify to the immigration application meeting and claimed a rushed experience. To testify to Mr. Woewiyu's honest and trustworthy character, the defense called Mr. Woeiwyu's children. The defense repeatedly challenged what all of these wartime violations had to do with Woewiyu's case, it was about immigration. = Prosecution Strategy = The prosecution's strategy during the trial was to demonstrate that Woewiyu lied because of the atrocities by the NPFL, and thus he deliberately omitted his authority in the NPFL knowing he would have been otherwise denied citizenship. Thayer told the jury that the evidence will show that while Woewiyu was under oath, he lied on official U.S. government forms, in particular his Citizenship Application Form N-400, and that he repeated those lies, again while under oath, in a subsequent interview with an Immigration Officer. = Verdict = Jucontee Thomas Woewiyu was found guilty on 11 of the 16 counts: * 2 counts of fraudulently attempting to obtain citizenship * 2 counts of fraud in immigration documents * 2 counts of false statements in relation to naturalization * 5 counts of perjury Indictment Filed: January 30, 2014 Verdict Issued: July 3, 2018 = Sentencing and death = Woewiyu's sentencing was first scheduled for October 15, 2018: he faced up to 75 years in prison and a fine. He was not in custody awaiting sentencing, that was postponed several times during 2018 and 2019. After the last postponement in April 2019, a new date for the hearing was not set, but was expected in 2020. On April 12, he died of COVID-19 after a week of treatment at the Bryn Mawr Hospital in Philadelphia, U.S. = International Significance = For many, this trial represents more than a conviction, it is an additional step in pursuit of justice and accountability for Liberia's victims of war crimes. Both the international community and the Liberian government have failed to provide mechanisms for justice to the numerous victims of the Liberian Civil Wars. This marks the second trial in the U.S. where Liberian victims testified to hold an alleged war criminal accountable for his actions during the First Liberian Civil War (1989-1996). Woewiyu's trial is the very first time that witnesses were able to testify in criminal court about crimes committed by the NPFL.  Debate  The Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established by the Liberian Transitional Government in 2005, published its final recommendations in 2009, suggesting that Liberia establish a Special Criminal Court to prosecute war-related crimes. However, Liberia lacks the political will to implement the recommendations and many alleged war criminals hold positions of power making prosecution for war crimes impossible in the national criminal justice system. Though questions have circled around Woewiyu's trial questioning why his case wasn't taken to the International Criminal Court (ICC) under international humanitarian law, Woewiyu was unable to be tried in the ICC. The ICC in the Hague has only had jurisdiction since July, 2002, and therefore does not have jurisdiction over crimes committed during Liberia's First Civil War, spanning from 1989-1996. Woewiyu's war crimes were committed before both the existence of the ICC and before Liberia ratified the Rome Statute, the founding document of the ICC. Liberia ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC in 2004. In addition, since the charges are related to U.S. immigration and Woewiyu had legal residency in the U.S., the United States holds jurisdiction. This does, however, provide the opportunity to document alleged war crimes committed in Liberia by someone residing in the U.S. in a legitimate criminal court of law. However, there has been a growing movement in Liberian society pushing for increased accountability for those who committed grave crimes during the Liberian Civil Wars. Additionally, both Liberians and international actors, notably in the UN Human Rights Committee in 2018, have increased pressure on the Liberian government to implement a war crimes court as recommended by the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report. This is also in response to some resistance in the trials of Liberian warlords happening outside of Liberia.  Related Cases  Mohammed ‚ÄúJungle Jabbah‚Äù Jabateh, was found guilty after three weeks of trial in Philadelphia, PA, of immigration fraud and perjury. The charges were connected to failing to disclose his role with the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) as commander of the rebel faction. In April, 2018, ‚ÄúJungle Jabbah‚Äù was sentenced to 30 years in prison. George Boley, Liberian immigrant to the United States was subject to administrative removal proceedings for his connection to the recruitment of child soldiers and extrajudicial killings. He was deported to Liberia in 2012. Boley was elected in 2017 as part of the Legislator of the Republic of Liberia. There has also been a case where an American citizen was held accountable for atrocities committed during Liberia's Second Civil War. Chuckie Taylor, American son of Charles Taylor, was sentenced in 2009 in the U.S. for torture he committed during the Second Liberian Civil War. He was tried for torture, and not immigration-related crimes, as a U.S. citizen and was the first-ever to be tried under 18 U.S.C.¬ß 2340, or the ‚ÄúTorture Act,‚Äù which states an act of torture committed outside the U.S. by a U.S. national is punishable by law.

However, on 6 January 1910, he accepted their help in stripping the ship, as he could find no buyer. This included removing the two masts, the bowsprit, and the rigging. The ship quickly deteriorated, and within a few years the remains were buried in the sand. The wreck partially resurfaced periodically over the next century. The remains resurfaced in 2004, when the beach shifted. They remained half-buried in the intertidal zone of the beach until 2009, when they were once again buried by the shifting sand dunes. The remains partially resurfaced in early 2014, with just the tip of the stem breaking the surface of the sand. In July 2015, the wreck surfaced enough to permit a non-excavation-based archeological survey to document the wreck and confirm its identity as part of a teaching program for Salem State University. In early 2020 the shifting sands once again exposed the ship down to its keel. The wreck is just visible at high tide and fully exposed during low tide. ReferencesExternal links * H.A.

The boy ends up inadvertently causing a stampede, however, then drowns while attempting to cross a raging river. News comes that the war is over.

The book details Cahalan's struggle with a rare form of encephalitis and her recovery. It was first published on November 13, 2012, through Free Press in hardback, and was later reprinted in paperback by Simon & Schuster after the two companies merged. Synopsis The book narrates Cahalan's issues with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and the process by which she was diagnosed with this form of encephalitis. She woke up in a hospital with no memory of the events of the previous month, during which time she had violent episodes and delusions. Her eventual diagnosis was made more difficult by various physicians misdiagnosing her with several theories such as \\"partying too much\\" and schizoaffective disorder. Eventually several physicians, including Dr. Souhel Najjar, began to suspect that Cahalan was suffering from an autoimmune disease. Najjar diagnosed Cahalan using a test that involved her drawing a clock, a test normally given to people suspected of having dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Rather than drawing the clock face normally, the disease caused Cahalan to draw all the numbers 1 through 12 on the right face of the clock, because the right side of her brain, which regulates the left side of the body, was inflamed. Najjar used this to help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery.Cahalan, Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness, pp. 131-33. The book also covers Cahalan's life after her recovery, including her reactions to watching videotapes of her psychotic episodes while in the hospital. Cahalan also discusses her symptoms prior to her hospitalization, as she had previously been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with bipolar disorder. While researching, she learned that the disease had been discovered just three years before she became ill. Her research indicated that in 2009 most people with the disease were either misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Cahalan was fortunate to be correctly diagnosed because, according to Najjar's estimates, only 10 percent of people with the disease were properly diagnosed at that time.Cahalan, Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness, pp. 221-27. Since then, a better understanding of the disease and its symptoms has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and treatment. Reception Critical reception for Brain on Fire has been mostly positive. NPR commented that the author was \\"a naturally talented prose stylist\\" and that \\"she perfectly tempers her brutal honesty with compassion and something like vulnerability.\\" The Washington Post praised Cahalan's researching abilities for the book, as they noted that she had to rely on information from others, including family members and medical documents. Film adaptation In May 2014, it was announced that the book was being adapted into a film of the same name starring Chlo√´ Grace MoretzKit, Borys (June 26, 2015). \\"Chloe Grace Moretz to Star in 'Brain on Fire' (Exclusive)\\".

It was at full-forward that he kicked four goals for East Fremantle in their 1979 WANFL Grand Final win over South Fremantle. With prolific goal scoring team mate Kevin Taylor at South Melbourne, Thomson topped East Fremantle's goal-kicking in 1981.

Opportunity classes have been regarded by some parents as feeder schools for selective schools; however, not all students in opportunity classes successfully gain admission to selective schools. The reality is that entry to both OC and Selective High School classes is via standardized testing that focuses on ability in mathematics, english and general ability (basically an IQ-style test), and that there are fewer places available for entry to OC (~1800) than to Selective High School (4214 places in 2015Selective HS Statistics and Reports), so in theory it is 'harder' to gain entry into OC than Selective High School and a large percentage of students attending OC classes gain entry to Selective High School, or gain a scholarship to a private high school. Admission Parents of prospective applicants for opportunity classes complete an \\"Intention to Apply\\" form provided by the school, then complete an online application. Prospective applicants undertake an aptitude test, consisting of mathematics and English literacy components, the marks for which are sent with assessment scores based on the student's performance in Years 3 and 4 by the applicant's school principal.

Life He was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow. He gained the Browne gold medal for a Greek ode in 1776, and graduated B.A. 1778, M.A. 1788, M.A. Oxford, ad eundem, 19 February 1812. Hayter was presented by his college to the rectory of Hepworth, Suffolk in Suffolk, and was chaplain in ordinary to the Prince of Wales. In 1800 the Prince of Wales undertook to continue the unrolling and deciphering of the papyri found at Herculaneum in 1752. Hayter was put on a salary and sent to Naples, to take charge of the \\"Officina\\" and direct the work; the papyri had been moved to Palermo. Hayter began operations in 1802 at Portici, near Naples. He had charge of the papyri from 1802 to 1806. In four years about two hundred rolls were opened, and nearly one hundred copied in lead-pencil facsimiles under Hayter's superintendence. On the French invasion of Naples in 1806 Hayter moved to Palermo; the original papyri fell into the hands of the French. The lead-pencil facsimiles also passed out of Hayter's hands, but were recovered from the Neapolitan authorities through the influence of William Drummond of Logiealmond, the British minister. At Palermo Hayter superintended the engraving of the Carmen Latinum and the Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ŒòŒ±ŒΩŒ¨œÑŒøœÖ. In 1809 Hayter was recalled to England by the Prince of Wales. He died at Paris from apoplexy on 29 November 1818, in his sixty-third year. Works Hayter's lead-pencil facsimiles and the engravings made at Palermo were presented by the prince in 1810 to the university of Oxford. The appendix to Walter Scott's Fragmenta Herculanensia contains reproductions of copper-plates engraved from Hayter's lead-pencil facsimiles. Hayter published: * The Herculanean and Pompeian Manuscripts [London?], 1800. * The Herculanean Manuscripts, 2nd edit. London, 1810. * Observations upon a Review of the \\"Herculanensia\\" in the \\"Quarterly Review\\", London, 1810. These three works were published as \\"Letters\\" to the Prince of Wales. * A Report upon the Herculanean Manuscripts, London, 1811.

It belongs to the Oshikango electoral constituency in the Ohangwena Region. Odibo is also an Archdeaconry in the Diocese of Namibia. Odibo is situated on top of a large underground water reservoir. Cracks in the soil and in stone structures are attributed to this. The village Headman is Charles Namoloh, Namibia's Minister of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development. History St Mary's Mission in Odibo was established in August 1924 by George Tobias, Nelson Fogarty, and Reverend R White, Anglican priest that had the task of setting up a mission in northern Ovamboland. The tree where they camped before starting their work is today known as Tobias' Tree. The mission eventually comprised a church, a hospital, and the St Mary Mission School, a high school and seminary. St Mary Mission School operated until 1979 when it was closed by the South African colonial administration. Several notable people attended this school, including human rights activist and Bishop James Kauluma,James Kauluma: A warrior for justice (1933 to 2007) New Era, 12 February 2010 National Council member Michael Hishikushitja, People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) commander Peter Mweshihange, National Assembly member and Bishop of Ovamboland Peter Kalangula and Minister of Foreign Affairs Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. During the Namibian War of Independence the seminary was bombed in 1981 by the South African Defence Force. Education There are two schools at the village, St. Mary's Odibo High School, the successor of Saint Mary Mission School, and Odibo Combined School. There is also a Lutheran Centre for Arts and Crafts for artistic subjects, established by one of Namibia's most famous artists, John Muafangejo, in the early 1970s.

Grenier and starring Stephen Baldwin, Macha Grenon and Michael Ironside. Synopsis Stephen Baldwin in 2008 Marketing executive Desmond Caine (Stephen Baldwin) is stricken with a bizarre form of insomnia, spending his nights walking the city's dangerous streets at night. Caine ends up at a local deli where he encounters some unusual characters: a nice, if bit lost, young woman (Macha Grenon) and a slightly deranged man who looks homeless (Michael Ironside), and an anti-social policeman. During one of his half-hallucinogenic journeys, Caine witnesses a brutal murder. He finds the victim's watch and goes to the police. Returning to the scene, there is no sign of the crime. Stranger still, Caine's girlfriend (Maxim Roy) is completely unaware that he gets up at night and wanders the city, while his personal assistant (Janet Kidder) seems to know all about his exploits. The police discover that the murdered man was connected to Caine's girlfriend; no longer only a witness, he is now the prime suspect... Michael Ironside in 2009 Cast *Stephen Baldwin as Desmond Caine *Macha Grenon as W.D. *Michael Ironside as Skay *Maxim Roy as Chaney Streeter *Janet Kidder as Kimberly 'Kick' Birmingham Genre In July 2000, Dead Awake was described as \\"a thriller with a dark twist of comedy\\". Production=Background= Locomotion Films, part of the Montreal Exponent Group, comprising commercial houses La Fabrique d'Images and S.W.A.T Films, and post and digital effects house Buzz Image Group, was officially launched in 1999 with a view to developing English- and French-track feature films, television series, and dramatic shorts. Director and co-producer Marc S. Grenier said he and his colleagues were ready \\"to do something entirely serious\\", moving into fiction after working many years in commercials (Grenier directed the 1999 Cinequest Films entry Cause of Death, and the 1998 Motion International television movie Fatal Affair). Dead Awake was made for television, and was Locomotion's second feature production for the year 2000 with a budget of $4.2 million. =Writing= The screenplay was written by Chicago-based Terry Abrahamson. Two working titles for the film were Wild Awake and Dead of Night. =Filming= Principal photography took place over twenty days in Montreal, June 9 to July 6, 2000, under the working title Dead of Night. Grenier said that cinematographer David Franco used a lot of interesting wide angle shots, giving the film \\"an unusual and edgy look.\\" Grenier elaborated: \\"The whole movie is like a maze. You know there's an exit but it seems unreachable and everything just keeps getting weirder and weirder.\\" Release and reception Dead Awake was first broadcast on November 6, 2001. =Distribution= In July 2000, it was announced that Dead Awake would be distributed by Lions Gate Films in Canada, by Millennium Pictures in the United States and by Martien Holding internationally. Home media Dead Awake was released on VHS (Millennium), DVD (First Look Home Entertainment), and Blu-ray in 2002. Streaming The film is currently available on Amazon Prime. =Critical response= The author of Critic Online calls Dead Awake one of the better Canadian thrillers of the early 2000s because of its interesting characters, and one of Stephen Baldwin's best films, because \\"it incorporates his morose acting style into the script.\\" The Great Canadian Movie Guide assigns the film 3 stars, praising the unconventional performances and imaginative story. Johnny Betts was \\"surprised\\" to find that Dead Awake \\"is actually a decent little movie\\" with \\"a plot and doesn't rely on women taking off their clothes every two minutes (a staple in most straight-to-video movies).\\" Betts also praised the \\"mix of plot twists, dark humor, and weirdness.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official trailer on YouTube * * Category:2001 films Category:2001 psychological thriller films Category:Canadian psychological thriller films Category:Canadian films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Montreal Category:Insomnia in film ","title":"Dead Awake (2001 film)"},{"id":"41583056","text":"Cypher is a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient data querying in a property graph. Cypher was largely an invention of Andr√©s Taylor while working for Neo4j, Inc. (formerly Neo Technology) in 2011. Cypher was originally intended to be used with the graph database Neo4j, but was opened up through the openCypher project in October 2015. The language was designed with the power and capability of SQL (standard query language for the relational database model) in mind, but Cypher was based on the components and needs of a database built upon the concepts of graph theory. In a graph model, data is structured as nodes (vertices in math and network science) and relationships (edges in math and network science) to focus on how entities in the data are connected and related to one another.  Graph model  Cypher is based on the Property Graph Model, which organizes data into nodes and edges (called ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù in Cypher). In addition to those standard graph elements of nodes and relationships, the property graph model adds labels and properties for describing finer categories and attributes of the data. Nodes are the entities in the graph. They can hold any number of attributes (key- value pairs) called properties. Nodes can be tagged with zero or more labels (like tags or categories), representing their different roles in a domain. Relationships provide directed, named, semantically-relevant connections between two node entities. A relationship always has a direction, a start node, an end node, and exactly one relationship type. Like nodes, relationships can also have properties. Labels can group similar nodes together by assigning zero or more node labels. Labels are kind of like tags and allow you to specify certain types of entities to look for or create. Properties are key-value pairs with a binding of a string key and some value from the Cypher type system. Cypher queries are assembled with patterns of nodes and relationships with any specified filtering on labels and properties to create, read, update, delete data found in the specified pattern. = Type system = The Cypher type system includes many of the common types used in other programming and query languages. Supported types include scalar value types such as boolean, string, number, integer, and floating-point numbers. It also supports temporal types like datetime, localdatetime, date, time, localtime, and duration. Container types for maps and lists are available, along with graph types for node, relationship, and path, and a void type.  Syntax  The Cypher query language depicts patterns of nodes and relationships and filters those patterns based on labels and properties. Cypher‚Äôs syntax is based on ASCII art, which is text-based visual art for computers. This makes the language very visual and easy to read because it both visually and structurally represents the data specified in the query. For instance, nodes are represented with parentheses around the attributes and information regarding the entity. Relationships are depicted with an arrow (either directed or undirected) with the relationship type in brackets. //node (variable:Label {propertyKey: 'propertyValue'}) //relationship -[variable:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]-> //Cypher pattern (node1:LabelA)-[rel1:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(node2:LabelB) = Keywords = Similar to other query languages, Cypher contains a variety of keywords for specifying patterns, filtering patterns, and returning results. Among those most common are: MATCH, WHERE, and RETURN. These operate slightly differently than the SELECT and WHERE in SQL; however, they have similar purposes. MATCH is used before describing the search pattern for finding nodes, relationships, or combinations of nodes and relationships together. WHERE in Cypher is used to add additional constraints to patterns and filter out any unwanted patterns. Cypher‚Äôs RETURN formats and organizes how the results should be outputted. Just as with other query languages, you can return the results with specific properties, lists, ordering, and more. Using the keywords with the pattern syntax shown above, the example query below will search for the pattern of the node (Actor label and property called name with value of 'Nicole Kidman') connected by a relationship (ACTED_IN type and outgoing direction away from the first node) to another node (Movie label). The WHERE clause then filters to only keep patterns where the Movie node in the match clause has a year property that is less than the value of the parameter passed in. In the return, the query specifies to output the movie nodes that fit the pattern and filtering from the match and where clauses. MATCH (nicole:Actor {name: 'Nicole Kidman'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie) WHERE movie.year < $yearParameter RETURN movie Cypher also contains keywords to specify clauses for writing, updating, and deleting data. CREATE and DELETE are used to create and delete nodes and relationships. SET and REMOVE are used to set values to properties and add labels on nodes. MERGE is used to create nodes uniquely without duplicates. Nodes can only be deleted when they have no other relationships still existing. For example: MATCH (startContent:Content)-[relationship:IS_RELATED_TO]->(endContent:Content) WHERE endContent.source = 'user' OPTIONAL MATCH (endContent)-[r]-() DELETE relationship, endContent  Standardization  With the openCypher project, an effort began to standardize Cypher as the query language for graph processing. As part of this process there have been five face-to-face openCypher Implementers Meetings (oCIMs). The first meeting took place in February 2017 at SAP's headquarters in Walldorf in Germany, coincident with a meeting of the Linked Data Benchmark Council. The most recent OCIM took place in Berlin,https://www.opencypher.org/events coincident with the W3C Workshop on Web Standards for Graph Data Management, in March 2019. At that meeting, there was a consensus to work towards Cypher becoming a significant input into a wider project for an international standardized Graph Query Language called GQL. In September 2019, a proposal for a GQL standard project was approved by a vote of national standards bodies which are members of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (responsible for information technology standards). The GQL project proposal states the following: Using graph as a fundamental representation for data modeling is an emerging approach in data management. In this approach, the data set is modeled as a graph, representing each data entity as a vertex (also called a node) of the graph and each relationship between two entities as an edge between corresponding vertices. The graph data model has been drawing attention for its unique advantages. Firstly, the graph model can be a natural fit for data sets that have hierarchical, complex, or even arbitrary structures. Such structures can be easily encoded into the graph model as edges. This can be more convenient than the relational model, which requires the normalization of the data set into a set of tables with fixed row types. Secondly, the graph model enables efficient execution of expensive queries or data analytic functions that need to observe multi-hop relationships among data entities, such as reachability queries, shortest or cheapest path queries, or centrality analysis. There are two graph models in current use: the Resource Description Framework (RDF) model and the Property Graph model. The RDF model has been standardized by W3C in a number of specifications. The Property Graph model, on the other hand, has a multitude of implementations in graph databases, graph algorithms, and graph processing facilities. However, a common, standardized query language for property graphs (like SQL for relational database systems) is missing. GQL is proposed to fill this void..

The sketch includes the whole slow introduction and the first theme of the Allegro before breaking off. It is one of Schubert's six unfinished symphonies. It was begun in 1811, when Schubert was fourteen years old, but it is unclear exactly how much he wrote before he abandoned the symphony (despite the fact that he would live another seventeen years). Its instrumentation is for the standard early Schubertian and classical orchestra, with the addition of trombones. Schubert authority, conductor, and composer Brian Newbould suggests that the piece was modelled on Ludwig van Beethoven's second symphony. Despite Beethoven's second not including trombones, Schubert included trombones in this incomplete work. Newbould states that the presence of trombones does not fit well with early Schubert's orchestral style and notes that they \\"have nothing special to contribute. Nor is the youngster sure how to notate their part. ... Perhaps he was merely obeying one of those headstrong impulses that impel the young to run before they can walk.\\" Nonetheless, the way Schubert uses the trombones in D 2B indicates that he already knew what their function was in a Classical orchestra. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\tempo \\"Adagio\\" \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 d8.\\\\f( \\\\times 4/6 { e64 fis g a b cis)} d8\\\\p d d d } References * Discovering Music ‚Äì The Spirit of Schubert.

A dairy is a small owner-operated convenience store in New Zealand, licensed to sell groceries, milk, eggs, dairy products, perishables, newspapers and other staples during and after normal trading hours. Origins and usage The term dairy came into common usage in New Zealand English to describe small shops by the late 1930s. Perishables such as milk and eggs were formerly delivered to city households from a dairy farm; by the late 1930s, small shops stocked such produce, and the term shifted to describe these shops. In addition to this meaning, New Zealand English retains the common meanings of dairy, referring to milk, milk-derived products and associated industries. The distinction between dairies, superettes and grocery stores has grown increasingly blurred in New Zealand English, a fact acknowledged by the Liquor Licensing Authority in 1991, and by the Law Commission. Contributing factors to this blurring of meanings include the deregulation of trading shop hours on Sundays, ambiguity over alcohol sales laws (see Sales of alcohol below), and the abolition of restrictions on types of goods permitted to be sold by dairies. The Law Commission summed up the ambiguity as follows: Business and culture Dairies rely on long hours rather than high mark-ups to make money, and are not overly profitable. As small operators, they cannot get bulk discounts that supermarkets get. As dairies must remain open long hours to stay profitable, they are almost always family-run businesses that utilise family members to run the shop. New Zealand introduced the 40-hour working week in 1945, ending Saturday trading hours for most grocers. Dairies were allowed to stay open outside normal working hours and on Saturdays. During the 1990s and 2000s, dairies became less profitable as other stores made inroads into their niche as nearby stores open outside regular trading hours. As supermarkets opened for longer hours with the introduction of deregulated shopping hours in 1990, and petrol stations extended the range of goods they sold, dairies began to lose their competitive advantage. =Immigrant ownership= A 1994 study found that 227 of the 269 dairies (%) in central Auckland were owned by Indians. Dairies are often self- owned by immigrants, who may face difficulties entering the workforce. Some dairy owners intended to give their children white collar or professional occupations, while other dairies had inter-generational ownership, with children taking over the store when they reach adulthood. The role of dairies in New Zealand's immigrant Indian culture was explored in Jacob Rajan's 1997 play Krishnan's Dairy, which toured internationally to positive reviews. =Sales of alcohol and legal highs= The Sale of Liquor Act (1989) prohibited the sale of liquor in \\"any shop of a kind commonly known as a dairy\\", without explicitly defining what a dairy was. In the wake of the act, dairies began altering their stock in order to qualify for a liquor license. This resulted in \\"a proliferation of small stores distinguishable from dairies only because they are licensed to sell alcohol.\\" The legislation contributed to the blurring distinction between dairies and grocery stores in New Zealand English. The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 sought to close this unintended loophole, clarifying the types of stores eligible to sell alcohol and ensuring dairies and convenience stores cannot sell alcohol. The law attracted criticism from dairy owners. The Psychoactive Substances Act (2013) prohibits dairies from selling legal highs.

The temple is located in Omkar Ashram, in Omkar Hills Bangalore. Omkar Hills in Srinivasapura is one of the highest points of Bangalore. The Sri Dwadasha Jyotirlinga Devasthana is unique, and one of the most magnificent and gigantic temples in Karnataka.  Importance  In Sri Dwadasha Jyotirlinga temple, the 12 representative Jyotirlingas of the original Puranik twelve Jyotirlingas, which are in different parts of our country, are in one temple, each with an individual Garbhagraha and Vimanagopuram. The Dwadasha (12) Jyotirlingas are very sacred and auspicious and are different from the ordinary shiva lingams. As per the Shastras, the darshanam of even a single Jyotirlinga will lead to moksha. In Sanskrit, jyoti means light. So a Jyotirlinga is a shrine where Lord Shiva, is worshipped in the form of a Jyotirlingam or \\"Lingam of light.\\" Puranas say that Lord Shiva first manifested himself as a Jyotirlinga on the night of the Arudra Nakshatra and thus the special reverence for the Jyotirlinga. The names and the locations of the 12 Jyotirlingas are mentioned in the Shiva Purana. This Dwadasha Jyotirlinga temple is in the Omkar ashram which is an abode of temples and religious activities, namely - Sri Matsya Narayana temple, Sri Vanadurga temple, Sri Nagadevatha temple, Sri Muneeshwara temple, Goshala, Vishwamitra Veda Vidyalaya, Sacred Banyan tree, Religious harmony memorial, giant tower clock which is one of the biggest clock in the world and a monastery. Hence a pilgrimage to this Dwadasha Jyotirlinga theertha kshetra and having darshan of all the temples and the blessings of sanyasins, will remove all the nava graha doshas (defects of the nine astrological planets) which are the source of all miseries and brings abundant grace, joy, health, wealth and peace.  History  This temple was founded by Brahmaleena Sadguru Sri Shivapuri Mahaswamiji with the intention of providing an opportunity to each and every devotee, for Jyotirlinga darshana, which otherwise requires health, wealth and time, as the original Jyotirlinga temples are in different parts of India. It also serves the purpose of propagating awareness, significance and uniqueness of these twelve Jyotirlingas to the younger generation. The construction of this temple was started in 2002 by Sri Shivapuri Mahaswamiji, and it continued for many years. However, before he could complete this divine task, he attained Samadhi, (left his mortal coil) in 2007. Later his Sannyasin disciple, Sri Madhusudhanananda Puri Swamiji became his successor, (The Peetadhipathi of Omkara Ashrama Mahasamsthana), and continued the temple work. The Pranaprathishta (consecration) of the 12 Jyotirlingas and Mahakumbhabhishekam of the Temple was done by Sri Swami Madhusudhanananda Puri on the Auspicious day of Wednesday, 16 February 2011, in the divine presence of many Saints, Holy men, purohits and others with elaborate rituals, Japas, Homams and Poojas.  Temple  Sri Omkareshwar Inside the main temple, the 12 Jyotirlingas are seen along with Sri Vidyaganapathi, Sri Subrahmanya, Sri Kalabhairava, Sri Chandikeshwara, Ekadasha (11) Rudradevatas, Panchaloha Nataraja weighing around 1000 kg and the Divine Mother Shakti in the form of Sri Yantra. Of these Twelve Jyotirlingas, the Omkareshwara Jyotirlinga measuring around 6 Feet in height, is at the centre of the temple, encircled by the other Eleven Jyotirlingas. Omkareshwara Jyotirlinga is the main Jyotirlinga of this temple. In this Sri Dwadasha Jyothirlinga Devasthana all the 12 Jyothirlingas are along with the Shakthi in the form of Sri Yantras. The Spatika Sri Yantra is in the Omkareswara Jyothirlinga and in the remaining 11 jyothirlingas Panchaloha Sri Yantras are there. All the 12 Jyotirlingas face east. The Vimana Gopurams, of Srisaila Mallikarjuna and Sri Rameshwara Jyotirlingas which are in South India, are in the South Indian style and the Vimana Gopurams of the remaining Ten Jyotirlingas which are in North India, are in the North Indian Style. Hence, this temple is a harmony of South Indian and North Indian sculpture. The height of the Vimana Gopuram of the main Jyotirlinga, Sri Omkareshwara, approximately 108 feet from the ground level, is the highest among all the Vimana Gopurams. Dwadasha Jyotirlinga Temple in Omkar Hills Salient features of Pranapratishta All the 12 Jyotirlingas are Narmadeshwara Lingas (also known as Baana Lingas) made from the Stones of the River Narmada, which is very auspicious for Shivalinga. Beneath each and every Jyotirlinga, 1008 Small Narmadeshwara Lingas measuring around an inch in length are placed, but below Sri Omkareshwara linga, 2008 Small Narmada Lingas are placed. So in total the temple consists of visible 12 main Jyotirlingas and around 13000 (thirteen thousand) invisible Narmadeshwara Lingas. Sri Matsya Narayana Temple The Sri Matsyanarayana Temple is unique, and the only temple in Karnataka for Bhagavan Sri Matsyanarayana Swamy. Sri Matsanarayana Temple faces east and is located behind the Dwadasha Jyotirlinga Temple in Omkar Hills. Bhagavan Sri Matsyanarayana is the first Avatara among the Dashavataras (Ten Avataras) of Bhagavan MahaVishnu in the form of Fish to protect the creation from great deluge. By worshiping him, through his grace generally one gains health, wealth, peace and prosperity and specially one gets cured of rare skin diseases and gains abundant wealth. Where ever Bhagavan Sri Matsyanarayana‚Äôs presence is there all the Vastu Doshas will get nullified. Sri Mata Vana Durga The Divine mother Sri Vana Durga is the presiding deity and the sthana-devata of the Omkara Hills. Vana Durga is one of the numerous forms of Goddess Durga. As the name indicates, she resides in forests and hills. The temples of Vana Durga are always open to air. She is a living deity staying under the sacred banyan tree at the top of the Omkar Ashram hill. Time and again, many blessed devotees' vivid experiences about the Mother testify her divine presence in Omkar Hills. Mother Sri Vana Durga protects and progresses this Omkara Ashrama. She is fond of camphor. Any devotee in distress or difficulty can invoke her divine blessings by offering camphor with sincere faith. One who worships Mother with devotion gains peace and prosperity through her bountiful benevolence and grace. 1200 kg bell in Omkar Hills Sri Nagadevata Temple Sri Nagadevata temple in Omkara Hills has a unique male and female Nagadevata. To the right of the Nagadevata is a banyan tree and to left is a neem tree. Daily pujas will be done to the devata.

In the early 60s when the Herzliya Gymnasium building was torn down for the construction of the Shalom Meir Tower, the library building was also demolished and the library was temporarily moved to premises on Shaul HaMelech Boulevard, not far from the place dedicated for the construction of a new Library Building. In 1977 the Library was finally housed in its new building on Shaul HaMelech Boulevard. This new building was named Beit Ariela (Ariela's House) in honor of Ariela Gitter, daughter of Bernhard Benno Gitter (1919-2004), a businessman, who donated a large sum of money for its construction.  Facilities and services  The Beit Ariela Library includes a reading hall, a lending department, and several special libraries. The Library includes more than half a million books in different languages (Hebrew, English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, and Yiddish). The Library provides its visitors access to databases in various fields of knowledge (in Hebrew and in English); registered borrowers may use this service from their homes. Besides the collections of books the Library possesses journals, newspapers, video recordings, photographs; the collection of musical CDs accounts about 8000. The Library subscribes to 180 different periodicals; there are about 9 thousand registered borrowers. The Library network throughout the City contains more than 21 branches and has around 37,201 (2018) active members. = Special departments = * The Periodicals Library ‚Äì is a collection of Hebrew press from the end of the 19th century and up to the present day.

GVC is similar to Industry Level Value Chain but encompasses operations at the global level. The concept of a value chain has been used to analyze international trade in global value chains and comprises ‚Äúthe full range of activities that are required to bring a product from its conception, through its design, its sourced raw materials and intermediate inputs, its marketing, its distribution and its support to the final consumer‚Äù.  In development  The first references to the GVC concept date from the mid-1990s and were enthusiastic about the upgrading prospects for developing countries that joined them. In his early work based on research on East Asian garment firms, the pioneer in value chain analysis, Gary Gereffi, describes a process of almost ‚Äònatural‚Äô learning and upgrading for the firms that joined GVCs.Gereffi, G., (1994). The Organisation of Buyer- Driven Global Commodity Chains: How US Retailers Shape Overseas Production Networks. In G. Gereffi, and M. Korzeniewicz (Eds), Commodity Chains and Global Capitalism. Westport, CT: Praeger. This echoed the ‚Äòexport-led‚Äô discourse of the World Bank in the ‚ÄòEast Asian Miracle‚Äô report based on the East Asian ‚ÄòTigers‚Äô success. This encouraged the World Bank and other leading institutions to encourage developing firms to develop their indigenous capabilities through a process of upgrading technical capabilities to meet global standards with leading multinational enterprises (MNE) playing a key role in helping local firms through transfer of new technology, skills and knowledge. Wider adoption of open source hardware technology used for digital fabrication such as 3D printers like the RepRap has the potential to partially reverse the trend towards global specialization of production systems into elements that may be geographically dispersed and closer to the end users (localization) and thus disrupt global value chains. =Analytical framework= Global value chains are networks of production and trade across countries. The study of global value chains requires inevitably a trade theory that can treat input trade. However, mainstream trade theories (Heckshcer- Ohlin-Samuelson model and New trade theory and New new trade theory) are only concerned with final goods. It needs a New new new trade theory. Escaith and Miroudot estimates that the Ricardian trade model in its extended form has \\"the advantage\\" of being better suited to the analysis of global value chains. The lack of appropriate tool of analysis, the studies of GVCs have been conducted mainly by sociologists like Gary Gereffi and management science researchers.Sturgeon and Kawakami See for a genealogy Jennifer Bair (2009).Jennifer Bair (2009) Global Commodity Chains: Genealogy and Review.

GVC analysis views ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù as a continuum starting with ‚Äúprocess upgrading‚Äù (e.g. a producer adopts better technology to improve efficiency), then moves on to ‚Äúproduct upgrading‚Äù where the quality or functionality of the product is upgraded by using higher quality material or a better quality management system (QMS), and then on to ‚Äúfunctional upgrading‚Äù in which the firm begins to design its own product and develops marketing and branding capabilities and begins to supply to end markets/customers directly - often by targeting geographies or customers (which are not served by its existing multinational clients). Subsequently, the process of upgrading might also cover inter-sectoral upgrading.Humphrey, J., and H. Schmitz. 2004. \\"Chain Governance and Upgrading: Taking Stock\\". in Local Enterprises in the Global Economy, edited by H. Schmitz, 349‚Äì82. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar. This upgrading process in GVCs has been challenged by other researchers ‚Äì some of whom argue that insertion in global value chains does not always lead to upgrading. Some authorsHumphrey, J. and Schmitz, H. (2000). Governance and Upgrading: Linking Industrial Cluster and Global Value Chain. IDS Working Paper 120, Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, Brighton. argue that the expected upgrading process might not hold for all types of upgrading. Specifically they argue upgrading into design, marketing and branding might be hindered by exporting under certain conditions because MNEs have no interest in transferring these core skills to their suppliers thus preventing them from accessing global markets (except as a supplier) for first world customer. = Current research on governance and its impact from a development perspective = There are motivations behind renewed interest in global value chains and the opportunities that they may present for countries in South Asia. A 2013 report found that looking at the production chain, rather than the individual stages of production, is more helpful. Individual donors with their own priorities and expertise cannot be expected to provide comprehensive response to the needs identified, not to mention the legal responsibilities of many specialist agencies. The research suggests they adjust their priorities and modalities to the way production chains operate, and to coordinate with other donors to cover all trade needs. It calls for donors and governments to work together to assess how aid flows may affect power relationships. In his 1994 paper, Gereffi identified two major types of governance. The first were buyer- driven chains, where the lead firms are final buyers such as retail chains and branded product producers such as non-durable final consumer products (e.g., clothing, footwear and food). The second governance type identified by Gereffi were producer-driven chains. Here the technological competences of the lead firms (generally upstream in the chain) defined the chain's competitiveness. Current research suggests that GVCs exhibit a variety of characteristics and impact communities in a variety of ways. In a paper that emerged from the deliberations of the GVC Initiative,Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, and Timothy Sturgeon, ‚ÄúThe governance of global value chains,‚Äù Review of International Political Economy, vol. 12, no. 1, 2005 five GVC governance patterns were identified: * Hierarchical chains represent the fully internalised operations of vertically integrated firms. * Quasi-hierarchical (or captive chains) involve suppliers or intermediate customers with low levels of capabilities, who require high levels of support and are the subject of well-developed supply chain management from lead firms (often called the chain governor). * Relational and modular chain governance exhibit durable relations between lead firms and their suppliers and customers in the chain, but with low levels of chain governance often because the main suppliers in the chain possess their own unique competences (and/or infrastructure) and can operate independently of the lead firm. * Market chains represent the classic arms length relationships found in many commodity markets. As capabilities in many low- and middle-income economies have grown, chain governance has tended to move away from quasi-hierarchical models toward modular type as this form of governance reduces the costs of supply chain management and allows chain governors to maintain a healthy level of competition in their supply chains. However, whilst it maintains short-term competition in the supply chain, it has allowed some leading intermediaries to develop considerable functional competences (e.g., design and branding). In the long term these have the potential to emerge as competitors to their original chain governor (Kaplinski, 2010).Kaplinsky, R. (2010), The Role of Standards in Global Value Chains and their Impact on Economic and Social Upgrading, Policy Research Paper 5396, World Bank Other study outlines the initiative to promote inclusive GVC,A.H. Pratono, ‚ÄúCross-cultural collaboration for inclusive global value chain: a case study of rattan industry,‚Äù International Journal of Emerging Markets, vol. 12, no. 1, 2005 three GVC patterns were identified: The theoretical concepts often considered firms as operating in a single value chain (with a single customer). Whilst this was often the case in quasi- hierarchical chains (with considerable customer power) it has become apparent that some firms operate in multiple value chains (subject to multiple forms of governance) and serve both national and international markets and that this plays a role in the development of firm capabilities (Navas-Aleman, 2011; UNCTAD, 2013). = See also = * Agricultural value chain * Global supply chain * Global commodity chain * Value added trade = Summary of Unctad report: global value chains and development = In 2013, UNCTAD published two reports on GVCs and their contribution to development. They concluded that: * GVCs make a significant contribution to international development. Value-added trade contributes about 30% to the GDP of developing countries, significantly more than it does in developed countries (18%) furthermore the level of participation in GVCs is associated with stronger levels of GDP per capita growth. GVCs thus have a direct impact on the economy, employment and income and create opportunities for development. They can also be an important mechanism for developing countries to enhance productive capacity, by increasing the rate of adoption of technology and through workforce skill development, thus building the foundations for long-term industrial upgrading. * However, there are limitations to the GVC approach. Their contribution to the growth may be limited if the work done in-country is relatively low value adding (i.e. contributes only a small part of the total value added for the product or service). In addition there is no automatic process that guarantees diffusion of technology, skill-building and upgrading. Developing countries thus face the risk of operating in permanently low value-added activities. Finally, there are potential negative impacts on the environment and social conditions, including: poor workplace conditions, occupational safety and health, and job security. The relative ease with which the Value Chain Governors can relocate their production (often to lower cost countries) also create additional risks. * Countries need to carefully assess the pros and cons of GVC participation and the costs and benefits of proactive policies to promote GVCs or GVC-led development strategies. Promoting GVC participation implies targeting specific GVC segments and GVC participation can only form one part of a country's overall development strategy. * Before promoting GVC participation, policymakers should evaluate their countries‚Äô trade profiles and industrial capabilities in order to select strategic GVC development paths. Achieving upgrading opportunities through CVCs requires a structured approach that includes: ** embedding GVCs in industrial development policies (e.g. targeting GVC tasks and activities); ** enabling GVC growth by providing the right framework conditions for trade and FDI and by putting in place the needed infrastructure; and ** developing firm capabilities and training the local workforce. Gender and global value chains Gender plays a prominent role in global value chains, because it influences consumption patterns within the United States, and thus affects production on a larger scale. In turn, specific roles within the value chain are also determined by gender, making gender a key component in the process as well. Far more women than men are found in the informal sector, as self-employed workers or subcontractors, while specific jobs and broader fields of work differ between men and women. =Women in global value chains= Within the global value chains, it is often women who work in the weakest or most disadvantaged chains. Carr et al. argue that ‚Äúthe vast majority of subcontract workers or industrial homeworkers, who earn some of the lowest wages worldwide, are women.‚Äù  Sustainability and global value chains  Sustainability is an increasingly important factor in global value chains, and there is a growing need to evaluate their performance based on social and environmental impact, as well as economic. Initiatives such as The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals encourage sustainable practices through its 17-goal blueprint, but there are few enforced policies which address sustainability with the urgency required to protect natural resources and reduce the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Sustainability efforts in global value chains are often voluntary steps taken in the private sector, such as the use of sustainability standards and certifications, and ecolabels, but they can sometimes lack evidence of measurable sustainable impacts. For example, some ecolabels seek to address issues such as poverty. Yet in some cases, even if producers meet ecolabel standards, the burden of certification costs can end up reducing the overall income for these producers. The measurement of sustainability in global value chains requires a multifaceted assessment which includes environmental, social and economic impacts, and it must also be standardized enough to be compared in order to generate sufficient learning and for scalability. Technologies that make these types of measurements are becoming both more available and essential for the public and private sector sustainability efforts.  Negative impacts of global value chains  Global supply chain management is facing the increasing difficulty in predicting demand variability in different areas. In addition, managing the production and transportation of goods over large distances to meet the peak demand represents another challenge. Integrating global value chains requires all actors to adapt to technological changes, which is capital-intensive. Therefore, it is safe to say that this trend significantly benefits developed countries rather than developing countries.

It is generally said of Hungerford that his own extravagance was his downfall, but it was claimed by others that his huge debts were inherited from his own father Anthony Hungerford and from his father-in-law Sir John Hele of Wembury, who had incurred them during the Civil War supporting the Royalist cause.Risdon, Survey of Devon, 1810 Additions, p.397 Indeed an Act of Parliament mentioning these reasons was obtained by Hungerford in 1675‚Äì76 specifically allowing him to sell the manors inherited from Hele.

Moneylending and reputation Until about 1600 Hele had a high reputation, but then personal attacks on him started. Through his making of loans, and actions in recovering them, he exposed himself to attacks from the circle of Sir Thomas Egerton, one of his debtors, whose clients ran a successful personal vendetta against him. Hele had hoped to succeed Egerton as Master of the Rolls, but the outcome of his intrigues was quite different. Hele lost a large sum in 1601 through the attainder of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, a key ally of his at court and was also owed a large sum by Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham. In 1602 he went on circuit with Judge Francis Gawdy, making himself \\"odious and ridiculous\\", according to the gossip circulated by the letter-writer John Chamberlain. Cobham was then caught up in the Main Plot of 1603, and Hele was thought to have taken advantage of his legal position to exact repayment from him. A petition was presented to the Privy Council by Sir William Dethick, Garter King-at-Arms, accusing Hele of violent conduct towards him in public, and Hele hardly denied it. The Council investigated Hele in 1604, and the matter was referred to the Star Chamber, which found against Hele on the ground that he had gone outside due process in dealing with Cobham. The result was that he was suspended from office, fined, and imprisoned for six weeks. Landholdings Having amassed a fortune, he bought an estate at Wembury, near Plymouth, in Devon, where he built a grand mansion-house. He also had a house at Kew, and owned the manor of Shirford, Knighton hundred, Warwickshire. He purchased the manor of Yealmpton in Devon and from Sir Robert Prideaux (1550-post 1603)Vivian, p.617 the estate of Orcheton, Modbury.Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p.650; Pole, pp.311-12 Death and burial Hele died on 4 June 1608 and was buried in Wembury Church, where his monument survives, showing effigies of himself and his children, inscribed in Latin as follows: : (\\"Here lies John Hele, Knight, Serjeant-at-Law to the most Serene Lady Queen Elizabeth and to James King of Great Britain, who departed on the fourth day of June in the year of Our Lord 1608, in the year of his age 66\\") His will was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 1 October 1608.

Topics have included Human Trafficking, Religious Freedom and Feminism. Lapido believe the rich can do little to change the world for the poor unless they learn the language of faith. The charity is founded on the belief that many news stories do not make sense without understanding religion.  History  Dr Jenny Taylor founded Lapido Media in 2005 leaving her position as Head of Media for the Church Mission Society in London. In 2002 she set up and ran the Break the Silence Campaign to draw the world‚Äôs attention to 17 years of civil war in Northern Uganda which particularly targeted children. The campaign was commended in the British parliament in 2004. Harnessing the concern and prayer of 400 British churches to international agencies as well as working strategically with the mainstream media ‚Äì one of Bob Geldof‚Äôs six Africa films for Live Aid was made in Kitgum \\\\- resulted in the tripling of United Nations aid to Northern Uganda and contributed to a reduction in hostilities and the eventual break-up of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. After witnessing how religiously literate journalism could generate social and spiritual capital, and inspired by theologian Lesslie Newbigin‚Äôs call to a ‚Äòradical encounter with secular culture‚Äô, Dr Taylor and Squadron Leader Mike Holdsworth, career officer in the Royal Air Force, founded Lapido to help the media \\"tell a truer story\\". Dr Taylor befriended Newbigin when she met him as a student in 1988 at the Selly Oak Federation of Colleges of which he was then President. She joined the management committee of the influential British Council of Churches Gospel and our Culture Programme ‚Äì despite never having read a theology book ‚Äì and went on to work with Newbigin until his death in 1998. She edited his last papers and co-wrote Faith and Power: Christianity and Islam in ‚ÄòSecular‚Äô Britain with him (SPCK 1998). Dr Taylor also credits an article by The Times columnist Bernard Levin as contributing to the founding of Lapido Media. After casting doubt on the persecution of Christians around the world in a column in the early 90s, Levin received a mass of evidence to the contrary from Dr Taylor and, independently, Patrick Sookhdeo of Barnabas Fund. This resulted in Levin doing a series of pieces about persecution of Christians beginning with \\"Islam's Fearful Bloodletting\\" on 23 March 1993. Shocked by what she described as \\"media blindness\\", Dr Taylor eventually went on to found Lapido, the first organisation to incorporate the expression ‚Äúreligious literacy‚Äù in its brand.  Vision  Lapido means to \\"speak up\\" in the Acholi dialect of Northern Uganda. The charity aims to advocate for people whose beliefs are incomprehensible to what is termed the \\"secular world\\". Lapido aim to build bridges of communication between varying world views. The founders believe an informed understanding of religion is essential to community cohesion, security, development and diplomacy. Dr Taylor has criticised the Church for ignoring the media and write, \\"Prostitutes, tramps, gypsies, even politicians get prayed for‚Äîbut journalists are what you might call ‚Äï\\"a lost people group\\".\\" Lapido wants to see the religious angle covered in global affairs, as opposed to more stories about religion. Dr Taylor writes \\"it is not possible to activate the switches that stop wars and prevent famine without recourse to non-secular language and categories.\\" Lapido Media believe an epistemic shift in essentially secularist British thought is taking place. This claim is backed up by the advent of religious literacy departments in several universities, as well as nationwide projects funded by government through the EHRC and ESRC to promote religious literacy. Dr Taylor was invited onto CNN's International Correspondents program where she explained, \\"All over the world, there are amazing stories crying out to be reported with greater sophistication and greater attention. And the trouble with the media, of course, is that it is too easy to sort of, you know, parachute in, parachute out, and miss the suffering and the roots of the suffering.\\"  Research and Consultancy  Lapido have offered media strategy consultancy to organisations including Faithworks, The Tropical Health and Education Trust and Kingsbridge Community Sports. They also provide training for civil society organisations and NGOs who are frustrated by a one dimensional public discourse which minimises the role of religion in public life. Lapido suggested a much stronger integration between Open Doors' news arm, then called Compass Direct, and the parent body which spawned World Watch Monitor (WWM). Having built a strong reputation with think tanks and journalists WWM has now expanded into a strategic news operation under former BBC TV Correspondent Julia Bicknell.  Previous Events =Neutrality or Truth? Reporting Islam post 7/7= The official launch of Lapido Media ‚Äì a debate for journalists on \\"Neutrality or Truth? Reporting Islam post 7/7\\" - was held at the Frontline Club, Paddington on 6 December 2007 - a watering hole for foreign correspondents. Melanie Phillips, Dominic Lawson, Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali and Aaqil Ahmed (later Head of Religion and Ethics at the BBC) attended. =When Journalists Don't Get Religion= In 2010 Lapido launched Blind Spot: When Journalists Don‚Äôt Get Religion for Oxford University Press, with the book‚Äôs Editor Paul Marshall being interviewed by classicist Tom Holland. = Wholly Political = In 2010, Lapido piloted Wholly Political seminars which look at the political dimension of religion, beginning with political Islam. They are intended to promote religious literacy and equip communicators and leaders with understanding about Muhammed, the ideology of struggle and the Caliphate today. The day-long training workshops consist of four 90 minute sessions, facilitated by two tutors with input from special guests and time for discussion. More information can be found on Lapido's website. = Textual criticism and Qur'an Manuscripts Book Launch = In November 2012 Lapido hosted a dinner in London bringing together top scholars to launch Dr Keith Small‚Äôs Textual Criticism and Qur‚Äôanic Manuscripts (Lexington). Professor Francois D√©roche from the Sorbonne, Paris; Dr Christopher Melchert from Pembroke College, Oxford; Dr Mehmet Ko√ß from the University of Ankara and Andrew Brown from The Guardian joined other scholars to launch the work. Andrew Rippin at the University of Victoria described it as \\"the first work to bring out the full implications of several generations of scholarly activity in the area of Qur‚Äôanic textual studies.\\" = Reporting the Middle East: Why the truth is getting lost = Lapido hosted a special media event in association with the Henry Jackson Society on 19 September 2013 in Whitehall, London. Douglas Murray chaired the debate between Bishop Angaelos, Betsy Hiel, Nina Shea and Tom Holland. The event resulted in coverage around the world including an article by Spectator blogger Ed West. = Tablighi Jamaat Book Launch = Lapido marked its fifth birthday by launching its first Handy Book for Journalists on Religion in World Affairs on 27 September 2013. Based on doctoral research by Zacharias Pieri, the book examines the secretive Islamic group Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) who are behind the media-dubbed \\"megamosque\\". There was standing room only at the launch which also featured a celebrity panel headed by the Chair of the Muslim Institute Ziauddin Sardar and UNESCO award winning photographer Jeremy Hunter whose photographs illustrate the book.  Controversy  In August 2012 Lapido trustee Tom Holland created a documentary for Channel 4 titled Islam: The Untold Story based on his bestselling book In The Shadow of the Sword. Both the book and documentary proved controversial and provoked criticism from the Islamic Education and Research Academy (IERA) who argued \\"Tom Holland's assertion that there is no valid historical evidence for the seventh century origins of Islam is historically inaccurate\\". Ofcom and the broadcaster Channel 4 received an estimated 1200 complaints regarding the program. Channel 4 cancelled a public screening of the documentary at their London headquarters. Responding to the news, Lapido founder Jenny Taylor defended Holland. She wrote, \\"...The IERA turns out to be the platform of the controversial convert Sheikh Abduraheem Green, a mixed up cross-culture kid if ever there was one: a public-schoolboy convert to Islam, currently with two wives, and at different times, an advocate of holy war, and hell for Mother Theresa.\\" She said the Daily Mail's decision to pit the IERA against an \\"award-winning Cambridge-educated historian\\" in its coverage was \\"insanely irresponsible\\". Taylor added, \\"He's shown all of us that Islam is interesting enough to be taken seriously. He's refused to stick his head in the sand and play blind about the problems or internal tensions that all thinking Muslims know are there.\\"  References  * http://www.lapidomedia.com/sites/default/files/resources/Commonwealth- Institute-Journal_Taking-Spirituality-Seriously.pdf Category:Religious charities based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Lapido Media"},{"id":"41583668","text":"Endless-piston principle is a dispensing variation of rotating positive displacement pumps. Their operating principle can be compared with an endless piston that conveys the product from the suction side to the discharge side, building up a differential pressure in the process. At the core of every application is a volumetric conveying pump. The interaction between an eccentrically moving rotor and a stator adapted to application conditions produces flow and dosing characteristics resembling those of an endlessly moving piston, as mentioned above. This geometry ensures that, per rotation, a constant flow volume proportional to rotary angle is always produced. The flow direction is reversed by changing the direction of rotation. Volume is therefore clearly determined by degree angle. A further advantage of this technology is that a pressure-stable, linear pump characteristic curve is obtained. From these facts we can conclude that there is a definable ratio between rotation, time and flow volume. Therefore, these pumps can produce a constant dosing volume via the parameters of time or rotation, when used in an application. This results in a guaranteed dosing accuracy of 1% at the pump outlet (depending on the medium). This figure is often even better in practice. An additional advantage is the discharge chamber that is created ‚Äì its volume remains absolutely constant during the course of displacement. This leads to the possibility of conveying and filling media containing solids and even pieces. Compared to other conveying methods, this pumping technology has even more advantages to offer: For example, in over 95% of all applications it is possible to eliminate filling and dosing valves completely, since the pump goes into reverse flow at the end of dosing, which breaks off the product thread or prevents any dripping. It is possible to dispense low to high viscous products very precise, stabile and free of pulsation.

Though set in the Western United States in the late 19th century, it does not have the typical characteristics of a \\"Western\\" movie. It is about business people, involved in activities both honest and shady. Plot In San Francisco in 1870, Ada Stritch owns a bank, but there's a run on it. She needs $3 million to keep it open. In desperation, she turns to a wealthy man she despises, Rip MacCool. Also in need of Rip's help are newspaperman Johnny Sanderson and an old acquaintance, Flutey, each of whom, like Ada, has issues with Rip from their past. Rip offers to deal a hand of poker‚Äîif Ada wins, he will give her the $3 million. If not, he gets the bank. Everyone recalls how they first met. Fifteen years before, Ada, a widow, has a small hotel that she'd like to sell. Rip and his pal Shocker are guests there. Rip woos her romantically, then offers $3,000 cash plus shares in the \\"Mona Lisa\\" gold mine. Ada accepts, only to learn later that the stock is worthless. Johnny was a prizefighter. After a defeat, Rip helps him find a job. Rip is broke, but suddenly discovers that a vein of gold struck at the Mona Lisa mine has made his stock worth a quarter of a million dollars. A beautiful singer, Lily Douvane, is loved by Johnny, but is seduced by Rip's money and weds him instead. Johnny is heartbroken. They have a baby boy and named it after Johnny. It's a loveless marriage, though, and when Lily catches Rip in a compromising position, she demands a divorce, a million dollars from Rip and custody of their child. Johnny cares about the baby and also for Zoe, the nanny. Rip interferes again, proposing to Zoe, then angering her as well as losing his fortune. Zoe mortgages their home. She also is pregnant. Rip regains his money, thanks again to the Mona Lisa mine, but loses both Zoe and his new baby in childbirth. Shocker explains to those present how Rip became the cold-hearted man he is. At 16, unable to pay for his own parents' funeral, he worked beside Shocker in a mine. Money came to mean everything to him. After hearing this, Ada agrees to the winner-take-all hand of cards. Rip gracefully loses and the bank is hers, although all suspect that Rip, having a heart after all, actually held the winning hand.

The house is a rijksmonument and is listed on the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites. Nowadays the building is home to the Embassy of The Free Mind, a museum and platform for culture, music, art, science and spirituality. History The house was built in 1622 for Nicolaas Sohier, a wealthy stock trader and art lover. The renaissance facade is attributed to architect Hendrick de Keyser, but was probably executed and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser, as Hendrick had already died in 1621. As for the heads in the facade, there is a legend that they refer to six thieves who had tried to break in the house and were then beheaded by the maid. However, the ornaments are said to be images of six Roman gods: Apollo with the laurel wreath (the arts); Ceres with the grain (agriculture); Mercury with the winged helmet (trade); Minerva (wisdom); Bacchus with the grapes (wine); and Diana with the half moon (hunt). The heads on the fa√ßade Residents Shortly after Sohier moved to the house, his wife and two daughters died. In 1634 he sold the property to Dutch entrepreneur and industrialist Louis de Geer. Along four generations the house remained in possession of the family De Geer, who made it a nerve center of exchange for ideas in respect to trade, science, philosophy and culture. Comenius, members of the prominent Elsevier publishing family and possibly Spinoza are said to be guests of the De Geer. Between 1752 en 1775 Anthoni Grill rented the house from the inheritants, who sold it in 1779. In 1811 art dealer Cornelis Sebille Roos settled in the building. After 1865 an Hogere Burgerschool was established in the house, followed by a public trade school in 1869. After a restoration in 1907 by the municipality, it served the Conservatorium van Amsterdam from 1909 to 1931. A fur trade and a city‚Äôs bureau for monuments and archeology were also later established. At the end of February 2006 it was announced that the Huis met de Hoofden had been sold to businessman and art collector Joost Ritman. Today the building is home to museum The Embassy of the Free Mind, which comprises part of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica.

Originally known as the Australian Building (and also known as the Australian Property Investment Co or API Building), it was located at 49 Elizabeth Street, on the corner of Flinders Lane in Melbourne, and was notable for the way the Queen Anne style design lent it very vertical proportionals, enhanced by the steep roof, spires and gables of the top floors. It was Australia's tallest building until 1912, when it was surpassed by Culwulla Chambers in Sydney, and remained Melbourne's tallest until 1929. The APA Building was demolished in 1981. History In the 1880s Melbourne was in the throes of the 'land boom, fueled by easy credit and steep increases in the price of land, especially in the central city. Built by the Australian Property Investment Co, (or API), the announcement of the construction noted that it was said to be taller than any private building in London at the time, and would stand amongst the tallest in New York and Chicago. It was reputed to have been originally planned to have fifteen stories (and an 1888 sketch shows an equally large building in the same style next door), but it was built with 12 levels, the 12th one attic space and a caretakers flat. The project was the brainchild of one of the directors of the API company, businessman and politician F T Derham, who had paid ¬£65,000 for the site; the API then borrowed ¬£400,000 for the construction from the London based Home and Colonial Assets Corporation Ltd. The API called a limited competition in November 1887, which was won Henry Hardie Kemp; at the time he was working at Terry & Oakden (partner Leonard Terry had dies some years previously), where he was soon taken on as a partner, along with another senior architect, to form Oakden, Addison and Kemp. John Beswicke, who had worked for one of the API directors previously, had also been invited to submit, and was retained as an associate in the project as he had studied tall buildings, and is thought to have provided technical advice. The Australian Building was one of about 11 'massive edifices' of 8 to 10 floors built in the city at the height of the boom, of which only two survive. They were made possible by the introduction of an hydraulic power system of pressurised water that could operate the lifts to great heights 'in complete safety'. They did not employ any new structural technologies however, relying on thick walls of load bearing brickwork, and internal structures of cast iron, wrought iron and timber. With the boom soon turning into a crash, these buildings remained the tallest for many years, and in 1916 a new building regulation was passed limiting buildings to 132ft (40m). The building inevitably generated its own legends, for instance that three companies went broke sinking the 40m deep cylinders for the hydraulic lift pole, and that not long after completion, the bolt on one of the cylinders broke, sending the fortunately vacant lift speeding downwards. Another from 1945 is that on the day of official inspection, the lift shot up uncontrollably only to bounce back from springs at the top, leaving prompting many of the party to use the stairs on the way down. The main legend is that it was the worlds tallest in 1889, for instance in the 1976 book Melbourne's Yesterdays. Its great height and dominance in the streetscape led to it being the subject of many photographs and postcards in its first 20 years. In 1920 the Australian Provincial Assurance Association Ltd, an insurance company, bought the building as their Melbourne base, and then renamed it the APA Building. The APA was Australia's tallest building until 1912, when the Culwalla Chambers was built in Sydney. This office building was constructed of reinforced concrete, and had 12 full office floors, with a facade height of 59m. The APA Building was Melbourne's tallest commercial building for 40 years, until the company decided to move, and purchased and remodelled another 9 storey Victorian 'skyscraper' on the southeast corner of Collins and Queen Streets as their new headquarters, adding a very tall tower (largely for show) in 1929, which topped out at 76 m (250 ft). This was also known as the APA Building, and was demolished in the late 1960s. Some time in the 1950s, the spire, turrets and gables of the top floors of the earlier APA Building were removed, leaving it with a truncated mansard roof. By the late 1970s, its historic importance was recognised despite its alteration, and it was classified by the National Trust in 1978. It was also listed by the then Historic Buildings Preservation Council (now Heritage Victoria), but the owners then successfully argued for a demolition permit, on the basis of the large cost of upgrading to meet modern fire regulations. It was demolished in mid 1980, and replaced by a five-story office building. Architectural Style The building was designed by the architecture firm of Oakden, Addison & Kemp in association with John Beswicke. The design has strong influences of the English Queen Anne revival, then a new style in Melbourne. This is seen in the use of red-brick with rendered stripes, and the picturesque turreted and gabled roofscape. Claims to height The APA Building has been variously claimed to be the tallest (or the third or fourth tallest) in the world in 1889, when in fact it was perhaps a distant sixth or seventh or more. Measured drawings held at the State Library of Victoria from 1980 show that it had 11 occupy-able floors, and a 12th attic floor with a caretakers flat, while plans reproduced in a thesis at Melbourne University show it had a roof height at the 11th floor at 41.5m, roof height of the top attic floor of 47m, and to top of the spire was 51m. This is lower than, but comparable to a number of buildings in New York City and Chicago, built in that year or earlier. The tallest in the world in 1889 was in Chicago, soon to be the home of all the world‚Äôs tallest buildings, where the tower portion of the Auditorium Building was 17 storeys and , while the 12-storey Rookery Building, completed in 1888, was to the roof. In New York, the tallest was the 12-storey Washington Building of 1887, which was to the roof, plus attic and cupola; the 13-storey New York Times Building by George B Post was to the top of its spire; and the adjacent 11-storey Potter Building completed in 1885 was to the top of the roof, with pinnacles on top of that. The 1885 Hotel Chelsea was to the top of the 12th storey, with decorative gables adding greater height. It was only amongst the tallest in the world for 6 to 12 months, as towers in Chicago and New York continued to climb higher. The long demolished New York World Building was completed in 1890, with 13 floors plus a tall dome reaching as high as , and in 1891 the Monadnock Building in Chicago reached over 16 floors, the tallest load bearing brick office building ever built.

The Dutch troopship and the Royal Navy destroyers and sank as a result of air attacks by Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. The three ships sank off the east coast of the Peloponnese during Operation Demon, which was the evacuation of British, Australian and New Zealand troops from Greece after their defeat by invading German and Italian forces. The loss of the three ships caused an estimated 983 deaths. Only 66 men survived. Operation Demon On 6 April 1941 Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. An expeditionary force of British, Australian and New Zealand troops was already in Greece, but they and Greek defenders lost ground to the invaders and by 17 April the British Empire was starting to plan the evacuation of 60,000 troops. Slamat was a Dutch troop ship, converted from a Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd (\\"Royal Dutch Lloyd\\") ocean liner. Since October 1940 she had been operating in the Indian Ocean, but in April 1941 she was ordered through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea to join Operation Demon. Convoy AG 14 Nauplia and carried 960 British, Australian and New Zealand troops Slamat was in the Mediterranean by 23 April, and on the 24th she was one of six merchant ships that left Alexandria with Convoy AG 14 for Greece. British, Australian and New Zealand forces were spread over much of Greece, so on 26 April when AG 14 reached Greek waters, it split to reach different embarkation points. Slamat and a smaller troop ship, the managed by British-India Line, were ordered with the cruiser and a number of destroyers to Nauplia and Tolon on the Argolic Gulf in the eastern Peloponnese. The corvette swept Nauplia Bay for mines before the ships arrived. Luftwaffe air reconnaissance found AG 14 at noon on 26 April. The invaders had air superiority, and Royal Air Force capacity to resist was being reduced daily. On 24 April the Belfast Steamship Company troop ship had grounded in the fairway in Nauplia Bay, blocking ship access to the port. The next day an air attack turned the grounded ship into a total loss. Ships would now have to anchor in the bay and tenders would be needed to bring troops and equipment out to them from the shore, so the landing ship, infantry (a converted Glen Line merchant ship) was sent to deliver several Landing Craft Assault to Nauplia. However, on 26 April a Junkers Ju 87 Stuka attack disabled Glenearn, so she put her LCAs ashore for use at Monemvasia and was towed to Souda Bay. En route to Nauplia the convoy was attacked by aircraft and a number of bombs hit Slamat, causing heavy damage on B and C decks, destroying two of her lifeboats and wounding one crewman. The Germans recognised that the ships would embark troops overnight and leave early the next morning (27 April), so General der Flieger Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, commander of the VIII. Fliegerkorps, planned to attack the ships as they left their various embarkation points. patrolled against submarines off Nauplia, rescued survivors from Slamat, but was then sunk by aircraft. At 2340 hrs on 26 April the light cruisers and joined Khedive Ismail, Slamat, Calcutta and four destroyers in the Bay of Nauplia. The destroyer patrolled against the risk of submarines while the other ships took turns to embark troops. The only available tenders were landing craft A5, local ca√Øques and the ships' own boats. One ca√Øque, Agios Giorgios, was a large boat with capacity for 600 men. There was a swell and a light wind, and in the dark there were one or two accidents and one ship's whaler capsized. Calcutta and Orion embarked 960 and 600 troops respectively; the destroyers and 500 and 408. The slow rate of embarkation meant that Khedive Ismail did not get her turn and did not embark any troops. At 0300 hrs Calcutta ordered all ships to sail, but Slamat disobeyed and continued embarking troops. Calcutta and Khedive Ismail sailed at 0400 hrs; Slamat followed at 0415 hrs, by which time she had embarked about 500 troops: about half her capacity. An estimated 700‚Äì2,000 men were left behind, but Hotspur remained at Nauplia to embark as many of them as possible. Loss of Slamat The convoy steamed south down the Argolic Gulf; Calcutta and Khedive Ismail at and Slamat full ahead at to catch up. At 0645 or 0715 hrs Luftwaffe aircraft attacked the convoy off Leonidion near the mouth of the gulf. Three Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters attacked first, followed by a Staffel of nine Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers from Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 at Almyros, Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 17 bombers and more Bf 109s. The attackers mainly targeted the troop ships, but anti-aircraft fire from Calcutta and Diamond at first prevented aircraft from hitting Slamat. Then a SC250 bomb exploded between her bridge and forward funnel, setting the bridge, control room and Master's cabin afire. Her water system became disabled, hampering her crew's ability to fight the fire. Another bomb also hit the ship and she listed to starboard. Slamats Master, Tjalling Luidinga, gave the order to abandon ship. The bombing and fire had destroyed some of her lifeboats and life rafts, and her remaining boats and rafts were launched under a second Stuka attack. Hotspur reported seeing four bombs hit Slamat. At least two lifeboats capsized; No. 10 from overloading and No. 4 when, in the midst of transferring survivors, Diamond had to speed away from her to evade an air attack. One Stuka pilot, Bertold Jung, saw \\"one or two\\" fellow-pilots machine- gunning survivors in the boats. Jung had served in the German navy, and back at Almyros airfield he complained very strongly that people in lifeboats had suffered enough so in future they should be spared. came to Diamonds aid, rescued survivors from Slamat but was then sunk along with Diamond. Orion, Isis and Khedive Ismail kept moving to reach Souda Bay, while Calcutta rescued some survivors and ordered the destroyer Diamond to go alongside Slamat to rescue more. At 0815 hrs Diamond reported that she was still rescuing survivors and still under air attack. At 0916 hrs the destroyers , and arrived from Souda Bay in Crete to reinforce the convoy, so Calcutta sent Wryneck to assist Diamond. At 0925 hrs Diamond reported that she had rescued most of the survivors and was proceeding to Souda Bay. She left several people behind on life rafts, where aircraft machine-gunned them. Calcuttas captain said the attack continued until about 1000 hrs. Wryneck reached Diamond about 1000 hrs and signalled a request for aircraft cover at 1025 hrs. Diamond accompanied by Wryneck returned to Slamat, arriving about 1100 hrs. The destroyers found Slamats No. 10 and No. 4 lifeboats, both of which had been righted. They rescued 30 troops and two Dutch crew from No. 10 and Slamats Second Officer and several other survivors from No. 4. Slamat was afire from stem to stern, and Diamond fired a torpedo at her port side that sank her in a coup de gr√¢ce. By now Diamond carried about 600 of Slamats survivors, including Captain Luidinga. Loss of Diamond and Wryneck About 1315 hrs a Staffel of between four and nine Ju 87 bombers came out of the sun in a surprise attack on the two destroyers. One bomb hit Diamonds engine room, stopping her engines and bringing down her funnel, mast and radio aerial. Another exploded in the sea off her port side, holing her hull below her foredeck. Her engine room petty officer, H.T. Davis, had been on deck, but rushed below and released the pressure from her No. 3 boiler to prevent the risk of a boiler explosion. She sank in eight minutes. Both of her lifeboats were destroyed, but her crew launched her three Carley floats. Three bombs hit Wryneck. The first exploded on her port side and damaged her hull; the second and third hit her engine room and bridge. Her Commissioned Engineer, Maurice Waldron, shut down her boilers and brought on deck a wounded Australian officer whom he had been looking after and put him in a Carley float. Wryneck capsized to port but managed to launch her whaler and three Carley floats before she sank in 10‚Äì15 minutes. Lt Cdr Philip Cartwright, who commanded Diamond, was on a Carley float but gave his place to a sailor who was in the water. Cartwright was not seen again. Several men in the Carley floats died either from wounds or from drowning in the swell. They included Lt Cdr Robert Lane who commanded Wryneck, and Dr G.H. Brand who was the civilian ship's doctor on Slamat. Rescues Wrynecks whaler suffered two holes but was repaired. Her occupants were wet through, her compass was damaged and her drinking water contaminated. Her four oars were serviceable, so Commissioned Engineer Waldron took command and she set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats to strike the boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift. Waldron was also nursing a Leading Seaman, George Fuller, who had bullet wounds in his belly and thigh. At 1900 the cruiser and seven destroyers reached Souda Bay and disembarked evacuated troops. The Vice Admiral, Light Forces, Henry Pridham-Wippell, became concerned that Diamond was not among them. Between 1922 and 1955 hrs repeated attempts to radio Diamond drew no reply. Wryneck had been ordered to keep radio silence so no attempt was made to radio her. Instead Phoebe and Calcutta were asked if they had seen her, but their replies at 2235 and 2245 hrs were indefinite. rescued survivors from Wryneck and Diamond, some of whom were survivors from Slamat. She later took the survivors from Souda Bay to Port Said. Pridham-Wippell sent the destroyer to the position in the Argolic Gulf where Slamat had been lost. Griffin found 14 survivors in two Carley floats. At 0240 hrs she reported the rescue, said both destroyers had been sunk about 1330 hrs and she was still looking for Wrynecks whaler. In the morning she found more floats and another four survivors. She took the survivors to Crete. The last living survivor from Slamat, Royal Army Service Corps veteran George Dexter, states that after Wryneck was sunk he and three other men were rescued by Orion. On the morning of 28 April the whaler was about off Milos in the Aegean Sea, so she set course for the island. At noon she sighted Ananes Rock, about southeast of Milos, so Waldron decided to land there as everyone was exhausted. The rock has a bay, where the whaler found a ca√Øque full of Greek refugees and British soldiers who had set out from Piraeus, were headed for Crete, but were sailing only by night to avoid detection. In the evening the ca√Øque left Ananes and headed south for Crete. As many as possible of the survivors transferred to the ca√Øque, but she was very full so she towed the whaler with five men still in it. On the morning of 29 April the ca√Øque sighted a small landing craft, A6, which had set out from Porto Rafti near Athens. She took aboard everyone from the ca√Øque and whaler, and the next day they reached Souda Bay. After a short stay the survivors from Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck were taken on HMS Hotspur to Port Said, Egypt. Casualties Nearly 1,000 people were killed in the loss of Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck. Of the 500 or so soldiers that Slamat embarked, eight survived. Of her complement of 193 crew and 21 Australian and New Zealand DEMS gunners, 11 survived. Of Diamonds 166 complement, 20 survived. Of Wrynecks 106 crew, 27 survived. Slamat had a mixed crew of 84 Goans, 74 Dutch, 24 Chinese, 10 Australians and a Norwegian. The 11 survivors were six Goans, four Dutch and one other. The bodies of three of Slamats crew washed ashore far from the wreck: apprentice helmsman J Pille on the Greek island of Stamperia, Second Officer G van der Woude at Alexandria in Egypt, and lamp trimmer J van der Brugge at Gaza in Palestine. Controversy Winston Churchill called Captain Luidinga's delay \\"gallant but misguided\\". Vice Admiral Pridham-Wippell held Slamat chiefly responsible of the disaster, asserting that her failure to depart until 75 minutes after she was ordered \\"resulted in her being within range of the dive bombers well after dawn.\\" In a volume of his history The Second World War, Winston Churchill wrote \\"At Navplion there was a disaster. The Slamat, in a gallant but misguided effort to embark the maximum number of men, stayed too long in the anchorage\\". The Dutch historian Karel Bezemer agreed that had Slamat obeyed orders and left on time, the convoy would not have been attacked. Frans Luidinga, who in 1995 published a book about his father Tjalling Luidinga, points out that had Slamat left on time, the convoy would have been only further south at the time of the attack. This was still in range from Jg 77's base at Almyros and unlikely to have given enough advantage to the RAF's diminished fighter cover. The Germans knew the convoy would spend the night of 26‚Äì27 April evacuating troops from Nauplia and would not be far beyond the Argolic Gulf by daybreak. Frans Luidinga blames the Royal Navy for including troop ships in the evacuation, asserting that only warships had the speed, manoeuvrability and firepower to return from Nauplia under fire. Against Luidinga's argument, the troop ship Khedive Ismail survived whereas the destroyers Diamond and Wryneck were sunk. And had the convoy been 20 nautical miles further south, Vendetta, Waterhen and Wryneck could have met it at 0800 instead of 0915 hrs, increasing both its anti-aircraft fire and capacity to rescue survivors. The distance from Almyros allowed the same Stukas to make repeated attack runs, although on the flight back to base one stopped at Corinth to refuel. Increasing their round trip by 40 nautical miles might have marginally reduced the aircraft's ability to attack repeatedly. The general situation was such that had Slamat left on time as ordered, it would have been more likely only to mitigate an attack rather than avert one. The Admiralty may have been as concerned at the general risk arising from Allied and civilian ships not following Royal Navy orders, as at any direct loss that Luidinga's delay may or may not have caused. Awards and monuments In November 1941 Philip Cartwright of HMS Diamond was posthumously made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. From HMS Wryneck, Maurice Waldron received the Distinguished Service Cross and George Fuller the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal. The Admiralty took the unusual step of publishing in The London Gazette its citation for Fuller: \\"who, though badly wounded, fought his gun till the last, and when his ship was sunk, heartened the survivors by his courage and cheerfulness\\". In May 1945 the Netherlands were liberated and the Dutch government returned from exile. In August 1946 Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands wrote to Captain Luidinga's widow, expressing her sympathy for her husband's death, gratitude for his war service and commending him as een groot zoon van ons zeevarend volk (\\"a great son of our seafaring people\\"). CWGC's Phaleron War Cemetery British and Commonwealth troops and naval personnel who were lost in the sinking of Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck are named on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Athens Memorial in Phaleron War Cemetery at Palaio Faliro southeast of Athens. Royal Navy personnel are also commemorated in Britain on the Royal Navy monuments at Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth. George Dexter commissioned a monument to all the service personnel lost when the three ships were sunk. It is in The Royal British Legion Club, Shard End, Birmingham. There was no Dutch monument to Slamat until 2011, when one commemorating victims from all three ships was made by the Dutch sculptor Nicolas van Ronkenstein. It was installed in the Sint-Laurenskerk (\\"St Lawrence Church\\"), Rotterdam and formally unveiled on the 70th anniversary of the disaster, 27 April. On 27 June 2012 the current hosted a wreath-laying ceremony at the position where Slamat was sunk. Participants included Diamonds commander, descendants of some of the dead from the Netherlands and New Zealand, and the Commander in Chief of the Hellenic Navy.

In 1923 the camp purchased property in Rhinebeck, New York where it would remain until closing in 1979. Affiliated with the Sholem Aleichem Folk Institute, after Sholom Aleichem, Boiberik was a secular, apolitical institution which emphasized Yiddishkeit, or Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish folk culture, including songs, dance, food in the tradition of the Borscht belt, theater, and humor. Although non-religious, Boiberik observed shabbos and kept a kosher kitchen. Boiberik had interactions with and was somewhat similar to Camp Kinder Ring. The name 'Boiberik' appears as a village in which the Tevye stories by Aleichem are set, as a fictionalization of the resort town Boyarka. In 1982, the former campgrounds were purchased by the Omega Institute which currently resides there. Omega hosted a reunion of former campers in 1998.

Both private schools and public schools were prominent. Public education was established as early as the 372 AD. Historically, the education has been heavily influenced by Confucianism and Buddhism. Prehistoric and Gojoseon Period Education in the prehistoric times mostly consisted of hunting, fishing, toolmaking, and combat. Through those lessons, people were taught to be members of society. Since the prehistoric education was based on protection from nature, it was unorganized. Such education eventually led to the first religious beliefs. In Korea, the ideas lead to the development of the idea of Samsin (Korea: ÏÇºÏã†, Hanja:‰∏âÁ•û, English: Three Gods) along with the Korean versions of animism and shamanism. However, there was no particular religion involved and the education relied on anecdotal teachings. In the Gojoseon Period (?-108 BC), many of the factors in the prehistoric education still remained, but an earlier frame of society was established, along with social morality. The earliest traces of education can be seen in Samguk Yusa. Passages of the book show evidence of agriculture, punishment, morality, and medicine. Korea's first educational slogan is Hongik Ingan (ÌôçÏùµÏù∏Í∞Ñ; ÂºòÁõä‰∫∫Èñì). It means to 'live and work for the benefit of all mankind\\".' The first system of law is written in the Book of Han. In this period, the education was made to benefit the society as a whole.  Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla Period  In the period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57-688 AD), the governments began to institute education. The education system was heavily influenced by Confucianism and Buddhism. = Goguryeo Period = Goguryeo was established from 37 BC to 668 AD. From its establishment, it was already using a form of writing. It is best demonstrated by the book Yoogi(Ïú†Í∏∞; ÁïôË®ò). The first established institution was Taehak (ÌÉúÌïô; Â§™Â≠∏), also called Daehak. It was established at 372 AD. The institute was mainly used by the Yangban class. It was established with Confucianism as its philosophy of education. Later, Buddhism was added to its curriculum. It thought both the humanities and martial arts. There was also another institute called Gyungdang. It is thought to be established at 372 AD. = Baekje Period = Baekje was established from 18 BC to 660 AD. Evidence of the scholarly method can be seen through the Japanese books of Nihon Shoki and Kojiki. It can also be seen through cultural exchanges with Japan, such as the transference of the books the Analects and the Thousand Character Classic at 258 AD. Further evidence of education is shown in the history book Seugi (ÏÑúÍ∏∞; Êõ∏Ë®ò) There are no records of an established institution. However, references to an establishment can be seen through various posts establishing relations with Japan. The Consulate General of the Republic of Korea holds that educational institutions were found earlier than 372 AD. = Silla = Three Kingdoms Period  Silla was established in the Three Kingdoms Period from 57 BC to 668 AD. The government mostly focused on the martial arts because of the invasions from the surrounding kingdoms. The main educational institute is considered to be Hwarang.  Unified Silla Period  Unified Silla was established from 668 AD to 935 AD. Education besides Hwarang began to be established after foreign influence. There were several student exchange programs with China. The major establishment is Gukhak (Íµ≠Ìïô; ÂúãÂ≠∏). The curriculum was directly taken from the system of the Tang Dynasty. It was established at 682 AD. Most of the subjects were humanities.  Goryeo Period  The picture titled \\"Seodang\\" drawn by Kim Hongdo in the late 18th century. The Goryeo dynasty was established from 935 to 1392 AD. As the country's official religion, Buddhism had enormous impact. However, Confucianism was used as the main idea for the philosophical and social structure. During the rule of Gwangjong of Goryeo (925 ‚Äì 975 AD), the gwageo (Í≥ºÍ±∞; ÁßëÊìß) examination system was strengthened due to the influences of Confucianism. The first concrete policy based on Confucianism was created during the reign of Seongjong of Goryeo (r. 981‚Äì997 AD). In 986 AD, education was expanded to the rural areas. There is a record of a policy on 1127 AD to establish a public school in each district. The public curriculum was based on books such as the Classic of Filial Piety and the Analects. There was also an annual final examination. There were two major types of education in this period: Gwanhak (Í¥ÄÌïô; ÂÆòÂ≠∏) and Sahak (ÏÇ¨Ìïô; ÁßÅÂ≠∏). Gwanhak is defined as schools established and managed by the government. Major Gwanhak institutions include Gukjagam and Hakdang (ÌïôÎãπ; Â≠∏Â†Ç) in the cities and Hyanggyo in the rural areas. The government also established public libraries such as Bisuhwon (ÎπÑÏÑúÏõê; ÁßòÊõ∏Èô¢) and Susuhwon (ÏàòÏÑúÏõê; ‰øÆÊõ∏Èô¢) to support educational efforts. Gukjagam was established on 992 AD as the first university in the country. It was regulated by social class and rank and played a major role in establishing future institutions. Sahak is defined as schools not established and not controlled by the government. Major Sahak institutions include Sibido (Ïã≠Ïù¥ÎèÑ; ÂçÅ‰∫åÂæí) and Seodang (ÏÑúÎãπ; Êõ∏Â†Ç). Even though Sibido was considered a Sahak, it was controlled by the government. It was closed down on 1391 AD.  Joseon Period  The Joseon Dynasty was established from 1392 to 1910 AD. At the end of the Goryeo Dynasty, Buddhism began to lose political influence. Instead, Confucianism became the official philosophy of the dynasty. Following this idea, Yangban's education was valued more than commoner's education. Education also focused on gaining rank and personal cultivation. The humanities was valued while vocational education was belittled. This idea has been credited with establishing a system of ethics for the entire country and contributing to Korea's philosophy of education as a whole. Higher education institutions included Sungkyunkwan () in Seoul, which had the role of a university. Secondary education institutions included Sahak (ÏÇ¨Ìïô; ÂõõÂ≠∏) in the cities and Hyanggyo in the rural areas. Private schools included Shuyuan and the primary education institution Seodang. However, these institutions were independent instead of being systematic. Seodang was seen as a preparation for Sahak or Hyanggyo. The educational curriculum was managed by the Ministry of Rites from the Six Ministries of Joseon. Educational policies such as Gyeongguk daejeon (Í≤ΩÍµ≠ÎåÄÏ†Ñ; Á∂ìÂúãÂ§ßÂÖ∏) were implemented for the management and supervision of the educational institutions. Government subsidies such as cultivated land, rice, and fish were given, and priviligies such as tax exemption were granted. During the reign of Taejo of Joseon (r. 1392‚Äì98 AD), Hyanggyo was especially supported. In 1398, the Goryeo-era Sungkyunkwan institute was renovated for Confucianism education. The student population was expanded from 100 to 200. Organized student events were held, and students' opinions were encouraged. In 1411, four institutions named Sahak (ÏÇ¨Ìïô,; ÂõõÂ≠∏) were established, which differed from the Goryeo-era Sahak. Annually, 20 students from each school in Sahak were tested for a governmental position; this system was called Seungbo (ÏäπÎ≥¥; ÈôûË£ú). In 1477, a 30-month tenure was implemented for Sahak. During the reign of Hyojong of Joseon (1649 - 59 AD), policies created by scholars with Song Jun-gil as the head were accepted as Sahak policies. On 1335 AD, schools were inspected under the government. Each region was mandated a school. On 1550 AD, the basis for Seowon was created. However, Seowons began to have negative influences on education and the government closed down all but 47 Seowons by 1868. There was a school for the royal family called Joghak (Ï¢ÖÌïô; ÂÆóÂ≠∏). It was established on 1429 AD.  19th century  In the late 19th century, the government, patriots, and foreign missionaries began to establish schools adopted to contemporary culture. The education in this period focused on the right to education and the social equality of education. 19th century education began with the establishment of the Gwanhaks Dongmunhak (ÎèôÎ¨∏Ìïô; ÂêåÊñáÂ≠∏) and Youkyoungongwon (Ïú°ÏòÅÍ≥µÏõê; ËÇ≤Ëã±ÂÖ¨Èô¢). Dongmunhak served as a training center for translators, and Youkyoungongwon served as a school for the Yangbans. Sahaks established in this period can be divided into two types: Christian schools and civilian schools. In 1894, along with the Gabo Reform, education policy was changed. The Gwageo was replaced with the institution Hakmuahmoon (ÌïôÎ¨¥ÏïÑÎ¨∏; Â≠∏ÂãôË°ôÈñÄ). In July 1894, specialized schools were established and students were assigned by the discretion of the Hakmuahmoon. Around 1894, Gojong of the Korean Empire officially promulgated that modern education should be accepted. Further clarifications and additions to the policy was made in 1895. = Notable Schools = The first civilian school was established in 1883. The school was called Wonsanhaksa (ÏõêÏÇ∞ÌïôÏÇ¨; ÂÖÉÂ±±Â≠∏Ëàç). In 1885, Baejaehakdang (Î∞∞Ïû¨ÌïôÎãπ) was established by Henry Appenzeller. It was a secondary school and the goal was to develop Christians and people to work for the government. In 1886, Ewhahakdang (Ïù¥ÌôîÌïôÎãπ) was established by M.F. Scranton. It is the first women-only educational institute to be established. In 1886, Gyungshin School (Í≤ΩÏã†ÌïôÍµê) was established by H.H. Underwood. The school developed into the present-day Yonsei University. In 1895, Heungha School (Ìù•ÌôîÌïôÍµê; ËààÂåñÂ≠∏Ê†°) was established by Min Yeong-hwan to teach English, Japanese, and surveying techniques. In 1899, Jumjin School was established by An Chang-ho.  Japanese rule (1910‚Äì1945)  The number of public regular schools(Í≥µÎ¶ΩÎ≥¥ÌÜµÌïôÍµê) and students Enrollment rate of public regular schools Korean Ethnic Education in the 20th century The first policy in this period is reflected in the Joseon Education Decree (Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÍµêÏú°Î†π; ÊúùÈÆÆÊïéËÇ≤‰ª§) and Private School Regulation (ÏÇ¨Î¶ΩÌïôÍµêÍ∑úÏπô) decreed in 1911. Joseon Education Decree is interpreted to have the purpose of obliterating all Korean cultural and spiritual independence to keep Koreans colonized forever. After the decrees, various policies established the education system to have three to four years of botong school (Î≥¥ÌÜµÌïôÍµê; ÊôÆÈÄöÂ≠∏Ê†°), a type of primary education; four years of godeung botong school (Í≥†Îì±Î≥¥ÌÜµÌïôÍµê; È´òÁ≠âÊôÆÈÄöÂ≠∏Ê†°) and girls-only godeung botong school (Ïó¨ÏûêÍ≥†Îì±Î≥¥ÌÜµÌïôÍµê; Â•≥Â≠êÈ´òÁ≠âÊôÆÈÄöÂ≠∏Ê†°), both forms of secondary education; two to three years of sileop school (Ïã§ÏóÖÌïôÍµê; ÂØ¶Ê•≠Â≠∏Ê†°) and gani sileop school (Í∞ÑÏù¥Ïã§ÏóÖÌïôÍµê) with no particular limit, both forms of vocational schools; jeonmun school (Ï†ÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÍµê; Â∞àÈñÄÂ≠∏Ê†°), a form of tertiary education. Botong school focused on reading, writing, and arithmetic. The subjects Susin (ÏàòÏã†), Korean, Japanese, hanja, and arithmetic were required. The school served more for as preparations for jobs, not for higher education. Godong botong school also focused on job training. Subjects included Susin, Korean, Hanja, and Japanese. As of 1915, there were 399 botong schools, 56,253 male botong school students, and 5,976 female botong school students compared to 291 Japanese primary schools, 31,142 male Japanese primary school students, and 28,206 female Japanese primary school students. 30% of the instructors in botong schools were Japanese, and 60% in godong botong schools. For private schools, the Decree concerning private schools (ÏÇ¨Î¶ΩÌïôÍµêÎ†π) was decreed in 1908. The decree was modified in 1911. In 1915, Modification of the regulation of private schools (Í∞úÏ†ïÏÇ¨Î¶ΩÌïôÍµêÍ∑úÏπô) was decreed. The decrees applied to all private schools. They promulgated that the purpose of the establishment of schools, head teachers, teachers, and textbooks must be regulated by the Empire of Japan. Moreover, the subjects of geography, history, and the Bible was prohibited. Consequently, the number of private schools decreased, from 1,973 in 1910 to 1,317 in 1912, 1,240 in 1914, and 690 in 1919. The educational policies were modified after the March 1st Movement on March 1, 1919. The modified policies were promulgated on 1922. The educational policies for students speaking Japanese and Korean were separately created. Korean students were permitted to study in normal schools (ÏÇ¨Î≤îÌïôÍµê; Â∏´ÁØÑÂ≠∏Ê†°). The quality of education as a whole also increased. The length of botong school was increased from four to six years. The subject of the Korean language, which had been abolished in some schools, changed to become a required subject. More schools were also established. When nationalistic leaders called for establishments of Minlip Daehak (ÎØºÎ¶Ω ÎåÄÌïô; Ê∞ëÁ´ãÂ§ßÂ≠∏), the Japanese government made compromises to establish universities under the control of the government. As a direct consequence, Rules concerning the establishment of Keij≈ç Imperial University (Í≤ΩÏÑ±Ï†úÍµ≠ÎåÄÌïôÏÑ§ÏπòÏóê Í¥ÄÌïú Î≤ïÎ•†) was promulgated in 1922. Although such policies were similar to the Japanese curriculum, the focus of the curriculum was to strengthen the Japanese education while diminishing Korean culture. This argument is supported by the facts that the time for the teaching of the Japanese language was two to three times longer than the time to teach the Korean language in primary and secondary education systems as well as the teachings of history of Japan and the geography of Japan. In March 1938, the third Joseon Education Degree was promulgated by Jir≈ç Minami. All Japanese elements were strengthened and the courses were forced to be taught in the Japanese language. The main points in this decree were that the names of schools were changed in the style of the Japanese language: \\"botong school\\" was changed to \\"simsang primary school\\" (Ïã¨ÏÉÅÏÜåÌïôÍµê); \\"godeung botong school\\" to \\"middle school\\" (Ï§ëÌïôÍµê); \\"girls-only godeung botong school\\" to \\"godeung girls' school\\" (Í≥†Îì±Ïó¨ÌïôÍµê). The Korean language was also changed to an elective course, which meant its eventual end. \\"Simsang primary school\\" was renamed to \\"citizen's school\\" (Íµ≠ÎØºÌïôÍµê; ÂúãÊ∞ëÂ≠∏Ê†°) in 1941. In 1943, the Decree concerning education during wartime (ÍµêÏú°Ïóê Í¥ÄÌïú Ï†ÑÏãúÎπÑÏÉÅÏ°∞ÏπòÎ†π) changed the education system to fit the war preparation. Consequent decrees modified the education entirely for war. Due to the changes, almost all the students were compelled to become soldiers and the schools were practically closed down.

It carries out research, education and outreach activities both in London and internationally. The Urban Laboratory was established in 2005. UCL Urban Lab co-operates with four UCL departments ‚Äì The Bartlett; Engineering, Social and Historical Sciences; and Arts and Humanities. The current director is Dr Clare Melhuish, who took on the role from Dr Ben Campkin in 2018. The centre investigates, proposes, and disseminates critical solutions to a wide range of social, physical and technological urban and built environment issues, with a focus on the grand challenges of our time. It draws on a range of urban expertise and research methodologies, based on exchange and collaboration between researchers across UCL, but also promoting participatory approaches to urban research, working in partnership with a range of different non-academic, business, and community- based organisations. The Urban Laboratory runs a number of urban events programmes promoting urbanism, including the annual international peer- reviewed exhibition Cities Methodologies with the Slade School of Fine Art, and Urban Lab Films, a public programme of talks and film screenings on cities. Cities Methodologies has been described by Monocle as a \\"marketplace of research ideas, [which] bring lots of different approaches to common urban questions together, and for work to be put in juxtaposition.\\" Since 2013, the Urban Laboratory has been part of the European Union-funded Erasmus Mundus Urban Lab+ international network of Urban Laboratories, an organisation composed of eight international universities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The project seeks to expand and strengthen competence in the realms of architecture, urban planning and other built environment disciplines. Urban Lab is a partner member along with Technical University of Berlin, √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne, University of Calabria, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, University of the Witwatersrand, Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 2012, UCL Urban Laboratory were critical of UCL plans to open a new campus near the site of the Olympic Park in East London on the Carpenters Estate, as detailed in an open letter sent to the university's council. The new campus would have required the demolition of the existing estate and relocation of current residents. The plans detailed in the \\"UCL Stratford Proposition\\" attracted considerable press attention and caused a student-led opposition group from UCL Union to 'occupy' a room in UCL's Bloomsbury campus. The main objection of the Urban Laboratory (endorsed by The Bartlett's Development Planning Unit) was that the plan constituted a missed opportunity to draw on the expertise of the UCL community and show leadership in developing a sustainable and socially equitable approach to regeneration. Plans for the new campus were dropped in May 2013 following a failure for UCL and Newham Council to agree to terms. Structure The current director of the Urban Laboratory is Dr Clare Melhuish, who has a background in architectural history, anthropology and human geography, alongside an extensive career as an architecture critic, author and curator. Between 2011 - 2018, the Urban Lab was directed by urbanist and architectural historian Ben Campkin. He is also a senior lecturer in Architectural History at the Bartlett School of Architecture. He was co-editor of the 2012 book Dirt: New Geographies of Cleanliness and Contamination and writer of the 2013 book Remaking London: Decline and Regeneration in Urban Culture. The latter focuses on gentrification, sink estates and the history of regeneration in five areas of London (Somers Town, Elephant and Castle, Kings Cross, Shoreditch and Hackney Wick). Former director Matthew Gandy is a geographer and urbanist. He is co- founder of the Urban Salon which links urbanists across London. He has taught geography at UCL since 1997, and before that worked at the University of Sussex between 1992 and 1997.

History Formed in 1920 after the amalgamation of Alvie and Insh Shinty Clubs, Kincraig have gained the reputation as the third team in Badenoch due to its proximity to Kingussie and Newtonmore.

Biography  He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and trained as a doctor at The Queen‚Äôs University of Belfast and specialized initially in internal medicine at Belfast City Hospital, before moving into public health. McKee currently lives in London with his wife Dorothy and two daughters.  Professional career  Martin McKee created the European Centre on Health of Societies in Transition, a WHO Collaborating Centre comprising a team of researchers working primarily on health and health policy in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He is also research director of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, a partnership of universities, national and regional governments, international agencies and Past President of the European Public Health Association. He has published over 740 scientific papers and 42 books, was an editor of the European Journal of Public Health for 15 years. Martin McKee (2017).  Research  Appointed to a senior lecturer post in 1989 with responsibility for developing a program of research in Europe, he was immediately confronted with two major changes: the collapse of the communist regimes in central and eastern Europe and, later, in the USSR, and the removal of borders within the expanding European Union. He has led major programs on both issues. With his colleagues Professor David Leon and Vladimir Shkolnikov, he has contributed important new insights into the adverse health consequences of rapid social and political transition, the entry of the international tobacco corporations into these new markets, and the role of alcohol, and especially substances such as aftershaves (odekolon) in the high levels of premature mortality seen in this region. More recently, his work on social change has extended into a large body of research on the health effects of the post-2007 financial crisis, jointly with Dr David Stuckler. His research on the European Union has included books and articles on the impact of European law on health and health policy, European research policy, and cross-border mobility of patients. In 2013 he led a Lancet series on health in Europe. In 2016 he co-founded Healthier IN the EU, a grassroots campaign making the health case for continued UK membership of the European Union. With colleagues Josep Figueras, Elias Mossialos, and Richard Saltman, he established the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.  Policy involvement  When Lord Darzi proposed the establishment of Polyclinics in England McKee wrote a paper with Bernd Rechel of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in which they observed: His involvement in the article Why has mortality in England and Wales been increasing?, written with Danny Dorling and others generated considerable publicity. The article suggested that the most likely reason for increased mortality among old people in England and Wales in 2015 was the application of austerity policies, saying that ‚Äúthe evidence points to a major failure of the health system, possibly exacerbated by failings in social care‚Äù. He has been a critic of the NHS reforms introduced by the UK's coalition government in 2012, arguing that they were unworkable and would lead to fragmentation and confusion. In January 2014 he said that continuing health inequalities among London boroughs was a scandal and that coalition reforms had left it unclear who was supposed to analyse health data and tackle the problems highlighted.  Honours and awards  McKee has received honorary doctorates from the universities of Debrecen (Hungary), Maastricht (The Netherlands), Karlstad (Sweden), Queen's (Belfast), and the Nordic School of Public Health. He has been elected to the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the US National Academy of Medicine. He was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) by HM Queen Elizabeth II for services to health in the 2005 Birthday Honours.

Ramabhadran (4 August 1929 ‚Äì 27 February 2012) was a Mridangam artiste from Tamil Nadu, India. He was awarded the Madras Music Academy's Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 2004. Early years Born in Vellore, he showed interest in Carnatic music even at an early age. His father Konnakol T. P. Gopalachari, a musician himself, was running a Music Sabha in Vellore. This sabha conducted competitions in Carnatic music among children. Maestros like Kancheepuram Naina Pillai, Palghat Mani Iyer and Pudukottai Dakshinamurthy Pillai judged competitors and awarded prizes. M. S. Subbulakshmi has given a concert in this Sabha in 1936Ramabhadran Interview Young Ramabhadran was fascinated by the music concerts and started learning Mridangam from his father at the age of eight. During World War II people living in Madras (presently, Chennai) evacuated the city and moved to interior towns and villages. In 1942, Thiruparkadal Srinivasa Iyengar moved from Chennai to Salem. It gave an opportunity for Ramabhadran to learn vocal music from him. Ramabhadran moved to Chennai in 1950 and took residence at Mylapore. Performances In his first stage appearance, he accompanied Madurai Mani Iyer on the Mridangam. During the 1940s there were not many Sabhas in Chennai. He accompanied Madurai Mani Iyer in concerts held at various temples throughout Tamil Nadu. Ramabhadran has performed as an accompanying Mridangam artiste to Carnatic music doyens Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Musiri Subramania Iyer, G.

He accompanied M. M. Dandapani Desikar in that concert. Likewise a remarkable experience for him was the receiving of Sangeetha Choodamani award from the top Mridandam Vidwan Palghat Mani Iyer in 1975. The award was accorded by the Krishna Gana Sabha, Chennai. His thoughts Ramabhadran opines that Mridangam is an accompanying instrument and it should not interrupt the main artiste. The Mridangam artiste can show his skill during the few minutes he/she is given for \\"Thani Avarthanam\\" (Solo interludes). Performance in Tamil film Ramabhadran accompanied K. J. Yesudas on the mridangan for the song \\"Mari, mari, ninne\\" in the Tamil film Sindhu Bhairavi produced by K. Balachandar.

The school's website stated that it is \\"perhaps the oldest Japanese boarding school in Europe.\\". The school is an affiliated educational institution of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai (the Anglican Church in Japan) and shares its name with Rikkyo University, Tokyo. Initially the school used the Pallinghurst House, a building constructed in 1902, as its classrooms, dining hall, dormitories, chapel, and staff room. In 1973 the school's middle school opened. In 1975 the Ministry of Education of Japan approved Rikkyo School as an overseas school. Afterwards the school opened its high school division. At that time the school educated students in ages 10 through 18. Toshio Iwasaki of the Journal of Japanese Trade & Industry wrote that this school was the first Japanese high school outside Japan to open.

Reception Manga Bookshelf's Katherine Dacey lists Amnesia Labyrinth as the fifth worst manga of 2011. Anime News Network's Carlo Santos commends the manga with its \\"deceptive leads and clues\\" and \\"calm, down-to-earth portrayal of home and school\\". However, he criticizes that Kohane's use of \\"careful shading, clean linework\\" serves to hide the \\"slightly off-kilter character designs and stiff facial expressions.\\" A later review by Santos commends the manga for its logic puzzles and its use of \\"long silences, where the things unsaid between characters make it far more intriguing than any dialogue could have.\\" With regards to the art, Santos commends Kohane for \\"using lots of hatched lines and ominous shading to create a different era where a supernatural back-story adds new layers to the series\\" but criticizes him for being inconsistent \\"when it comes to basic character design and anatomy\\". Mania's Matthew Warner commends the manga's artwork with \\"the artwork provided looks fantastic, and is definitely one of the book‚Äôs main draws. Character designs look solid and display emotion well (though there is one instance in which a character strips that looks a little off, for whatever reason). However, the real star is the backgrounds and environments throughout, which appear often and have something of a stylized, sketchy feel to them, and are usually quite complex.\\" School Library Journal's Snow Wildsmith commends Kohane's sharp artwork \\"full of feral smiles and vulpine eyes.\\" She recommends the manga to the fans of psychological manga such as After School Nightmare and Higurashi When They Cry. Dacey heavily pans the \\"source material; as writer Nagaru Tanigawa explains in the afterword to volume one, Amnesia Labyrinth was ‚Äúbased on a story that, while it didn‚Äôt have enough to become a full-fledged novel, had been kicking around in my head for years.‚Äù He admitted that he had to ‚Äúdismantle‚Äù his original idea and ‚Äúreinvent the characters‚Äù; small wonder that the published version was, by his own admission, filled with ‚Äúlazy, phantom passages,‚Äù vestiges of an earlier story idea.\\" List of volumesReferencesExternal links * Category:2009 manga Category:ASCII Media Works manga Category:Mystery anime and manga Category:Seven Seas Entertainment titles Category:Sh≈çnen manga ","title":"Amnesia Labyrinth"},{"id":"41584563","text":"Mei Shaowu (; 22 December 1928 - 28 September 2005) was a Chinese translator, author and scholar who was honorary president of the Mei Lanfang Memorial Hall () and president of the Mei Lanfang Literature and Art Research Association ().

He was one of the greatest Ghurid kings, and it was during his reign that the Ghurid dynasty rose to prominence.  Early life  When Ala al-Din's brother, Sayf al-Din Suri, ascended the throne, he divided the Ghurid kingdom among his brothers; Fakhr al-Din Masud received land near the Hari River; Baha al-Din Sam I received Ghur; Shihab al-Din Muhammad Kharnak received Madin; Shuja al-Din Ali received Jarmas; Ala al-Din Husayn received Wajiristan; and Qutb al-Din Muhammad received Warshad Warsh, where he built the famous city of Firuzkuh.History of Civilizations of Central Asia, C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, pp. 185-186. However, Sayf later quarreled with his brother Qutb, who took refuge in Ghazna, and was poisoned by the Ghaznavid sultan Bahram-Shah of Ghazna. In order to avenge his brother, Sayf marched towards Ghazna in 1148, and scored a victory at the Battle of Ghazni while Bahram fled to Kurram.C.E. Bosworth, The Later Ghaznavids, 113-114. Building an army, Bahram marched back to Ghazna. Sayf fled, but the Ghaznavid army caught up with him and a battle ensued at Sang-i Surakh. Sayf and Majd ad-Din Musawi were captured and later crucified at Pul-i Yak Taq. After his death, he was succeeded by his brother Baha al-Din Sam I, who shortly died of natural causes before he could avenge his murdered brothers. Ala al-Din Husayn, the younger brother of Sayf and Baha al-Din, then ascended the Ghurid throne.  Reign  In order to avenge the death of his brothers, Ala al-Din, launched a campaign against Bahram in 1150.Bahram Shah, P. Hardy, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. I, 940. The Ghaznavid and Ghurid armies met at Tiginabad and through the heroic efforts of Kharmil Sam-i Husain and Kharmil Sam-i Banji the Ghaznavid army was routed. Bahram rallied elements of his army at the hot springs, Jush-i Ab-i Garm, but was again routed and fled back to Ghazna.C.E. Bosworth, The Later Ghaznavids, 115-116. Bahram again rallied the remaining elements of his army with the addition of the city's garrison, but again his army was routed and the city was burned by the Ghurids. Following this defeat, Bahram fled to the Ghaznavid territories in India. Ghazna was then subjected to seven days of pillage and rapine, in which 60,000 of the city were killed. All the tombs of the Ghaznavid rulers, with the exception of Mahmud, Mas'ud and Ibrahim, were broken open and the remains burned. He also destroyed the city of Bust.History of Civilizations of Central Asia, C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, p. 186. From these events, Ala ad-Din Husayn gained the nickname, JahƒÅns≈´z (meaning the World Burner).C.E. Bosworth, The Later Ghaznavids, 116-117.Encyclopedia Iranica, Ghaznavids, Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2007, (LINK ) After having greatly expanded Ghurid power, he had gone from a tribal chief to a king of an empire, he then took the title of Sultan al- Muazzam. In 1152, he declared independence against his Seljuq overlords, and captured Balkh. He was, however, shortly defeated and captured by Ahmad Sanjar, who then aided the Ghaznavids in recapturing Ghazni. Ala al-Din Husayn remained a prisoner for two years, until he was released in return for a heavy ransom to the Seljuqs. Meanwhile, a rival of Ala al-Din named Husayn ibn Nasir al-Din Muhammad al-Madini had seized Firuzkuh, but was murdered at the right moment when Ala al-Din returned to reclaim his ancestral domain. Ala al-Din spent the rest of his reign in expanding the domains of his kingdom; he managed to conquer Garchistan, Tukharistan, and Bamiyan, which he later divided amongst his brothers. He died in 1161, and was succeeded by his son Sayf al-Din Muhammad.

Scale bar 1 ¬µm.Noor MAF, Parnell RS, Grant BS (2011) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0018653 \\"Morphological and Structural Aspects of the Extremely Halophilic Archaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi\\"] PLoS ONE, 6(4): e18653. Haloquadratum walsbyi is a species of archaea which was discovered in a brine pool in the Sinai peninsula of Egypt. It is noted for both its flat, square-shaped cells, and its unusual ability to survive in aqueous environments with high concentrations of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride. The species' genus name Haloquadratum literally translates from Greek and Latin as \\"salt square\\". Haloquadratum walsbyi is a phototrophic halophilic archaea. It was the only recognized species of the genus Haloquadratum until 1999 when Haloarcula quadrata was reported as recovered from a brine pool. Haloquadratum walsbyi is very unusual in that it forms almost-perfectly square, flat-shaped cells. The genus was observed for the first time in 1980 by a British microbiologist, Prof. Anthony E. Walsby, from samples taken from the Sabkha Gavish, a brine lake in southern Sinai, in Egypt, and has been described formally in 2007 by Burns et al. They are usually abundant in most salty environments. Attempts to cultivate them were unsuccessful until 2004 and resulted in the identification of haloarcula quadrata, another species of square archaea of the genus haloarcula, distinct from H. walsbyi, less abundant and genetically quite different. The cells are large 2 to 5 microns but very thin approximately 150 nanometers and generally contain granules of polyhydroxyalkanoates. They also hold a large number of refractive vacuoles filled with gas that ensure buoyancy in an aqueous environment, and may help to position the cells to maximize the reception of light. They can gather in sheets up to 40 Œºm wide, but the connections between the cells are fragile and can easily be broken. These organisms can be found in any stretch of very salty water. During the evaporation of seawater, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) precipitate first, leading to a brine rich in sodium chloride NaCl. If evaporation continues, NaCl precipitates in the form of halite, leaving a brine rich in magnesium chloride (MgCl2). H. walsbyi prospers during the final phase of the precipitation of halite, and can constitute 80% of the biomass of this medium. The genome of H. walsbyi has been completely sequenced, allowing access to a better understanding of the phylogenetic and taxonomic classification of this organism and its role in the ecosystem. A genomic comparison of Spanish and Australian isolates (strains HBSQ001 and C23T) strongly suggests a rapid global dispersion, as they are remarkably similar and have maintained the order of genes. Its growth in the laboratory was obtained in a medium with very high chloride concentrations (greater than 2 mol ¬∑ L‚àí1 of MgCl2 and greater than 3 mol ¬∑ L ‚àí1of NaCl ), making this organism among the most haloresistant known. Its optimum growth temperature is 40 ¬∞C.

Type  There are different kinds of functions of land development banks in world. They also differ from one another in their bye-laws or constitutions. Some are organized on a state basis, some on a co-operative basis and some on a private basis, incorporating joint stock principles.  Funds  The sources of funds of land development banks are: # Share capital # Deposits from members or non-members # Issue of debentures # Accepting deposits # Reimbursements of subsidies from the government # Other funds. #  Loans and advances  Land development bank provides long-term funds for various agriculture related projects besides development of land and business. The borrowing capacity of a member is generally determined according to the number of shares he holds in the bank. The loans granted by land development bank is repayable within 20 to 30 years. Normally, loans are granted up to 50% of the value of the land or up to 30 times the revenue. Loans are granted only after a thorough verification of security title-deeds as well as the necessity for the loan.

First lit in 1831, it was deactivated in 1882 and later demolished. History The Pass Christian Light, along with the Cat Island Light, was built by Winslow Lewis, constructor of many early lighthouses. The tower was originally and equipped with an array of eight lamps and reflectors, first lit in 1831; in 1857 this was replaced with a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The lighthouse and keeper's dwelling sat in the center of town on the main street on a half-acre (0.2 ha) plot purchased for $250 from Senator Edward Livingston of Louisiana. The obscuring of the beacon by obstructions became a theme of the history of the light. In 1860, for example, complaints were registered as to a cupola on an adjoining store; proposal was made to increase the height of the tower in order to clear the obstruction. At the same time consideration was made of selling the property and building a new light at a different site, as the current site had become more valuable as a result of its central location in town. This came to naught amid the Civil War, for Confederate forces took the lens from the tower, and the light went dark until 1866. Restoration of the beacon came at the behest of citizens of the town, and the old lens (which had been located at war's end) was returned to the tower. At this time it appears that the tower was raised by two feet. In 1878 the dilapidated keeper's house was replaced with a much larger dwelling. By this time obstruction of the beacon had become an issue again, but this time the culprit was trees which had grown up on a neighboring lot. The owner refused to remove or trim the trees, and the lighthouse board concluded that the light was not useful and should be discontinued. Although objections were raised by shippers and local residents, they were to no avail: the light was extinguished in 1882 and the property sold the year after. The lighthouse itself was demolished.

Users describe the task and indicate a budget, community members then bid to complete the task. Airtasker was founded in 2012 by Australian entrepreneurs Tim Fung and Jonathan Lui and has raised AUD $3.5 million to date.  History  Co- founders Tim Fung and Jonathan Lui devised the Airtasker concept in 2011, when they relocated apartments and realised that many of the related tasks could be outsourced to other people. Funding for the venture was facilitated by existing relationships with investors, forged by Fung and Lui's shared workplace, the mobile start-up Amaysim. The team successfully raised AUD $1.5 million two months after launch and began expanding its offering to cater for businesses as well as individuals. The company acquired rival company TaskBox for an undisclosed sum in February 2013, and the Melbourne-based Occasional Butler in 2014. Airtasker partnered with Australian jobs listing website CareerOne in July 2013 which gave the platform further exposure to the casual jobs market. By late 2013 Airtasker had closed a second round of funding raising a further AUD $2 million, bringing total investment in the company to AUD $3.5 million and valuing it at $10 million. In 2017, Sydney company Freelancer alleged that Airtasker misappropriated confidential information in the usage of the term \\"Like a boss\\" in their advertising campaign. Airtasker lodged an opposition to Freelancer's \\"Like a boss\\" trademark, which was still in correspondence process with IP Australia in December 2018. In July 2018, some of Airtasker's Australian data may have been compromised in a Typeform data breach. In December 2018, the Australian Taxation Office audited Airtasker and requested the repayment of Research and Development rebates.  Bidding process  The Airtasker process begins when a user posts a job they need completed, setting a suggested payment as well as any details needed to make a decision. Other users can post their interest in completing the task along with their own suggestion on the payment amount. The user who posted the task can make a decision on whom to award the task based on the applicant's profile, task history and ratings. Once this decision is made, the Airtasker platform allows private communication and payment to be made between the parties. It is free for users and applicants to join Airtasker but once a task is successfully completed and paid all taskers must face a 22% service fee with GST settlement unless they make over $1000 dollars when they face a 20% reduction instead. This is the deduction for a silver tiered Tasker but there are also gold and platinum tiered taskers and they face an 18% and 15% task deduction respectively for their services for the community. Airtasker has obtained insurance cover via CGU that provides up to $10 million covers to protect Taskers on the Airtasker marketplace for their liability to third parties, for personal injury or property damage when performing a task.  Investment and results  In April 2012, Airtasker raised AUD $1.5 million, acquired 45,000 users and processed AUD $1 million in Australian jobs (two months after launch). By November 2013 the company had raised a further AUD $2 million for a total of $3.5 million in funds raised, valuing the company at AUD $10 million. In February 2013, Airtasker acquired competitor TaskBox. In July 2014, Airtasker acquired Melbourne-based odd jobs outsourcing business Occasional Butler and claimed to have 130,000 community members and an annual task run rate of over $4 million. In May 2015, Airtasker raised $6.5 million in a round led by Shanghai-based Morning Crest Capital and the NRMA. Airtasker claimed to have 250,000 users and to process $15 million worth of tasks a year. In June 2016, Airtasker raised $22 million in a series B investment led by Seven West Media for a 15% stake. Airtasker claimed to have 600,000 community members and more than $40m annual transaction volume. In October 2017, Airtasker raised $33 million to enable the company to expand to Britain. In June 2018, there were about 2,000,000 users. In 2018, total revenue for Airtasker was $11,424,440 versus $5,468,341 in 2017. The operating loss in 2018 was $23,536,669 compared to $12,846,493 in 2017.

Instruments Instruments that uses the super radiant emission. * Free Electron Laser (FEL) * Far Infrared (FIR) Laser * Undulator allows to obtain the super radiant emission. Application Superradiant emission using instruments such as FEL are used in materials science, chemical technology and surface analysis. Using the superradiant emission from the instruments, proteins molecules can be imaged. Another use of these instruments in the analysis is the vibrational energy transfer in molecule. High power from superradiant emission allows exciting molecule easier which also makes it easier to analyze the vibrational energy. Superradiant emission using instruments are very advantageous because they produce high power laser due to coherent radiation and they do not use expensive photons. Discovery Superradiance was discovered by American physicist named Robert H. Dicke. He discovered that coherent emission enhances the radiation. In the analytical instruments, superradiance is used to enhance the radiation emitted by the electron.

Fluorine-18 is the most common isotope used for this procedure. This is due to its 97% positron emission and relatively long 109.8 min half-life. The half-life allows for a long enough time to be incorporated into the molecule and be used without causing exceedingly harmful effects. This process has many applications especially with the use of positron emission tomography (PET) as the aforementioned low positron energy is able to yield a high resolution in PET imaging.  History  The first notable radiofluorination synthesis was performed in 1976 for the synthesis of Fluorine-18 labeled fludeoxyglucose. In the 1980's this molecule was discovered to accumulate in tumors of cancer patients. Since this time, this molecule has become a standard in PET imaging of cancer, and currently the only FDA-approved substance to do so. In recent years, research is being performed to find alternatives to the fludeoxyglucose molecule. These new molecules are bifunctional lableing agents that can attach to proteins or peptides to label not only cancer, but also amyloid plaques and inflammatory processes.  Procedure  Due to the ongoing research involving radiofluorinated molecules and their various uses, the demand for suitable syntheses has increased over the years. In order for synthetic methods to be considered viable, the process must be rapid and efficient as well as compatible with the forms of 18F with are available. In many cases, the synthesis must also be capable of regio- and stereo-specificity. Positron Emission of Fluorine-18. Typically, radiofluorinated products are synthesized using nucleophilic or electrophilic substitution processes. One classical method for radiofluorination is the Balz-Schiemann reaction, or a modified Balz-Schiemann reaction with [18F] F‚àí. Electrophilic substitution reactions typically make use of [18F] F2 as a precursor which can then be added to an array of molecules such as alkenes, aromatic rings, and carbanions [21]. However, methods utilizing [18F]F2 are at a disadvantage due to the loss 50% of the input activity in the form of [18F] F‚àí. To facilitate these procedures the reaction may also be carried out within a microfluidic chamber.  Uses  One of the most popular uses of radiofluorination is its application in PET scans. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used imaging technique in the field of nuclear medicine. With applications in research and in diagnosis, a PET scan can be used to image tumors, diagnose brain disease, and monitor brain or heart function [8,9,12]. These images are created with the aid of radiotracers that emit positrons which decay via an annihilation reaction to generate two 510 KeV photons that are then detected and used to reconstruct images using the same software utilized in X-Ray CT units. The gamma rays are then emitted nearly 180 degrees from each other and their detection allows the ability to pinpoint the source, thus creating an image. One of the most popular isotopes used as a positron emitting radiotracer is fluorine-18. This isotope is particularly advantageous due to its short half- life of approximately 109.8 min, its decay being 97% positron emission, its ease of production, and its energy being low (0.64 MeV). Therefore, the radiofluorination procedure is incorporates the radioactive isotope of choice in order to create the images. Another application in the field of radiofluorination chemistry lies in the field of biofuels. Recent interest has been given to the exploration of lignocellulostic material as a biofuel source. Given that it is the most plentiful renewable carbon source in the biosphere, it is a natural choice for this purpose. The composition consists of three elements‚Äîhemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. It is the last of these three, lignin, that presents the greatest obstacle to the efficient use of such material as a feasible biofuel source. The recalcitrant chemical nature of the lignin molecule currently requires an extensive and expensive process to degrade for bioethanol. Current research is being conducted to find more economical ways to breakdown this lignin barrier. This research will explore the use of radiofluorination with the fluorine-18 isotope to search for places in nature that lignin is being degraded. The radioactive fluorine will be attached to lignin-degradation products in order to search for enzymes in nature that breakdown lignin. This will help to make the process more efficient for use in biofuel production.  Applications with radiopharmaceuticals  Fluorine-18 is typically produced by proton bombardment of oxygen-18 enriched water in a particle accelerator. Due to the relatively short half-life, the isotope must be quickly incorporated into a tracer molecule designed for the desired target. These radiotracers generally fall into two main categories‚Äîlabeled molecules normally used in the body such as water or glucose or labeled molecules that react with or bind to receptors within the body. One important application in the latter class is the attachment of the molecule to a biologically active proteins and peptides, including antibodies and antibody fragments. This class of radiotracers is of particular interest due to their role in imaging the regulation of cellular growth and function. Consequently, radiolabeling these labeled biologically active proteins and peptides with fluorine-18 to image various aspects of nuclear medicinal purposes such as tumors and inflammatory processes is important in nuclear medicine. right However, due to the chemically sensitive nature of proteins, the synthesis of radiofluorine-labeled proteins and peptides presents some formidable challenges. The harsh conditions needed for the addition of the into the biomacromolecule can easily hinder its use in radiolabeling reactions. In order to overcome these obstacles, protein or peptide labeling can be performed through a prosthetic group or bifunctional labeling agent to which the radiofluorine has been attached. This molecule can then be conjugated to the protein or peptide under milder conditions. center The three main categories of prosthetic groups are carboxyl-reactive, amino- reactive, and thiol-reactive. Of these three, the carboxyl-reactive group is the least utilized, and the amino-reactive is the most utilized. The thiol- reactive prosthetic groups are the newest class of the three. The choice of method by which the protein is labeled is dependent upon the structure. Thiol- reactive molecules can be used in cases where the amino-reactive prosthetic groups would not work. Below can be seen the structures and names of various prosthetic groups currently being used for protein and peptide labeling.  References  1.) Berndt, M., Pietzsch, J., & Wuest, F. (2007).

It is carinated and flat on the base. It is covered with tubercles, and colored with gray and pink. Its sculpture shows eight spiral rows of small round tubercles on each whorl. The tubercles on the first two rows, are larger than the others; these, as well as the next three rows, are parted by distinct depressions. The lowest three rows are much closer together, but project a little, especially the center and largest row of the three. On the base there are about nine less strongly tuberculated spiral threads with feebler threads between. These intermediate threads become feebler towards the center. The tubercles are smooth and polished, but the whole intervening surface is sharply fretted with fine oblique puckerings. The color of the shell is white, beautifully flecked above with grayish-purple patches, and closely spotted with purplish-pink on the base. The spire is high and sharp pointed. Its concavely conical slope is slightly broken at the sutures by the projection of the two superior rows of tubercles. It contains about ten flat whorls that increase very regularly in size. The suture is slight, but distinct, being defined by the slight carinal spiral above, and the double row of large tubercles below. The aperture is rather small, square, and very oblique. The outer lip is sharp but strong. The inner lip is strengthened internally by a buttress of porcelaneous nacre, which ends abruptly towards the point of the columella, forming a tooth. The columella, beveled off to a sharp edge, is pressed back on the umbilicus, which it completely closes, leaving only a central depression and a post- columellar furrow. The operculum is thin, yellow, and normal.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Calliostoma arruense) Distribution This marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off Queensland.

It is the seat of the Eparchy of St. Maron of Brooklyn. It is located in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights in the oldest northwest section of the borough, across the East River from Manhattan. The church building originally housed the \\"Church of the Pilgrims\\" of the old Congregational Christian Church, (merged 1957 into the United Church of Christ). History The Maronite Catholic community was established in New York when St. Joseph's Church was founded in Manhattan. Father Khairallah Stephen, its first priest, arrived in New York in 1900. Father Stephen purchased a large brownstone at 295‚Äì297 Hicks Street in Brooklyn in 1902 using $2000 of his money and $600 in donations. The church was incorporated as ‚ÄúThe Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Lebanon‚Äù on February 17, 1903. Services began the following year. The church was on the main floor of the building and the rectory on the second floor. The basement and the main floor were combined and the renovated church was dedicated in January 1906. The congregation grew over the next several decades necessitating a larger church. Father Mansour Stephen, Father Khairallah Stephen's nephew, purchased the former Congregational Church of the Pilgrims on December 8, 1943, for $70,000. The new church of Our Lady of Lebanon was dedicated on Sunday, November 26, 1944. The brownstone residence behind the church was purchased on December 30, 1944, by a parishioner, George Jebaily. On June 27, 1977, the See city for the Eparchy of St. Maron-USA was transferred from Detroit to Brooklyn. Our Lady of Lebanon was designated the cathedral on the same day. Church of the Pilgrims The church building predates the congregation that worships there. It was built as the Church of the Pilgrims for $65,000. It was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by Richard Upjohn, who was known for his Gothic Revival church buildings for the Episcopal Church. The cornerstone was laid on December 22, 1844, and the first service was held in the building on May 12, 1846. A couple of changes were made during construction. A truss bridge had to be added when the timbers that supported the roof were found to be inadequate. Side galleries, which increased seating capacity, were also added. Ten columns were added in the 1850s to provide further support for the roof. An addition designed by Leopold Eidlitz was begun in 1869. It added 450 seats to the church, a large lecture room, and other rooms for classes and meetings. Membership at the Church of the Pilgrims and the nearby Plymouth Church declined in the early Twentieth Century due to changes in the population of Brooklyn Heights. In 1934 they merged to form Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims and utilized the Plymouth Church facilities. Architecture Church doors The church's exterior doors had originally been used as the dining hall doors of the French luxury liner, the SS Normandie. They feature ten medallions showing nine cities in Normandy and one that features the Normandie's sister ship, the SS Ile de France. The doors were altered to fit the church's entrances. Six medallions are on the main entrance on Henry Street and four medallions are on the Remsen Street doors. There is also a set of mahogany doors and marble pilasters in the narthex that came from Charles M. Schwab's New York City mansion. The church's original stained glass windows were relocated to Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims when the two congregations merged. Swiss artist Jean Crotti created new windows for Our Lady of Lebanon using the Gemmaux method by which pieces of colored glass are held together by colorless enamel. The ten windows were created for the church in Crotti's workshop in France during 1953. Problems developed in the windows created by Crotti, and so in the late 1950s Lebanese artist Sabiha Douaihy made additional windows and worked on the existing windows for the church. Other furnishings of note include the marble and onyx flooring in the sanctuary, which was originally in the French and Lebanese Pavilions at the 1939 New York World's Fair. The solid bronze baptistery gates were created in the region of Northern Italy and Southern Germany in the 17th century. The Saint Rafqa Chapel features a bas relief of Our Lady in Chains circa 1526. Behind the altar is a mural of Our Lady of Harissa who is depicted standing on the top of the Lebanese mountains looking down upon the sea coast. It was completed by Lebanese artist Saliba Douaihy in 1952. The pipe organ was originally built as E. & G.G. Hook, opus 519 in 1870, and extensively rebuilt as the Austin Organ Company, opus 259 in 1909. It features three manuals, 25 stops, 23 ranks and 1,525 pipes. After the church was transferred to the Maronite congregation the Austin console near the front of the church, where the pipes are located, was replaced with a new Tellers Organ Company console in the rear gallery. In 1987 an attempt was made to relocate the console closer to the organ. The main cable was severed during the project and has yet to be repaired.

In 1948 Cheetham, in charge of the Allied Control Commission in Vienna, attended a meeting of the Anglo-Russian Society to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Red Army. The Soviet commander-in- chief, General Vladimir Kurasov, made a speech claiming that Britain and the USA had helped Hitler to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, and were plotting a war themselves. Cheetham and the American envoy, Sidney Mellon, got up and walked out. Afterwards, in answer to a question in the House of Commons, the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, said that the Government fully endorsed Cheetham's action.House of Commons, The Times, London, 26 February 1948, page 2 Cheetham was Minister to Hungary 1959‚Äì61, Assistant Under- Secretary at the Foreign Office 1961‚Äì64, and Ambassador to Mexico 1964‚Äì68.

British comics magazines and features to which he has contributed include Roy of the Rovers, Judge Dredd, Doctor Who Magazine and Doctor Who Adventures. He has also created the graphic novels Don Quixote (based on Cervantes' novel of the same name) and an original story, The Motherless Oven. Profile Davis' first strips were seen in the self- published Slang comic, which he published with Sean Longcroft. Davis' first professional work was on the football comic \\"Roy of the Rovers\\" relaunch as a monthly title in 1993. The original title was concluded in March 1993 with Roy Race having crashed his private helicopter, readers were left not knowing if he was alive or dead. In September 1993, Roy awoke from a coma to find his famous left foot amputated after the crash. The new Roy was 'Delroy' of the Rovers, Paul \\"Delroy\\" Ntende, a ragamuffin who played for Nigeria. The new approach by Davis and editor, Stuart Green, was committed to the Kick Racism Out of Football Campaign. Davis also designed posters for the campaign featuring Delroy and Rocky. The strip itself dealt with issues of racism in the game, among other subjects. Green and Davis introduced many other innovations. Among these, he split the history of Roy Race into three generations of Race: grandfather, father and son. In addition to the monthly stories in Roy of the Rovers, Davis drew another Roy strip in Shoot magazine as a two-page spread every week. Many of the changes made during Green and Davis' tenure on the strip were dropped in later revamps of the magazine. Davis went to work for 2000AD, drawing \\"Judge Dredd Lawman of the Future\\", a more child-friendly Judge Dredd spin-off based on the 1996 film. Davis then became disenchanted with comics and pursued a career as an illustrator before returning as a comics writer on \\"Bus Stop\\", \\"The Woman Who Sold the World\\" and \\"The Widow's Curse\\", published in Doctor Who Magazine. He worked on a number of other stories for Doctor Who Magazine solely as an artist, rather than a writer. Davis submitted a four-page comic strip to a 2010 graphic short story competition sponsored by The Observer. The submission, entitled \\"How I Built My Father\\" failed to win, it generated interest and Davis returned to comics with another short strip for the anthology Solipsistic Pop. In 2011, Davis conceived of the idea of a collaborative graphic novel which would showcase the talent of the UK comics scene, made up of chapters by many creators. The result was Nelson, co-edited with Woodrow Phoenix. Phoenix and Davis guided a team of 54 creators to produce 54 chapters of a single story about a woman named Nell. As a storytelling experiment, it won huge critical acclaim. The Observer newspaper awarded it its Graphic Novel of The Month, November 2011. The Times newspaper awarded it Best Graphic Novel of 2011, it was nominated for an Eisner Award and was voted Book of The Year in the British Comic Awards 2012. He then began work on a graphic novel adaptation of Don Quixote, which he made in two parts. The first volume was published in 2011 by SelfMadeHero and featured in many best of the yearlists. Davis released the second volume in 2013. The Complete Don Quixote () contains both parts. The collected was nominated for two Eisner Awards in 2014. The Motherless Oven, a surreal coming of age story based on \\"How I Built My Father\\", was published by SelfMadeHero in 2014. It won the British Comics Award for best book and was nominated for the Best Graphic Album ‚Äì New Eisner Award. A sequel, entitled The Can Opener's Daughter, was published in December 2016, while a third volume The Book of Forks was published in October 2018.

The accident occurred when the aircraft struck a seawall on approach to the runway. The inquiry attributed this to crew tiredness, noting that the captain had been on duty for over 21 hours. It also criticised the response of the airport fire unit. This is the highest death toll of any aviation accident in Singapore. Flight The aircraft was operating a joint Qantas-BOAC scheduled passenger flight from Sydney, Australia, to London, England. Following a stopover at Jakarta, Indonesia, it crashed while landing at Kallang Airport. Captain Trevor Hoyle was the pilot. The aircraft was a Lockheed L-749A Constellation, a low-wing monoplane airliner with four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines. It had first flown in the United States in 1947. Originally part of an order by Eastern Air Lines it was re-allocated to the Irish airline Aerl√≠nte √âireann and delivered on 16 September 1947.Eastwood/Roach 1991, p. 232 It was sold in 1948 by Aerl√≠nte √âireann, along with five other Constellations, to British Overseas Airways Corporation. It had been registered as G-ALAM and named Belfast. Accident The accident occurred when the aircraft struck a seawall on approach to Runway 06 at Kallang, damaging the undercarriage and causing a leak from the number three wing fuel tank. As the aircraft touched down a second time, on the runway, the undercarriage collapsed and the aircraft slid until the starboard wing broke off. The remainder of the aircraft rolled to the right, coming to rest upside down with the fuselage in two pieces, and one of the engines carried on for another . The aircraft was already on fire when it came to rest. The weather was clear at 2:35 p.m. when the accident occurred. Five crew members escaped from the cockpit through a 14-by-10-inch clear vision panel, and two more through a gash in the fuselage in the crew compartment, the sole survivors of the accident. Holes were cut in the fuselage through which a stewardess and two passengers were removed, but the latter died before reaching a hospital, and the stewardess died later of her injuries. No attempt was made to use the emergency exits, and the main cabin door was jammed; at the inquiry a fire expert attached to the RAF stated that the door of the Constellation was the most difficult he had had to open in his 24-year firefighting career. All 31 passengers died, along with 2 crew members (the other crew fatality being a steward). It is the highest death toll of any aviation accident ever to take place in Singapore. Public inquiry The Singapore government held a public inquiry into the accident under Justice Knight from 31 May to 16 August. The accident was attributed to poor execution of the approach due to crew tiredness, which exacerbated the pilot's decision to touch down near the end of the runway. The inquiry determined that, at the time of arrival in Singapore, Captain Hoyle had been on duty for 21¬Ω hours since the flight departed Sydney. Christopher Shawcross, senior counsel for BOAC, stated that \\"the crash would not have happened had it not been for the condition which existed at that end of the runway on the day of the crash\\", referring to the wall struck by the plane. The inquiry criticised the airport fire unit's lack of equipment and the efforts it made to rescue the passengers in the six- to eight-minute period after the aircraft came to rest, when many were probably still alive. It did not censure the aircraft crew but did not commend their actions either, noting they were suffering from shock and the darkness and fumes. After studying the public report on the crash, the Singapore coroner recorded verdicts of 'death by misadventure'. The coroner also said that Captain Hoyle had made an error of judgement but that no one was criminally responsible for the crash. Aftermath Twenty-four of the victims, including fourteen who were not identified, were buried together in a communal grave at Bidadari Cemetery. Two crash victims were mistaken for one another and received funeral rites of the other's religion. BOAC based four captains in Sydney so the Sydney‚ÄìDarwin and Darwin‚ÄìJakarta routes could be flown by separate captains.

Held on three consecutive nights in July 2013 at Petronas Philharmonic Hall, this was her first solo concert to be backed entirely by 80-piece Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO). The concert marked her 18th year involvement Malaysian music industry with more than 20 albums, where most songs that were performed were taken from her solo albums and couple of songs as tribute to Malaysian singers and artists who have inspired her. During the course of the three-night concert, she performed more than 20 songs with MPO which was also her second time collaborating with them since 2001, when she was only a guest artist for Tan Sri SM Salim. Background and development She was reportedly invited to collaborate with Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO) as early as July 2012. This concert marked her first collaboration with MPO as a solo artist at Petronas Philharmonic Hall (DFP). 12 years earlier, in 2001, at the very same venue, she was only a guest artist for Tan Sri SM Salim's concert which also was backed by MPO, Konsert Perjalanan Seni Tan Sri SM Salim. During the stint, she only performed two songs ‚Äì Mohon Kasih as a solo and Pandang Pandang Jeling Jeling as a duet. Prior to the concert dates, the preparation for the concert for Siti herself has taken place at least a month earlier. Preparation made by Siti included the training for her voice, breath control and stamina against a prerecorded orchestral arrangement of the chosen songs made by MPO in a compact disc, followed by a couple of morning and evening practice sessions with MPO itself for two days in a row before the concert dates, under the tutelage and guidance of Kevin Field, the conductor for the concert. Siti admitted the fact that though she has had performed at Royal Albert Hall with London Symphony Orchestra in 2005, Alt URL and had been a recording artist for over 18 years, it was still a challenge for her to perform a full orchestra- backed performance. In the first night of the performance, she said, \\"Every time after I finished singing a song, I will feel relieved. It is not easy to make sure that we and the musicians are moving together. Alhamdullilah (Praise to God), so far I am satisfied, because I got the momentum that I wanted.\\" In addition to limited time frame for practice, Farihad Shalla Mahmud of Berita Harian also pointed out that unlike her previous concerts with considerable big space that allows different gimmicks to be performed, the limited space at DFP means Siti has nothing to offer other than her solid vocal performance alone. Since the whole duration of the concert was only 90 minutes, the original 30 songs that she has listed to perform has to be reduced to only 20 songs, composed mainly from her own repertoire, with additional songs from singers who have inspired her to be in the music industry ‚Äì Alleycats, Jamal Abdillah, M. Nasir, Sudirman Arshad and P. Ramlee. The concert also marked the closing of DFP and MPO's 2012/2013 season. To maintain the exclusivity of the concert, no form of audio or visual recordings were made upon Siti's own request. She said, \\"This is my own request and may it become the sweetest memory for the audiences for the next ten, twenty years\\". Performances=Fashion and stage= One of the pathways that leads to the entrance of the concert at Petronas Philharmonic Hall. In the course of 3 days of the concert, she only changed her dress twice per each night of the concert, and the dresses were all designed by three local designers ‚Äì Khoon Hooi, Cosry and Rizman Ruzaini. Her choice of dress to be worn especially for the debut night of the concert received positive feedbacks from the reviewers where both Azhariah Kamin of The Star and Nur Aqidah Azizi of New Straits Times said Siti looked \\"resplendent\\" in a turquoise coloured dress designed by Khoon Hooi. Given the limited space of stage for her to perform, most of the focus of the concert was her vocals. Apart from her performing space, much of the space on stage was taken by the 80-piece Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra musicians, and the conductor, Kevin Field. =Concert synopsis= The concert opened with Siti performing \\"Kau Kekasihku\\", one of her singles from her album, Pancawarna which then was followed by traditional number, \\"Badarsila\\" which was taken from her eight album, Sanggar Mustika. Then, it was followed by the first medley of the concert which was basically a string of her well-known ballads like \\"Jerat Percintaan\\", \\"Bukan Cinta Biasa\\", \\"Diari Hatimu\\" and \\"Percayalah\\". Siti admitted that ballad is the most challenging song genre that she had to perform. One of the comments that she made after performing the medley of ballads was, \\"Wow! What a relief! \\"Seriously I was thinking, ‚ÄòWill I be able to pull this one off?‚Äô Thank God I did.\\" She also commented, \\"Ballad really challenges my vocals' durability because it requires [me to take] long breath [to perform it]. To make sure that I have enough stamina, every day I will jog for an hour\\". Still in the first part of the concert, she later performed as a tribute, two songs that were made famous by Tan Sri P. Ramlee ‚Äì \\"Malam Bulan Dipagar Bintang\\" and \\"Tiada Kata Secantik Bahasa\\". Explaining her decision to choose the two songs, she explained, \\"Picking songs by Tan Sri P. Ramlee as a tribute to the legend was not easy for me. There are just too many great songs that he had written. Tonight‚Äôs songs were chosen because of their beautiful melodies and lyrics.\\" Closing the first part of the concert, she performed four songs which were all taken from four different album of hers ‚Äì \\"Hanya Dia\\" (CTKD: Canda, Tangis, Ketawa, Duka), \\"Di Taman Teman\\" (Lentera Timur), \\"Seindah Biasa\\" (Prasasti Seni) dan \\"Biarlah Rahsia\\" (Transkripsi). In the second part of the concert, she began the performance with \\"Cindai\\" while playing Darbuka. Speaking of the idea in playing Darbuka as part of her performance, she commented during the media conference, \\"The idea of playing a drum has been thought by me for quite awhile. The funny thing is, since I was so busy with singing and dancing practices, I had to practice playing the Darbuka while I was about to sleep. Whether [he likes it] or not, my husband (Datuk Khalid) has to bear with it.\\" In the next part of the show, she presented another tribute song to her idols, and this time for Alleycats, M. Nasir and Jamal Abdillah, by singing \\"Senandung Semalam\\" which was made famous by the three artists. Later, \\"Lebih Indah\\" was performed for the first time ever by her. A new song, which was said to reflect her emotional state when her husband was involved in a motorcycle accident in New Zealand in 2012. The concert later continued with the final medley of the night, which was composed of her more upbeat songs like \\"Ku Mahu\\", \\"Balqis\\" and \\"Ya Maulai\\". The final tribute song of the concert, \\"Terasing\\" which was an homage to Sudirman Arshad was performed to close the aforementioned upbeat numbers. Another song, which was included in the set list was \\"Purnama Merindu\\", one of the songs that has helped her to promote her name to the international stage. Closing the ceremony, performed as an encore was \\"Muara Hati\\", which was well received by members of the audience before the concert drew to its end. Critical response Overall, the concert received positive reviews and feedback from music critics, especially for Siti's vocal showcase. A number of the reviews agree that she indeed possessed the \\"buluh perindu\\" (very sweet voice) quality to her vocals, while others praised that she has certain \\"magical\\" quality to both her vocals and performances. Most of the critics praised her ability to sing technical ballads with ease. Nur Aqidah Azizi of New Straits Times on the opening song of the night, \\"Kau Kekasihku\\" one of the ballads in the set list commented, \\"It was, perhaps, one of the most difficult songs in Siti‚Äôs repertoire but she certainly outdid herself that night, performing the high notes effortlessly.\\" Azhariah Kamin of The Star also commented positively on \\"Kau Kekasihku\\" as the opening performance. She commented, \\"Backed by an 80-piece MPO ensemble and watched by a hushed audience, there was no way that Siti could go wrong with this infectious ballad. The song, which is about love lost, showcased Siti‚Äôs vocal prowess as the chorus was sung on the upper register. And as expected, Siti sang the poignant song beautifully. What a start it was at DFP!\\" Syazwan Zakariah of Astro Awani also praised Siti's vocal ability to sing ballads with ease. He commented that, \\"Siti appeared very calm, in fact [she seemed] relax, it is as if she was smiling every time she is singing, though while performing difficult song like \\"Purnama Merindu\\".\\" Her ability to sing traditional songs were also subject of praise by the critics, in particular, \\"Badarsila\\" which is one of the songs from her eight album, Sanggar Mustika. Kamaruddin Razal, a reviewer from Gua.com.my praised such ability by saying,\\"The mellowness and melisma of her vocals in phrasing the melody and the rhythm of this traditional song can't no longer be denied.\\" Nur Aqidah Azizi of New Straits Times also shared the same sentiment. She commented that Siti has \\"made it look as if little effort was needed to bring such beautiful performance to the song\\". In another aspect of the concert, during the second part of the concert, Nur Aqidah Azizi commented her only negative remark of the concert is how certain part of the second half of the show \\"... could sound even better without the drums set and its annoying cymbals, that unceremoniously overpowered the string section.\\" Bissme S. of The Sun noted that despite Siti's jokes and banters can be \\"too simplistic\\", he believed that, in the eyes of the fans, \\"Siti can do no wrong.\\" Azhariah Kamin noted that these jokes actually \\"brought the artiste and audience closer to each other.\\" The 3-day concert, in overall, received positive reviews and responses from the music and concert critics alike. Syazawan Zakariah concluded his review by saying, \\"Though she was backed by musicians as impressive as the MPO, Siti's vocals was the best \\"instrument\\" of the night. With clear voice, energetic and dynamic, she has proven that she is still nation's best vocalist.\\", while Nur Aqidah Azizi concluded hers on Siti's vocal showcase with \\"to describe her as the singer with a golden voice would really be an understatement.\\" Commercial performance Tickets for the concert were made available since late April 2013 through its official ticket vendors, dfp.com.my and mpo.com.my. Listed from RM 150 to RM 400, it was reported that by May, more than 90 percents of the tickets have already been sold. With Petronas Philharmonic Hall at its full capacity able to seat 900 people per night, all 2700 tickets that were available sold out weeks after the concert was announced.

It covered a wide range of agricultural topics and was extensively distributed and widely reproduced throughout African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and elsewhere. Originally known as the \\"Bulletin of CTA\\" it later styled itself as \\"the magazine for agricultural and rural development in ACP countries\\". The final issue, No. 195, was published in December 2019. At its peak, the magazine reached over 50,000 subscribers and it was also published online.  Origin  Spore was first published at the beginning 1986, two years after the establishment of CTA. The first issue noted that \\"rather than promoting the agency putting it out, ..........Spore aims to ensure the widest possible dissemination of information of relevance to the agricultural world, in order to fertilize ideas and allow them to germinate. It is in this down-to-earth way that Spore hopes to participate in the process of rural development.\\" The first issue included articles on locusts, fertilizer response, bananas, aquaculture, rice husks for fuel, and sorghum. Initially published in English and French, a Portuguese version (Esporo) was added in 1993,\\"The First Ten Years\\", CTA, 1994. although rising costs meant that this was discontinued in 2016.  Distribution  The magazine appeared bimonthly until mid-2016, when it changed to being a quarterly publication. It also had an annual Special Issue in which a particular subject was treated in depth but these were discontinued from 2016. It was available in print free of charge to people living in ACP countries and online but increasing emphasis was put on online distribution and new subscriptions for hard copies were discouraged. Copies were also distributed through ACP ministries of agriculture and in partnership with local organisations, particularly where postal services were poor. In some countries the magazine was very effective in reaching remote areas. In 2012 the print run of all three languages combined was around 70,000, with 53,000 of these being sent out directly to subscribers. With 60,000 copies being distributed it was estimated that around 300,000 people read each issue but the potential audience was considered to have been close to one million. Surveys in Cameroon and Uganda found several examples of income-raising activities inspired by the magazine. It was also used in literacy and adult education programmes. According to Google Scholar,https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q;=spore.cta.int&btnG;=&as;_sdt=1%2C5&as;_sdtp= articles in Spore had been cited 83 times in academic journals by the beginning of February 2014.  Reproduction of articles  Articles appearing in Spore could be freely reproduced for non-commercial use, if credited as coming from the magazine. Reproduction of Spore articles was widespread in ACP countries and elsewhere, both in national newspapers and international media services such as Africa Online and in journals and web sites specializing on agricultural topics, such as City Farmer.  Contents  A typical issue contained a two-page in-depth report on a particular topic that was usually also featured on the cover. This was followed by news items presented under the categories of Agriculture, Fisheries and Livestock, Environment, Research and Business and Trade. Other features included an interview with someone active in the field of agriculture, a detailed 7-page \\"Dossier\\" on a major issue, reviews of agricultural publications, and news about the work of the publisher, CTA. Earlier issues included letters from readers but this was later discontinued in favour of the use of social media. Examples of Special Issues were those on Climate Change; Family Farming; Structured Grain Trading; Agricultural Value Chains; Modernizing Farms (2011); Population and Agriculture (2010).

Background In September 2004, the Newfoundland fishing vessel Ryan's Commander departed Bay de Verde for a trip to its home port of St. Brendan's, but it never arrived. In heavy seas off Cape Bonavista the vessel capsized, forcing the crew of five to abandon ship. Despite the efforts of search and rescue technicians, brothers Joe and David Ryan did not survive. Their widows and dependants (the \\"Ryan Estates\\") applied for and received compensation under the provincial Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Act. Proceeding under the federal Marine Liability Act, the Ryan Estates also commenced an action in 2006 against Universal Marine Limited, Marine Services International Limited and its employee David Porter, alleging negligence in the design and construction of the Ryan's Commander, which had been commissioned by the Ryan brothers in 2003. The action was also brought against the Attorney General of Canada, alleging negligence in the inspection of the vessel by Transport Canada. Marine Services and Porter applied to the Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission for a determination of whether the Ryan Estates' action was statute-barred under s. 44 of the provincial Act. The Commission declared that it was, holding: :* the Ryan brothers had died in the course of their employment, :* Universal Marine, Marine Services, and the Attorney General of Canada were \\"employers\\" and David Porter was a \\"worker\\" within the meaning of s. 2 of the Act, and :* the constitutional doctrines of interjurisdictional immunity and federal paramountcy did not apply. The Ryan Estates applied to the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador for judicial review of the decision in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision The courts below At trial, Hall J overturned the Commission's decision, ruling:SCC, par. 79 :* the provincial Act was, in pith and substance, an insurance scheme, while liability in the marine context fell within the exclusive federal jurisdiction over Navigation and Shipping, and the right to make a claim under the federal Act was a core feature of that power. :* interjurisdictional immunity applied, as the statute bar under the provincial Act impaired the ability to pursue a claim under the federal Act. :* federal paramountcy applied because the Ryan Estates could not comply with both Acts. The Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 ruling, dismissed the appeal. The majority held that:SCC, par. 1012 :* the provincial Act was a valid exercise of the provincial power over property and civil rights, but interjurisdictional immunity applied because s. 44 trenches on maritime negligence law, which sits at the core of the federal power over navigation and shipping. :* federal paramountcy applied, and even if dual compliance was possible, the operation of s. 44 frustrated the purpose of the federal Act by denying access to the federal maritime tort regime to the dependants of persons who die in maritime incidents. In dissent, Welsh JA stated that neither doctrine applied, as the provincial Act did not trench on the core of the federal power over navigation and shipping (being a workers' compensation scheme which does not engage issues of negligence), and the fact that s. 44 restricts the scope of the right granted under s. 6(2) of the MLA was not sufficient to establish the frustration of a federal purpose.SCC, par. 1314 Leave to appeal was sought from the Supreme Court of Canada, which was granted in April 2012. At the Supreme Court In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal's decision was overturned. In their joint ruling, LeBel and Karakatsanis JJ focused on two key issues: #Does s. 44 of the provincial Act apply on the facts of this case? #If it applies, is it constitutionally applicable and operative? =Application of s. 44= The parties did not dispute the Commission's findings that under the provincial Act: (a) the Ryan brothers were injured in the course of employment; (b) Marine Services was an \\"employer\\"; and (c) Porter was a \\"worker\\". The dispute was whether the injury that led to the Ryan brothers' death \\"occurred otherwise than in the conduct of the operations usual in or incidental to the industry carried on by the employer\\" as stated in s. 44(2).SCC, par. 4243 The Commission had exclusive jurisdiction under s. 19 to determine matters under the Act, and the standard of reasonableness under Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick holds that the Commission's findings were entitled to deference.SCC, par. 45 =Constitutional questions= Under Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, an analysis is required to assess whether interjurisdictional immunity or federal paramountcy apply: #An analysis of the pith and substance must be undertaken, which consists of \\"an inquiry into the true nature of the law in question for the purpose of identifying the 'matter' to which it essentially relates\\".Canadian Western Bank, at par. 26 Two aspects of the law or of the impugned provision are analyzed: the purpose of the enacting body in adopting it, and the legal effect of the law or provision.Canadian Western Bank, at par. 27 In this case, the validity of the two Acts was not contested and a full pith and substance analysis was not required.SCC, par. 48 #At the end of a pith and substance analysis, a court should generally consider interjurisdictional immunity only if there is \\"prior case law favouring its application to the subject matter at hand\\".Canadian Western Bank, at par. 78 The doctrine \\"is of limited application and should in general be reserved for situations already covered by precedent\\".Canadian Western Bank, at par. 77 In view of Ordon v. Grail, the SCC had to consider whether interjurisdictional immunity applied.SCC, par. 49 #In COPA, a two-pronged test was devised to determine whether the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity applied: (1) whether the provincial law trenches on the protected \\"core\\" of a federal competence, (2) if it does, whether the provincial law's effect on the exercise of the protected federal power is sufficiently serious to invoke the doctrine.COPA, par. 27 The standard to be used is that of impairment,Canadian Western Bank, at par. 48 and \\"impairment\\" is a higher standard than \\"affects\\", as in \\"an era of cooperative, flexible federalism, application of the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity requires a significant or serious intrusion on the exercise\\" of a head of power.COPA, par. 45 #The first prong of the test was met, but not the second.SCC, par. 60 While federal jurisdiction over navigation and shipping \\"encompasses those aspects of navigation and shipping that engage national concerns which must be uniformly regulated across the country, regardless of their territorial scope\\", it has been acknowledged since 1919 that workers' compensation schemes apply to the maritime context. #While Ordon held that interjurisdictional immunity applies where a provincial statute of general application has the effect of indirectly regulating a maritime negligence law issue, it predates Canadian Western Bank and COPA, which clarified the two- step test for interjurisdictional immunity and set the necessary level of intrusion into the relevant core at \\"impairs\\" instead of \\"affects\\". Accordingly, Ordon does not apply the two-step test for interjurisdictional immunity developed in Western Bank and COPA nor the notion of impairment of the federal core which is now necessary to trigger the application of interjurisdictional immunity.SCC, par. 64 #\\"The doctrine of paramountcy applies where there is a federal law and a provincial law which are (1) each valid and (2) inconsistent.\\" The doctrine does not apply to an inconsistency between the common law and a valid legislative enactment.SCC, par. 66 Upon a proper reading of the federal Act, the doctrine did not apply.SCC, par. 70 The Court declared: Impact The case has attracted extensive comment in the Canadian legal profession: #While Beetz J had suggested in obiter in Bisaillon v. Keable that the paramountcy doctrine could apply to conflicts between federal common law and provincial statute law, the Court in Ryan Estate noted that \\"we are aware of no case in which the doctrine was applied to common law\\".SCC, par. 67 However, the Court did not directly deal with whether paramountcy can apply where a federal statute is inconsistent with a provincial rule of common law. Such conflicts have given rise to a significant body of case law in the United States,e.g., where courts have frequently held that state tort laws may be \\"pre-empted\\" where they conflict with federal enactments. #While the decision may be surprising to those who practise in the area of maritime law (with some considering the lower courts to have reached the correct decision), to conclude differently would have created uncertainty, (a) for marine employers who may have paid into their respective provincial funds but, ultimately, would not be entitled to the limited liability benefits thereof; and (b) for employees injured or killed in a marine context who would not, based on their specific fact scenario, have a claim in tort against their employer and thus would have no ability to obtain compensation. #In Ryan Estate, the SCC also tried to clarify what exactly it means to impair a core legislative power. The SCC considered (1) extent of federal power (in this case over navigation and shipping), (2) the lack of uniformity in Canadian maritime law, and (3) the history of other workers' compensation schemes in a maritime context.

He served as Minister of Justice and Cults in the government of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte from 17 July 1869 to 2 January 1870. Early years Jean-Baptiste-Marie Duvergier was born in Bordeaux on 25 August 1792. His father was a middle-class merchant. He studied law in Bordeaux, then moved to Paris where he completed his studies and founded his law firm. Duvergier became an advocate in Paris in 1821. As a young man he was one of the first followers of Saint-Simon. He was one of the founders of the journal Le Producteur, and with Olinde Rodrigues belonged to the first circle of friends of Saint Simon. He was also interested in the utilitarianism of Saint-Simon's disciple Jeremy Bentham. He wrote, \\"it is to Bentham's credit that he abandoned a false path and showed the right path by demonstrating the purpose of legislation by saying that its aim was for General Utility.\\" Later he broke with the movement due to his religious beliefs. Career Duvergier married Jeanne-Jos√®phine-Perette Arnheiter (1804 ‚Äì 19 March 1854). He soon became well known for his legal expertise and attracted a clientele of wealthy businessmen and political leaders. Duvergier was president of the bar of Paris from 1844 to 1845, and was appointed Councillor of State in 1855. He presided over a section of the Council of State in 1866. Duvergier was appointed Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs on 17 July 1869, replacing Jules Baroche. The cabinet he joined had the mission of preparing the parliamentary empire for a revised constitution, which he assisted in drafting. At the end of his term of office, on 2 January 1870 he was nominated as a senator of the Second French Empire. He was replaced by √âmile Ollivier. Duvergier died in Bordeaux on 2 November 1877. The Rue Duvergier in Paris () is named in his honor. Works Jean-Baptiste Duvergier is best known for starting the Collection compl√®te des lois, d√©crets, ordonnances, r√©glements, avis du Conseil-d‚Äô√âtat published by A. Guyot et Scribe. The first volume appeared in 1824, and new volumes continued to be published by the company long after Duvergier had died. Duvergier also co-authored a Collection des constitutions, chartes et lois fondamentales des peuples de l‚ÄôEurope et des deux Am√©riques avec des pr√©cis offrant l‚Äôhistoire des libert√©s et des institutions politiques chez les nations modernes (1823). He published his views on the relationship between workers and employers in an article titled Des caract√®res distinctifs du louage d'ouvrage et du mandat salari√© in the Revue de L√©gislation et de Jurisprudence (April‚ÄìSeptember 1837).

The three-month extension would cost $6.4 billion. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act was introduced in the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background In response to the Great Recession in the United States, the federal government began extending the length of unemployment benefits. The federal government has been providing additional weeks of unemployment benefits for people since 2008. The most recent extension was provided by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which extended unemployment benefits until the end of 2013. The United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the average (mean) duration of unemployment in weeks was 37.2 weeks in November 2013. The median duration was 17.0 weeks. 22.6% of people who were unemployed found a new job in less than 5 weeks, while 37.3% had been unemployed for 27 weeks or more. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act would amend the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 to extend emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) payments for eligible individuals to weeks of employment ending on or before April 1, 2014. The bill would amend the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act to extend until March 31, 2014, requirements that federal payments to states cover 100% of EUC. The bill would also amend the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008 to exempt weeks of unemployment between enactment of this Act and September 30, 2014, from the prohibition in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (FSEUCA of 1970) against federal matching payments to a state for the first week in an individual's eligibility period for which extended compensation or sharable regular compensation is paid if the state law provides for payment of regular compensation to an individual for his or her first week of otherwise compensable unemployment. (This would allow temporary federal matching for the first week of extended benefits for states with no waiting period.) The bill would also amend the FSEUCA of 1970 to postpone similarly from December 31, 2013, to March 31, 2014, termination of the period during which a state may determine its \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" indicators according to specified temporary substitutions in its formula. The bill would amend the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 to appropriate funds out of the employment security administration account through the first quarter of FY2015 to assist states in providing reemployment and eligibility assessment activities. The bill would amend the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to extend through March 31, 2014, the temporary increase in extended unemployment benefits. The bill would make a change in application of a certain requirement (nonreduction rule) to a state that has: (1) entered a federal-state EUC agreement, under which the federal government would reimburse the state's unemployment compensation agency making EUC payments to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular unemployment compensation under state or federal law and meet specified other criteria; and (2) enacted a law before December 1, 2013, that, upon taking effect, would violate the nonreduction rule. (Under the nonreduction rule such an agreement does not apply with respect to a state whose method for computing regular unemployment compensation under state law has been modified to make the average weekly unemployment compensation benefit paid on or after June 2, 2010, less than what would have been paid before June 2, 2010.) The bill would declare that the nonreduction rule shall not apply to a state which has enacted a law before December 1, 2013, that, upon taking effect, would violate the nonreduction rule. It would allow such a state, however, to enter into a subsequent federal-state EUC agreement on or after enactment of this Act if, taking into account this inapplicability of the nonreduction rule, it would otherwise meet the requirements for an EUC agreement. (This would allow such a subsequent EUC agreement to permit payment of less than the average weekly unemployment compensation benefit paid on or after June 2, 2010.) Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. S. 1845 would extend the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program for three months‚Äîthrough March 31, 2014. The EUC program allows qualified states to provide up to 47 additional weeks of federally funded unemployment compensation to people who have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits. The total expected increase in the deficit would be $6,414,000,000 over 2014-2023. Procedural history The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act was introduced in the United States Senate on December 17, 2013 by Sen. Jack Reed (D, RI). The bill began receiving floor consideration on January 6, 2014. Debate and discussion One objection many Republicans had to the bill was that it did not include any spending cuts to offset the $6.4 billion cost of the bill. The liberal public policy think tank the Center for American Progress supported the bill. According to the Center for American Progress, extending the emergency unemployment benefits would accomplish two things. First, it would prevent 3.1 million Americans from losing their benefits. Second, it would create 310,000 jobs in the next year (as a result of the spending of the 3.1 million Americans who would keep their benefits). This information is based on a report on Jobs and Unemployment from fellow liberal think tank the Economic Policy Institute. Conservative policy advocacy organization Heritage Action opposed the bill and challenged some of the arguments made by organizations such as the Center for American Progress. According to Heritage Action, research has shown that increasing unemployment benefits actually results in \\"higher unemployment,\\" \\"longer unemployment,\\" and \\"ineffective stimulus.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Unemployment benefits *Unemployment in the United States Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 1845 *beta.congress.gov S. 1845 *GovTrack.us S. 1845 *OpenCongress.org S. 1845 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 1845 *Congressional Budget Office's report on S. 1845 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Unemployment in the United States ","title":"Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act"},{"id":"41585416","text":"Calthalotia baudini is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails.Marshall, B.

This is one of the couple ways in which AMOs can interact with miRNA in the body. By the hybridization of the miRNA sequence, the function of the miRNA sequence is neutralized by preventing its selective binding to the target genetic information. Although this diagram illustrates only the genetic base pairing between miRNA and anti-miRNA sequences, there are specific chemical modifications that are placed on the 3' and 5' ends of the anti- miRNA.Anti-miRNA Oligonucleotides (also known as AMOs) have many uses in cellular mechanics. These synthetically designed molecules are used to neutralize microRNA (miRNA) function in cells for desired responses. miRNA are complementary sequences (‚âà22 bp) to mRNA that are involved in the cleavage of RNA or the suppression of the translation. By controlling the miRNA that regulate mRNAs in cells, AMOs can be used as further regulation as well as for therapeutic treatment for certain cellular disorders. This regulation can occur through a steric blocking mechanism as well as hybridization to miRNA. These interactions, within the body between miRNA and AMOs, can be for therapeutics in disorders in which over/under expression occurs or aberrations in miRNA lead to coding issues. Some of the miRNA linked disorders that are encountered in the humans include cancers, muscular diseases, autoimmune disorders, and viruses. In order to determine the functionality of certain AMOs, the AMO/miRNA binding expression (transcript concentration) must be measured against the expressions of the isolated miRNA. The direct detection of differing levels of genetic expression allow the relationship between AMOs and miRNAs to be shown. This can be detected through luciferase activity (biolumincescence in response to targeted enzymatic activity). Understanding the miRNA sequences involved in these diseases can allow us to use anti miRNA Oligonucleotides to disrupt pathways that lead to the under/over expression of proteins of cells that can cause symptoms for these diseases. Synthesis During anti-miRNA oligonucleotide design, necessary modifications to optimize binding affinity, improve nuclease resistance, and in vivo delivery must be considered. There have been several generations of designs with attempts to develop AMOs with high binding affinity as well as high specificity. The first generation utilized 2‚Äô-O-Methyl RNA nucleotides with phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages positioned at both ends to prevent exonuclease attack. A recent study discovered a compound, N,N-diethyl-4-(4-nitronaphthalen-1-ylazo)-phenylamine (ZEN), that improved binding affinity and blocked exonuclease degradation. This method was combined with the first generation design to create a new generation ZEN-AMO with an improved effectiveness. Various components of AMOs can be manipulated to affect the binding affinity and potency of the AMO. The 2‚Äô-sugar of the AMOs can be modified to be substituted with fluorine and various methyl groups, almost all with an increase in binding affinity. However, some of these modified 2‚Äô-sugar AMOs led to negative effects on cell growth. Modifying the 5'-3' phosphodiester backbone linkage to a phosphorothiorate (P-S) backbone linkage was also shown to have an effect on target affinity. Using the P-S mutation was shown to decrease the Tm of the oligonucleotide, which leads to a lower target affinity. A final requirement for AMOs is mismatch specificity and length restrictions. Due to miRNAs in the same families sharing ‚Äúseed‚Äù (shared) sequences and differ by only a couple of additional nucleotides; one AMO can potentially target multiple miRNA sequences. However, studies have suggested that this is difficult due to the loss of activity with single nucleotide mismatches. Greater than three mismatches demonstrates complete loss of activity. Changes in the length of AMOs were tolerated far better, with changes of one nucleotide and two nucleotides resulting in little loss of activity and three or more in total loss of activity. Truncating a single nucleotide from the 3‚Äô end resulted in a slight improvement of AMO activity. Delivery and Detection gold nanoparticles and cargo DNA to introduce AMOs into cells by in vitro transfection. Inspired by Figure 1. Delivery of AMOs requires in vitro transfection into target cells. Presently there are difficulties with conventional methods of transfection that result in low delivery efficiency. In order to increase the effectiveness of AMO delivery, a 2011 paper proposed using functionalized gold nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticles increase delivery efficiency by conjugating with a cargo DNA that anneals to the AMO using complementarity. The cargo DNA is attached to the surface of the nanoparticle. Because many variations of DNA and RNA are unstable in in vivo conditions, carriers, such as nanoparticles, are necessary to protect from degeneration by nucleases. These nanoparticles are useful in order to facilitate uptake into the cell, and transfer the genetic information to the nucleus. Another in vivo method for delivery supported by results in mice is the injection of AMOs intravenously. Tail vein injection of AMOs in the mice were shown to be effective. In order for this system to be useful, the AMOs were conjugated with cholesterol for increased uptake into the cell through the membrane and were chemically modified by 2‚Ä≤-OMe phosphoramidites to prevent degradation of the AMOs. To detect the presence and functionality of AMOs, researchers can observe the relative activity of the target enzyme or protein of the miRNA. This method was used in a study of single AMOs targeting multiple miRNAs, where relative luciferase activity in HEK293 cells was monitored. To determine relative Luciferase activity levels, a control with no miRNA present was included. The presence of functional AMOs with the inhibiting miRNA would result in an increase in Luciferase activity due to the inactivation of the miRNA suppressing the enzyme's activity. Disorders/Therapeutics Many human disorders have been found to have some alterations in expression or aberrations involving miRNA. It has been found that miRNA have been involved in many key regulation pathways that are suspected to be related to cancer, viral genes, and metabolic pathways, as well as muscular disorders (specifically cardiovascularly related). By targeting cells affected with improper miRNA expression, the normal balance of the expression can be restored by using AMOs. By minimizing overexpression and increasing underexpression with AMOs, some of these genetic disorders can be potentially bypassed or at least have their symptoms minimized. This is done by hybridization of the AMOs to miRNA sequences that are involved in the expression of specific genes. The issue is finding a way for the AMOs to successfully perform their function in concentrations that are sufficient for success, while at the same time being low enough to avoid toxicity of the vector and AMOs themselves. =Cancer= All cancers are mutations in the genomes that cause abnormal cell growth. Determining factors that contribute to or regulate this excessive growth can potentially lead to preventative, therapeutic treatments of cancer. For example, chronic lymphocytic leukemias illustrates a region of miRNAs (mir-15 and mir-16) are missing from the genome in the expression of this cancer. While in other cancers, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, expression of miRNA sequences are amplified. This leads to the suggestion that many miRNA have regulatory sequences involved in cancer. If those were to be better regulated, potentially through AMOs, perhaps the onset and progression of cancer could be regulated. Following a study of 540 tumor samples of various cancer types, it was discovered that 15 miRNAs were upregulated and 12 were downregulated. From the study, it was concluded that these miRNA sequences had an effect on cell growth and apoptosis in the cell. AMOs play into the equation as this regulatory factor for the miRNAs involved in cancer. If bound to a single affected miRNA site, the effect appears to be minimal. However, by creating sequences of anti-miRNA Oligonucleotides to bind to all of these implicit miRNAs, there was increased cell death within the cancer cells. One study involving antagomirs, a different variation of anti- miRNA oligonucleotides, focused on reducing induced tumors in mice. After 2 weeks of treatment, tumor growth was inhibited and regression was shown in 30% of cases. This illustrates that AMOs can be used to successfully inhibit cancers through miRNAs. This inhibition is caused by a direct silencing interaction of the miRNAs that in turn bind on the mRNA sequences that create proteins in cancer cells, as well as increased control of cellular processes of cancer. =Muscular Development= In the development of tissues in embryos, miRNA can have a role in the upregulation or downregulation of specific muscular development. miRNA-1 plays a role in muscle differentiation between cardiac and skeletal muscle precursor cells. In development, if levels of precursor cells are not properly regulated, it can result in muscular hypoplasia. By creating AMOs for these known miRNAs involved in muscle generation, it is possible to track a miRNA's specific mechanisms throughout the process of muscle generation by essentially using the created AMO to turn off the miRNA. This halts the production of myogenin(the transcription factor involved in myogenesis). By then measuring the changes in myogenin compared to standard, non-inhibited myogenesis, a miRNA's function can be determined as either upregulating or downregulating the synthesis of myogenin. By further understanding how certain miRNA sequences control the development of muscle, AMOs can be utilized to promote normal production levels of myogenin in organisms that have been detected to contain genetic errors involving myogenesis. AMOs can also be used to prevent apoptosis, or organ hypoplasia, of the heart in the presence of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can induce apoptosis through oxidative stress. This is because oxidative stress caused by induces increased activity of miRNA-1. This increased miRNA-1 activity represses the activity of Bcl-2, inducing apoptosis. However, by creating and introducing an AMO for miRNA-1 in an environment of oxidative stress, the response to is reduced, creating a resistance to oxidative stress in the heart. Because of this, the amount of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is be reduced in heart disease. Due to the reduction of cardiomyocyte death in conditions of oxidative stress by the anti-miRNA-1 Oligonucleotide, miRNA regulation can allow us to more deeply understand the development of the heart, as well as the survival of heart muscle in low oxygen conditions. =Autoimmune Response and Disorders= This diagram illustrates the various locations in the process of lymphocyte specificity that have miRNA regulation. Each of these sites has the potential to be over or under-expressed which can result in hyper/hypo- sensitivity of the immune system. Inspired by Figure 2 Autoimmune disorders are when the body has an immune response to itself, causing an inflammatory reaction to occur within the body. Because autoimmune disorders involve abnormalities in the immune system cells (i.e., B-cells, T-cells). It can be inferred that miRNA are strongly expressed in regions of the body that have to do with the maturation of these T and B lymphocytes, such as in the spleen and lymph nodes. Abnormalities in the miRNA or the function of the miRNA in the post-transcriptional process can result in an increased sensitivity of the lymphocytes. Due to increased sensitivity, these lymphocytes can now target antigens that it could not previously bind, which can allow for these lymphocytes to attack itself, if these antigens happen to naturally occur in cells in the body. One instance of this is Rheumatoid Arthritis, in which the body breaks down its own joints. The break down is caused by the overexpression of specific miRNA clusters. These clusters causes an increase in synovial fibroblasts. Due to this increased fibroblast amount, certain proteases' concentrations are increased which cause the breakdown of cartilage in joints. By targeting the miRNA clusters responsible for expression of the disease, inflammation caused by this disorder can be reduced when AMOs are added to afflicted areas. Systemic lupus erythematosus causes long term organ damage to the body. It propagates due to environmental and genetic factors. By targeting microRNA (miR-184, miR-196a, miR-198, and miR-21) that are down- regulated in SLE with AMOs in the affected organs, the normal expression of these genes can be restored. =Viral Studies= It is believed that cellular miRNAs inhibit viral gene expression. In a study of HIV-1, anti-miRNA inhibitors were used to deactivate two miRNAs that inhibit viral gene expression, has-miR-29a and 29b. It was shown that viral gene expression increased after the introduction of anti-miRNAs targeting has-miR-29a and 29b. This demonstrated miRNA inhibitors were able to directly target and reverse the inhibitory effect of has-miR-29a and 29b in the HIV-1 virus. By creating an AMO, certain genomic sequences of HIV were able to be studied more in depth. A further understanding of the way the genome of certain viruses work can allow scientists to create preventative measures against these viruses. The mechanism for anti-miRNA regulation in the case of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) differs slightly than other viral cases such as HIV-1. EBV is a herpesvirus related to various cancers that has the ability to express miRNAs, unlike many other viruses that affect humans. Unlike other studies that utilize anti-miRNAs as a knockdown tool to demonstrate the effects of miRNAs, researchers of EBV used them to inhibit the miRNAs produced by the virus. MiR- BART5, a miRNA of EBV, regulates the protein: p53 Up-regulated Modulator of Apoptosis (PUMA). When the viral mir-BART5 was depleted using its anti-miRNA, anti-miR-BART5, cell apoptosis was triggered and resulted in disease control, killing the cells that are identified as infected. Another peculiar case of host-viral interaction mediated by a microRNA occurs with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV, which causes acute infection of the liver, often going undetected and progressing to chronic, uses the human miRNA miR-122 to recruit Argonaute2 proteins to the uncapped 5' end of its RNA genome, thereby masking it from the cellular antiviral response and stabilizing it. This interaction has led to the development of AMOs that target miR-122 in an effort to clear the virus from the hepatic cells. The most advanced of these compounds is miravirsen, a locked nucleic acid-DNA mixmer, currently undergoing clinical trials. An interesting aspect of miravirsen is its reported ability to inhibit not just the mature miR-122, but to also invade the stem-loop structures in the microRNA precursor molecules, disrupting the biogenesis of miR-122 in biochemical assays and cell culture.

The book follows narrator Sarah Parsons, who discovers she has the psychic ability of psychometry, enabling her to see into her own history as she stays at her family's ancestral estate outside of Annapolis, Maryland. Amber House is a young adult paranormal mystery novel. Critics have remained in disagreement over what genre Amber House best fits into; Kirkus Reviews dubbed it \\"horror romance,\\" and Booklist cited the story's \\"Gothic feel,\\" while Publishers Weekly claimed the story \\"straddles the lines between magical realism, fantasy, ghost stories, and horror, with a touch of romance and classic glamour.\\" The authors categorize the book (and its sequels) as \\"a time travel series.\\" Plot summary The book begins at the funeral of Sarah's maternal grandmother, Ida. Sarah and her autistic brother, five-year-old Sammy, have never seen their mother's supposedly-haunted ancestral home; Anne was estranged from Ida, and she plans to sell Amber House and everything in it. Sarah meets her grandmother's nurse, Rose Valois, and Rose's teenaged grandson, Jackson. Sarah feels uncomfortable around Jackson because he seems to know things about her that her grandmother would have been unable to tell him due to how infrequently she and Sarah interacted while Ida was alive. Jackson mentions a local legend about a fortune of diamonds hidden in Amber House and offers to help Sarah find them. Even though Anne has already booked the family into a hotel, Sarah and Sammy conspire to hunt for the treasure and force Anne to stay in the house for the few days they will be in town. Soon Sarah is introduced to Senator Robert Hathaway and his teenaged son Richard. Richard knows more about Amber House than Sarah does, and tells her about Deirdre Foster, the mad wife of the sea captain who lost the diamonds in the 1700s. Richard claims it is Deirdre who haunts the estate. Meanwhile, inspired by Sarah and Richard's palpable connection, Anne comes up with the idea of celebrating Sarah's sixteenth birthday, ten days off, with a masquerade ball. The event will be used to advertise the house before Anne puts it on the market. As time goes on, Sarah finds herself spending many of her daytime hours with Richard, and many of her evening hours with Jackson. After Jackson rescues Sarah from an encounter with Deirdre Foster, Sarah confesses to seeing ghosts in Amber House. But Jackson explains that they aren't ghosts; according to Ida, they are what the house remembers, and the house tells its secrets only to the women of Sarah's family. In the days leading up to her birthday, Sarah uses her new \\"gift\\" to piece together when and why her mother and grandmother drifted apart. She uncovers secrets Through visions of the women of her family that suggest she is connected to both Jackson and Richard. And when the past seems to threaten Sarah and Sammy in the present, Sarah must use her gift to find the point where \\"past and future meet,\\" before the ominous happenings at Amber House end in a fresh tragedy. Development According to interviews, Kelly Moore first started work on the story in the 1980s. Moore was influenced by Indonesian tribal beliefs and the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California. She attempted to adapt the idea for television in the early 1990s, first collaborating with her (then) husband Dan Reed, and later with her former sister-in-law Maureen Reed and actress Nancy Harewood. The collaboration dissolved and Moore's research for the project was stored in a box in her attic. A decade later, Tucker Reed located the box that held Moore's earliest notes on and drafts of the Amber House story. Believing the concept well-suited for young adult literature, Tucker persuaded Moore to collaborate on a novel; Moore's daughter Larkin was later included in the collaboration, as well. The authors cite as inspiration the films Back to the Future, Jumanji, Labyrinth and The Shining, as well as an episode of the original Lost in Space television series, and Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel The Secret Garden. Publication and reception The book was published on October 1, 2012 by Scholastic's Arthur A. Levine Books imprint. Critical reception was positive. Kirkus Reviews praised the protagonist, saying \\"Move over Bella Swan, Sarah is a strong, admirable character who‚Äôd rather speak her mind than sulk and sigh over some hot guy.\\" In a second featured review issued by Kirkus, critic Leila Roy stated: \\"Amber House has a wonderful hook of an opening line ... [a]nd it's got a fantastic premise.\\" Booklist cited the \\"highly descriptive, lush prose\\" and \\"deft handling of family dynamics\\" as highlights. In starred reviews, both Publishers Weekly and the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books described the plot as \\"intricate\\" and \\"swift,\\" respectively. Amber House was a finalist for the 2014 Oregon Book Awards for Young Adult Literature, as well as the 2014 Dolly Gray Award for its realistic and positive portrayal of a character with autism. Amber House was a featured title on the Texas Library Association's 2014 TAYSHAS List, and was featured in the 2012 and 2013 Scholastic Book Fairs.

He was born in Clunes, Victoria, Australia, and died in Victoria, British Columbia. He was a dentist. Life and career Born in the goldfields town of Clunes in Victoria, Robbie MacDonald moved to Brisbane in 1881 with his mother and his stepfather, Justice A. B. Noel. After attending Brisbane Boys Grammar School MacDonald studied dentistry at the University of Pennsylvania, where he excelled. He was the first Queenslander to graduate as a doctor of dental surgery with honours. In cricket, MacDonald had a reputation as an imperturbable defensive batsman. The English player and writer C. B. Fry said of him in 1901: \\"he pays extreme attention to not getting out, and has no regard for the time it takes to make his runs. He is an excellent antidote to the modern tendency to try for high hitting. He never hits a ball, but just pushes and blocks, pushes and blocks. His skill, however, in defence is most remarkable: and I doubt whether there has ever been a more perfect player in his own particular line.\\" In a match for Leicestershire against Sussex in 1902 he batted for three and three-quarter hours for 33, in what an English newspaper called \\"a wonderfully patient innings\\". In 1902-03 he batted 375 minutes in the match to make 51 and 61 not out when Queensland lost narrowly to New South Wales.A. G. Moyes, Australian Cricket: A History, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1959, p. 67. His highest first- class score was 147 not out for Leicestershire against Derbyshire in 1901, when he added 142 for the fourth wicket with John King and then made an unbroken stand of 226 for the fifth wicket with Frederic Geeson. Leicestershire won by an innings. A week earlier he had made 127 against Sussex, batting for about six hours. His only first-class century for Queensland came on the state team's tour of New Zealand in 1896-97, when he made 114 against Hawke's Bay, adding 228 for the sixth wicket with Owen Cowley. Playing for Valley in the Brisbane senior competition in 1898-99, he made 812 runs in 13 innings, with an average of 203.00, as he was not out nine times. He served as secretary of the Queensland Cricket Association in 1894-95, and secretary of Leicestershire from 1922 to 1930. He also represented Australia on the Imperial Cricket Conference between the wars.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, p. 321. He was instrumental in the reconciliation of the Australian and English cricket authorities after the acrimonious Bodyline series between the two countries in 1932-33. Sensing that feeling in England in the 1933 season was turning against the bodyline tactics that had given England victory in the 1932-33 series, he advised the Australian board to maintain gentle but firm pressure on the English authorities to forswear such tactics during the forthcoming Australian tour of England in 1934.David Frith, Bodyline Autopsy, ABC Books, Sydney, 2002, pp. 364‚Äì75.

Sihathor may never have enjoyed an independent reign, possibly only ruling for a few months as a coregent with his brother Neferhotep I.

Two rock inscriptions from Philae and Sehel Island further mention Sihathor as a brother to Neferhotep I. According to Ryholt and Stephen Quirke, Sihathor is also attested as a king on a steatite cylinder seal, now in the Petrie Museum (UC1157), and a bead of unknown provenance, now in the Brooklyn Museum.Picture of the cylinder seal A few further seals mentioning a king's son Sihathor are known, but Ryholt concludes that they may correspond to another Sihathor. Finally, Vivian Davies points to the existence of a statue of Sihathor made after his death and where he is only given the title of \\"king's son\\".Vivian Davies: A Statue of the King's Son, Sahathor, from Thebes, in: Stationen Beitr√§ge zur Kulturgeschichte √Ñgyptens Rainer Stadelmann editor, Heike Guksch, Daniel Polz, pp. 177 - 179, Family Scarab seals of the \\"Royal seal bearer, divine father Haankhef\\", the father of Sihathor, and \\"Princess, royal daughter Kema\\", daughter of Neferhotep, niece of Sihathor.Flinders Petrie: Scarabs and cylinders with names (1917), available copyright-free here, pl. XVIII The family of Sihathor is known thanks to the rock inscriptions of Philae and Sehel made by his brother Neferhotep I. Sihathor's father is thus known to be Haankhef, his mother was Kemi and his brothers were Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV, the later of whom eventually succeeded him on the throne. Tomb The Egyptologist and archaeologist Josef W. Wegner of the University of Pennsylvania has led excavations of the tomb and funerary complex of Senusret III in Abydos as well as of the surrounding necropolis. This necropolis was found to comprise royal tombs dating to the Second Intermediate Period as well as from the earlier late Middle Kingdom. Two large tombs in particular, S9 and S10 are now believed to belong to Sihathor's pharaoh brothers, Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV. Indeed, evidences gathered from the neighbouring tombs reveal that a king Sobekhotep was buried in S10, who must be Sobekhotep IV given the size of the tomb, its general datation and location in Abydos. By extension, S9 is likely to belong to Neferhotep I. These attributions are crucial for locating Sihathor's tomb, as indeed Wegner has found an unfinished royal burial at the immediate north-east of S10, east of S9. According to him, its position suggest very strongly that it was intended for Neferhotep's chosen heir Sihathor. The burial seems to have been abandoned at the death of its intended owner, its massive granite sarcophagus reused at a later time, during the chaotic Second Intermediate Period.Josef W.

Poale Zion (also spelled Poalei Tziyon or Poaley Syjon, meaning \\"Workers of Zion\\") was a movement of Marxist‚ÄìZionist Jewish workers founded in various cities of Poland, Europe and the Russian Empire in about the turn of the 20th century after the Bund rejected Zionism in 1901.http://www.yivoarchives.org/inholocdex.php?p=collections/controlcard&id;=34182&q;=phttp://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/term/480,poale- zion/ Formation and early years=Ideology= The key features of the ideology of early Poale Zion were acceptance of the Marxist view of history with the addition of the role of nationalism, which Borochov believed could not be ignored as a factor in historical development. A Jewish proletariat would come into being in the Land of Israel, according to Poale Zion, and would then take part in the class struggle. These views were set out in Borochov's Our Platform, published in 1906. =Early parties and organisations= Poalei Zion members in Warsaw, Congress Poland, 1905.

In 1906 a formal Poale Zion party was formed in Poltava, Ukraine,Geoffrey Alderman, Modern British Jewry, Clarendon Press, 1998, p.175 under the leadership of Ber Borochov and Itzhak Ben-Zvi, and other groups were soon formed elsewhere in Europe. A French group was formed, under the leadership of Marc Jarblum, which was influential on the SFIO and its leader Leon Blum.June Edmunds The Left‚Äôs Views on Israel: From the establishment of the Jewish state to the intifada, LSE doctoral thesis, p.180 By 1907, the party had 25,000 members in Russia.P. Mendes Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance, Springer, 20 May 2014, p.134 =Global coordination= A World Union of Poale Zion was formed. The first World Congress took place in August 1907 in The Hague. Its second congress in 1909 in Krak√≥w emphasised practical socialist projects in Palestine, further congresses followed in Vienna (1911 and 1920) and Stockholm (1919). =Palestine= In Ottoman Palestine, Poale Zion founded the Hashomer guard organization that guarded settlements of the Yishuv, and took up the ideology of \\"conquest of labor\\" (Kibbush Ha'avoda) and \\"Hebrew labor\\" (Avoda Ivrit). The first formal congress of the \\"Jewish Social Democratic Workers' Party in the Land of Israel‚ÄìPoalei Tziyon\\" was held in early 1907. Poale Zion set up employment offices, kitchens and health services for members. These eventually evolved into the institutions of Labor Zionism in Israel. =UK during World War I= During World War I, Poale Zion was instrumental in recruiting members to the Jewish Legion. Martin Watts, The Jewish Legion and the First World War, Palgrave McMillian: Hampshire, 2004, pg. 155. Poale Zion was active in Britain during the war, under the leadership of J. Pomeranz and Morris Meyer, and influential on the British labour movement, including on the drafting (by Sidney Webb and Arthur Henderson) of the Labour Party's War Aims Memorandum, recognising the 'right of return' of Jews to Palestine, a document which preceded the Balfour Declaration by three months.Joseph Gorny, The British Labour Movement and Zionism: 1917‚Äì1948. London: Frank Cass, ch.1 Factions and activity after World War I=Factions, 1920 split and aftermath= Poale Zion was torn between Left and Right factions in 1919‚Äì1920, which formally split at the Poale Zion fifth world congress in Vienna in 1920, following a similar division that occurred in the Second International. The right wing was less Marxist and more nationalist, and favoured a more moderate socialist program and supported the International Working Union of Socialist Parties to continue the work of the Second International, essentially becoming a social democratic party. The left wing faction did not consider the Second International radical enough and some accused its members of betraying Borochov's revolutionary principles (although Borochov had begun to modify his ideology as early as 1914, and publicly identified as a social democrat the year before his death). Poale Zion Left, which supported the Bolshevik revolution, continued to be sympathetic to Marxism and Communism, and attended the second and third congresses of the Communist International in a consultative capacity.P. Mendes, Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance, Springer, 20 May 2014, p.100 They lobbied for membership, but their attempts were unsuccessful, as the internationalist communist movement under Lenin and Trotsky was opposed to Zionist nationalism. The Comintern advised individual members of Left Poale Zion to join their national Communist parties as individuals; at their 1922 Danzig conference, these terms were rejected by the party. The Comintern declared it an enemy of the workers' movement. Poale Zion Left opposed the decision by Poale Zion to rejoin the World Zionist Organization, viewing it as essentially bourgeois in character, and viewed the Histadrut as reformist and non-socialist. Aside from differing attitudes towards Zionism and Stalinism, the two wings of Poale Zion parted ways over Yiddish and Yiddish culture. The Left was more supportive of the latter, similar to the members of the Jewish Bund, while the Right bloc identified strongly with the emerging modern Hebrew movement in the early 20th century. =Palestine= In Palestine, the major leaders of Poale Zion since their immigration in 1906 and 1907 had been David Ben-Gurion, who joined a local Poalei Tziyon group in 1904 as a student at the University of Warsaw, and Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, a close friend of Borochov's and early member of the Poltava group. After the split the two Benim (\\"the Bens\\") continued to control and direct Poale Zion Right in Palestine. The party in Palestine split into right and left wings at its February 1919 conference. In October 1919, a faction of the Left Poale Zion founded Mifleget Poalim Sozialistiim (Socialist Workers Party) which became the Jewish Communist Party in 1921, split in 1922 over the Zionist issues, with one faction taking the name Palestine Communist Party and the more anti-Zionist faction becoming the Communist Party of Palestine. The former retained its links to Poale Zion Left. These two factions reunited as the Palestine Communist Party in 1923 and become an official section of the Communist International. Another faction of Poale Zion Left, aligned with the kibbutz movement Hashomer Hatzair, founded in Europe in 1919, became the Mapam party. Poale Zion Right, under Ben Gurion's leadership, formed Ahdut HaAvoda in March 1919. In January 1930 it merged with another party to become Mapai, predecessor of the modern Israeli Labor Party. =Bolshevik Revolution and USSR= In Russia, the Poale Zion Left participated in the Bolshevik Revolution and organized a brigade of Poale Zion activists nicknamed the \\"Borochov Brigade\\" to fight in the Red Army. The party remained legal until 1928 when it was liquidated by the NKVD. Most other Zionist organizations had been closed down in 1919, but Poale Zion Left remained untouched because it was recognized as a Communist party. In 1919, the Communists of Poale Zion Left split to form the Jewish Communist Party which ultimately joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, leading to a sharp loss of membership in Russia. While the Bund was forcibly disbanded in 1921, Poale Zion and Hechalutz were allowed to operate freely in the Soviet Union until 1928.P. Mendes, Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance, Springer, 20 May 2014 =Poland= In Poland, for a brief period following the war, both factions of Poale Zion were reported as legal and functioning political parties. The Polish Left party was the largest Left Poale Zion party in the world. It worked closely with the Bund in developing Yiddish schools in Poland and supporting secular Yiddish culture, although they had political differences (e.g., the Bund was more supportive of the Polish Socialist Party than LPZ).P. Mendes, Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance, Springer, 20 May 2014, p.138 As part of the large-scale ban on Jewish political parties in post-war Poland by the Communist leadership, both Poale Zion groups were disbanded in February 1950. =Austria= In Austria, the left faction was led by Michael Kohn-Eber, who joined the Austrian Communist Party in 1938. The right faction also remained active until 1938. =USA= After the First World War, the American party was led by veteran socialist Zionist thinker Nachman Syrkin. In America, the right faction was dominant, and initiated the National Labor Committee for Palestine, raising money for the Histadrut. =UK= Poale Zion in Britain formally affiliated to the British Labour Party in 1920. =Worldwide= Globally, Poale Zion, under the leadership of Shlomo Kaplansky was involved in the 1921 formation of the centrist International Working Union of Socialist Parties,Joseph Gorny, The British Labour Movement and Zionism: 1917‚Äì1948. London: Frank Cass then between 1923 and 1930 the World Union of Poalei Zion (i.e., the PZ right) joined the Labour and Socialist International (as its Palestine section).Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter- internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 314 As of 1928, it claimed to have 22,500 members in branches around the world; 5,000 in Poland and the United States, 4,000 in Palestine, 3,000 in Russia, 1,000 in Lithuania, Romania, Argentina and the United Kingdom, 500 in Latvia and another 1,000 scattered across countries such as Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, France and Brazil. The general secretary of the World Union of Poalei Zion at the time was Berl Locker. The World Union had a women's wing, the Women's Organization for the Pioneer Women in Palestine.Labour and Socialist International. Kongress-Protokolle der Sozialistischen Arbeiter-Internationale - B. 3.1 Br√ºssel 1928. Glash√ºtten im Taunus: D. Auvermann, 1974. p. IV. 100 World Union of Zionists-Socialists (1932) In 1932, Poale Zion's world federation merged with Hitahdut Olamit, the World Union of Hapoel Hatzair and Zeirei Zion (which had been formed in 1920), to create Ihud Olami, the World Union of Zionists-Socialists.Rafael Medoff, Chaim I. Waxman, Historical Dictionary of Zionism, Routledge, 5 Sep 2013 In this period, several well-known Zionist leaders and politicians were active in Poale Zion, including Ben-Gurion, Ben-Zvi, kibbutz movement leader Yitzhak Tabenkin, Jewish Agency Executive member Shlomo Kaplansky, and future Israeli politicians Moshe Sharett and Dov Hoz. The Holocaust The Holocaust-era Jewish resistance group ≈ªOB was formed from a coalition including Hashomer Hatzair, Dror, Bnei Akiva, the Jewish Bund, various Jewish Communist groups, and both factions of Poale Zion. Poale Zion was also active in the Anti-Fascist Bloc. Several notable Jewish resistance fighters during the Holocaust, particularly those involved in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, were members of Poale Zion. They include: * Adolf Berman, Warsaw ≈ªOB fighter; Secretary of Zegota (Poale Zion Left) * Hersz Berlinski, member of Warsaw ≈ªOB Command (Poale Zion Left) * Yochanan Morgenstern, member of Warsaw ≈ªOB Command (Poale Zion Right) * Emanuel Ringelblum, member of Warsaw ≈ªOB; chronicler of the Warsaw Ghetto (Poale Zion Left) Legacy=Palestine= After World War I, David Ben-Gurion integrated most of Poale Zion Right in Palestine into his Ahdut HaAvoda party, which became Mapai by the 1930s. The Poale Zion Left merged with the kibbutz-based Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party of Palestine and the urban-based Socialist League of Palestine to form Mapam in 1948, which in the 1990s merged with two smaller parties, Ratz and Shinui, to form Meretz. In 1946, a split in Mapai led to the creation of another small party, Ahdut HaAvoda - Zion Workers, which united with Mapam in 1948. In 1954, a small group of Mapam dissidents left the party, again assuming the Ahdut HaAvoda - Zion Workers name. That party eventually became part of the Alignment in a 1965 merger with Mapai (and later included Rafi and Mapam). In 1992, the Alignment became the Israeli Labour Party. =Youth movements= Several youth movements have emerged out of Poale Zion: the Marxist Hashomer Hatzair (the largest, with 70,000 members on the eve of the Holocaust), the socialist Habonim Dror, the Left Poale Zion's Yugent, and Zeire Zion.P. Mendes Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance, Springer, 20 May 2014, p.218 =North America= In North America, Poale Zion founded the HeHalutz movement, the Farband and Habonim Dror, and later the Labor Zionist Organization of America, which merged with other groups into the Labor Zionist Alliance, which rebranded itself in 2007 as Ameinu. US Poale Zion published a Yiddish newspaper, the Yidisher Kempfer, and an English journal, Jewish Frontier, edited by Hayim Greenberg and Marie Syrkin.David Bridger, Samuel Wolk, The New Jewish Encyclopedia, Behrman House, Inc, 1976, p.381 =UK= In Britain, Poale Zion rebranded itself in 2004 as the Jewish Labour Movement. Its original affiliate status with the Labour Party in 1920 was as The Jewish Socialist Labour Party (Poale Zion).Minutes of Labour Party's NEC, 5 February 1920 =Worldwide= Internationally, the Poale Zion right is represented within the World Zionist Organization by the World Labour Zionist Movement; the group \\"to the left\\" of the WLZM within the WZO is Mapam's successor, the World Union of Meretz. Meretz succeeded Mapam as a member of the Socialist International and, since 2013, is also a member of the Progressive Alliance.

He is the founder and chairman of the Liberty for All Super PAC. Early life Ramsey grew up in rural East Texas near the Louisiana border. His family owns a timber farm and community bank near San Augustine, Texas, as well as other agricultural interests in central and west Texas. His parents were both social workers who worked for Child Protective Services. His grandfather, Justin Robert Howard, an American officer in World War II, banker, rancher, and antique firearm collector, mentored Ramsey in business and finance. Howard died on Thanksgiving 2010, leaving an inheritance to Ramsey and his two siblings. Ramsey's mother, Susan, died from breast cancer when he was 12. Ramsey credits his charitable work to the inspiration from his mother who publicly mentions her dedication to raising and empowering disadvantaged children to be next generation leaders. =College= Ramsey graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University with degrees in business economics and finance. His grandfather was a member of the Stephen F. Austin State University Alumni Association Hall of Fame. While in college, Ramsey served as the energy sector advisor for the Mast Student Investment Roundtable, which exists to provide finance students with experience in managing equity portfolios. In 2011, he attended a study-abroad program at Oxford University in England, where he advocated libertarianism and the exit of Great Britain from the European Union. Ramsey became a libertarian while in college and worked for Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign in Iowa and Maine. Career=Liberty for All= Ramsey founded the Liberty for All Super PAC in 2012 with an initial investment of $890,000 of his own money. According to Federal Election Commission records, Liberty for All became official on March 5, 2012. The PAC was founded with the goal of supporting libertarian-minded, independent-leaning candidates who could win in the two major parties, viewing the RNC and DNC as models. During the May 2012 Kentucky Republican primary election, Liberty for All spent over $700,000 in independent expenditures for congressional candidate Thomas Massie. The group also supported Republican Congressmen Justin Amash, Kerry Bentivolio and Jeff Flake. Liberty for All reportedly spent a total of $3.1 million in the 2012 cycle, with over 90 percent of backed candidates winning. * * In addition to his activity on the national level, Ramsey is politically active around the Austin and Travis County area. In 2012, Ramsey supported Michael Cargill for Travis County Constable. Cargill is a homosexual African-American gun store owner and prominent libertarian activist in Austin. The race marked Ramsey's first attempt to elect a libertarian leaning candidate in the Democratic party. The race also became prominent for Ramsey's role in labeling Cargill's opponent Adan Ballesteros as the \\"Cocaine Constable\\". The attacks against Ballesteros were based on the findings of a 15-year-old investigation by the Department of Public Safety that said Ballesteros had peddled drugs into the United States from Mexico. In 2012, Ramsey donated $10,000 to Austinites for Geographic Representation (AGR). AGR was the main proponent of Proposition 3, which established single member districts for the Austin city council elections. Ramsey was also a financial backer and fundraising bundler for the 2012 marijuana legalization efforts in Colorado. Ramsey has since been involved in marijuana decriminalization efforts in states such as Maine and Washington. For the 2014 elections, Ramsey invested in state legislative races in early presidential primary states hoping to start the careers of libertarian politicians who could run for higher offices in the future. In 2016, Ramsey and Liberty for All deployed resources to defeat a food tax in Fairfax county Virginia. Ramsey and Benefico at a 2014 Never Hungover launch party held at Phil Maloof's luxury suite atop the Palms Casino and resort in Las Vegas. =Other endeavors= Ramsey is an investor in the hangover preventative Never Hungover. According to Never Hungover CEO Parrish Whitaker, Ramsey contributed to the overall vision of the company. Ramsey and the Harrises inside The Liberty Bell In early 2013, Ramsey partnered with Grant and Kati Harris to open a wine bar named the Liberty Bell in Nacogdoches, Texas. The Liberty Bell has a sandwich named after Nacogdoches native and professional soccer player Clint Dempsey, the \\"Dempsey FC.\\" Ramsey is the founder and CEO of the early-stage tech, SAAS, and consumer packaged-good investment firm Seedcess Investment Group. He is also involved with Praxis, an alternative higher education company that teaches entrepreneurship through real-world career experience. Additionally, he co-manages JPW Equity, an investment fund that focuses its efforts on commercial storage and US-based nutritional supplement manufacturing. Ramsey is a critic of central banking systems and was an early investor in Bitcoin. In addition to trading activity, Ramsey has invested in several cryptocurrency mining operations. Ramsey is an advanced tennis player and early investor in MyTennislessons.com, the largest online marketplace for tennis instruction. Personal Ramsey has an organic garden at his residence in Austin. Each year upon harvest, Ramsey opens his home to the public for an educational seminar and charitable food drive that is hosted by the Center For Natural Living. Ramsey is a devout Christian and regularly speaks at conferences, religious institutions, and politically affiliated organizations around the country about libertarianism. Frederic Bastiat, Roger Federer, Ludwig Von Mises, Samuel B. Fuller, George Strait, Milton Friedman, Leo Tolstoy, Ross Perot, Roger Staubach, and Jerry Jones are among Ramsey's influences.. Ramsey is the co-founder of returned.org, which is a non profit organization which focuses its efforts on re-uniting stolen and sex trafficked children to their families through scientific DNA testing. The venture is a partnership with world renowned Spanish professor and scientist, Dr Jose Lorente.

Tel Aviv, 1989, page 13. Julian birth date was June 21, 1881. ‚Äì December 17, 1917) was a Marxist Zionist and one of the founders of the Labor Zionist movement. He was also a pioneer in the study of the Yiddish language.  Biography  Dov Ber Borochov was born in the town of Zolotonosha, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine), and grew up in nearby Poltava. His mother and father were both teachers. As an adult he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party but was expelled when he formed a Zionist Socialist Workers Union in Yekaterinoslav. After being arrested by the Russian authorities he left for the United States. Subsequently, he helped form the Poale Zion party and devoted his life to promoting the party in Russia, Europe, and America. When the Russian social democrats came to power, Borochov returned to Russia in March 1917 to lead the Poale Zion. He became ill and died in Kiev of pneumonia in December 1917.  Ideology  Igrot Ber Borochov (Ber Borochov letters) Borochov became highly influential in the Zionist movement because he explained nationalism in general, and Jewish Nationalism in particular in terms of Marxist class struggle and dialectical materialism. He saw himself as a Marxist, and laid out his philosophy in his first major work published in 1905, The National Question and the Class Struggle. Borochov predicted that nationalist forces would be more important in determining events than economic and class considerations, especially as concerned the Jews. Borochov argued that the class structure of European Jews resembled an inverted class pyramid where few Jews occupied the productive layers of society as workers. The Jews would migrate from country to country as they were forced out of their chosen professions by a \\"stychic process\\" which would ultimately force migration to Palestine, where they would form a proletarian basis in order to carry out Marxist class struggle. In November 1905 he joined, and soon became a leader, of the Poalei Zion (Workers of Zion) movement. He became an avid supporter of a Palestine-based Zionism following the Sixth Zionist Congress, during which the question of Uganda as a possible temporary refuge for the Jews was debated. A key part of Borochovian ideology was that the Arab and Jewish working classes had a common proletarian interest and would participate in the class struggle together once Jews had returned to Palestine. In his last recorded speech, he said: > Many point out the obstacles which we encounter in our colonization work. > Some say that the Turkish law hinders our work, others contend that > Palestine is insignificantly small, and still others charge us with the > odious crime of wishing to oppress and expel the Arabs from Palestine... > When the waste lands are prepared for colonization, when modern technique is > introduced, and when the other obstacles are removed, there will be > sufficient land to accommodate both the Jews and the Arabs. Normal relations > between the Jews and Arabs will and must prevail.  Influence  Letter from Ber Borochov to Shmuel Niger, 1913 Borochov, along with Nachman Syrkin is considered a father of socialist Zionism. Borochov's ideas were influential in convincing Jewish youth from Europe to move to Palestine. However, Borochov's theories remained most influential in Eastern Europe, where they formed the basis of the Left Poale Zionist movement which was active in Poland during the interwar years. Indeed, Borochov's vision of class struggle in Palestine was widely viewed as untenable by the 1910s, with Jewish migrants to Palestine struggling to establish an economic foothold and with interclass cooperation seemingly necessary, and his theories dimmed in popularity there. Borochov, for years an advocate for a doctrinaire Marxist Zionism, himself seemed to repudiate his former vision of class struggle in Palestine in speeches towards the end of his life. Borochov insisted that he was a Social Democrat, but Borochov's Left Poale Zion followers continued to vigorously advocate class struggle both in Palestine and eastern Europe, supporting the February Revolution of 1917.  Return to Russia  Borochov returned to Russia in August 1917 and attended the Third All-Russian Poale Zion party congress to argue for socialist settlement in Palestine. The Poale Zion conference selected Borochov as a delegate to the Conference of Nationalities, where he issued a paper describing Russia as a decentralized socialist commonwealth of nations (‚ÄúRossiia kak sodruzhestvo narodov‚Äù).  Death and split of Russian Poale Zion  Borochov caught pneumonia while on a speaking tour and died in Kiev on December 17, 1917 at the age of 36. The Russian Poale Zion movement split into two factions over attitudes towards the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. The Poale Zion Left formed a \\"Borochov Brigade\\" to join the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and ultimately split from the main Poale Zion party to become the Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion) in 1919 and would go on to join the Jewish section (Yevsektsiya) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union while the social democratic Right Poale Zion was banned.  Re-interment  Ber Borochov grave in the Kvutzat Kinneret Cemetery After his death in December 1917 Borochov was buried in the Lukyanovka Jewish Cemetery in Babi Yar, near Kiev. In 1954 a process to reinter the remains of notable leaders of Russian Zionism to Israel was initiated by the Association of Russian Immigrants to Israel. With the intervention of Israel's second President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who had been a friend of Borochov, his remains were finally brought to Israel and buried in the Kinneret cemetery, alongside many other socialist pioneers, on April 3, 1963. Ber Borochov statue at Kibbutz Mishmar Hanegev  International Poale Zion  The international Poale Zion movement also split into left and right factions, which have evolved into the modern Israeli political parties of the leftist Mapam (later Meretz) and the non-Marxist party of Ben Gurion, Mapai, the precursor of the Israeli Labor Party respectively. The European branch of the Left Poale Zion movement was effectively destroyed by the early 1950s; many of its members were killed by the Nazis during World War II, and the surviving activists were persecuted and ultimately outlawed under the various post-war Communist regimes.  Yiddish  While most Zionists regarded Yiddish as a derivative language characteristic of the Jewish Diaspora and to be abandoned by the Jewish people in favor of Hebrew, Borochov was a committed Yiddishist and Yiddish philologist and wrote extensively on the importance of the language. He wrote a short dictionary of Old Yiddish, and was a regular contributor to the Yiddish daily Di Warheit. Although he only began to study Yiddish at the age of 26, he is considered the founder of modern Yiddish studies. Borochov's contributions were recognized in various ways by the early Jewish settlement in Palestine. For example, the first workers' neighborhood in the country, in what later became the city of Giv'atayim, was named after Borochov.

Tziyonut sotzyalistit; translit. Tnu'at ha'avoda, i.e. The labor movement) is the left-wing of the Zionist movement. For many years, it was the most significant tendency among Zionists and Zionist organizations. It saw itself as the Zionist sector of the historic Jewish labor movements of Eastern and Central Europe, eventually developing local units in most countries with sizable Jewish populations. Unlike the \\"political Zionist\\" tendency founded by Theodor Herzl and advocated by Chaim Weizmann, Labor Zionists did not believe that a Jewish state would be created simply by appealing to the international community or to a powerful nation such as Britain, Germany or the Ottoman Empire. Rather, Labor Zionists believed that a Jewish state could only be created through the efforts of the Jewish working class settling in the Land of Israel and constructing a state through the creation of a progressive Jewish society with rural kibbutzim and moshavim and an urban Jewish proletariat. Labor Zionism grew in size and influence and eclipsed \\"political Zionism\\" by the 1930s both internationally and within the British Mandate of Palestine where Labor Zionists predominated among many of the institutions of the pre-independence Jewish community Yishuv, particularly the trade union federation known as the Histadrut. The Haganah, the largest Zionist paramilitary defense force, was a Labor Zionist institution and was used on occasion (such as during the Hunting Season) against right-wing political opponents or to assist the British Administration in capturing rival Jewish militants. Labor Zionists played a leading role in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and Labor Zionists were predominant among the leadership of the Israeli military for decades after the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. Major theoreticians of the Labor Zionist movement included Moses Hess, Nachman Syrkin, Ber Borochov, and Aaron David Gordon and leading figures in the movement included David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, and Berl Katznelson.  Ideology  Moses Hess's 1862 work Rome and Jerusalem. The Last National Question argued for the Jews to settle in Palestine as a means of settling the national question. Hess proposed a socialist state in which the Jews would become agrarianized through a process of \\"redemption of the soil\\" that would transform the Jewish community into a true nation in that Jews would occupy the productive layers of society rather than being an intermediary non-productive merchant class, which is how he perceived European Jews. Ber Borochov, continuing from the work of Moses Hess, proposed the creation of a socialist society that would correct the \\"inverted pyramid\\" of Jewish society. Borochov believed that Jews were forced out of ordinary occupations by Gentile hostility and competition, using this dynamic to explain Jewish professionals' relative predominance, rather than workers. He argued that Jewish society would not be healthy until the inverted pyramid was righted, and a substantial number of Jews became workers and peasants again. This, he held, could only be accomplished by Jews in their own country. Another Zionist thinker, A. D. Gordon, was influenced by the v√∂lkisch ideas of European romantic nationalism, and proposed establishing a society of Jewish peasants. Gordon made a religion of work. These two figures (Gordon and Borochov), and others like them, motivated the establishment of the first Jewish collective settlement, or kibbutz, Degania, on the southern shore of the Sea of Galilee, in 1909 (the same year that the city of Tel Aviv was established). Deganiah, and many other kibbutzim that were soon to follow, attempted to realize these thinkers' vision by creating communal villages, where newly arrived European Jews would be taught agriculture and other manual skills. Joseph Trumpeldor is also considered to be one of the early icons of the Labor Zionist movement in Palestine. When discussing what it is to be a Jewish pioneer, Trumpeldor stated > What is a pioneer? Is he a worker only? No! The definition includes much > more. The pioneers should be workers but that is not all. We shall need > people who will be \\"everything\\" ‚Äì everything that the land of Israel needs. > A worker has his labor interests, a soldier his esprit de corps, a doctor > and an engineer, their special inclinations. A generation of iron-men; iron > from which you can forge everything the national machinery needs. You need a > wheel? Here I am. A nail, a screw, a block? ‚Äì here take me. You need a man > to till the soil? ‚Äì I‚Äôm ready. A soldier? I am here. Policeman, doctor, > lawyer, artist, teacher, water carrier? Here I am. I have no form. I have no > psychology. I have no personal feeling, no name. I am a servant of Zion. > Ready to do everything, not bound to do anything. I have only one aim ‚Äì > creation. Trumpeldor, a Socialist Zionist, gave his life in 1920 defending the community of Tel Hai in the Upper Galilee. He became a symbol of Jewish self-defense and his reputed last words, \\"Never mind, it is good to die for our country\\" (En davar, tov lamut be'ad artzenu ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ì◊ë◊®, ◊ò◊ï◊ë ◊ú◊û◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊¢◊ì ◊ê◊®◊¶◊†◊ï), became famous in the pre-state Zionist movement and in Israel during the 1950s and 1960s. Trumpeldor's heroic death made him not only a martyr for Zionists Left but also for the Revisionist Zionist movement who named its youth movement Betar (an acronym for \\"Covenant of Joseph Trumpeldor\\") after the fallen hero. Albert Einstein was a prominent supporter of both Labor Zionism and efforts to encourage Jewish‚ÄìArab cooperation. Fred Jerome in his Einstein on Israel and Zionism: His Provocative Ideas About the Middle East argues that Einstein was a Cultural Zionist who supported the idea of a Jewish homeland but opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine \\"with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power.\\" Instead, he preferred a bi-national state with \\"continuously functioning, mixed, administrative, economic, and social organizations.\\"\\"Einstein and Complex Analyses of Zionism\\" Jewish Daily Forward, July 24, 2009 However Ami Isseroff in his article Was Einstein a Zionist argues that Einstein was not opposed to the state of Israel given that Einstein declared it \\"the fulfillment of our dreams.\\" Perceiving its vulnerability after independence, he again set aside his pacifism in the name of human preservation, when president Harry Truman recognized Israel in May 1948.\\"Was Einstein a Zionist\\" Zionism and Israel Information Center In the November 1948 presidential election Einstein supported former vice-president Henry A. Wallace‚Äôs Progressive Party, which advocated a pro-Soviet foreign policy ‚Äì but which also at the time (like the USSR) strongly supported the new state of Israel. Wallace went down to defeat, winning no states.\\"Albert Einstein was a political activist\\" Jewish Tribune,14 April 2010  Parties  Initially two labor parties were founded by immigrants to Palestine of the Second Aliyah (1904‚Äì1914): the pacifist and anti-militarist Hapo'el Hatza'ir (Young Worker) party and the Marxist Poale Zion party, with Poale Zion roots. The Poale Zion Party had a left wing and a right wing. In 1919 the right wing, including Ben-Gurion and anti-Marxist non-party people, founded Ahdut HaAvoda. In 1930 Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapo'el Hatza'ir fused into the Mapai party, which included all of mainstream Labor Zionism. Until the 1960s these parties were dominated by members of the Second Aliyah.Z. Sternhell, 1998, The Founding Myths of Israel, The Left Poale Zion party ultimately merged with the kibbutz-based Hashomer Hatzair, the urban Socialist League and several smaller left-wing groups to become the Mapam party, which in turn later joined with Shulamit Aloni‚Äôs Ratz to create Meretz. The Mapai party later became the Israeli Labor Party, which for a number of years was linked with Mapam in the Alignment. These two parties were initially the two largest parties in the Yishuv and in the first Knesset, whilst Mapai and its predecessors dominated Israeli politics both in the pre-independence Yishuv and for the first three decades of Israel's independence, until the late 1970s.  Decline and transformation  Already in the 1920s the Labor movement disregarded its socialist roots and concentrated on building the nation by constructive action. According to Tzahor its leaders did not \\"abandon fundamental ideological principles\\". However, according to Ze'ev Sternhell in his book The Founding Myths of Israel, the labor leaders had already abandoned socialist principles by 1920 and only used them as \\"mobilizing myths\\". Following the 1967 Six-Day War several prominent Labor Zionists created the Movement for Greater Israel which subscribed to an ideology of Greater Israel and called upon the Israeli government to keep and populate all areas captured in the war. Among the public figures in this movement associated with left-wing nationalism were Rachel Yanait Ben-Zvi, Yitzhak Tabenkin, Icchak Cukierman, Zivia Lubetkin, Eliezer Livneh, Moshe Shamir, Zev Vilnay, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Isser Harel, Dan Tolkovsky, and Avraham Yoffe. In the 1969 Knesset elections it ran as the \\"List for the Land of Israel\\", but failed to cross the electoral threshold. Prior to the 1973 elections, it joined the Likud and won 39 seats. In 1976 it merged with the National List and the Independent Centre (a breakaway from the Free Centre) to form La'am, which remained a faction within Likud until its merger into the Herut faction in 1984. Other prominent Labor Zionists, especially those who came to dominate the Israeli Labor Party, became strong advocates for relinquishing the territory won during the Six-Day War. By the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, this became the central policy of the Labor Party under Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. What distinguishes Labor Zionism from other Zionist streams today is not economic policy, an analysis of capitalism, or any class analysis or orientation, but its attitude towards the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process with modern Labor Zionists tending to support the Israeli peace camp to varying degrees. This orientation towards Israel's borders and foreign policy has dominated Labor Zionist institutions in recent decades to the extent that socialist Zionists who support a Greater Israel ideology are forced to seek political expression elsewhere. In Israel the Labor Party has followed the general path of other governing social-democratic parties such as the British Labour Party and is now fully oriented towards supporting a capitalist model, and some factions support centrist policies akin to the Third Way, though in the 2010s it has returned to a more social-democratic outlook under the leadership of Shelly Yachimovich and Amir Peretz. The Israeli Labor Party and its predecessors have ironically been associated within Israeli society as representing the country's ruling class and political elite whereas working-class Israelis have traditionally voted for the Likud since the Begin Revolution of 1977.  Labor Zionism today  Labor Zionism manifests itself today in both adult and youth organizations. Among adults, the World Labor Zionist Movement, based in Jerusalem, has affiliates in countries around the world, such as Ameinu in the United States and Australia, Associa√ß√£o Mosh√© Sharett in Brazil and the Jewish Labour Movement in the United Kingdom. Youth and students are served through Zionist youth movements such as Habonim Dror, Hashomer Hatzair and college-age campus activist groups such as the Union of Progressive Zionists of the U.S. and Canada. In Israel, Labor Zionism has become nearly synonymous with the Israeli peace camp. Usually Labor Zionist political and educational institutions activists are also advocates of a two-state solution, who do not necessarily adhere to socialist economic views.

He was the leader of Hashomer Hatzair, Kibbutz Artzi and Mapam, and a member of the Knesset. Biography Meyer Wald (later Ya'ari) was born in Ka≈Ñczuga in the Galicia area of Austria-Hungary in 1897. At the break of World War I his family moved to Vienna. At the age of 17 he volunteered to the Austrian Army and served as an officer until the end of the war. He studied at the Agricultural Academy and at the University of Vienna. In 1919 he co-founded and co-led the Viennese Hashomer Hatzair. In 1920, he made aliyah to Palestine. He worked at the Kinneret moshava, and in the Gdud HaAvoda group, paving roads from Tiberias to Tzemah and to Tabgha. His grandson, Yedidya Ya'ari, is a retired Israel Defense Forces General. Zionist activism Ya'ari and his followers Ya'ari was one of the founders of Bitania, the first collective settlement of Hashomer Hatzair. Lessons from an exotic Zionist commune, Haaretz He was among the founders of the Histadrut workers' syndicate. Since 1924 he served as Secretary of the world Hashomer Hatzair.Yaari Meir The Labour Movement In 1927, he founded Kibbutz Artzi, was elected its secretary and took part in drafting its principles. In 1929, he was among the founders of kibbutz Merhavia, where he lived until he died. Political career In 1948, he co-founded Mapam political party as its leader, and functioned as its general secretary until 1973. He was a Mapam MK in the first through seventh Knessets, from 1949 to 1973. In the first Knesset he was member of the Knesset committee, and in the fifth through seventh Knessets he was member of Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. His movement co-leader and almost equal colleague was Yaakov Hazan. For many years, they led Hashomer Hatzair and Mapam together. Despite holding the top two positions in Mapam‚Äôs list, they made a joint decision not to become ministers but rather occupy themselves in the movement‚Äôs ideological and educational activities. To his honor, the Association for Progressive Education in Honor of Meir Ya'ari (YAARI) was founded. Over the past decades YAARI envisioned, designed and implemented many peace-building projects in the region and especially in Cyprus. YAARI has also implemented a large-scale EC supported project known as Act Beyond Borders, which promoted reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians through education. Views and opinions As leader and ideologist of Hashomer Hatzair, he sought to turn it from a scout-like youth movement promoting abstract socialist-humanist ideas to a political settlement movement that integrates Zionism and Marxism. He protested David Ben-Gurion's activism and Mapai's moderate socialism. He regarded highly the achievements of Revolutionary Socialism in the Soviet Union, although he criticized its attitude towards Zionism. In the 1940s he opposed the Biltmore Program and supported the one-state solution. During Israel's early years, he objected his party‚Äôs coalition membership and was an outspoken critic of the government‚Äôs western orientation, the nationality conception, the Reparations Agreement and the martial law. At first, he supported the Soviet Union and tried, along with Moshe Sneh, to introduce Hashomer Hatzair‚Äôs idea in Mapam. The exposure of Stalin's wrongdoings caused a schism in the Marxist orientation, resulting in the expulsion of Moshe Sneh's men from the party in 1953. Gradually, admiration of the Soviet Union lessened and inclination to cooperate with Mapai increased, and in 1955 Mapam indeed joined Mapai in the coalition. After the Six-Day War he expressed a relatively hawkish stand by opposing immediate withdrawal from the occupied territories. In 1969 he supported Mapam's alliance with Mapai as part of the Alignment (In 1984, he would support staying in the Alignment until the formation of the national unity government in 1984).

Labour Unity) was the name used by a series of political parties. Ahdut HaAvoda in its first incarnation was led by David Ben-Gurion. It was first established during the period of British Mandate and later became part of the Israeli political establishment. It was one of the forerunners of the modern-day Israeli Labor Party. History=Ahdut HaAvoda= The original Ahdut HaAvoda party was founded in Palestine in March 1919, while under British military administration, after a split in the Poale Zion party, which had established a branch in Ottoman Syria in 1906. Ahdut HaAvoda was led by David Ben-Gurion, who had been a member of the pre-war group. The root of the division was a conflict between membership of the Communist International and participation in the bourgeois Zionist Organisation (ZO). The membership of the more radical anti-ZO faction tended to come from among the newer Yiddish-speaking immigrants. The speaking of Yiddish became another area of disagreement with Ahdut HaAvoda having a Hebrew-only policy.Lokman, Zachary. Comrades and Enemies: Arab and Jewish Workers in Palestine 1906‚Äì1948. University of California Press. 1996. . Pages 59, 67. \\"Those attempting to speak in Yiddish ... were frequently shouted down at public meetings\\" The following year, 1920, at a conference in June, the Ahdut HaAvoda decided to establish a military organisation, the Haganah, to replace the existing Hashomer militias.Peri, Yoram. Between Battles and Ballots: Israeli Military in Politics. Cambridge University Press. 1983. . Page 26. Also in 1920, Ahdut HaAvoda and the non-Marxist Hapoel Hatzair cooperated to set up the \\"General Organization of Hebrew Workers\\"‚Äîthe Histadrut. In November delegates were elected by 4,500 members of the various labor groups and the first congress was held in Haifa, December 1920. Ahdut HaAvoda did not have an overall majority, but with the help of Hapoel Hatzair, they dominated proceedings. Their objective was the building of a separate Jewish workers economy in Greater Israel. Ben-Gurion was living in New York at the time, but returned in 1921 to be elected the first Secretary of the Histradrut.Lokman. Page 65. \\"out of a Jewish population of 80,000\\"Peri. Page 29.

At the third Ahdut HaAvoda congress in 1924 at Ein Harod, Ben-Gurion defeated proposals put forward by Shlomo Kaplansky that a parliament be set up in Mandate Palestine. The issue had arisen due to the British Colonial Office having presented plans for the setting up of a Legislative Council.Lokman. Pages 77, 78. Other important members of the first Ahdut HaAvoda were Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, and Berl Katznelson. Cooperation between Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair led them to merge in 1930 to form the \\"Party of the Workers of the Land of Israel\\"‚ÄîMapai, which was to become the dominant force in Zionist politics until the 1960s.Peri.

Others with close ties were David Elazar, Yitzhak Hofi, Avraham Adan and Yitzhak Rabin. =Ahdut HaAvoda Poale Zion Movement= In 1946 the Ahdut HaAvoda Movement merged with Poale Zion Left to form the Ahdut HaAvoda Poale Zion Movement (, HaTnu'a LeAhdut HaAvoda Poale Zion). Two years later the party merged with the Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party to form Mapam. Most senior Haganah commanders were Mapam members, including the head of the National Command Israel Galili who was one of Mapam's leaders. The Palmach was also dominated by Mapam with its commanding officer, Yigal Allon, and five brigade commanders being members.Peri, page 47. With the creation of Israel's national army this led to conflict with Ben Gurion. In 1953, after a series of confrontations, two of the four Area Command commanders and six of the twelve brigade commanders resigned. Those members of Mapam who remained, Yitzhak Rabin, Haim Bar-Lev and David Elazar, had to endure several years in staff or training post before resuming their careers.Peri, page 62. =Ahdut HaAvoda ‚Äì Poale Zion= On 23 August 1954 Moshe Aram, Yisrael Bar-Yehuda, Yitzhak Ben-Aharon and Aharon Zisling broke away from Mapam to re-establish Ahdut HaAvoda ‚Äì Poale Zion. However, they were not recognised by the speaker of the Knesset as an independent party. The new party also launched a newspaper, LaMerhav, which became a daily publication in December that year, and was published until merging into Davar in May 1971. The 1955 elections were fought as Ahdut HaAvoda and the party won 10 seats, making them the fifth largest in the Knesset. They formed part of both of Ben-Gurion's governing coalitions during the third Knesset. Party member Nahum Nir was appointed Knesset speaker (the only time a speaker has not been a member of the largest party), Bar-Yehuda was made Minister of Internal Affairs, and Moshe Carmel became Minister of Transportation. However, they party were ultimately responsible for bringing down the government in 1959 when they and fellow coalition partners Mapam voted against the government on the issue of selling arms to West Germany but refused to leave the coalition. In the 1959 elections the party was reduced to seven seats. They again joined the coalition government until its collapse in 1961, with Ben-Aharon becoming Minister of Transportation. The 1961 elections saw them gain one seat, and become part of all three coalition governments of the fifth Knesset with Yigal Allon becoming Minister of Labour and Ben-Aharon, Bar-Yehuda and Carmel all acting as Minister of Transportation during the session. For the 1965 elections, the party allied with Mapai to form the Labor Alignment, which won 45 seats. On 23 January 1968 the party merged with Mapai and Rafi to form the Israeli Labor Party and ceased to exist as an individual entity.

In his work, Hess put forward the following ideas:\\"Rom und Jerusalem.\\" by Isidore Singer, Max Schloessinger in the Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906 Ed. # The Jews will always remain strangers among the European peoples, who may emancipate them for reasons of humanity and justice, but will never respect them so long as the Jews place their own great national memories in the background and hold to the principle, \\"Ubi bene, ibi patria.\\" (Latin language: \\"where [it is] well, there [is] the fatherland\\") # The Jewish type is indestructible, and Jewish national feeling can not be uprooted, although the German Jews, for the sake of a wider and more general emancipation, persuade themselves and others to the contrary. # If the emancipation of the Jews is irreconcilable with Jewish nationality, the Jews must sacrifice emancipation to nationality. Hess considers that the only solution of the Jewish question lies in the returning to Palestine. Reactions and legacy At the time the book was met with a cold reception, and only in retrospect it became one of the basic works of Zionism, as it prefigured ideas laid out in Der Judenstaat by Theodor Herzl by some 35 years.

Teach them to code. The website includes free coding lessons and the initiative also targets schools in an attempt to encourage them to include more computer science classes in the curriculum. On December 9, 2013, they launched the Hour of Code nationwide to promote computer science during Computer Science Education Week through December 15, 2013. nytimes.com Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and Lately, Coding History Code.org was launched in January 2013 by Iranian-American brothers Hadi Partovi and Ali Partovi, as a non-profit focused on making computer programming more accessible. The initial focus was on creating a database of all computer science classrooms in the United States. At the time, Hadi Partovi stated that about ninety percent of US schools do not teach programming, despite it now being a \\"foundational field\\". The idea for the organization came from Hadi, who states that he thought of it on the day of Steve Jobs' death in 2011 while mulling over his own potential legacy. After this, Hadi worked full-time to bring the organization to fruition. In late February 2013, a month after launch, they released a video featuring Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jack Dorsey, and other programmers and entrepreneurs on the importance of learning to code. Two weeks after the launch, TechCrunch reported that the video had gone viral and received a lot of positive attention. Partovi raised about $10 million for Code.org from various tech companies and tech company founders. In 2014, Code.org posted a one-hour tutorial to build and customize a Flappy Bird video game using the site's block visual programming language. Code.org has also created coding programs revolving around characters from the Disney film Frozen, in addition to Angry Birds, and Plants vs. Zombies. In December 2014, Code.org held a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign that raised over $5 million to help educate school children. Overall, about 100 million students have been reached by Code.org efforts. On November 16, 2015, Microsoft announced a partnership with Code.org to launch Minecraft as a tutorial to teach kids how to code. In February 2016, Code.org won the award for \\"Biggest Social Impact\\" at the Annual Crunchies Awards. By September 2016, Code.org founder Hadi Partovi was recognized as a Top 30 Education Leader by the Center for Digital Education. In December 2016, Code.org rang the opening bell of the NASDAQ. In March 2017 expanding its Operation it has started its working in backward region of Rajasthan India. Hour of Code During Computer Science Education Week from December 9 to December 15, 2013, Code.org launched the \\"Hour of Code Challenge\\" on its website to teach computer science to school students, enticing them to complete short programming tutorials. The Hour of Code involved getting people to write short snippets of code to achieve pre- specified goals using Blockly, a visual programming language of a similar flavor as Logo. The initiative had been announced about two months in advance and at the time of launch, the initiative was supported by former United States President Barack Obama as well as executives from technology companies such as Microsoft and Apple Inc. It was also supported by educational online learning platforms such as Khan Academy.https://www.khanacademy.org/partner- content/code-org About 20 million people participated and over 600 million lines of code had been written. The Hour of Code also offered participation gifts to some of the schools involved, such as a set of fifty laptops or a conference call with one a tech \\"luminary\\" like Gates or Dorsey. The crowdfunding effort for Hour of Code received the highest amount of funding ever raised on Indiegogo. By October 2014, about forty million students had taken the Hour of Code class, and a second Hour of Code was held in December 2014. That year, locations for Hour of Code lessons included Apple retail stores. In December 2016, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau helped launch the international Hour of Code campaign for 2016. And in December 2017, Code.org announced the Hour of Code had reached over 500 million hours served. Curriculum efforts The first step in the organization's efforts as regards the curriculum of schools was to work with US school districts to add computer programming as a class. Most US schools did not have a course code for computer sciences, in order for schools to be able to offer coding as a class. After this, the next step was to create free online teaching and learning materials for schools to use if instituting computer science classes. By 2014, Code.org had launched computer courses in thirty US school districts to reach about 5% of all the students in US public schools (about two million students), and by 2015, Code.org had trained about 15,000 teachers to teach computer sciences, able to reach about 600,000 new students previously unable to learn computer coding, with large percentages of those being either female or minorities. To date, Code.org has prepared over 72,000 educators to teach computer science. That year Code.org was partnered with about seventy of the largest US school districts (including each of the seven largest), representing several million students. The company also partnered with other computer class businesses and private entities to provide additional computer learning materials and opportunities. As of 2015, six million students had been enrolled in Code.org curriculum classes. That year, Code.org partnered with College Board, in order to develop a slate of advanced placement computer classes. The main platform used in Code.org instruction is Code Studio which according to TechCrunch, \\"teaches the underlying concepts in programming through the manipulation of blocks of logic that when stacked together in a particular order, move a character around a scene or draw a shape.\\" In 2018, Code.org celebrated record participation by girls and underrepresented minorities in AP computer science classrooms, driven in large part by students in the Code.org CS Principles classrooms. Legislative efforts One of the main lobbying efforts of Code.org in state legislatures is to ensure that computer classes are not registered as foreign language classes, but as science classes, in order to ensure that more than coding is taught in computer courses. Code.org also focuses specifically on female and minority students, as the organization believes these are the students most at risk of not receiving computer science education before high school or college. Goals According to its website, Code.org has the following goals: * Bringing Computer Science classes to every K‚Äì12 school in the United States, especially in urban and rural neighborhoods. * Demonstrating the successful use of online curriculum in public school classrooms * Changing policies in all 50 states to categorize C.S. as part of the math/science \\"core\\" curriculum * Harnessing the collective power of the tech community to celebrate and grow C.S. education worldwide * Increasing the representation of women and students of color in the field of Computer Science. * Increasing their global outreach by making their courses available in more than 45 languages that are used in over 180 countries. Reception Writing for San Jose Mercury News, Mike Cassidy praised Code.org and the Hour of Code, writing: \\"A publicity stunt is what we need.\\" John Dvorak was critical of the Hour of Code in an article for PC Magazine.

It was designed in accordance with Cybernetic-Synergy, Cybersyn Chile - Opsroom] Project Cybersyn was a Chilean project from 1971 to 1973 during the presidency of Salvador Allende aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer. Project Cybersyn was based on viable system model theory approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of telex machines (Cybernet) in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (Cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in \\"almost\\" real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (CHECO, for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (Opsroom) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate feasible responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network. The principal architect of the system was British operations research scientist Stafford Beer, and the system embodied his notions of organisational cybernetics in industrial management. One of its main objectives was to devolve decision-making power within industrial enterprises to their workforce in order to develop self-regulation of factories. After the CIA-backed military coup on September 11, 1973, Cybersyn was abandoned and the operations room was destroyed. Name The project's name in English (Cybersyn) is a portmanteau of the words \\"cybernetics\\" and \\"synergy\\". Since the name is not euphonic in Spanish, in that language the project was called Synco, both an initialism for the Spanish Sistema de INformaci√≥n y COntrol, \\"system of information and control\\", and a pun on the Spanish cinco, the number five, alluding to the five levels of Beer's viable system model. History Stafford Beer was a British consultant in management cybernetics. He also sympathized with the stated ideals of Chilean socialism of maintaining Chile's democratic system and the autonomy of workers instead of imposing a Soviet- style system of top-down command and control. In July 1971, Fernando Flores, a high-level employee of the Chilean Production Development Corporation (CORFO) contacted Beer for advice on incorporating Beer's theories into the management of the newly nationalized sector of Chile's economy. Beer saw this as a unique opportunity to implement his ideas on a national scale. More than offering advice, he left most of his other consulting business and devoted much time to what became Project Cybersyn. He traveled to Chile often to collaborate with local implementors and used his personal contacts to secure help from British technical experts. The implementation schedule was very aggressive, and the system had reached an advanced prototype stage at the start of 1973. The system was most useful in October 1972, when about 40,000 striking truck drivers blocked the access streets that converged towards Santiago. The strike was supported by the group and at least partly funded by private donors who had received money from the CIA. According to Gustavo Silva (executive secretary of energy in CORFO), the system's telex machines helped organize the transport of resources into the city with only about 200 trucks driven by strike-breakers, lessening the potential damage caused by the 40,000 striking truck drivers. System There were 500 unused telex machines bought by the previous government. Each was put into one factory. In the control centre in Santiago, each day data coming from each factory (several numbers, such as raw material input, production output and number of absentees) were put into a computer, which made short-term predictions and necessary adjustments. There were four levels of control (firm, branch, sector, total), with algedonic feedback. If one level of control did not remedy a problem in a certain interval, the higher level was notified. The results were discussed in the operations room and a top-level plan was made. The network of telex machines, called Cybernet, was the first operational component of Cybersyn, and the only one regularly used by the Allende government. The software for Cybersyn was called Cyberstride, and used Bayesian filtering and Bayesian control. It was written by Chilean engineers in consultation with a team of 12 British programmers. Cybersyn first ran on an IBM 360/50, but later was transferred to a less heavily used Burroughs 3500 mainframe. The futuristic operations room was designed by a team led by the interface designer Gui Bonsiepe. It was furnished with seven swivel chairs (considered the best for creativity) with buttons, which were designed to control several large screens that could project the data, and other panels with status information, although these were of limited functionality as they could only show pre-prepared graphs. This consisted of slides. The vision had been distribution of control and involvement of workers in business planning. The design looked more like bureaucratic centralisation of control via bottom up reporting and top-down direction. Workers were expected to perform processes and use resources in the ways that had been modelled and planned. Any significant deviation from was to be reported upwards, and corrective directives were to be cascaded downwards. The project is described in some detail in the second edition of Stafford Beer's books Brain of the Firm and Platform for Change. The latter book includes proposals for social innovations such as having representatives of diverse 'stakeholder' groups into the control centre. Aesthetics The Ops room used Tulip chairs similar to those used in the American science fiction TV programme Star Trek, although according to the designers, the style was not influenced by science fiction movies. Legacy Computer scientist Paul Cockshott and economist Allin Cottrell referenced Project Cybersyn in their 1993 book Towards a New Socialism, citing it as an inspiration for their own proposed model of computer-managed socialist planned economy. Authors Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski also dedicated a chapter on the project in their 2019 book, The People's Republic of Walmart. The authors presented a case to defend the feasibility of a planned economy aided by contemporary processing power used by large organizations such as Amazon, Walmart and the Pentagon. The authors, however, question whether much can be built on Project Cybersyn in particular, specifically, \\"whether a system used in emergency, near‚Äìcivil war conditions in a single country‚Äîcovering a limited number of enterprises and, admittedly, only partially ameliorating a dire situation‚Äîcan be applied in times of peace and at a global scale\\" especially as the project was never completed due to the CIA-backed military coup in 1973, which was followed by economic reforms by the Chicago Boys. Chilean science fiction author Jorge Baradit published a Spanish-language science fiction novel Synco in 2008. It is an alternate history science fantasy novel set in a 1979, of which he said: \\"It stops the military coup, the socialist government consolidates and creates the first cybernetic state, a universal example, the true third way, a miracle.\\" In April 2016, 99% Invisible produced a podcast about the project. The Radio Ambulante podcast covered some history of Allende and the Cybersyn project in their 2019 episode \\"The Room That Was A Brain\\".\\"The Room That Was A Brain\\". Radio Ambulante. The Guardian called the project \\"a sort of socialist internet, decades ahead of its time\\".

Material balancing involves taking a survey of the available inputs and raw materials in an economy and then using a balance sheet to balance the inputs with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for resource allocation and investment in a national economy.Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty- First Century, 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. . \\"Material Balance Planning\\", (P.127) The method of material balances is contrasted with the method of input-output planning developed by Wassily Leontief.  Role in Soviet-type planning  Material balance planning was the principal tool of planning employed by Soviet-type planned economies and was Gosplan's major function in the Soviet Union. This system emerged in a haphazard manner during the collectivisation drive under Joseph Stalin's leadership. It prioritized rapid growth and industrialization over efficiency. Although material balances became an established part of Soviet planning, it never completely replaced the role of financial calculation in the economy.Planning with Material Balances in Soviet-Type Economies, by Montias, J.M. 1959. The American Economic Review. Vol. 49, No. 5 (Dec., 1959), pp. 963-985. In the economy of the Soviet Union, Gosplan's major function was the formulation of material balances and national plans for the economy. In 1973, supplies for 70% of all industrial production representing 1,943 of the economy's most important items had their balances worked out by Gosplan. State Committee for Supplies Procurement and the various economic ministries were responsible for the determination of the suppliers and recipients of supplies in the Soviet economy.How the Soviet Union is Governed, 1979, by Jerry F. Hough. Harvard University Press. 978-0674410305. (P.390) Material balance planning encompassed non-labor inputs (the distribution of consumer goods and allocation of labor was left to market mechanisms). In a material balance sheet, the major sources of supply and demand are drawn up in a table that achieves a rough balance between the two through an iterative process. Successive iterations corrected imbalances with previous iterations - for example, deficits signaled the need for extra output in the successive iteration of the balance. The Soviet economy suffered endemic supply problems stemming from the crudity of the material balance technique, where balances were highly aggregated and thus imprecise. Beginning in the early 1960s, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union considered moving away from material balance planning in favor of developing an interlinked computerized system of resource allocation based on the principles of cybernetics. This development was seen as the basis for moving toward optimal planning that could form the basis of a more highly developed form of socialist economy based on informational decentralization and innovation. This was seen as a logical progression given that the material balances system was geared toward rapid industrialization, which the Soviet Union had already achieved in the preceding decades. But by the early 1970s the idea of transcending the status quo was abandoned by the Soviet leadership.InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network, by Gerovitch, Slava.

It was released in 1992 on the multi-artist charity album The Bunbury Tails, which was the soundtrack to the British animated television series of the same name. Harrison co-wrote the song's lyrics with Bunbury Tails creator David English. The eponymous Rajbun was a character in the series, one of a team of cricket- playing rabbits ‚Äì in this case, from Bangalore in India. The composition is in the style of a nursery rhyme or children's song, while the all-Indian instrumentation on the recording recalls some of Harrison's compositions for the Beatles during 1966‚Äì68. Harrison recorded \\"Ride Rajbun\\" in March 1988, between the release of his successful comeback album, Cloud Nine, and his formation of the Traveling Wilburys. Harrison's nine-year-old son Dhani and English accompanied him on the recording, as fellow vocalists, and Indian musician and composer Ravi Shankar provided the opening sitar part. The song appeared in the Bunbury Tails episode \\"Rajbun Story\\", and on the soundtrack album alongside contributions from Elton John, the Bee Gees and Eric Clapton.

In English's recollection, the night after he had made the request, Harrison called him at home in London and played the tune down the phone. The pair met the next day and co-wrote the song's lyrics.Harry, pp. 43‚Äì44. Composition Musically, \\"Ride Rajbun\\" is in the style of what author Alan Clayson calls \\"George's Indo-pop productions\\" for the Beatles, \\"Love You To\\" and \\"The Inner Light\\",Clayson, pp. 315, 424. released in 1966 and 1968 respectively.Lavezzoli, pp. 175, 182‚Äì83. The lyrics take the form of a traditional children's song, author Simon Leng writes, with its refrain sung in rounds, similar to \\"London's Burning\\". In a chorus that Inglis terms \\"nursery-rhyme-like\\", Harrison urges Rajbun to cycle away from his home in India and embrace his destiny: Inglis draws parallels between Rajbun's journey of discovery and that of nursery-rhyme or folk-tale characters Pinocchio, Dick Whittington and Dorothy Gale, in that he \\"has a 'quest' that awaits him\\". On this journey, Harrison sings of Rajbun's adversaries, one of which warns him: \\"You may think that you have heard the last of Katman / ‚Ä¶ I'll be watching you 'round ev'ry bend you'll take ‚Ä¶\\"\\"Ride Rajbun\\", Bootleg Zone (retrieved 6 January 2013). Inglis writes that Rajbun must face his quest \\"without 'fears' or 'tears'\\" and cites the verse-one lines \\"Bunbury stands for freedom / Being young and having fun\\" as evidence of the song's \\"overwhelmingly positive\\" message. Recording Ravi Shankar (pictured in 1988) performed the song's sitar introduction. Harrison recorded \\"Ride Rajbun\\" in late March 1988,Madinger & Easter, p. 475. at his Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, and at an unnamed studio in London.Leng, p. 272. The song was his first to feature only Indian instrumentation since \\"The Inner Light\\",Leng, p. 273.Inglis, p. 106. recorded in Bombay in January 1968.Lavezzoli, p. 183. The sitar introduction to \\"Ride Rabjan\\" ‚Äì or alap, in the Indian classical traditionLavezzoli, pp. 19, 23‚Äì24. ‚Äì was performed by Ravi Shankar. According to English, Harrison visited Shankar at the London hotel where the sitarist was staying and taped Shankar's intro in his hotel room. Harrison otherwise played all the sitar parts on the song. As with Harrison's appearance on \\"Friar Park\\", a track on Shankar's album Tana Mana (1987),Leng, pp. 246, 246fn. \\"Ride Rajbun\\" marked a rare collaboration between the two musicians in the years since their joint North American tour at the end of 1974.Shankar, pp. 212‚Äì13, 227‚Äì28. Harrison sung the choruses with his son Dhani, and English (in the role of Katman) provided what Leng calls a \\"cameo vocal\\" part.Leng, pp. 272, 273. According to author Bill Harry, Ray Cooper played percussion on the track; in English's description, all the other contributors were \\"top Indian musicians\\", none of whom are credited by name. Besides sitar, the Indian instruments on the recording include tabla, shehnai and bansuri (flute). From writing the song to the finished recording,Harry, p. 44. work on \\"Ride Rajbun\\" lasted for four days. Harrison then left for Los Angeles, a trip that resulted in the formation of the Traveling Wilburys.Badman, pp. 406‚Äì07. Release and reception \\"Ride Rajbun\\" appeared in the Bunbury Tails episode \\"Rajbun Story\\".Badman, p. 406. After the show's broadcast in 1992, on Britain's Channel 4 network,Huntley, pp. 244‚Äì45. Polydor Records included the song on its soundtrack album from the series.Madinger & Easter, p. 638. The UK-only album was released on 5 October that year, on the same day that Harrison joined guitarist Gary Moore on stage at London's Royal Albert Hall.Badman, p. 487. While Harrison made a number of concert appearances throughout 1992,Badman, pp. 489, 492. this period marked the end of his successful return to full-time music-making,Huntley, pp. 243, 245‚Äì46. after Cloud Nine and two albums with the Traveling Wilburys.Leng, pp. 263, 269. Although he would continue to record privately as a solo artist, \\"Ride Rajbun\\" was the last new Harrison song to be commercially released until \\"Horse to the Water\\" in 2001.Leng, pp. 273, 286. Proceeds from the Bunbury Tails album went to the Bunbury Cricket Club for dispersal to charity.Bathroom Readers' Institute, \\"The Bee Gees Meet Eric Clapton\\", bathroomreader.com, 27 June 2014 (retrieved 7 November 2017). The \\"Rajbun Story\\" episode was included on the home video of the series, although a narrator's voice renders Harrison's song almost inaudible.Huntley, p. 245.Allison, p. 153. With the album and video only available in the UK for a short time, \\"Ride Rajbun\\" has become one of Harrison's rarest recordings. The song has since appeared on bootleg compilations such as Artifacts III. Among Harrison's biographers, Elliot Huntley views \\"Ride Rajbun\\" as \\"another truly great 'lost' Harrison gem\\" alongside tracks released privately on the two Songs by George Harrison discs, in 1988 and 1992.Huntley, pp. 244, 245. Huntley laments the unavailability of \\"Ride Rajbun\\", since \\"the song is excellent, with a delightful melody, earnest vocals, and some great sitar work by Ravi Shankar\\". Simon Leng similarly admires Shankar's \\"characteristically precious\\" alap; Leng writes that while the song \\"will never be regarded as a Harrison classic\\", it is significant within the artist's work as the first \\"purely Indian piece issued under his name since 'The Inner Light'\\". Ian Inglis notes the precedents set in the 1960s by Beatle songs such as \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"Cry Baby Cry\\", which had reflected the band's \\"fascination with the conventions of the children's nursery rhyme\\", and comments on The Bunbury Tails \\"eccentric combination\\" of rabbits and cricket.

Until Glasnost and the 1989 elections, however, only candidates approved by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were permitted to participate in the elections. It was briefly succeeded by the Soviet of the Republics from October to December of 1991. As opposed to the Soviet of the Union, the Soviet of Nationalities was composed of the nationalities of the Soviet Union, which in turn followed administrative division rather than being a representation of ethnic groups. The Soviet of the Nationalities was formed on the basis of equal representation of all the Republics of the Soviet Union (32 deputies from each republic, excluding other autonomous units inside that republic which sent in separate members), autonomous republics (11 deputies from each republic), autonomous oblasts (five deputies from each oblast), and national districts (one deputy from each district). As a result, the largest republic, the Russian SFSR with a population of 147 million, and the smallest republic, the Estonian SSR with a population of about 1.5 million, got 32 deputies each. Russians as an ethnic group made up more than half of the population of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet of Nationalities did not represent ethnic groups, it represented the different nationalities as expressed by the republics and various autonomous units of the Soviet Union. This electoral system seriously diminished representation of larger ethnic groups in favor of the smaller ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, with the Russians being most underrepresented. The Soviet of Nationalities enjoyed the same rights as the Soviet of the Union in the area of legislative initiative and in resolving other issues inside the competence of the Soviet Union. In practice, until 1989, it did little more than approve decisions already made by the top leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After the 1989 elections‚Äìthe first, and as it turned out, only, free elections ever held in the Soviet Union‚Äìthe Soviet of Nationalities acquired a much greater role, and was the scene of many lively debates. The Soviet of Nationalities elected a chairman (who would lead the sessions of the chamber), his four deputies, and permanent commissions: Mandate Commission, Commission on Legislative Suppositions, Budget Planning Commission, Foreign Affairs Commission, Youth Affairs Commission, Industry Commission, Transportation and Communications Commission, Construction and Industry of Building Materials Commission, Agricultural Commission, Consumer Goods Commission, Public Education Commission, Science and Culture Commission, Trade Commission, Consumer Service and Municipal Economy Commission, Environmental Commission. The presidium of the Soviet of Nationalities \\"ceased all noticeable work at the end of 1937,\\" but it did \\"survive as the sole central political institution formally devoted to the nationalities question.\\"Terry Martin, The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939 (Cornell University Press, 2001: ), p. 412. On December 26, 1991, the Soviet of the Republics adopted a resolution declaring that the Soviet Union no longer existed as a functioning state and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence. The Soviet of the Union had effectively been dissolved two weeks earlier when Russia recalled its deputies, leaving it without a quorum. The Soviet of the Republics' declaration was thus the final legal step in the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  Soviet of Nationalities prior to 1938  Prior to the creation of the Supreme Soviet in 1938 by the Soviet Constitution of 1936, the Soviet of Nationalities was one of the bodies that formed the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. Created by the 1924 Constitution to represent the national-territorial units of the Soviet Union in 1924, the Soviet of Nationalities included 5 delegates from union-level republics and ASSRs and 1 delegate from each autonomous oblast.

It was founded in October 1917, and refounded in March 1919, at the 8th Congress of the Bolshevik Party. It was known as the Presidium from 1952 to 1966. The existence of the Politburo ended in 1991 upon the breakup of the Soviet Union. History=Background= On August 18, 1917, the top Bolshevik leader, Vladimir Lenin, set up a political bureau ‚Äì known first as Narrow composition and, after October 23, 1917, as Political bureau ‚Äì specifically to direct the October Revolution, with only seven members (Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin, Sokolnikov, and Bubnov), but this precursor did not outlast the event; the Central Committee continued with the political functions. However, due to practical reasons, usually fewer than half of the members attended the regular Central Committee meetings during this time, even though they decided all key questions. The 8th Party Congress in 1919 formalized this reality and re-established what would later on become the true center of political power in the Soviet Union. It ordered the Central Committee to appoint a five-member Politburo to decide on questions too urgent to await full Central Committee deliberation. The original members of the Politburo were Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Stalin, Lev Kamenev, and Nikolai Krestinsky. =Early years: 1919‚Äì1934= The Soviet system was based upon the system conceived by Vladimir Lenin, often referred to as Leninism. Certain historians and political scientists credit Lenin for the evolution of the Soviet political system after his death. Others, such as Leonard Schapiro, argue that the system itself, from 1921, evolved an inner-party democratic system to a monolithic one in 1921, with the establishment of the Control Commission, the ban on factions and the ability given to the Central Committee to expel members they deemed unqualified. These rules were implemented to strengthen party discipline, however, the party continued under Lenin and the early post- Lenin years to try to establish democratic procedures within the party. For instance, by 1929, leading party members began criticizing the party apparatus, represented by the Secretariat headed by Stalin, of having too much control over personnel decisions. Lenin addressed such posing questions in 1923, in his articles \\"How We Should Reorganize the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate\\" and \\"Better Fewer But Better\\". In these, Lenin wrote of his plan to turn the combined meetings of the Central Committee and the Control Commission into the party's \\"parliament\\". The combined meetings of these two would hold the Politburo responsible, while at the same time guard the Politburo from factionalism. Admitting that organizational barriers may be inadequate to safeguard the party from one-man dictatorship, Lenin recognized the importance of individuals. His testament tried to solve this crisis by reducing both Stalin's and Leon Trotsky's powers. While some of his contemporaries accused Lenin of creating a one-man dictatorship within the party, Lenin countered, stating that he, like any other, could only implement policies by persuading the party. This happened on several occasions, such as in 1917 when he threatened to leave the party if the party did not go along with the October Revolution, or persuading the party to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, or the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP). Lenin, a noted factionalist before the Bolshevik seizure of power, supported the promotion of people he had previously clashed with on important issues to the Politburo; Trotsky and Lenin had had several years of violent polemics between them, while Grigori Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev both opposed the Central Committee resolution which initiated the October Revolution. 14th Conference,:ru:XIV –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –†–ö–ü(–±) April 1925left From 1917 to the mid-1920s, congresses were held annually, the Central Committee was convened at least once a month and the Politburo met once a week. With Joseph Stalin's consolidation of power, the frequency of formal meetings declined. By the mid-1930s, the Central Committee began meeting only once a month, and the Politburo convened at most once every third week. The Politburo was established, and worked within the framework of democratic centralism (that is a system in which higher bodies are responsible to lower bodies and where every member is subordinate to party decisions). The nature of democratic centralism had changed by 1929, and the freedom of expression which had been previously tolerated within the party, was replaced with monolithic unity. The main reason being Stalin's defeat of the opposition; the Left Opposition, the Right Opposition etc. It is generally believed that under Stalin the Politburo's powers were reduced vis-a-vis Stalin. Stalin defeated the Left Opposition led by Trotsky by allying himself with the rightists within the Politburo; Nikolai Bukharin, Aleksey Rykov and Mikhail Tomsky. After defeating the Left Opposition, Stalin began attacking the rightists (referred to as the Right Opposition) through his supporters in the Politburo, the Central Committee and the Control Commission. Stalin and his companion supported an undemocratic interpretation of Lenin's What Is to Be Done?. Throughout the late-1920s, Politburo member Lazar Kaganovich (a Stalin ally), wrote and campaigned for a party organisational by-law which reduced inner-party democracy in favour of hierarchy and centralism. With the defeat of the other factions, these interpretations became party law. To strengthen the system of centralised decision-making, Stalin strengthened the Politburo by appointing his allies to high standing offices outside the Politburo; for instance, Molotov succeeded Rykov as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars in 1930, to reduce the chance of another independent locus of centralised power coming into form which could threaten him and the Politburo, Secretariat and the Orgburo. During this period, the office of General Secretary became paramount. The Politburo, which was nominally responsible to the Central Committee and the party Congress, became responsible to the General Secretary. The General Secretary, the formal head of the Secretariat and the Orgburo, \\"came to exercise enormous weight in decision-making.\\" The Secretariat and Orgburo were responsible for personnel appointments in the whole party, and so were used as a machine by Stalin and his allies to promote likeminded individuals. Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich played a key role in strengthening the role of the Secretariat and the Orgburo in party affairs. =Stalin years: 1934‚Äì1953= Excerpt of protocol of Politburo meeting of 17 January 1940 noting the decision to put 457 persons on trial and to execute 346 of them with the rest (111) being sent to the Gulags The 17th Politburo was elected at the 1st Plenary Session of the 17th Central Committee, in the aftermath of the 17th Congress. Outwardly, the Politburo remained united, but on 4 February Grigory Ordzhonikidze, the People's Commissar for Heavy Industry, refused to acknowledge Stalin's projected economic growth targets, claiming that the majority in the Politburo supported his position. Sergey Kirov, who had turned down an offer to take Stalin's place as General Secretary before the 17th Congress, opposed many of Stalin's repressive policies, and tried throughout 1934 to moderate them. Several scholars have viewed Ordzhonikidze's and Kirov's outspokenness as the rise of a moderate Stalinist faction with the party. On 1 December 1934, Kirov was shot dead ‚Äì whether he was the victim of a madman or killed on Stalin's orders remains unknown. Not long after, on 21 January 1935, Valerian Kuybyshev died of natural causes, and a month later, Anastas Mikoyan and Vlas Chubar were elected Politburo full members. Andrei Zhdanov, the First Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee and member of the Secretariat, and Robert Eikhe, the First Secretary of the Siberian and West-Siberian District Committee, were elected Politburo candidate members. 1936 signaled the beginning of the Great Purge, a nationwide purge of what Stalin deemed as anti-socialist elements. The first victims of the purge were members and leaders of economic organizations. Not everyone in the Politburo agreed with the purges, or the scope of them. Ordzhonikidze ridiculed the purge, and tried to save officials working in the People's Commissariat for Heavy Industry. Stalin expected that Ordzhonikidze would support the purges, at least officially, but instead he wrote a speech condemning them. On 18 February 1937, Ordzhonikidze was found dead in his house, having killed himself. At the Central Committee plenum in February 1937, Stalin, Molotov, Zhdanov and Nikolai Yezhov began accusing leading officials of anti-socialist behavior, but they met opposition. Pavel Postyshev, a Politburo candidate member and First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Branch, in response to them accusing a member of the Ukrainian Central Committee of being anti-socialist said; \\"I don't believe it.\\" When Yezhov proposed killing Bukharin and Rykov, Postyshev along with Stanislav Kosior and Grigory Petrovsky, opposed such a measure, proposing instead of handing them over to the courts. Molotov and Kliment Voroshilov, supported a compromise brokered by Stalin, which handed over Bukharin and Rykov to the NKVD. Despite this opposition, Stalin and his closet associates began purging officials nationwide. In May 1937, JƒÅnis Rudzutaks became the first Politburo member to be purged. In 1938, four other Politburo members were purged; Chubar, who personally telephoned Stalin crying trying to assure his innocence, Kosior, who confessed for anti-socialist crimes after his daughter was raped in front of him, Postyshev and Eikhe. Petrovsky in contrast, was rather lucky, instead of being purged he was not reelected to the Politburo at the 18th Congress. The purging of Rudzutaks, Eikhe and Kosior testified to Stalin's growing power; the Politburo were not even notified of the decision. Postyshev was purged because \\"of too much zeal in persecuting people.\\" =Khrushchev: 1953‚Äì1964Brezhnev Era: 1964‚Äì1985Gorbachev: 1985‚Äì1991=Duties and responsibilities=Status= The Politburo was the highest organ of the party when the party Congress and the Central Committee were not in session. The Politburo, along with the Secretariat and the Organizational Bureau (Orgburo) until 1952, was one of three permanent bodies of the party. The General Secretary, the party leader, served as ex officio chairman of the Politburo (however, no formal rule stipulated such activity). 28 politburos were elected throughout the existence of the USSR. While nominally subordinate to the Central Committee and the Party Congress, in practice the Politburo was the true center of power in the CPSU, and its decisions de facto had the force of law. =Decision-making process= Arkady Shevchenko, like many Soviet technical experts, once attended the part of a Politburo meeting that touched on his area of expertise, and he often prepared his boss Andrei Gromyko for meetings. He described the working style of the Politburo's weekly meeting during the Brezhnev era as \\"quiet, orderly, and methodical. Although an agenda is prepared, there is no quorum call or other form of parliamentary procedure.\\" Shevchenko's memoir makes it clear that the tense political struggle that could often occur among Politburo members usually did not take place openly during its meetings, but rather behind the backs of one's rivals. In practice, Soviet Leninism's democratic centralism often followed a style of unanimous consent rather than majority vote. This style of consensus decision-making had roots not only in the era of the Great Terror, when no one dared demur openly, but also in Brezhnev's carefully cultivated culture of collective decision-making. Shevchenko said, \\"While the Politburo considered the item for which I was responsible, I sat with Kuznetsov, Kornienko, and [Vasily] Makarov, behind Gromyko at the long table in the Kremlin. Brezhnev asked whether all members of the Politburo had received the draft U.S.-Soviet documents in time and if they had studied them. Most of the members nodded silent assent. 'Can I assume that the draft is approved?' Brezhnev asked. No one spoke. 'The draft is approved,' said Brezhnev after a few more moments of silence. Makarov put his hand on my shoulder, whispering, 'Okay, Arkady, that's it. You can go.'\\" =Relation to the Secretariat=Members=Election= To be elected to the Politburo, a member had to serve on the Central Committee. The Central Committee formally elected the Politburo in the aftermath of a party Congress. Members of the Central Committee were given a predetermined list of candidates for the Politburo (having only one candidate for each seat), for this reason the election of the Politburo was usually passed unanimously. The more power the CPSU General Secretary had, the stronger the chance was that the Politburo membership were passed without serious dissent. Article 25 of the party Charter, said little to nothing on the actual relationship between the Politburo and the Central Committee. Until 1961, Article 25 stated (with several changes) that the Central Committee \\"forms\\" or \\"organizes\\" the Politburo. It was not until 1961, under Nikita Khrushchev, that the party Charter was amended; stating that the Politburo was appointed through \\"secret elections\\". The amended party Charter stated that at least one-third of the Politburo (as well as the Central Committee) had to step down at each election to the Politburo, and that no members could be elected for more than three terms. The initiator of these changes, Khrushchev, the CPSU General Secretary, had served in the Politburo for 22 years. Instead of stepping down, Khrushchev made a rule which stated that members \\"who enjoyed great authority and possessed exceptional ability\\" could serve more than three terms, if they received more 75 percent approval votes from the Central Committee, upon elections. These amendments were removed from the party Charter under Leonid Brezhnev, and Article 25 now stated; \\"In the election of all party organs, from the primary party organization to the Central Committee of the CPSU, the principle of systematic replacement of personnel and the continuity of leadership is to be observed.\\" The Brezhnev period saw, in complete contrast to Khrushchev's amendment, the greatest continuity in the Politburo in its history. Article 25 of the Charter remained unchanged under the successive leadership of Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Mikhail Gorbachev. Between 1919 and 1990, 42 members who served as candidate members were not promoted to full member status of the Politburo. Similarly, 32 full members of the Politburo never served as candidate members. Six members who had served as full members were demoted to candidate status during the Politburo's existence. =Posts= Serving in the Politburo was a part-time function, and members served concurrently in either the party, state, trade union, security or military administrations (or all of them concurrently). Until the 1950s, most members served in state positions, but this changed at the 20th Congress (held in 1956) when 47% percent of Politburo members served in the central party apparatus while another 47% served in the state administration. From the 20th Congress until the 28th Congress, the share of Politburo members serving in the central party apparatus increased, while those serving in the state administration declined. The majority of Politburo members had leading central posts; the highest share of republican officials serving in the Politburo came at the 22nd Congress (held in 1961) when 50 percent of members held offices at the republican-level. Security officials had historically had a low-profile on the Politburo. From 1953 until 1973, no officials representing the security sector served in the Politburo as full members; the last two being Lavrentiy Beria and Nikolay Ignatov. This tradition was put to an end with the elevation of Yuri Andropov, the KGB Chairman, to full membership (having served as a candidate member since 1967). Alexander Shelepin had served as KGB Chairman, but was elected to the Politburo through his work in the Komsomol, while Eduard Shevardnadze, who had served as the Georgian Minister of Internal Affairs until 1972, became a candidate member of the Politburo through his work as First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Similarly in 1973, the Minister of Defense Andrei Grechko was appointed to the Politburo. However, unlike the security sector, the military sector had had representatives in the Politburo since the 8th Politburo (in 1919). Defense ministers who had served in the Politburo are Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Frunze, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikolai Bulganin, Georgy Zhukov and Dmitry Ustinov among others. Similarly, several leading Politburo officials had participated in either the Russian Revolution, the Russian Civil War or World War II. =Ethnicity, age and sex= Ethnic Slavs dominated the Politburo from its establishment in 1919. This isn't surprising, since the three most populous republics within the Soviet Union were ethnic Slavic; Byelorussia, Ukraine and Russia. From 1919 until 1991, 89 members of the Politburo were Russians (which makes up 68 percent). In distant second were Ukrainians, who had 11 members in the Politburo, making up 8 percent. In third place are both ethnic Jews and Georgians, who had 4 members respectively. In general, in the first half of the Politburo's existence, there was a higher ethnic representation than the second half. It was not until the 28th Politburo that every republic had a representative at the Politburo. The Politburo never tried to fix the ethnic imbalance within the Politburo. Instead, the Soviet Union at the central level was mostly ruled by Russians. Despite the ideological rhetoric about equality between the sexes, the Politburo came to be composed largely of men. Only four women ever served in the Politburo; Elena Stasova, Yekaterina Furtseva, Alexandra Biryukova and Galina Semenova. Furtseva, Biryukova and Semenova reached the Politburo under the leadership of reformist party leaders; Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev. The average age of the Politburo was 39 in 1919, and the Politburo continued to age more-or-less consistently until 1985. The reason for this being that the Central Committee treated Politburo replenishment as the responsibility of the Politburo itself. Politburo members usually picked successors who were around the same age, the end result being the establishment of the gerontocracy of the Brezhnev Era. While the age steadily crept up during Khrushchev's leadership, members were replaced; for instance, 70 percent of the members elected to the Politburo in 1956 lost their seats in 1961. In contrast, all the Politburo members elected in 1966 were reelected in 1971. Even more worrisome, 12 out of 19 members elected in 1966 were reelected in 1981. By the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982, the median age of the politburo was 70. This age development was finally put to a halt under Gorbachev. From 1985 onwards, the age of Politburo members steadily declined. =Origin and education= Fifty-nine percent of Politburo members (both candidate and full) were of rural origins, while 41 percent were urban. The first members of the Politburo were predominantly from urban areas. For instance, on the 9th Politburo, two out of eight (Trotsky and Mikhail Kalinin) were born in rural areas. From the 1930s onwards, the majority of Politburo members had a father who worked either as a peasant or as a worker. This is strange, considering that one would assume a rise in representation of the intelligentsia as the Soviet Union became more advanced. From 1960s onwards the majority of new members had workers background, as expected. What is strange, however, is that from 1975 to 1981, a sudden increase of people of peasant background took place. When looking at first profession, the majority of members had worked as workers, but the majority of them had attended higher education later in their life (the majority of them choosing engineering). 43 percent of Politburo members attained higher education credentials during their life, while in a close second place, 32 percent of members earned an education in technical engineering.

According to party statutes, the committee directed all party and governmental activities. Its members were elected by the Party Congress. During Vladimir Lenin's leadership of the Communist Party, the Central Committee functioned as the highest party authority between Congresses. However, the 8th Party Congress (held in 1919) established the Political Bureau (Politburo) to respond to questions needing immediate responses. Some delegates objected to the establishment of the Politburo, and in response, the Politburo became responsible to the Central Committee, and Central Committee members could participate in Politburo sessions with a consultative voice, but could not vote unless they were members. Following Lenin's death in January 1924, Joseph Stalin gradually increased his power in the Communist Party through the office of General Secretary of the Central Committee, the leading Secretary of the Secretariat. With Stalin's takeover, the role of the Central Committee was eclipsed by the Politburo, which consisted of a small clique of loyal Stalinists. By the time of Stalin's death in 1953, the Central Committee had become largely a symbolic organ that was responsible to the Politburo, and not the other way around. The death of Stalin revitalised the Central Committee, and it became an important institution during the power struggle to succeed Stalin. Following Nikita Khrushchev's accession to power, the Central Committee still played a leading role; it overturned the Politburo's decision to remove Khrushchev from office in 1957. In 1964 the Central Committee ousted Khrushchev from power and elected Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary. The Central Committee was an important organ in the beginning of Brezhnev's rule, but lost effective power to the Politburo. From then on, until the era of Mikhail Gorbachev (General Secretary from 1985 to 1991), the Central Committee played a minor role in the running of the party and state ‚Äì the Politburo once again operated as the highest political organ in the Soviet Union. History CPSU Central Committee headquarter in 1920s-1991, current Administration of the President of Russia. =Background: 1898‚Äì1917= At the founding congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (the predecessor of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) Vladimir Lenin was able to gain enough support for the establishment of an all-powerful central organ at the next congress. This central organ was to become the Central Committee, and it had the rights to decide all party issues, with the exception of local ones. The group which supported the establishment of a Central Committee at the 2nd Congress called themselves the Bolsheviks, and the losers (the minority) were given the name Mensheviks by their own leader, Julius Martov. The Central Committee would contain three members, and would supervise the editorial board of Iskra, the party newspaper. The first members of the Central Committee were Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, Friedrich Lengnik and Vladimir Noskov. Throughout its history, the party and the Central Committee were riven by factional infighting and repression by government authorities. Lenin was able to persuade the Central Committee, after a long and heated discussion, to initiate the October Revolution. The majority of the members had been skeptical of initiating the revolution so early, and it was Lenin who was able to persuade them. The motion to carry out a revolution in October 1917 was passed with 10 in favour, and two against by the Central Committee. =Lenin era: 1917‚Äì1922= The Central Committee, according to Lenin, was to be the supreme authority of the party. Leon Trotsky criticised this view, stating \\"our rules represent 'organisational nonconfidence' of the party toward its parts, that is, supervision over all local, district, national and other organisations ... the organisation of the party takes place of the party itself; the Central Committee takes the place of the organisation; and finally the dictator takes the place of the Central Committee.\\" During the first years in power, under Lenin's rule, the Central Committee was the key decision-making body in both practice and theory, and decisions were made through majority votes. For example, the Central Committee voted for or against signing a peace treaty with the Germans between 1917 and 1918 during World War I; the majority voted in favour of peace when Trotsky backed down in 1918. The result of the vote was the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the heated debates in the Central Committee about a possible peace with the Germans, Lenin did not have a majority; both Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin had more support for their own position than Lenin. Only when Lenin sought a coalition with Trotsky and others, were negotiations with the Germans voted through with a simple majority. Criticism of other officials was allowed during these meetings, for instance, Karl Radek said to Lenin (criticising his position of supporting peace with the Germans), \\"If there were five hundred courageous men in Petrograd, we would put you in prison.\\" The decision to negotiate peace with the Germans was only reached when Lenin threatened to resign, which in turn led to a temporary coalition between Lenin's supporters and those of Trotsky and others. No sanctions were invoked on the opposition in the Central Committee following the decision. The system had many faults, and opposition to Lenin and what many saw as his excessive centralisation policies came to the leadership's attention during the 8th Party Congress (March 1919) and the 9th Party Congress (March 1920). At the 9th Party Congress the Democratic Centralists, an opposition faction within the party, accused Lenin and his associates, of creating a Central Committee in which a \\"small handful of party oligarchs ... was banning those who hold deviant views.\\" Several delegates to the Congress were quite specific in the criticism, one of them accusing Lenin and his associates of making the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic a place of exile for opponents. Lenin reply was evasive, he conceded that faults had been made, but noted that if such policies had in fact been carried out the criticism of him during the 9th Party Congress could not have occurred. During the 10th Party Congress (March 1921) Lenin condemned the Workers Opposition, a faction within the Communist Party, for deviating from communism and accused Trotsky of factionalism. Lenin did state that factionalism was allowed, but only allowed before and during Party Congresses when the different sides needed to win votes. Several Central Committee members, who were members of the Workers Opposition, offered their resignation to Lenin but their resignations were not accepted, and they were instead asked to submit to party discipline. The 10th Party Congress also introduced a ban on factionalism within the Communist Party; however, what Lenin considered to be 'platforms', such as the Democratic Centralists and the Workers Opposition, were allowed. Factions, in Lenin's mind, were groups within the Communist Party who subverted party discipline. Despite the ban on factionalism, the Workers' Opposition continued its open agitation against the policies of the Central Committee, and before the 11th Party Congress (March 1922) the Workers' Opposition made an ill-conceived bid to win support for their position in the Comintern. The Comintern, not unexpectedly, supported the position of the Central Committee. During the 11th Party Congress Alexander Shliapnikov, the leader of the Workers' Opposition, claimed that certain individuals from the Central Committee had threatened him. Lenin's reply was evasive, but he stated that party discipline needed to be strengthened during \\"a retreat\\" ‚Äì the New Economic Policy was introduced at the 10th Party Congress. The 11th Party Congress would prove to be the last congress chaired by Lenin, he suffered one stroke in May 1922, was paralysed by a second in December later that year, was removed from public life in March 1923 and died on 21 January 1924. =Interregnum: 1922‚Äì1930= Trotsky was one of the main contenders for leadership following Lenin's death. When Lenin died, the Soviet leadership was uncertain how the building of the new, socialist society should proceed. Some supported extending the NEP, as Lenin had suggested late in his life, or ending it and replacing it with a planned economy, a position Lenin held when he initiated NEP. Following Lenin's forced departure due to ill health, a power struggle began, which involved Nikolai Bukharin, Lev Kamenev, Alexei Rykov, Joseph Stalin, Mikhail Tomsky, Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev. Of these, Trotsky was the most notable one. In his testament, Lenin referred to Trotsky's \\"exceptional abilities\\", adding \\"personally he is perhaps the most able man in the present central committee.\\" Trotsky did face a problem however: he had previously disagreed with Lenin on several matters. He was also of Jewish descent. Stalin, the second major contender, and future leader of the Soviet Union, was the least known, and he was not a popular figure with the masses. Even though he was a Georgian, and he opposed Georgian nationalism, he talked like a Slavophile, which was an advantage. The Communist Party was his institutional base; he was the General Secretary ‚Äì another advantage. But there was a problem; Stalin was known for his brutality. As one Party faithful put it, \\"A savage man ... a bloody man. You have to have swords like him in a revolution but I don't like that fact, nor like him.\\" In his testament, Lenin said of Stalin: > Stalin is too rude, and this fault, fully tolerable in our midst and in the > relations among us Communists, becomes intolerable in the office of General > Secretary. Therefore I propose to the comrades that they devise a way of > shifting Stalin from this position and appointing to it another man who in > all other respects falls on the other side of the scale from Comrade Stalin, > namely, more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and considerate of comrades, > less capricious and so forth. Inner-party democracy became an important topic following Lenin's health leave; Trotsky and Zinoviev were its main backers, but Zinoviev later changed his position when he aligned himself with Stalin. Trotsky and Rykov tried to reorganise the party in early 1923, by debureaucratising it, however, in this they failed, and Stalin managed to enlarge the Central Committee. This was opposed by certain leading party members and a week later; the Declaration of the Forty-Six was issued, which condemned Stalin's centralisation policies. The declaration stated that the Politburo, Orgburo and the Secretariat was taking complete control over the party, and it was these bodies which elected the delegates to the Party Congresses ‚Äì in effect making the executive branch, the Party Congress, a tool of the Soviet leadership. On this issue, Trotsky said, \\"as this regime becomes consolidated all affairs are concentrated in the hands of a small group, sometimes only of a secretary who appoints, removes, gives the instructions, inflicts the penalties, etc.\\" In many ways Trotsky's argument was valid, but he was overlooking the changes, which were taking place. Under Lenin the party ruled through the government, for instance, the only political office held by Lenin was Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, but following Lenin's health the party took control of government activities. The system before Lenin was forced to leave was similar to that of parliamentary systems where the party cabinet, and not the party leadership, were the actual leaders of the country. It was the power of the center which disturbed Trotsky and his followers. If the Soviet leadership had the power to appoint regional officials, they had the indirect power to elect the delegates of the Party Congresses. Trotsky accused the delegates of the 12th Party Congress (17‚Äì25 April 1923) of being indirectly elected by the center, citing that 55.1% of the voting delegates at the congress were full-time members, at the previous congress only 24.8% of the voting-delegates were full-members. He had cause for alarm, because as Anastas Mikoyan noted in his memoirs, Stalin strived to prevent as many pro-Trotsky officials as possible being elected as congress delegates. Trotsky's views went unheeded until 1923, when the Politburo announced a resolution where it reaffirmed party democracy, and even declared the possibility of ending the appointment powers of the center. This was not enough for Trotsky, and he wrote an article in Pravda where he condemned the Soviet leadership and the powers of the center. Zinoviev, Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership then accused him of factionalism. Trotsky was not elected as a delegate to the 13th Party Congress (23‚Äì31 May 1924). 15th Congress; Rykov (left), Mykola Skrypnik (center) and Stalin (right) Following the 13th Congress, another power struggle with a different focus began; this time socio-economic policies were the prime motivators for the struggle. Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev supported rapid industrialisation and a planned economy, while Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky supported keeping the NEP. Stalin, in contrast to the others, has often been viewed as standing alone; as Jerry F. Hough explained, he has often been viewed as \\"a cynical Machiavellian interested only in power.\\" None of the leading figures of that era were rigid in economic policy, and all of them had supported the NEP previously. With the good harvests in 1922, several problems arose, especially the role of heavy industry and inflation. While agriculture had recovered substantially, the heavy industrial sector was still in recession, and had barely recovered from the pre-war levels. The State Planning Commission (Gosplan) supported giving subsidies to heavy industries, while the People's Commissariat for Finance opposed this, citing major inflation as their reason. Trotsky was the only one in the Politburo who supported Gosplan in its feud with the Commissariat for Finance. In 1925, Stalin began moving against Zinoviev and Kamenev. The appointment of Rykov as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars was a de facto demotion of Kamenev. Kamenev was acting Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars in Lenin's absence. To make matters worse, Stalin began espousing his policy of socialism in one country ‚Äì a policy often viewed, wrongly, as an attack on Trotsky, when it was really aimed at Zinoviev. Zinoviev, from his position as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (Comintern), opposed Stalin's policy. Zinoviev began attacking Stalin within a matter of months, while Trotsky began attacking Stalin for this stance in 1926. At the 14th Party Congress (18‚Äì31 December 1925) Kamenev and Zinoviev were forced into the same position that Trotsky had been forced into previously; they proclaimed that the center was usurping power from the regional branches, and that Stalin was a danger to inner-party democracy. The Congress became divided between two factions, between the one supporting Stalin, and those who supported Kamenev and Zinoviev. The Leningrad delegation, which supported Zinoviev, shouted \\"Long live the Central Committee of our party\\". Even so, Kamenev and Zinoviev were crushed at the congress, and 559 voted in favour of the Soviet leadership and only 65 against. The newly elected Central Committee demoted Kamenev to a non- voting member of the Politburo. In April 1926 Zinoviev was removed from the Politburo and in December, Trotsky lost his membership too. All of them retained their seats in the Central Committee until October 1927. At the 15th Party Congress (2‚Äì19 December 1927) the Left Opposition was crushed; none of its members were elected to the Central Committee. From then on Stalin was the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union, and other leading officials, such as Bukharin, Tomsky, and Rykov were considerably weakened. The Central Committee which was elected at the 16th Party Congress (26 June ‚Äì 13 July 1930) removed Tomsky and Rykov. Rykov also lost the Council of People's Commissars chairmanship, from the Politburo. =Interwar and war period: 1930‚Äì1945= From 1934 to 1953, three congresses were held (a breach of the party rule which stated that a congress must be convened every third year), one conference and 23 Central Committee meetings. This is in deep contrast to the Lenin era (1917‚Äì1924), when six Congresses were held, five conferences and 69 meetings of the Central Committee. The Politburo did not convene once between 1950, when Nikolai Voznesensky was killed, and 1953. In 1952, at the 19th Party Congress (5‚Äì14 October 1952) the Politburo was abolished and replaced by the Presidium. Under Stalin (pictured) the Central Committee lost effective control over policymaking. In 1930 the Central Committee departments were reorganised, because the Secretariat had lost control over the economy, because of the First Five-Year Plan, and needed more party personnel to supervise the economy. Prior to 1930, Central Committee departments focused on major components of \\"political work\\". During Stalin's rule they were specialised. The departments supervised local party officials and ministerial branches within their particular sphere. Four years later, in 1934, new Central Committee departments were established which were independent from the Department for Personnel. Stalin's emphasis on the importance of political and economic work led to another wave of reorganisation of the Central Committee departments in the late-1930s and 1940s. At the 18th Party Congress (10‚Äì21 March 1939) the department specializing in industry was abolished and replaced by a division focusing on personnel management, ideology and verification fulfillment. At the 18th Party Conference (15‚Äì20 February 1941) it was concluded that the abolition of the Central Committee Department on Industry had led to the neglect of industry. Because of this, specialised secretaries became responsible for industry and transport from the center down to the city level. The 17th Party Congress (26 January ‚Äì 10 February 1934) has gone down in history as the Congress of Victors, because of the success of the First- Five Year Plan. During it several delegates formed an anti-Stalin bloc. Several delegates discussed the possibility of either removing or reducing Stalin's powers. Not all conflicts were below the surface, and Grigory Ordzhonikidze, the People's Commissar for Heavy Industry openly disputed with Vyacheslav Molotov, the Chairman of the Council of the People's Commissars, about the rate of economic growth. The dispute between Ordzhonikidze and Molotov, who represented the Soviet leadership, was settled by the establishment of a Congress Commission, which consisted of Stalin, Molotov, Ordzhonikidze, other Politburo members and certain economic experts. They eventually reached an agreement, and the planned target for economic growth in the Second Five-Year Plan was reduced from 19% to 16.5%. The tone of the 17th Party Congress was different from its predecessors; several old oppositionists became delegates, and were re-elected to the Central Committee. For instance, Bukharin, Zinoviev, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Georgy Pyatakov were all rehabilitated. All of them spoke at the congress, even if most of them were interrupted. The Congress was split between two dominant factions, radicals (mostly Stalinists) and moderates. Several groups were established before the congress, which either opposed the Stalinist leadership (the Ryutin Group) or opposed socio-economic policies of the Stalinist leadership (the Syrtsov‚ÄìLominadze Group, Eismont‚ÄìTolmachev Group and the group headed by Alexander Petrovich Smirnov amongst others). Politicians, who had previously opposed the Stalinist leadership, could be rehabilitated if they renounced their former beliefs and began supporting Stalin's rule. However, the leadership was not opening up; Kamenev and Zinoviev were arrested in 1932 (or in the beginning of 1933), and set free in 1934, and than rearrested in 1935, accused of being part of an assassination plot which killed Sergei Kirov. Preobrazhensky (pictured) was a leading figure of the Central Committee in the 1920s, but was killed during the Purge The majority of the Central Committee members elected at the 17th Party Congress were killed during, or shortly after, the Great Purge when Nikolai Yezhov and Lavrentiy Beria headed the NKVD. Grigory Kaminsky, at a Central Committee meeting, spoke against the Great Purge, and shortly after was arrested and killed. In short, during the Great Purge, the Central Committee was liquidated. Stalin managed to liquidate the Central Committee with the committee's own consent, as Molotov once put it \\"This gradually occurred. Seventy expelled 10‚Äì15 persons, then 60 expelled 15 ... In essence this led to a situation where a minority of this majority remained within the Central Committee ... Such was the gradual but rather rapid process of clearing the way.\\" Several members were expelled from the Central Committee through voting. Of the 139 members elected to the Central Committee at the 17th Congress, 98 people were killed in the period 1936‚Äì40. In this period the Central Committee decreased in size; a 78 percent decrease. By the 18th Congress there were only 31 members of the Central Committee, and of these only two were reelected. Many of the victims of the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until 1988. Under Khrushchev, an investigation into the matter concluded that the Central Committee had lost its ruling function under Stalin; from 1929 onwards all decisions in the Central Committee were taken unanimously. In other words, the Central Committee was too weak to protect itself from Stalin and his hangmen. Stalin had managed to turn Lenin's hierarchical model on its head; under Lenin the Party Congress and the Central Committee were the highest decision-making organs, under Stalin the Politburo, Secretariat and the Orgburo became the most important decision-making bodies. =From Stalin to Khrushchev's fall: 1945‚Äì1964= In the post-World War II period, Stalin ruled the Soviet Union through the post of Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The powers of the Secretariat decreased during this period, and only one member of the Secretariat, Nikita Khrushchev, was a member of the Presidium (the Politburo). The frequency of Central Committee meetings decreased sharply under Stalin, but increased again following his death. After Khrushchev's consolidation of power, the number of Central Committee meetings decreased yet again, but it increased during his later rule, and together with the Politburo, the Central Committee voted to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary in 1964. Malenkov succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, but failed to take total control over the party machinery When Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Georgy Malenkov, a Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers succeeded him as Chairman and as the de facto leading figure of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). A power struggle between Malenkov and Khrushchev began, and on 14 March Malenkov was forced to resign from the Secretariat. The official explanation for his resignation was \\"to grant the request of Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers G. M. Malenkov to be released from the duties of the Party Central Committee\\". Malenkov's resignation made Khrushchev the senior member within the Secretariat, and made him powerful enough to set the agenda of the Presidium meetings alongside Malenkov. Khrushchev was able to consolidate his powers within the party machine after Malenkov's resignation, but Malenkov remained the de facto leading figure of the Party. Together with Malenkov's and Khrushchev's accession of power, another figure, Lavrentiy Beria was also contending for power. The three formed a short-lived Troika, which lasted until Khrushchev and Malenkov betrayed Beria. Beria, an ethnic Georgian, was the Presidium member for internal security affairs, and he was a strong supporter for minority rights and even supported reuniting East and West Germany to establish a strong, and neutral Germany between the capitalist and socialist nations. It was Beria, through an official pronouncement by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and not by the Central Committee or the Council of Ministers, who renounced the Doctor's Plot as a fraud. Beria was no easy man to defeat, and his ethnicisation policies (that a local or republican leaders had to have ethnic origins, and speak the language of the given area) proved to be a tool to strengthen the MVD's grip on local party organs. Khrushchev and Malenkov, who had begun receiving information which stated that the MVD had begun spying on party officials, started to act in the spring of 1953. Beria was defeated at the next Presidium plenums by a majority against him, and not long after, Khrushchev and Malenkov started to plan Beria's fall from power. However, this was no easy task, as Beria was able to inspire fear in his colleagues. In Khrushchev's and Malenkov's first discussion with Kliment Voroshilov, Voroshilov did not want anything to do with it, because he feared \\"Beria's ears\\". However, Khrushchev and Malenkov were able to gather enough support for Beria's ouster, but only when a rumour of a potential coup led by Beria began to take hold within the party leadership. Afraid of the power Beria held, Khrushchev and Malenkov were prepared for a potential civil war. This did not happen, and Beria was forced to resign from all his party posts on 26 June, and was later executed on 23 December. Beria's fall also led to criticism of Stalin; the party leadership accused Beria of using Stalin, a sick and old man, to force his own will on the Soviet Union during Stalin's last days. This criticism, and much more, led party and state newspapers to launch more general criticism of Stalin and the Stalin era. A party history pamphlet went so far as to state that the party needed to eliminate \\"the incorrect, un-Marxist interpretation of the role of the individual in history, which is expressed in propaganda by the idealist theory of the cult of personality, which is alien to Marxism\\". Beria's downfall led to the collapse of his \\"empire\\"; the powers of the MVD was curtailed, and the KGB was established. Malenkov, while losing his secretaryship, was still Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and remained so until 1955. He initiated a policy of strengthening the central ministries, while at the same time ensuing populist policies, one example being to establish a savings of 20.2 billion rubles for Soviet taxpayers. In contrast, Khrushchev tried to strengthen the central party apparatus by focusing on the Central Committee. The Central Committee had not played a notable role in Soviet politics since Nikolai Bukharin's downfall in 1929. Stalin weakened the powers of the Central Committee by a mixture of repression and organisational restructuring. Khrushchev also called for the Party's role to supervise local organs, economic endeavors and central government activities. In September 1953, the Central Committee bestowed Khrushchev with the title of First Secretary, which made his seniority in the Central Committee official. With new acquired powers, Khrushchev was able to appoint associates to the leadership in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Armenia and Moldavia (modern Moldova), while Malenkov, in contrast, was able to appoint an associate to leadership only in Moscow. Under Khrushchev the local party leadership in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR) witnessed the largest turnover in provincial leaders since the Great Purge; two out of three provincial leaders were replaced in 1953 alone. Malenkov was assured an identical policy in government institutions; the most notable change being the appointment of Mikhail Pervukhin, Ivan Tevosian and Maksim Saburov to the Deputy Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. During the height of the Malenkov‚ÄìKhrushchev struggle, Khrushchev actively fought for improvements in Soviet agriculture and the strengthening of the role of the Central Committee. Khrushchev tried to revitalise the Central Committee by hosting several discussions on agriculture at the Central Committee plenums. While no other Presidium members were enthusiastic for such an approach, Khrushchev held several Central Committee meetings from February to March 1954 to discuss agriculture alone. By doing this, Khrushchev was acknowledging a long forgotten fact; the Presidium, the Secretariat and he himself were responsible to the Central Committee. Khrushchev could have gone the other way, since some people were already calling for decreasing the Central Committee's role to \\"cadres and propaganda alone\\". A further change was democratisation at the top of the party hierarchy, as Voroshilov noted at a Presidium meeting in 1954. By August 1954 Malenkov's role as de facto head of government was over; Nikolai Bulganin began signing Council of Ministers decrees (a right beholden to the Chairman) and the Presidium gave in to Khrushchev's wishes to replace Malenkov. Malenkov was called of revisionism because of his wishes to prioritise light industry over heavy industry. At the same time, Malenkov was accused of being involved in the Leningrad Affair which led to the deaths of innocent party officials. At the Central Committee plenum of 25 January 1955, Khrushchev accused Malenkov of ideological deviations at the same level as former, anti-Stalinist Bukharin and Alexey Rykov of the 1920s. Malenkov spoke twice to the plenum, but it failed to alter his position, and on 8 March 1955 he was forced to resign from his post as Chairman of the Council of Ministers; he was succeeded by Nikolai Bulganin, a protege of Khrushchev dating back to the 1930s. Malenkov still remained a powerful figure, and he retained his seat in the Presidium. The anti- Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Lazar Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At an 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a Central Committee plenum. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolian People's Republic; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow. At the 20th Party Congress Khrushchev, in his speech \\"On the Personality Cult and its Consequences\\", stated that Stalin, the Stalinist cult of personality and Stalinist repression had deformed true Leninist legality. The party became synonymous with a person, not the people ‚Äì the true nature of the party had become deformed under Stalin, and needed to be revitalised. These points, and more, were used against him, when Khrushchev was forced to resign from all his posts in 1964. Khrushchev had begun to initiate nepotistic policies, initiated policies without the consent of either the Presidium or the Central Committee, a cult of personality had developed and, in general, Khrushchev had developed several characteristics which he himself criticised Stalin of having at the 20th Party Congress. At the 21st Party Congress Khrushchev boldly declared that Leninist legality had been reestablished, when in reality, he himself was beginning to following some of the same policies, albeit not at the same level, as Stalin had. On 14 October 1964 the Central Committee, alongside the Presidium, made it clear that Khrushchev himself did not fit the model of a \\"Leninist leader\\", and he was forced to resign from all his post, and was succeeded by Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. =Brezhnev era: 1964‚Äì1982= Brezhnev was able to succeed Khrushchev because a majority in the Central Committee voted in favour of removing Khrushchev from office as both First Secretary and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Before initiating the palace coup against Khrushchev, Brezhnev had talked to several Central Committee members, and had a list which contained all of the Central Committee members who supported ousting Khrushchev. Brezhnev phoned Khrushchev, and asked him to meet him in Moscow. There, a convened Central Committee voted Khrushchev out of office, both as First Secretary of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers. At the beginning, Brezhnev's principal rival was Nikolai Podgorny, a member of the Secretariat. Podgorny was later \\"promoted\\" to the Chairmanship of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and Andrei Kirilenko replaced him as Secretary in charge of personnel policy. At the same time, Alexander Shelepin, another rival, was replaced as Chairman of the Party-State Control Commission and lost his post as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Shelepin was given a further blow when he was removed from the Secretariat. The number of Central Committee meetings rose again during Brezhnev's early tenure as elected First Secretary, but the number of meetings and their duration steadily decreased during Brezhnev's rule. Before Stalin's consolidation of power, the Central Committee featured open debate, where even leading officials could be criticised. This did not occur during the Brezhnev era, and Politburo officials rarely participated in its meetings; from 1966 to 1976, Alexei Kosygin, Podgorny and Mikhail Suslov attended a Central Committee meeting once; it was in 1973 to ratify the Soviet Union's treaty with West Germany. No Politburo or Secretariat members during the Brezhnev era were speakers during Central Committee meetings. The speaker at the Central Committee meeting which elected the Council of Ministers (the Government) and the Politburo was never listed during the Brezhnev era. Because the average duration of a Central Committee meeting decreased, and fewer meetings were held, many Central Committee members were unable to speak. Some members consulted the leadership beforehand, to ask to speak during meetings. During the May 1966 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev openly complained that only one member had asked him personally to be allowed to speak. The majority of speakers at Central Committee plenums were high- standing officials. By 1971, Brezhnev had succeeded in becoming first amongst equals in the Politburo and the Central Committee. Six years later, Brezhnev had succeeded in filling the majority of the Central Committee with Brezhnevites. But as Peter M.E. Volten noted, \\"the relationship between the general secretary and the central committee remained mutually vulnerable and mutually dependent.\\" The collective leadership of the Brezhnev era emphasised the stability of cadres in the party. Because of this, the survival ratio of full members of the Central Committee increased gradually during the era. At the 23rd Congress (29 March ‚Äì 8 April 1966) the survival ratio was 79.4 percent, it decreased to 76.5 percent at the 24th Congress (30 March ‚Äì 9 April 1971), increased to 83.4 percent at the 25th Congress (24 February ‚Äì 5 March 1976) and at its peak, at the 26th Congress (23 February ‚Äì 3 March 1981), it reached 89 percent. Because the size of the Central Committee expanded, the majority of members were either in their first or second term. It expanded to 195 in 1966, 141 in 1971, 287 in 1976 and 319 in 1981; of these, new membership consisted of 37, 30 and 28 percent respectively. Andropov succeeded Brezhnev as General Secretary =Andropov‚ÄìChernenko interregnum: 1982‚Äì1985= Andropov was elected the party's General Secretary on 12 November 1982 by a decision of the Central Committee. The Central Committee meeting was held less than 24 hours after the announcement of Brezhnev's death. A.R. Judson Mitchell claims that the Central Committee meeting which elected Andropov as General Secretary, was little more than a rubber stamp meeting. Andropov was in a good position to take over the control of the party apparatus; three big system hierarchs, Brezhnev, Kosygin and Suslov had all died. A fourth, Kirilenko, was forced into retirement. At the Central Committee meeting of 22 November 1982, Kirilenko lost his membership in the Politburo (after a decision within the Politburo itself), and Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee, was elected to the Secretariat. Ryzhkov became the Head of the Economic Department of the Central Committee, and became the leading Central Committee member on matters regarding economic planning. Shortly afterwards, Ryzhkov, after replacing Vladimir Dolgikh, began to oversee the civilian economy. At the 14‚Äì15 June 1983 Central Committee meeting, Vitaly Vorotnikov was elected as a candidate member of the Politburo, Grigory Romanov was elected to the Secretariat and five members of the Central Committee were given full membership. The election of Romanov in the Secretariat, weakened Chernenko's control considerably. Later, Yegor Ligachev was appointed as Head of the Party Organisational Work Department of the Central Committee. Certain Brezhnev appointees were kept, such as Viktor Chebrikov and Nikolai Savinkin. With these appointments, Andropov effectively wielded the powers of the nomenklatura. Even so, by the time he had succeeded in dominating the Central Committee, Andropov fell ill. He was unable to attend the annual parade celebrating the victory of the October Revolution. Chernenko, the official second-ranking secretary, competed for power with Mikhail Gorbachev. The meetings of the Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were postponed to the last possible moment because of Andropov's health. Changes continued however, and the Andropov appointees continued Andropov's course of introducing new blood into the Central Committee and Party apparatus. Vorotnikov and Mikhail Solomentsev were given full membership in the Politburo, Chebrikov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and Ligachev became a member of the Secretariat. Chernenko's position began to look precarious; Gorbachev was getting stronger by the day. Four days after Andropov's death, on 9 February 1984, Chernenko was elected as the party's General Secretary. Chernenko was elected as a compromise candidate by the Politburo; the Central Committee could never have accepted another candidate, considering that the majority of the Central Committee members were old Brezhnev appointees. The Politburo could not, despite its powers, elect a General Secretary not supported by the Central Committee. Even so, several leading Politburo members supported Chernenko, such as Nikolai Tikhonov and Viktor Grishin. To make matters worse for Chernenko, he did not have control over the Politburo; both Andrei Gromyko and Dmitriy Ustinov were both very independent politically, and the Politburo still contained several leading Andropov prot√©g√©s, such as Gorbachev, Vorotnikov, Solomontsev and Heydar Aliyev. Chernenko never got complete control over the Central Committee and Party apparatus; while Andropov never succeeded in removing the majority of Brezhnev appointees in the Central Committee, he had succeeding in dividing the Central Committee along factional lines. In this confusion, Chernenko was never able to become a strong leader. For example, Gorbachev quickly became the party's de facto Second Secretary, even though Chernenko did not support him. The distribution of power within the Central Committee turned Chernenko into little more than a figurehead. In contrast to previous general secretaries, Chernenko did not control the Cadre Department of the Central Committee, making Chernenko's position considerably weaker. However, Chernenko did strengthen his position considerably at the beginning of 1985, not long before his death. Chernenko died on 10 March 1985, and the Central Committee appointed Gorbachev General Secretary on 11 March. =Gorbachev era: 1985‚Äì1991= Gorbachev's election to the General Secretaryship was the quickest in Soviet history. The Politburo recommended Gorbachev to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee approved him. The Politburo meeting, which elected Gorbachev to the General Secretaryship, did not include such members as Dinmukhamed Konayev, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky and Vitaly Vorotnikov. Of these three, Konayev and Shcherbytsky were Brezhnevites, and Vorotnikov, while not supporting Gorbachev, took it for granted that Gorbachev would succeed Chernenko. It is conceivable, according to historian Archie Brown, that Konayev and Shcherbytsky would rather have voted in favour of Viktor Grishin as General Secretary, than Gorbachev. At the same meeting, Grishin was asked to chair the commission responsible for Chernenko's funeral; Grishin turned down the offer, claiming that Gorbachev was closer to Chernenko than he was. By doing this, he practically signaled his support for Gorbachev's accession to the General Secretaryship. Andrei Gromyko, the longtime foreign minister, proposed Gorbachev as a candidate for the General Secretaryship. The Politburo and the Central Committee elected Gorbachev as General Secretary unanimously. Ryzhkov, in retrospect, claimed that the Soviet system had \\"created, nursed and formed\\" Gorbachev, but that \\"long ago Gorbachev had internally rebelled against the native System.\\" In the same vein, Gorbachev's adviser Andrey Grachev, noted that he was a \\"genetic error of the system.\\" 19th Party Conference Gorbachev's policy of glasnost (literally openness) meant the gradual democratisation of the party. Because of this, the role of the Central Committee was strengthened. Several old apparatchiks lost their seats to more open-minded officials during the Gorbachev era. The plan was to make the Central Committee an organ where discussion took place; and in this Gorbachev succeeded. By 1988, several people demanded reform within the Communist Party itself. At the 19th Conference, the first party conference held since 1941, several delegates asked for the introduction of term limits, and an end to appointments of officials, and to introduce multi-candidate elections within the party. Some called for a maximum of two term-periods in each party body, including the Central Committee, others supported Nikita Khrushchev's policy of compulsory turnover rules, which had been ended by the Brezhnev leadership. Other people called for the General Secretary to either be elected by the people, or a \\"kind of party referendum\\". There was also talk about introducing age limits, and decentralising, and weakening the party's bureaucracy. The nomenklatura system came under attack; several delegates asked why the leading party members had rights to a better life, at least materially, and why the leadership was more-or-less untouchable, as they had been under Leonid Brezhnev, even if their incompetence was clear to everyone. Other complained that the Soviet working class was given too large a role in party organisation; scientific personnel and other white-collar employees were legally discriminated against. Duties and responsibilities The Central Committee was a collective organ elected at the annual party congress. It was mandated to meet at least twice a year to act as the party's supreme organ. Over the years, membership in the Central Committee increased; in 1934 there were 71 full members, in 1976 there were 287 full members. Central Committee members were elected to the seats because of the offices they held, not their personal merit. Because of this, the Central Committee was commonly considered an indicator for Sovietologists to study the strength of the different institutions. The Politburo was elected by and reported to the Central Committee. Besides the Politburo the Central Committee also elected the Secretariat and the General Secretary, the de facto leader of the Soviet Union. In 1919‚Äì1952 the Orgburo was also elected in the same manner as the Politburo and the Secretariat by the plenums of the Central Committee. In between Central Committee plenums, the Politburo and the Secretariat was legally empowered to make decisions on its behalf. The Central Committee (or the Politburo and/or Secretariat in its behalf) could issue nationwide decisions; decisions on behalf of the party were transmitted from the top to the bottom. Under Lenin the Central Committee functioned like the Politburo did during the post-Stalin era, as the party's leading collective organ. However, as the membership in the Central Committee steadily increased, its role was eclipsed by the Politburo. Between congresses the Central Committee functioned as the Soviet leadership's source for legitimacy. The decline in the Central Committee's standing began in the 1920s, and it was reduced to a compliant body of the Party leadership during the Great Purge. According to party rules, the Central Committee was to convene at least twice a year to discuss political matters (but not matters relating to military policy). =Elections= Delegates at the Party Congresses elected the members of the Central Committee. Nevertheless, there were no competitions for the seats of the Central Committee. The Soviet leadership decided beforehand who would be elected, or rather appointed, to the Central Committee. In the Brezhnev era, for instance, delegates at Party Congresses lost the power to vote in secret against candidates endorsed by the leadership. For instance, at the congresses in 1962 and 1971 the delegates elected the Central Committee unanimously. According to Robert Vincent Daniels the Central Committee was rather an assembly of representatives than an assembly of individuals. The appointment of members often had \\"an automatic character\\"; members were appointed to represent various institutions. While Jerry F. Hough agrees with Daniels analysis, he states that other factors must be included; for example an official with a bad relationship with the General Secretary would not be appointed to the Central Committee. The view that the Politburo appointed Central Committee members is also controversial, considering the fact that each new Central Committee were, in most cases, filled with supporters of the General Secretary. If the Politburo indeed chose the Central Committee membership, various factions would have arisen. While the Politburo theory states indirectly that the Party Congress is a non-important process, another theory, the circular-flow-of-power theory assumed that the General Secretary was able to build a power base among the party's regional secretaries. These secretaries in turn would elect delegates who supported the General Secretary. =Apparatus=Commissions At the 19th Conference, the first since 1941, Mikhail Gorbachev called for the establishment of Commissions of the Central Committee to allow Central Committee members more leeway in actual policy implementation. On 30 September 1988, a Central Committee Resolution established six Commissions, all of which were led either by Politburo members or Secretaries. The Commission on International Affairs was led by Alexander Yakovlev; Yegor Ligachev led the Commission on Agriculture; Georgy Razumovsky led the Commission on Party Building and Personnel; Vadim Medvedev became head of the Commission on Ideology; the Commission of Socio-economic Questions was led by Nikolay Slyunkov; and Viktor Chebrikov became the head of the Commission on Legal Affairs. The establishment of these commissions was explained in different ways, but Gorbachev later claimed that they were established to end the power struggle between Yakovlev and Ligachev on cultural and ideological matters, without forcing Ligachev out of politics. Ligachev, on the other hand, claimed that the commissions were established to weaken the prestige and power of the Secretariat. The number of meetings held by the Secretariat, following the establishments of the commissions, decreased drastically, before the body was revitalised following the 28th Party Congress (2 July 1990 ‚Äì 13 July 1990) (see \\"Secretariat\\" section). The commissions did not convene until early 1989, but some commission heads were given responsibilities immediately. For instance, Medvedev was tasked with creating \\"a new definition of socialism\\", a task which would prove impossible once Gorbachev became an enthusiastic supporter of some social democratic policies and thinking. Medvedev eventually concluded that the party still upheld Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, but would have to accept some bourgeois policies. Central Control Commission The Party Control Commission () was responsible for, in the words of the Party constitution, \\"... a) to oversee the implementation of decisions of the Party and the CPSU (b), b) investigate those responsible for violating party discipline, and c) to prosecute violations of party ethics.\\" The 18th Party Congress, held in 1939, recognised that the central task of the Control Commission would be to enhance the control of the Party control. The congress decided that the Control Commission would be, from then on, elected by the Central Committee in the immediate aftermath of the Congress, instead of being elected by the congress itself. Changes were also made to the constitution. It stated that the \\"Control Commission a) oversaw the implementation of the directives of the CPSU, (b) and the Soviet-economic agencies and party organisations; c) examined the work of local party organisations, d) investigate those responsible for abusing party discipline and the Party constitution\\". Departments The leader of a department was usually given the titles \\"head\\" (), but in practice the Secretariat had a major say in the running of the departments; for example, five of eleven secretaries headed their own departments in 1978. But normally specific secretaries were given supervising duties over one or more departments. Each department established its own cells, which specialised in one or more fields. These cells were called sections. By 1979, there were between 150 and 175 sections, of these only a few were known by name outside the Soviet Union. An example of a department is, for instance, the Land Cultivation section of the Agriculture Department or the Africa section of the International Department. As with the departments, a section was headed by an office named head. The official name for a departmental staff member was instructor (). During the Gorbachev era, a variety of departments made up the Central Committee apparatus. The Party Building and Cadre Work Department assigned party personnel in the nomenklatura system. The State and Legal Department supervised the armed forces, KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the trade unions, and the Procuracy. Before 1989 the Central Committee had several departments, but several were abolished in that year. Among these departments there was a Central Committee Department responsible for the economy as a whole, one for machine building, and one for the chemical industry, and so on. The party abolished these departments in an effort to remove itself from the day-to-day management of the economy in favor of government bodies and a greater role for the market, as a part of the perestroika process. General Secretary Gorbachev, the last General Secretary of the Central Committee, as seen during the Reykjav√≠k Summit in 1986 The post of General Secretary was established under the name Technical Secretary in April 1917, and was first held by Elena Stasova. Originally, in its first two incarnations, the office performed mostly secretarial work. The post of Responsible Secretary was then established in 1919 to perform administrative work. The post of General Secretary was established in 1922, and Joseph Stalin was elected its first officeholder. The General Secretary, as a post, was a purely administrative and disciplinary position, whose role was to do no more than determine party membership composition. Stalin used the principles of democratic centralism to transform his office into that of party leader, and later leader of the Soviet Union. In 1934, the 17th Party Congress did not elect a General Secretary and Stalin was an ordinary secretary until his death in 1953, although he remained the de facto leader without diminishing his own authority. Nikita Khrushchev reestablished the office on 14 September 1953 under the name First Secretary. In 1957 he was nearly removed from office by the Anti-Party Group. Georgy Malenkov, a leading member of the Anti-Party Group, worried that the powers of the First Secretary were virtually unlimited. Khrushchev was removed as leader on 14 October 1964, and replaced by Leonid Brezhnev. At first there was no clear leader of the collective leadership with Brezhnev and Premier Alexei Kosygin ruling as equals. However, by the 1970s Brezhnev's influence exceeded that of Kosygin's and he was able to retain this support by avoiding any radical reforms. The powers and functions of the General Secretary were limited by the collective leadership during Brezhnev's, and later Yuri Andropov's and Konstantin Chernenko's tenures. Mikhail Gorbachev, elected in 1985, ruled the Soviet Union through the office of the General Secretary until 1990, when the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the 1977 Soviet Constitution. This meant that the Communist Party lost its position as the \\"leading and guiding force of the Soviet society\\" and the powers of the General Secretary were drastically curtailed. Orgburo The Organisational Bureau, usually abbreviated Orgburo, was an executive party organ. The Central Committee organised the Orgburo. Under Lenin, the Orgburo met at least 3 times a week, and it was obliged to report to the Central Committee every second week. The Orgburo directed all organisational tasks of the party. In the words of Lenin, \\"the Orgburo allocates forces, while the Politburo decides policy.\\" In theory, the Orgburo decided all policies relating to administrative and personnel related issues. Decisions reached by the Orgburo would in turn be implemented by the Secretariat. The Secretariat could formulate and decide policies on party administration and personnel if all Orgburo members agreed with the decision. The Politburo frequently meddled in the affairs of the Orgburo, and became active in deciding administrative and personnel policy. Even so, the Orgburo remained an independent organ during Lenin's time, even if the Politburo could veto its resolutions. The Orgburo was an active and dynamic organ, and was in practice responsible for personnel selection for high-level posts; personnel selection for unimportant posts or lower-tier posts were the unofficial responsibility of the Secretariat. However, the Orgburo was gradually eclipsed by the Secretariat. The Orgburo was abolished in 1952 at the 19th Party Congress. Party education system The Academy of Social Sciences (, abbreviated ASS) was established on 2 August 1946 (and headquartered in Moscow) as an institution for higher education. It educated future Party and government officials, as well as university professors, scientists and writers. The education was based upon the worldview of the Communist Party and its ideology. It took three years for a student to graduate. Students could earn doctoral degrees in social sciences. The rector of the academy was also the chairman of the academy's Scientific Council. The ASS oversaw the propaganda system alongside the Institute of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. By the 1980s, the Academy of Social Sciences was responsible for the activities of the party schools, and became the leading organ in the Soviet education system. The Higher Party School (Russian: –í—ã—Å—à–∞—è –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–π–Ω–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞, abbreviated HPS (Russian: –í–ü–®)) was the organ responsible for teaching cadres in the Soviet Union. It was the successor of the Communist Academy which was established in 1918. The HPS itself was established in 1939 as the Moscow Higher Party School, and it offered its students a two-year training course for becoming a Party official. It was reorganised in 1956 to that it could offer more specialised ideological training. In 1956 the school in Moscow was opened for students from socialist countries. The Moscow Higher Party School was the party school with the highest standing. The school itself had eleven faculties until a Central Committee resolution in 1972 which demanded a shake-up in the curriculum. The first regional (schools outside Moscow) Higher Party School was established in 1946 By the early 1950s there existed 70 Higher Party Schools. During the reorganisation drive of 1956, Khrushchev closed-down thirteen of them, reclassified 29 of them as inter-republican and inter-oblast schools. The HPS carried out the ideological and theoretical training and retraining of the Party and government officials. Courses included the history of the Communist Party, Marxist‚ÄìLeninist philosophy, scientific communism, political economy of Party-building, the international communist movement, workers and the national liberation movements, the Soviet economy, agricultural economics, public law and Soviet development, journalism and literature, Russian and foreign languages among others. To study at the Higher Party School Party members had to have a higher education. Admission of students was conducted on the recommendation of the Central Committee of the Union republics, territorial and regional committees of the party. The Institute of Lenin at Soviet square, in 1931 The Institute of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism (Russian: –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –º–∞—Ä–∫—Å–∏–∑–º–∞- –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞, abbreviated IML (Russian: –ò–ú–õ)) was responsible for doctrinal scholarship. Alongside the Academy of Social Sciences, the IML was responsible for overseeing the propaganda system. The IML was established by a merger of the Institute of Marx‚ÄìEngels (Russian: –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –ö. –ú–∞—Ä–∫—Å–∞ –∏ –§. –≠–Ω–≥–µ–ª—å—Å–∞) and the Institute of Lenin (Russian: –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞) in 1931. It was a research institute which collected and preserved the documents of the writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Lenin. It published their works, wrote biographies, collected and stored documents on the prominent figures of the party, collected and published the magazine Questions on Party History. It also published monographs and collected documents related to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Party affairs, scientific communism and history of the international communist movement. A resolution of the Central Committee on 25 June 1968 provided the IML with the right to guide affiliate organisations ‚Äì the Institute of History of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the union republics, the Leningrad Regional Committee, the Museum of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, the Central Museum of Vladimir. Lenin and other affiliate organisastions, the coordination of all research in the field of historical-party science, observation of the publication of scientific papers and works of art and literature about the life and work of the classics of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, to provide scientific guidance on the subject of the old Bolsheviks. In 1972 the IML was divided into 9 departments which focused on; the works of Marx and Engels, the works of Lenin, the history of party-building, scientific communism, the history of the international communist movement, coordination branches of research, the Central Party Archive, the Party Library, the Museum of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The Institute of Social Sciences (Russian: –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—É–∫) was established in 1962. Its principal function was to educate foreign Communists from socialist countries and from Third World countries with socialist orientations. The institute came under the jurisdiction of the International Department of the Central Committee under Gorbachev. There was a significant minority within the institute who wished for, or believed in political reform. Politburo Excerpt of protocol of Politburo meeting of 17 January 1940, noting the decision to put 457 persons on trial and to execute 346 of them with the rest (111) being sent to the GULAG When Yakov Sverdlov died on 19 March 1919, the party lost its leading organiser. At the 8th Party Congress (18‚Äì23 March 1919) the Central Committee was instructed to establish the Political Bureau (Politburo), the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) and the Secretariat, which was to consist of one Responsible Secretary (later renamed to General Secretary). Originally, the Politburo was composed of 5 (full) members; its first members were Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Stalin, Lev Kamenev and Nikolay Krestinsky. There were three other (candidate) members; these were Nikolai Bukharin, Mikhail Kalinin and Grigory Zinoviev. At the beginning, the Politburo was charged with solving immediate problems ‚Äì it became the top- policy organ. Certain delegates of the 8th Party Congress raised objections to the establishment of the Politburo, claiming that its establishment would turn Central Committee members into second-class officials. In response, the Politburo was ordered to deliver reports to the Central Committee, and Central Committee members were given the right to attend Politburo sessions. At the sessions, Central Committee members could participate with a consultative voice, but could not vote on matters. According to Jerry F. Hough the Politburo in the post-Lenin period, played the role of the Soviet cabinet, and the Central Committee as the parliament to which it was responsible. Under Stalin the Politburo did not meet often as a collective unit, but was still an important body ‚Äì many of Stalin's closet prot√©g√©s were members. Membership in the Politburo gradually increased in the era from Lenin until Brezhnev, partly because of Stalin's centralisation of power in the Politburo. The Politburo was renamed in 1952 to the Presidium, and kept that name until 1966. According to Brezhnev, the Politburo met at least once a week, usually on Thursdays. A normal session would last between three and six hours. In between the 24th Party Congress (30 March ‚Äì 9 April 1971) and the 25th Party Congress (24 February ‚Äì 5 March 1976), the Politburo convened, at least officially, 215 times. According to Brezhnev, the Politburo decides on \\"the most important and urgent questions of internal and foreign policy\\". The Politburo exercised both executive and legislative powers. Pravda Pravda (translates to The Truth) was a leading newspaper in the Soviet Union and an organ of the Central Committee. The Organisational Department of the Central Committee was the only organ empowered to relieve Pravda editors from their duties. Pravda was at the beginning a project begun by members of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905. Leon Trotsky was approached about the possibility of running the new paper because of his previous work in Kyivan Thought, a Ukrainian paper. The first issue was published on 3 October 1908. The paper was originally published in Lvov, but until the publication of the sixth issue in November 1909, the whole operation was moved to Vienna, Austria-Hungary. During the Russian Civil War, sales of Pravda were curtailed by Izvestia, the government run newspaper. At the time, the average reading figure for Pravda was 130,000. This Pravda (the one headquartered in Vienna) published its last issue in 1912, and was succeeded by a new newspaper, also called Pravda, headquartered in St. Petersburg the same year. This newspaper was dominated by the Bolsheviks. The paper's main goal was to promote Marxist‚ÄìLeninist philosophy and expose the lies of the bourgeoisie. In 1975 the paper reached a circulation of 10.6 million people. Secretariat The Secretariat headed the CPSU's central apparatus and was solely responsible for the development and implementation of party policies. It was legally empowered to take over the duties and functions of the Central Committee when it was not in plenum (did not hold a meeting). Many members of the Secretariat concurrently held a seat in the Politburo. According to a Soviet textbook on party procedures, the Secretariat's role was that of \\"leadership of current work, chiefly in the realm of personnel selection and in the organisation of the verification of fulfillment [of party-state decisions]\\". \\"Selections of personnel\\" () in this instance means the maintenance of general standards and the criteria for selecting various personnel. \\"Verification of fulfillment\\" () of party and state decisions meant that the Secretariat instructed other bodies. The Secretariat controlled, or had a major say in, the running of Central Committee departments (see Departments section). The members of the Secretariat, the secretaries, supervised Central Committee departments, or headed them. However, there were exceptions such as Mikhail Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko who supervised other secretaries on top of their individual responsibilities over Soviet policy (foreign relations and ideological affairs in the case of Suslov; personnel selection and the economy in the case of Kirilenko). While the General Secretary formally headed the Secretariat, his responsibilities not only as the leader of the party but the entire Soviet state left him little opportunity to chair its sessions let alone provide detailed oversight of its work . This led to the creation of a de facto Deputy General Secretary otherwise known as a \\"Second Secretary\\" who was responsible for the day-to-day running of the Secretariat. The powers of the Secretariat were weakened under Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Central Committee Commissions took over the functions of the Secretariat in 1988. Yegor Ligachev, a Secretariat member, noted that these changes completely destroyed the Secretariat's hold on power, and made the body almost superfluous. Because of this, the Secretariat, until 1990, barely met. However, none of these Commissions were as powerful as the Secretariat had been. The Secretariat was revitalised at the 28th Party Congress (2 July 1990 ‚Äì 13 July 1990). A newly established office, the Deputy General Secretary, became the official Director of the Secretariat. Gorbachev chaired the first post-Congress session, but after that Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, chaired its meetings. Though the Secretariat was revitalised, it never regained the authority it held in the pre-Gorbachev days. The Secretariat's authority was strengthened within the limits of the institutions and political rules, which had been introduced under Gorbachev ‚Äì a return to the old-days was impossible. Physical location The Central Committee had its offices on the Staraya Square in Moscow. There were over a dozen buildings in that area, known as the \\"party town\\", that the Central Committee controlled. There was a three-story restaurant, buffets, travel bureau, a post office, bookstore, a cinema and a sports center. They employed about 1,500 people in the 1920s, and about 3,000 in 1988.

In 1627 he was appointed lieutenant of the ordnance in the place of his brother Sir William, who was killed in the expedition to the Isle of Rh√©. Between 1627 and 1643 Heydon was actively occupied in furnishing men, provisions, arms, guns, and ammunition for the service of the king . When Charles I raised his standard at Nottingham on 22 August 1642, Heydon was in charge of cannon and ammunition at York. He soon joined the king, and accompanied the Royalist army from Shrewsbury towards London in October 1642. He acted as Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance with Charles's forces, and joined his Privy Council. He was made D.C.L. at Oxford on 20 December 1642.

ECRC constitutes a part of the Institute of Genetics & Molecular Medicine (IGMM) and is positioned in direct proximity of the Western General Hospital, where most of its clinical activities take place. Scientific activities A broad spectrum of tumor types are studied in the Centre although the main strengths of ECRC lay in the areas of breast, colorectal, ovarian and brain cancers. They include research focused on: * Stem cells and the cancer stem cell niche * Signal transduction and biological mechanisms * Lifestyle, risk and prevention * Stratification for prevention and therapy * Cancer Informatics In these fields the ECRC has gained international recognition in innovative biomedical research and belongs to the Cancer Research UK Centres network of excellence. The ECRC investigators play also an important role in the palliative care practice and research. As of 2015, research in the ECRC is carried out by 27 independent research teams. In addition, 9 clinical researchers and 14 affiliated research groups are associated with the Centre. Several technology platforms, including mass spectrometry, reverse phase protein arrays and advanced microscopy, support the research activities. Since 2011, the ECRC also hosts a dedicated drug discovery unit. Since 2010, the institute is led by Margaret Frame (as the Science Director) and David Cameron (as the Clinical Director) with help and advise from the ECRC Governance Board. The ECRC works closely with the Edinburgh Cancer Centre and NHS Lothian, supporting clinical trials and cancer informatics research that is embedded within the NHS care of Scottish cancer patients. Recent highlights from ECRC scientists and clinicians include: * Important role (David Cameron as joint global Chief Investigator) in the pivotal clinical trial that tested the hypothesis that the combination of lapatinib and the cytotoxic drug capecitabine would be superior to capecitabine alone in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer that had progressed despite trastuzumab treatment. The results of this trial has led to a global (more than 100 countries) marketing authorisation of the drug lapatinib produced by GlaxoSmithKline. * Identification of new gene variants linked to colorectal cancer. * Evidence-based identification of an effective treatment of depression in cancer patients. Governance Board The Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre was established in The University of Edinburgh (UoE) in close partnership with Cancer Research UK and the NHS Lothian, and has strong links to other Institutes and Colleges conducting cancer research in Edinburgh, in particular the Institute of Genetics & Molecular Medicine. The ECRC follows a partnership model in which key stakeholders are actively and directly involved in the strategic governance and growth of the Centre. Teaching and Training As a part of the Institute of Genetics & Molecular Medicine, ECRC is affiliated with the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine of the University of Edinburgh. It provides biomedical research and career training for over 30 PhD students. Many PhD positions are filled in the frame of IGMM 4 Year Graduate School Programme, but there are also some externally funded PhD-studentships and PhD positions specifically aimed for cancer clinicians. The available positions are awarded on competitive basis. ECRC scientists and clinicians actively participate in the teaching programmes of the University of Edinburgh. Ten researchers based in ECRC hold full professorships at the University. The ECRC also offers training in biomedical research to postdoctoral fellows. Applications for these positions are opened to all nationalities and are highly competitive. Public Engagement Rising awareness about cancer, cancer prevention, healthy lifestyle and science among patients, fundraisers and general public is an important part of the ECRC mission. Activities in this area are closely coordinated with Cancer Research UK and include many diverse events ranging from guided tours of the Centre to participation in fundraising events and science festivals. History In 1978, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) - a major charity supporting cancer research in the United Kingdom at the time, decided to provide an ¬£800,000 endowment to support creation of a Chair of Medical Oncology in the Faculty of Medicine in Edinburgh. Following an open competition, the University of Edinburgh appointed John F. Smyth (at the time a senior lecturer in medical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London) for that position on 1 April 1979. After a short visit to the University of Chicago, professor Smyth assumed his duties in Edinburgh on 1 October 1979 (a date that can be considered as the beginning of the Centre). Soon afterwards, additional posts were provided by the University and matched by appropriate staff positions by Lothian Health Board (NHS) to create first clinical service for medical oncology in Edinburgh. The service was based in the Western General Hospital where some beds and out-patient facilities were provided. In 1980 it was formally recognized as the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit in Edinburgh with professor John Smyth as its director. This resulted in additional funding that allowed building of a small research laboratory which was commissioned in 1981. The laboratory was located in a portable cabin on the Western General Hospital campus. The main focus of the Unit was the development of more successful drug therapies for all forms of cancer and looking for new ways of reducing the side-effects of anti-cancer drugs. With generous support from Imperial Cancer Research Fund and other organisations, the Unit was steadily growing enabling clinical trials for promising anticancer therapeutics. For example, the Unit was responsible for the very first clinical trial of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, heralding in the dramatic changes in emesis control that subsequently followed the development of that class of compounds. In 1984 the Unit moved to a new location at the top floor of the MRC Human Genetics Unit building which allowed for expansion of laboratory research activities. After a successful ICRF review in 1996, it had been recognized that further extension of scientific activities of the Unit required even more space and prof. Smyth obtained permission to rise funds to create a new purpose designed building. The work started in 2000 and the new ¬£7M building was officially opened in 2002 by The Princess Royal. It provides 3000 square meters of gross internal space and is a current base for majority of ECRC researchers. At that time (in 2002), following reorganisation of faculties into schools within the University of Edinburgh, the name Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre was created and used with reference to the Unit and the new building. In 2004 the successor of ICRF, Cancer Research UK, also started to refer to the Unit as the CRUK Clinical Cancer Centre to emphasize its status as a comprehensive cancer centre. In 2007 ECRC became part of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine. In 2010, following a successful bid, ECRC has been formally recognized as Cancer Research UK Centre and is known as Edinburgh Cancer Research UK Centre. =ECRC Directors= 1980 ‚Äì 2005 John Smyth (initially as a director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit) 2005 ‚Äì 2009 David Harrison 2010 ‚Äì present Margaret Frame (Science Director) and David Cameron (Clinical Director)  See also  * Cancer in the United Kingdom  Notes and references External links * Official website of the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre Category:Cancer organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Medical research institutes in the United Kingdom Category:Research institutes in Edinburgh Category:University of Edinburgh ","title":"Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre"},{"id":"41585923","text":"St. Josaphat Cathedral may refer to: ;Canada *St. Josaphat Cathedral, Edmonton, Alberta ;United States *St. Josaphat's Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral (Parma, Ohio) ","title":"St. Josaphat Cathedral (disambiguation)"},{"id":"41585929","text":"Gayathri () is a 2014 Indian Tamil-language soap opera that aired on Zee Tamil.

The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos  A journalist who had become a propagandist and confidant for Ferdinand Marcos, Primitivo ‚ÄúTibo‚Äù Mijares had served under Marcos since 1963 and claimed to have been privy to government‚Äôs high-level doings. As Chairman of the National Press Club, Mijares ran the Media Advisory Council, a state agency established to censor the press in 1973. Upon the declaration of martial law in September 1972, and with the power to choose which media outlet would be re-opened, the Mijares-led Media Advisory Council was accused of abusing its role and was criticized as a \\"money-raising tool,\\" leading one of its members, Emil Jurado, to resign. Mijares himself, after failing to account for NPC funds, ran away to the US, and joined Manglapus' Movement for a Free Philippines and wrote the book. Mijares said that he was offered a bribe amounting to US$100,000 to be dissuaded to testify about the human rights situation in the Philippines, and said that he refused the bribe. However, whether there was a bribe by Marcos' associates or whether Mijares himself extorted money from Marcos, and whether Mijares actually received money from Marcos remains unclear. Steve Psinakis, an anti-Marcos critic married into the Lopez family that owns ABS-CBN, wrote in his memoir A Country Not Even His Own‚Äù (2008): ‚ÄúThe investigation (referring to the U.S. Justice Department investigation) revealed that after his February 1975 defection, Mijares did, in fact extort money from Marcos by feeding him imaginary information for which Marcos was ignorant enough to pay considerable sums. While Mijares was still receiving money from Marcos, he was at the same time lambasting Marcos in the U.S. press, causing the Marcos regime irreparable damage. It is no wonder the only natural conclusion is that Marcos had his vengeance and did Mijares in.‚Äù A declassified U.S. Department of State cable dated February 24, 1975 further casts doubt on Mijares credibility, noting that \\"Mijares' moved not surprising to Manila Community which recognizes him as complete opportunist who recently was feeling hot breath of Martial Law Regime for certain recent extra-curricular activities. Allegedly, Mijares gambled away 50,000 dollars of GOP funds during a 1974 Las Vegas visit, misappropriated for personal use 7,000 dollars of the First Lady's personal funds and attempted to rape a well connected Philippine foreign service secretary while in New York for the trade center opening,\\" and that \\"final push to action may in fact have been provided by Philippine opposition group in US and financial inducements of Lopez family members. Local Lopezes got word of San Francisco story February 21 and quickly began telephoning glad news around town.\\" Attempts to refute some of the book's claims have arisen after more than a decade since its publication. For example, the book insinuated that Marcos plotted the Plaza Miranda bombing to wipe out the entire Liberal Party leadership and that the weapon landing from China for the communists along the coast of Isabela was 'staged'. In 1989, four \\"former former ranking Party officials\\" admitted to the plot to bomb Plaza Miranda, and former NPA Victor Corpuz admitted that their plot was foiled when the weapons that they were about to receive from communist China was intercepted by the military. However, no official statement from the Communist Party of the Philippines exists taking credit for the Plaza Miranda bombing. = Online release and revised edition reprint = On May 2016, the heirs of Primitivo Mijares released The Conjugal Dictatorship as a free e-book download from the Ateneo de Manila Rizal Library. In February 2017, a revised and annotated reprint of the book was released by Mijares' grandson Joseph Christopher \\"JC\\" Mijares Gurango. The Mijares family admitted that what happened to Primitivo and his youngest son Boyet was so traumatic that they did not want to talk about it, but decided to break their silence with the resurgence of Marcos in the political scene, culminated by the burial of Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani and near victory of the dictator's namesake and son Ferdinand Jr. in the 2016 national elections.

The app delivering these services was renamed Free Basics in September 2015. As of November 2016, 40 million people were using internet.org. It has been criticized for violating net neutrality, and by handpicking internet services that are included, for discriminating against companies not in the list, including Facebook's rivals. In February 2016, regulators banned the Free Basics service in India based on \\"Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations\\". The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) accused Facebook of failing to pass on the four questions in the regulator's consultation paper and also blocking access to TRAI's designated email for feedback on Free Basics. On February 11, 2016, Facebook withdrew the Free Basics platform from India. History Mobile with Free Basics zero rating plan showing Spanish Wikipedia main page in Mexico Internet.org was launched on August 20, 2013. At the time of launch, Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a ten-page whitepaper he had written elaborating on the vision that asserts that connectivity is a \\"human right\\". In the paper, he wrote that Internet.org was a further step in the direction of Facebook's past initiatives, such as Facebook Zero, to improve Internet access for people around the world. During TechCrunch Disrupt on September 11, 2013 Zuckerberg elaborated further on his vision. TechCrunch blog compared Internet.org with Google's Project Loon. Zuckerberg also released a video on September 30, 2013 explaining Internet.org's goal of making the Internet 100 times more affordable. On February 24, 2014, shortly before a keynote presentation by Zuckerberg at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on February 24, 2014, Internet.org unveiled several new projects: an education partnership called SocialEDU with Nokia and local carrier AirTel, edX, and the government in Rwanda; a project with Unilever in India; and a new Internet.org Innovation Lab with Ericsson in its Menlo Park HQ. In the presentation, Zuckerberg says that Facebook's recent acquisition of mobile messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion was closely related to the Internet.org vision. In May 2015, Facebook announced the Internet.org Platform, an open program for developers to easily create services that integrate with Internet.org. This was seen by commentators as a response to concerns raised over net neutrality. Participating websites must meet three criteria: # Explore the entire internet (so as to give users a taste of the wider Internet and therefore help them see the value of the Internet), # Efficiency of data use (so that it would be economical for carriers to allow free access to the websites), and # Technical specifications: optimized for browsing on a wide range of devices including smartphones and less sophisticated mobile devices, and should not be dependent on JavaScript or HTTPS. = Satellite development = On March 27, 2014, Facebook announced a connectivity lab as part of the Internet.org initiative, with the goal of bringing the Internet to everybody via drones, acquired from the company Ascenta. It is also communicated by the Connectivity Lab, that, besides using drones, low-Earth orbit and geosynchronous satellites would also be part of the project, for establishing internet connectivity in other areas. All three systems would rely on free space optics (FSO). In free space optics, the signal is sent in a compact bundle of infrared light At Mobile World Congress March 2015, Mark Zuckerberg says that the Internet.org initiative was \\"willing to work\\" with Project Loon (Google's project to use high-altitude balloons to provide people cheaper Internet access) but emphasizes that in his view, the real work is in partnering with existing telecommunications companies to improve access and reduce costs for people already within range of a network, which he estimates at over 80% of the population. In October 2015, Facebook and Eutelsat leased the entire Ka-band capacity (36 spot beams with a total throughput of 18 Gbit/s) on the planned Amos-6 satellite to provide access to parts of Africa Amos-6 was intended to be launched on Flight 29 of a SpaceX Falcon 9 to geosynchronous transfer orbit on 3 September 2016. However, on 1 September 2016, during the run-up to a static fire test, there was an anomaly on the launch pad resulting in a fire and the loss of the vehicle and its payload, Amos-6. There were no injuries. In January 2016, Google had exited Facebook's Free Basics platform in Zambia. They were included in the initial trial of this project, which was first launched in Zambia. = Net neutrality criticism in India = The first Internet.org summit was held on 9 October 2014 in New Delhi, India. The primary objective of this summit was to bring together experts, officials and industry leaders to focus on ways to deliver more Internet services for people in languages other than English. Zuckerberg also met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to talk about how Facebook and the Indian government can collaborate on Internet.org. In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an article for Hindustan Times stating that Internet.org and net neutrality can co-exist and Internet.org will never differentiate between services. His claims were contested by many response articles, including one published in the Hindustan Times. In May 2015, the Internet.org Platform, open to participation by any developers meeting specified guidelines, was announced. Some commentators viewed this announcement as a response to the net neutrality concerns expressed. The PMO has expressed displeasure at Facebook's reaction to and handling of TRAI's consultation paper, calling it a crudely majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll. An Indian journalist, in his reply to Mark Zuckerberg's article defending Internet.org in India, criticized Internet.org as \\"being just a Facebook proxy targeting India's poor\\" as it provides restricted Internet access to Reliance Telecom's subscribers in India. Until April 2015, Internet.org users could access (for free) only a few websites, and Facebook's role as gatekeeper in determining what websites were in that list was criticised for violating net neutrality. In May 2015, Facebook announced that the Free Basics Platform would be opened to websites that met its criteria. In April 2015, some Indian startups start pulling out of Internet.org to protect net neutrality. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in January 2016 criticized Facebook for its misleading commercials and astroturfing the Free Basics campaign. TRAI accused Facebook of failing to pass on the four questions in the regulator's consultation paper and also blocking access to TRAI's designated email for feedback on Free Basics. On February 8, 2016, TRAI banned the Free Basics service in India based on \\"Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016\\" notification. On February 11, 2016 Facebook withdrew the Free Basics platform from India. In May 2017, Facebook, in partnership with Indian telecoms operator Bharti Airtel, launched a service under the Express Wi-Fi banner.

The estimations and reserves of energy resources show future potentials but a small fraction of them are being utilized which proved to be insufficient. Moreover, the impact of climate change and environment pollution has also been significantly felt. As a result, the successive governments have aimed at formulating an effective energy policy which would address these concerns. The energy policies have also received extensive criticisms especially on the questions of energy export and methods of extraction.  History  The first National Energy Policy (NEP) of Bangladesh was formulated in 1996 by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral resources to ensure proper exploration, production, distribution and rational use of energy resources to meet the growing energy demands of different zones, consuming sectors and consumers groups on a sustainable basis. With rapid change of global as well as domestic situation, the policy was updated in 2004. The updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment, to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the entire country under electrification by the year 2020.  Energy resources = Natural gas = Natural gas accounts for about 70% of the country's commercial energy supply. According to a study conducted in 2003 by Hydrocarbon unit of the Energy and Mineral Resources Division and Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the initial gas reserve of the 22 discovered gas fields of the country amounts to 28.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF) out of which 20.5 TCF is considered recoverable. In 2000, United States Geological Survey conducted a study for undiscovered gas reserve of the country. According this study, there are possibilities to explore another 32 TCF of natural gas. Another study conducted by Hydrocarbon Unit and Norwegian Petroleum Directorate in 2001 concluded that additional 42 TCF of natural gas could be discovered in the country. In recent years, experts have raised concerns that the existing proven reserves could be extirpated by 2020 and have called for immediate exploration of new gas fields.http://www.dhakatribune.com/op-ed/2013/sep/11/energy-hope-and-reality = Coal = Bangladesh has a reserve of approximately 3 billion tons of steam grade Bituminous coal as discovered till 2003. These reserves are mainly concentrated into the five large coal fields in the northwestern regions of the country, namely Jamalganj, Barapukuria, Khalashpir, Dighipara and Phulbari.http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=164481:coal- and-bangladeshs-energy-scenario&catid;=169:op-ed&Itemid;=201  Energy conservation  The NEP called for conservation measures to be strictly enforced to ensure rational, economic and efficient use of energy. The major means of energy conservation have been pointed out as energy audit, reduction of wastage, demand management and efficient use. Experts have suggested to initiate the energy conservation act, which would significantly reduce the energy demand of the country.http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news- details.php?nid=227763 See also References External links Category:Energy in Bangladesh Bangladesh ","title":"Energy policy of Bangladesh"},{"id":"41586068","text":"Lois Landgraf is an American politician and a Republican member of the Colorado House of Representatives representing District 21 since January 9, 2013.

The son of the revolutionary Georges Danton and his 16-year old stepmother.Impression in the Rijksmuseum √Ä la poup√©e is a largely historic intaglio printmaking technique for making colour prints by applying different ink colours to a single printing plate using ball-shaped wads of cloth, one for each colour. The paper has just one run through the press, but the inking needs to be carefully re-done after each impression is printed. Each impression will usually vary at least slightly, and sometimes very significantly.Gascoigne, 26a; Griffiths, 117 Though invented much earlier, the technique became common from the late 17th century into the early 19th century. It was always an alternative to, and often combined with, hand colouring, usually with watercolour and brush.Gascoigne, 26a; Griffiths, 117 Large areas, such as the sky in landscapes, might be done √† la poup√©e, with more detailed parts hand coloured.Gascoigne, 26a It was used with all the various intaglio printmaking techniques, but tended to be most effective with stipple engraving, \\"giving a bright and clean look\\".Gascoigne, 26a The term √† la poup√©e means \\"with the doll\\" in French, the \\"doll\\" being the wad of cloth, shaped like a ball. The term only came into use after about 1900, with a variety of contemporary terms being used in different languages. In fact technical descriptions make it clear that the ink was applied with a \\"stump brush\\" at least as much as by the \\"doll\\".Stijnman and Savage, 46‚Äì47 It may be called the \\"dolly method\\" in English.Portland Art Museum, Glossary Technique Detail of Amor and Psyche, after Simon Vouet, engraving inked √† la poup√©e, with additional hand-colouring (the flesh colour, pink in the robe and Amor's yellow hair), Teyler workshop, 1688‚Äì98.The whole print. There is also a light black or grey wash, seen on Psyche's hair. As with a monochrome print in an intaglio technique (such as engraving, etching, mezzotint and aquatint), the ink was spread on the plate (normally copper) and then wiped off the surface, leaving ink only in the lines or other areas below the main level of the plate. This was much more difficult, and slower, when different colours of ink were applied to different areas, requiring what was in effect a painting process rather than just spreading a single colour over the whole plate with what we would call today a squeegee. Where \\"surface tone\\" was wanted, not all the ink was wiped off the face of the plate. The high-pressure press pushed the slightly damp paper into these recesses to collect the ink and print the image. To ready the plate for the next impression, it was wiped clean and the whole process was repeated. Presumably the printer normally worked off a model, probably in watercolour.Lambert, 88, 97; Griffiths, 31‚Äì34 on \\"normal\\" intaglio printmaking Unusually for a significant artist, Mary Cassat did the inking for her famous group of 1891 herself, and found printing 25 impressions of ten prints, with the help of a professional printer, \\"a great work ... Sometimes we worked all day (eight hours) both as hard as we could work and only printed eight or ten proofs in the day\\".Ives, 45‚Äì46 The technique varied somewhat; an account based on a 19th-century Parisian practice said a fairly light \\"ground tint, usually brown black or grey\\" was applied first, all over except for flesh areas, giving a \\"slight tone\\" which \\"dominated the picture\\".Lambert, 88 (quoted), 97 But the leading early practitioner Johannes Teyler for one did not do this, inking purely linear plates in different colours, risking that, according to Antony Griffiths, the results \\"look very odd\\".Griffiths, 119 Later printmakers generally used √† la poup√©e inking with techniques that gave tone rather than just line, such as stipple engraving, mezzotint and aquatint. It was commonly used with mezzotint plates that had begun to wear out (as they rather quickly did) to disguise this, although this is not always the case, as some proof impressions use it.Griffiths, 119; Lambert, 102 History Elisha Kirkall, Heroic Stormy Landscape, mezzotint and etching printed √† la poup√©e in two colours, after Jan van Huysum, 1724 The earliest known example of the technique is an impression of a religious engraving of about 1525 by Agostino Veneziano, where the Virgin and Child are printed in red, and the surrounding saints and background in blue. When this was printed is uncertain. Other early uses of the technique, many decades later, are to colour illustrated title pages of books otherwise illustrated in black and white. The earliest title page to use this was the Architectura of Wendel Dietterlin, with various Nuremberg editions from 1593 to 1598; this was a heavily-illustrated and very influential book on architectural ornament.Stijnman and Savage, 43 The revival in interest in the technique about a century later was due to the Dutch artist (among various other professions) Johannes Teyler, who in 1688 received a patent for the technique and financed a Dutch workshop to produce prints in the technique.Stijnman and Savage, 43 This was not very long-lived; over about ten years, the workshop produced over 800 different prints using up to eight colours. These were mostly of decorative subjects of all the various types of the day, but included reproductive prints of old masters, more often French than Dutch or Italian.Les estampes en couleurs de Johannes Teyler, INHA, Paris The technique was soon taken up by others, especially in the Netherlands, and later France. From about 1695, a number of Amsterdam publishers began putting out prints in the technique.Stijnman and Savage, 45‚Äì46 The first published description of the technique is in the 3rd edition of 1745 of the manual on etching by the French artist Abraham Bosse, De la mani√®re de graver √† l'eaux- forte et au burin..., first published a century earlier.Stijnman and Savage, 43 In the second half of the 18th century the technique began to be used to colour more elaborate prints that were also issued in monochrome,Lambert, 101, her 82A and B show monochome and colour impressions of the same print the coloured impressions being much more expensive, and probably intended for framing.Griffiths, 118 Considerably different colour schemes across different impressions of some prints suggest that at times coloured versions were pulled individually for a specific order.Lambert, 102 In England, Elisha Kirkall was an early user, in mezzotints of the 1720s, and Robert Laurie, an engraver of maps and other subjects later in the century, extended the number of colours that were used, helping to make the technique fashionable again.Griffiths, 118 Towards the end of the century, the Italian Francesco Bartolozzi and his followers made much use of it, and in France it was used for the illustrations to luxury scientific books, culminating in those of the botanical illustrator Pierre-Joseph Redout√©, such as his Les Roses (1817‚Äì24).Grove, 557 Redout√© had the many artists working from his watercolours print them with inking √† la poup√©e and then hand-colour details where necessary.Grove; \\"Redoute, Les Roses, Antique Prints, Paris, 1817‚Äì24\\", George Glazer Gallery As other, cheaper, methods of colour printing developed in the mid-19th century, the usage of √† la poup√©e declined. But at the end of the century, a set of ten prints by Mary Cassatt was an early example of the technique being applied individually by a significant artist, rather than a printshop worker following a painted model. She used drypoint, etching and aquatint and colour applied √† la poup√©e. The prints were influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, especially those of Utamaru, which were made using complicated multiple blocks.Ives, 45‚Äì54 Peter Ilsted also used the technique, mainly with mezzotint.The National Museum of Western Art, The Dining Room at Liselund, 1917 and the French printmaker Manuel Robbe used it with aquatint.\\"Manuel Robbe\\", Galerie Maximillian Various later artists have used the technique at times.

Of Jewish descent, Maddox had been born John Medex and used \\"Maddox\\" as an ornamental suffix. His brother, Samuel Medex kept a cigar shop directly opposite the Princess's Theatre and his premises became something of a meeting point for London's actors and playwrights.The Life & Adventures of George Augustus Sala Until taking over the Princesses Theatre in 1842, Maddox had led a roving life as stage-manager, acting-manager, and agent. He had also enjoyed a brief spell as manager of London's Colosseum theatre. Charles, Duke of Brunswick, an exiled German aristocrat and London character, lent Maddox the cash to tide him over during the first few months of his management. His first productions at the Princesses were the opera La Sonnambula and an Oriental burlesque. The chief feature of Maddox's reign were English versions of Italian operas, with productions of Anna Bolena, Lucia di Lammermoor, Otello, I puritani and Lucrezia Borgia. Maddox prospered, and gradually enlarged his sphere of operations. The first English version of the French vaudeville, L'homme Blesse, was brought out at the Princesses in 1842-43, after which he staged Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide extravaganzas, but shrank from the financial risk of a Christmas pantomime. He was not averse to paying good salaries to first-rate English comedians‚Äîin particular Mr. and Mrs. Keeley who drew huge crowds to the theatre. Robert Keeley eventually took over as co-manager with Charles Kean after Maddox retired. Maddox was also a prolific playwright and authored a number of dramas and farces, as well as sub-contracting work to a number of hack writers and translators. It was reputed that he was in the habit of locking up his them up in a garret at the theatre, leaving them just enough cold meat, bread and alcohol as was necessary, and not releasing them until they had finished the work he had paid them for. One of his earlier prot√©g√©s was George Augustus Sala who undertook scene-painting for the theatre and later found a degree of fame writing pieces for Charles Dickens' Household Words.

The book follows narrator Sarah Parsons, who discovers she has altered the course of history through the use of a psychic ability that has been passed down through the women living at the family's ancestral estate outside of Annapolis, Maryland. Neverwas is a young adult paranormal mystery novel set in a dystopian alternate history. The books setting is in a mid-twentieth century United States with an undefeated Confederacy to examine issues such as racism, sexism, and xenophobia. Plot summary Picking up three months after Amber House left off, Sarah and her family relocate from the Pacific Northwestern nation of Astoria to live at Amber House with her aunt Maggie. Unbeknownst to Sarah, her actions at the end of Amber House propelled her and her loved ones into an alternate reality: North America is a collection of separate nations ‚Äî including the American Confederation of States, which still struggles with segregation and sexism ‚Äî and Nazis control all of Europe. With little recollection of what happened in Amber House, Sarah must rediscover her psychometric ability (which was suppressed in this timeline by her grandmother Ida and mother Anne after use of the \\"family gift\\" nearly killed Maggie) and track down \\"echoes\\" of the past that will help her remember the way things used to be. Sarah is once again thrown together with Richard Hathaway, whose senator father is about to run for the Presidency, but finds she inexplicably yearns for Jackson Harris, little knowing how close the two grew in the time before. Sarah learns she is distantly related to both Jackson and Richard; all share Captain Joseph Foster as a common ancestor from the 1700s. A smuggler and slave owner, Foster married Sarah's ancestress Deirdre Dobson after the death of his first wife, Lydia, who died during the birth of Foster's oldest daughter, Camilla. It is from Camilla that Richard is descended, from an illegitimate daughter fathered by Foster and the slave Nyangu that Jackson is descended, and from Foster and Dobson's daughter Sarah-Louise that Sarah is descended. With the help of Jackson's precognition, Sarah realizes that a mysterious artifact that belonged to the Captain and that was passed down through the generations to Richard's mother Claire Hathaway may prove vital to pinpointing how time went wrong. Sarah and Jackson ultimately attempt to reset the universe once again in a high-stakes heist in New York City.

As a young girl, Scott was a gymnast and roller skater. She discontinued gymnastics when it became too expensive, and took up inline speed skating. As an inline skater, she won five World Championship gold medals and set three national records. In 2008 Scott transitioned from inline skating to short track speed skating on the ice. She made the United States' World Cup and World Championship teams from 2010‚Äì2013, winning a silver medal at the 2012 World Championships. With Scott's help, the United States' relay team placed third in the overall 2010‚Äì11 World Cup standings and second in the 2011‚Äì12 standings. In 2012, she placed second overall at the U.S. National Championships. Following a poor 2012‚Äì13 season, the United States cut Scott's funding, prompting her to fill out an application for food stamps. Shortly thereafter USA Today ran a story on her situation. The story prompted an outpouring of donations from the public, allowing Scott to focus on her training. The increased focus paid off, as Scott finished 2013 as the top rated American in the 1000 meters, second in the 1500 meters, and third in the 500 meters. At the 2014 Olympic Trials, she placed second in all three events, qualifying her for her first Olympics. Scott made the finals of 1500 meters at the Olympics, placing fifth after another skater caused her to fall. She was eliminated in the quarter finals of the 500 and 1000 meter events. Early life Scott was born February 16, 1989, in Springfield, Missouri, to mother Carol and father Craig Scott. She grew up in Springfield, Missouri. When she was in third grade, she and her sister were removed from their mother's house. They were subsequently raised by their father. Scott graduated from Hillcrest High School in 2007. As a young girl, Scott made the Junior Olympics Gymnastics Team, but gave up the sport because it was too expensive for her family. She first learned to roller skate at age two and a half, later taking up inline skating at the local roller rink, Skateport. At age 14, she moved to Florida for three years to focus on her inline training, returning to Springfield in time for high school graduation. Skating career Scott competing at the 2014 Winter Olympics Scott began her athletic career as an inline speed skater. In 2004, she teamed with Brittany Bowe to set the United States national record in the Sophomore 2000 meter two woman relay with a time of 3:12.574. In 2005, Scott won the junior 15000 meter elimination at the 2006 World Inline Speed Skating Championships, passing Columbia's Carolina Upegui on the final lap. At the 2008 World Championships, Bowe, Scott, and Sara Sayasane teamed up to win gold in the 3000 meter track relay. Also in 2008, Scott set the Senior national record in the 5000 meter elimination with a time of 8:45.049 and teamed up with Kirsten Attipoe to set the national record in the 3000 meter relay with a time of 4:53.179. In all, Scott won five World Championship crowns before transitioning to the ice in 2008. She found the transition very difficult and nearly quit, but continued on the advice of her father. At the 2010 Olympic Trials, her third ever meet, Scott placed ninth overall. She quickly improved, making the United States' World Cup and World Championship Teams every year from 2010 to 2013. Scott placed fourth overall at the 2010 and 2011 National Championships. As a member of the National Short Track Team, she has focused primarily on team relay events, helping the United States to place third in the 2010‚Äì2011 World Cup standings. At the 2011 World Team Championships, Scott helped the United States to a bronze medal. At the 2012 National Championships, Scott finished second overall. She helped the United States to a second-place finish in the 2011‚Äì12 World Cup relay standings and a silver medal at the 2012 World Championships. During the 2012‚Äì2013 season, the United States placed eighth in the World Cup relay standing. In total, Scott has won five World Cup medals ‚Äì 1 gold, 3 silver, and 1 bronze, all for relay events. After the relay team failed to place in the top eight at the 2013 World Championships, US Speedskating cut Scott's monthly stipend from $1950 to $600. She set up a GoFundMe campaign, but it generated little interest, prompting her to fill out an application for food stamps. USA Today ran a story on Scott's situation in July. Within 24 hours of the story, Scott had raised $30,000, more than double her stated goal. By August, she had generated over $48,000 in donations from 689 people. \\"It saved my career without a doubt,\\" Scott remarked. She ended up not submitting the food stamp application and quit her part-time job at a surgical supply factory to focus on training. The support lifted an emotional burden and her increased focus allowed Scott to finish 2013 as the top rated American in the 1000 meters, second in the 1500 meters, and third in the 500 meters. The United States finished ninth in the World Cup relay standings for the 2013‚Äì14 season. At the 2014 United States Olympic Trials, Scott placed second in both 500 meter short track races to secure a spot on the Olympic team. \\"I had no idea [I'd qualified],\\" she said after the second race. \\"My coach brought me over. I thought I was in trouble for not winning the race, and he congratulated me. I‚Äôm speechless.\\" She also finished second in the 1000 and 1500 meter events at the Trials. Scott made her Olympic debut in the 500 metres. She advanced through her opening round heat, but was eliminated in the quarter finals. In the 1500 metres, she coasted through the opening round, winning her heat. In the semi-finals, she was in qualifying position when pushed by a rival skater near the finish line. She placed last in the heat, but was advanced to the finals when the judges ruled she had been illegally inhibited by the skater who pushed her. In the final, a South Korean fell, taking Scott down in the process. She got up, but finished fifth. She concluded her Olympics by advancing out of the opening round of the 1000 metres before being eliminated in the quarter finals. The 1000 and 1500 meters are considered Scott's stronger events, and she lists endurance as her greatest strength. She is coached by Stephen Gough. Personal life Scott's mother, Carol, was jailed for selling methamphetamine. When she got out, Scott would occasionally send her money, but Carol soon fell back into the drug trade and Scott stopped sending money. She has not heard from her mother since. Carol and her other daughter are in prison on drug charges as of 2014. Scott's brother died as an infant when she was a teenager. Her father makes his living installing signage. Scott is close friends with 2002 Olympic gold medalist Derek Parra who helped her transition to ice speed skating with his Wheels on Ice Program (WhIP). \\"[Parra is] like a fun uncle .. we go to lunch and dinner and he‚Äôll always be just kind of my mentor and I can talk to him if I‚Äôm having a rough time\\", Scott explained. \\"He‚Äôs always been there for me.\\" Scott says her father is her best friend and idol.
