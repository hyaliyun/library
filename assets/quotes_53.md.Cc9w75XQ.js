In Cuba, she published several science fiction and fantasy books, becoming the most renowned and best-selling author in those genres in Cuban literature.Toledano, Juan C. \\"Da√≠na Chaviano\\", in Darrell B. Lockhart (ed.), Latin American Science Fiction Writers: An A-to-Z Guide, Greenwood Press, 2004, pp. 54-55. Since leaving the island, she has distinguished herself with a series of novels incorporating historical and more contemporary matters as well as mythological and fantastic elements. Biography She was born in Havana, the first of four children of an economist father, and a mother with two Ph.D.: one in Philosophy and Letters, and the other in Psychology.Fern√°ndez, Manuel and Trimberger, Michael. \\"Ecos de un pasado que se niega a morir\\".

When she had barely begun her university studies, she won the first science fiction competition ever organized in Cuba with her short story collection Los mundos que amo (The Worlds I Love), in 1979. After the book was published (1980), the main story was adapted and published as a photonovel in 1982, selling 200,000 copies in 3 months, an unprecedented fact that started her popularity as an author. The plot - almost the same in the short story and in its photonovel version - has been considered \\"an editorial phenomenon\\" that \\"questioned the hierarchical structures that the governing institutions of the revolutionary culture imposed in the literary field as early as 1960\\".Porb√©n, Pedro Pablo. \\"Fotonovela, ciencia ficci√≥n y revoluci√≥n en Los mundos que amo.\\" Revista Iberoamericana, Vol. LXXVIII, No. 238-239, January‚ÄìJune 2012, 225-243. This sales record \\"broke with an editorial logic that considered science fiction as a minor genre.\\" Furthermore, \\"Da√≠na Chaviano claimed literary genres established and controlled mostly by male writers who arrived with the Revolution - that is, writers who did not take part in the processes of the pre-1959 revolutionary struggle - a recognition that placed science fiction written by women, in feminine, in the Cuban editorial map and in the space of national culture\\". After earning a bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature at the University of Havana, she established the first science fiction literary workshop in her country, which she named ‚ÄúOscar Hurtado‚Äù in honor of the father of that genre on the Caribbean island. Herrera-Mulligan, Michelle. When Sci-Fi Meets Sexy. Cr√≠ticas Magazine, January/February 2004, pp. 24-6. In 1991 she left Cuba, establishing residency in the United States, where she worked as a translator, columnist, and editor. In 1998 she achieved international recognition when she was awarded the Azor√≠n Prize for Best Novel in Spain for El hombre, la hembra y el hambre. This work forms part of her series ¬´The Occult Side of Havana¬ª, together with Casa de juegos, Gata encerrada, and La isla de los amores infinitos (The Island of Eternal Love, Riverhead Books, 2008). The series has been described as ‚Äúthe most coherent novelistic project of its generation, indispensable for understanding the social psychology and spiritual vicissitudes of the Cuban people.‚ÄùLiteratura cubana en el exilio . Accessed July 10, 2008. The Island of Eternal Love has been published in 26 languages, making it the most widely translated Cuban novel of all time.Fuentes, Yvette. Anthurium: A Caribbean Studies Journal, Volume 2, Issue 2, Fall 2008, ISSN 1547-7150 In 2007 the novel was awarded the gold medal at the Florida Book Awards, in the category Best Book in Spanish Language.Miami author wins gold The Miami Herald, March 10, 2007, pp. 5E. In 2004 Chaviano was guest of honor at the 25th International Conference for the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA) in the United States. It was the first time that honor had ever been conferred on a Spanish-language writer.\\"Here There Be Dragons: The Global Fantastic\\", Conference Booklet, ICFA Guests of Honor 1980-2004, p. 39 In November 2014, she was also the guest of honor during the University Book Fair in Tabasco (Mexico), where she received the Malinalli National Award for the Promotion of Arts, Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, which until then had only received figures of Mexican culture and society. It was the first time this award was given to an international figure. Her short story collection Extra√±os testimonios was published in 2017. In an interview, Chaviano classified the genre of this work as \\"Caribbean Gothic,\\" as it brings together \\"elements of horror, absurdity, eroticism, and a certain dose of humor √† la Cort√°zar, amidst tropical and sunny environments, specifically in the Caribbean.\\"Jurado, Cristina. El g√≥tico caribe√±o de Da√≠na Chaviano, Supersonic, Abril 26, 2017 In 2019 her historical thriller Los hijos de la Diosa Hurac√°n was published by Grijalbo, the Spanish imprint of Penguin Random House. The novel, which required more than a decade of research work, recreates and rescues the Ta√≠nos' world, following the trail and paying homage to the legacy of the main Caribbean indigenous culture. Hence the importance of Taino mythology in the novel, especially the symbolism of their three main goddesses: Atabey, Guabancex, and Iguanabo√≠na. In 2020 the novel was awarded the gold medal at the Florida Book Awards 2019 contest, in the category Best Book in Spanish Language, making Chaviano the only writer to twice receive the award in that category. Chaviano has been a guest lecturer and visiting author at several universities and colleges, like Denison University (2007), Florida International University (2014), Miami Dade College (2016), University of North Georgia (2017), and others. She is the cousin of the Cuban actor C√©sar √âvora. Literary influences Her literary influences derive fundamentally from the Celtic world, from diverse mythologies, and from the principal epics of ancient peoples. Among these sources one can find the Arthurian cycle; Greek, Roman, Egyptian, pre-Columbian and Afro-Cuban myths; and humankind's first epics, dating back to prehistory, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, the Popol Vuh, the Odyssey, and other similar works.Moreno, Sarah. \\"Da√≠na Chaviano, sus pasiones y fantas√≠as\\".

The author has observed that she has no affinity whatsoever with Cuban literature of any period. Chaviano has stated that, with the exception of authors such as Manuel Mujica La√≠nez and Mario Vargas Llosa,Triff, Soren. ‚ÄùLa maldici√≥n de escribir en Miami‚Äù. Cat√°logo de Letras, Miami. N√∫mero 13, 1998, pp. 6-7. her only point of contact with Latin America is pre-Columbian mythology. The author has said that her passion for Anglo-Saxon literature was always so strong that, when she entered the university, she decided to major in English literature so that she could read many of these authors in their original language.Oliva, Jos√©. \\"Da√≠na Chaviano apuesta por la literatura surrealista\\". Diario Las Am√©ricas. Miami, 13 junio 1999, p. 11-B. In general terms, her contemporary influences come from European and Anglophone authors like Margaret Atwood, Milan Kundera, Ursula K. Le Guin, Ray Bradbury, Ana√Øs Nin, J. R. R. Tolkien, and William Shakespeare, among others. Style Da√≠na Chaviano's works have been described as ‚Äúbold experiments that break down the boundaries between genres.‚Äù Her style is characterized by: * highly poetic prose, indebted to cinematic imagery, which leaves the reader with the impression that s/he has seen, rather than read, a story; * a fondness for the magical or fantastic anecdote, which nonetheless lends a high degree of realism to the narrative, thanks to a well-grounded knowledge of the religious and mythological elements of Celtic, Christian, Afro-Cuban, pre-Columbian, and Greco-Roman cultures; * several interpretive levels and a plethora of hidden meanings in her books, whether they be fantasy, science fiction, or realism.

It had a strong focus on the city of Auckland, with reportage of issues and society. The magazine was first published independently by Mick Mason, Clive Curry and Bruce Palmer. Metro was shut down by its owners, the Bauer Media Group due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 July 2020, Metro was acquired by independent publisher Simon Chesterman. History Metro was established in 1981. The debut of the magazine coincided with the rapid expansion of the New Zealand economy that occurred from 1984, following the election of the Fourth Labour Government, who implemented widespread neoliberal deregulation and economic reform. The increased access to imported luxury goods made Metro magazine an attractive media environment for advertisers. From Metro's ninth issue in March 1982 until 2002, the magazine featured an influential gossip column called Felicity Ferret. The writer was anonymous, although in May 2006 Auckland restaurant owner Fran Fisher told Metro that she had pitched the idea to editor Warwick Roger in 1982, and had contributed to it ‚Äì along with Roger ‚Äì until she left New Zealand in December 1983. The Ferret's initials hinted at her own name. While multiple writers were known to have written for the column over the years, after 1983 the Ferret was suspected to be largely the work of former model and notorious Auckland socialite Judith Baragwanath. Metro magazine's success led to the launch of a sister title North and South, edited by Robyn Langwell. This publication took a wider look at New Zealand regional stories. Langwell was editor of North & South until June 2007. A third title, women's interest magazine More, was launched before the stable was bought by ACP Media, an Australian publishing consortium. Both Metro and North & South have won awards for publishing and journalism and Metro, in particular, has been well known for its standard of photography and design under art directors William Chen and Jenny Nicholls. This tradition is still strong, with Metro winning Best Art Director (Charlie McKay) at the 2010 Qantas Media Awards. ACP Media was the former owner of Metro until 2013 when the magazine was acquired by Bauer Media Group. Metro's fortunes have varied since Warwick Roger gave up the editor's chair. The appointment of Bill Ralston saw dramatic shifts in the magazine's editorial focus away from the rigor of Roger's style to a more flamboyant, celebrity style format. Sales were disappointing and a period of decline followed. The magazine was relaunched as a large format glossy title while led by Nicola Legat, a long-time contributing journalist. The changes were intended to reverse the decline of sales and readership. At its peak Metro sold 40,000 copies, but this had fallen to less than 20,000. During this period the society scandal column Felicity Ferret was dropped from Metro's pages. The Ferret briefly returned to the pages of Metro in 2009. In 2005, Legat left the magazine to join publishing company Random House. She was replaced by Lauren Quaintance, a former North & South writer, who oversaw a 5 per cent increase in circulation. Quaintance left in June 2007 to return to the Sydney Morning Herald and the long-serving deputy Bevan Rapson was appointed acting editor. A makeover in 2009 saw Metro changed to a smaller size, and the incorporation of Citymix magazine within its pages. In mid-2010, Rapson was replaced as editor by Simon Wilson, a Metro senior writer and former editor of Cuisine and Consumer, the magazine published by the Consumers' Institute of New Zealand. In 2010, Wilson oversaw a 25 per cent increase in Metro's readership, according to Nielsen Media Research. In August 2015 Susannah Walker became the editor of the magazine, replacing Simon Wilson in the post. In early April 2020, the Bauer Media Group closed down Metro and several of its New Zealand operations in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. On 17 June 2020, Sydney investment firm Mercury Capital purchased Metro as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media's New Zealand and Australian media assets. On 17 July, Mercury Capital confirmed that it would be selling Metro to independent publisher Simon Chesterman.

It is approximately long and flows through Canton Township, Canton, Leroy Township, Franklin Township, and Monroe Township. Course Towanda Creek begins on a hill in southwestern Canton Township, near the border between Bradford County and Lycoming County. The creek flows northwest off the hill and then turns north, flowing parallel to Pennsylvania Route 14. After several miles, it turns east and passes through the community of Canton and continues east. The creek then receives the tributary Mill Creek and shortly afterwards receives Alba Creek and Beech Flats Creek. It then enters Leroy Township, where it continues flowing east and slightly north parallel to Pennsylvania Route 50. In this township, the creek receives Wallace Brook and Gulf Brook.

The creek has fairly high mud banks and flows between forested mountains. Its valley becomes flat and wide downstream of Schrader Creek. There are some riffles on the creek and a few rocky patches near Franklindale. The topography of the watershed of Towanda Creek is described as \\"rough and hilly\\" in a 1921 book. Most of the watershed consists of narrow valleys and steep hills that are rounded by glaciation. Rock formations consisting of shale and sandstone are found in the vicinity of Towanda Creek. Deposits of bituminous coal are found in these rock formations. Gravel and boulders are also present near the creek. The channel of Towanda Creek is sinuous.

The collection, which existed only in two manuscripts (handwritten copies), was first printed in 1491 in Latin and came out in numerous editions over the next 25 years. Johannes de Ketham, the German physician routinely associated with the Fasciculus, was neither the author nor even the original compiler but merely an owner of one of the manuscripts. The topics of the treatises cover a wide spectrum of medieval European medical knowledge and technique, including uroscopy, astrology, bloodletting, the treatment of wounds, plague, anatomical dissection, and women‚Äôs health. The book is remarkable as the first illustrated medical work to appear in print; notable illustrations include: a urine chart, a diagram of the veins for phlebotomy, a pregnant woman, Wound Man, Disease Man and Zodiac Man. In 1495, it appeared in Italian under the title Fasiculo de Medicina. The ten handsome full-page woodcut illustrations influenced artists for some time ‚Äì even as late as 1751 when the last of William Hogarth's Four Stages of Cruelty seems to borrow from the dissection scene (above).

De Charmettes was born in Bordeaux (France). He was appointed to the French Conseil d'√âtat' in 1810 and became a pr√©fet (prefect) in the French department of Haute-Sa√¥ne in 1830. A contributor to the literary magazine l‚ÄôAbeille litt√©raire, created by Victor Hugo in 1821, he is mainly known for his successful efforts to rescue the figure of Jeanne d'Arc from partial oblivion and turn her into a national heroine. His interest for Joan came at a time when France was still struggling to define its new identity after the Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. The national ethos was in search of non controversial heroes. A staunch prop to King and country, Joan of Arc was an acceptable symbol to the monarchists. As a patriot and the daughter of commoners, she was seen as one prototype of the low-born volunteers (the soldats de l'an II) who had victoriously fought for revolutionary France in 1802 and as such could be claimed by the Republicans. As a religious martyr, she was also popular in the powerful Catholic community. De Charmette's Orleanide, today largely forgotten, was another attempt to magnify the national ethos as writers like Virgil (the Aeneid), or Camoens (the Lusiad) had done for Rome and Portugal.

The building was completely renovated in 2006-07 as part of the $17.8-million, 126,000 sq ft Sheila Umphrey Recreational Center project. The gym's seating capacity was reduced from 4,200 to 500 as part of the renovation. McDonald Gym has been the home of the Lamar Lady Cardinals Volleyball Team since the renovation. The facility was named after the fourth president of Lamar Dr. F.L. McDonald. (1952‚Äì1967) The original construction cost estimate in 1957-1958 was $850,000. Chambers Construction Company of Houston, Texas was the main construction contractor. Allco, LLC was the main contractor for the 2006-07 renovation. Facility Features In addition to the competition volleyball arena, the facility has the following: *Coaches offices for Volleyball, Cross Country, Tennis and Track & Field *Separate team locker and shower facilities for each of the sports listed above. Shower and locker facilities are also provided for visiting teams, coaches, and officials. *Athletic Training Suite - athletic training staff offices, treatment and rehabilitation areas, and hydrotherapy room *Student athlete lounge *Student athlete study center - four private study rooms, computer lab with 14 workstations, and offices for two Athletic Academic Affairs coordinators. Prior to 2007 As a 4,200 seat gymnasium, prior to the 2007 renovation project, the gym was home to both the Lamar Cardinals men's basketball team and Volleyball team from 1958 until the 1980-81 season. It was also the home of the Lamar Lady Cardinals basketball team from 1969 to 1980-81. Following the 1980-81 season, the basketball teams called the off- campus Beaumont Civic Center home from 1980-1984 until the construction of the 10,080 seat Montagne Center in 1984 gave the basketball teams a new on-campus home. =220-65 Home Court Advantage Over the Years= McDonald Gym was home of the men's basketball team for 23 years.

Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930. Then WWll disrupted it for a while, but systematic breeding with registrations resumed after the war ended, in 1946. This was the time the breed began taking modern shape. Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika. In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika.Quoted by Vladimir Beregovoy - Author, Translator, WSL Advisor and Curator of Primitive Aboriginal Dog Society International. In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word layat that means to bark. The word Laika simply means barker. Any hunting Laika is a bark pointer (pointing at animal of interest by barking and staying with the animalQuoted by Vladimir Beregovoy. ). It is a versatile dog depending on use and environment, but in certain parts of the country they have become more specialized.  Origins  Laikas, occurring on Russian territory, belong to northern primitive breeds retaining traits of their wild ancestor, the wolf, in the appearance and behavior. They are dogs with pointed muzzle, slightly rangy or nearly square body and often gray or gray mixed with red like in the wolf coat color predominate. They are small to medium size pariah- type dogs that originally accompanied humans since prehistory worldwide, until they became replaced with lop-eared, specialized for certain style of hunting, cultured breeds. In large sparser populated parts of Russia, this process came at a later time and aboriginal Laika types still remain with hunters in remote northern and northeastern provinces of the country. History Deforestation of land for agriculture and industrialization in later 19th-early 20th Centuries accelerated replacement of Laikas with other popular at the time dogs. Russian experts of the late 19th century distinguished dozens of varieties of aboriginal Laikas, each associated with a particular ethnic group of indigenous people of northeastern Europe and Siberia, but none of them had been considered as purebred and pedigreed. Russians tried to save some hunting Laikas from extinction by bringing them from different provincial parts of Russia in cities of European part of the country and breeding them pure. Starting from thirtieth and especially after WW II, they established four breeds as purebreds: the Karelo-Finnish Laika, the Russ-European Laika, the West Siberian Laika and the East Siberian Laika. They all are bark-pointing dogs and their hunting behavior is generally similar. All of them are descendants of aboriginal types of Laikas selectively sampled from large territories and lumped into the four breeds for breeding in kennels. Among all of them, the West Siberian Laika became most popular and by present time it is most numerous Laika far beyond its original range in Russia. Appearance The West Siberian Laika is a medium to large size dog. Males are 22-24 inches and females are 20-23 inches at the shoulder. *The coat of the West Siberian Laika is a double coat of harsh straight guard hairs and thick and soft undercoat. The guard hairs on the neck, around the head and shoulders are particularly long and stiff. Together with a very thick undercoat they form a ruff framing the dog's face. On the tail, the guard hair and undercoat are also longer and thicker than on the rest of the body. In wintertime, dogs living in cold climate grow hair between the toes. Although the coat quality varies individually, dogs raised in countries with cold climates have longer and thicker coats than dogs that live in warm and hot climates or dogs that are kept inside most of the time. *Most common coat colors are wolf gray, pale red and white. The gray coat can be of various shades from almost white to very dark gray, nearly black. The gray can be mixed with red producing array of brownish and red shades. Dogs with either coat color described above may have white patches in different proportions. Pale red and white dogs may have brown noses and lips. Dogs with either coat color have so-called \\"zonary\\" pattern of distribution of pigment in each guard hair. This means guard hair has alternating bands (zones) of white with black, brown or red color. Hairs with evenly distributed pigment indicate an admixture of other than Laika breed. *The head is wedge-shaped in the form of a triangle, flat on the top and broader between ears. In the Mansi Laika, the head is more elongate with muzzle as long as the skull from eye to occiput or slightly longer. In the Khanty Laika, the head is broader and the muzzle is as long as the skull or slightly shorter. Lips are always close and lean. A full set of large teeth with a scissors bite is typical, but dogs with vice bite also occur. The standard accepts scissors bite only. In many dogs with a scissors bite at young age the bite is changing with age and becomes a vice bite by age of 5‚Äì6 years. *Eyes are almond-shaped, medium size, deep set and distinctly slanted. Their colors are brown to dark brown. Dogs with amber yellow and/or blue eyes rarely occur, but hunters believe that dogs with brown and dark brown eyes are better hunting dogs. According to the standard, any eye color, except brown and light brown is a fault. *Ears are always pricked and directed straight up, but their size, pointed or slightly rounded tips of ears are variable. Generally, ears of the Khanty Laika are small to medium. In the Mansi Laika, ears are medium to long. Ears can be set high and close to each other or slightly apart. *The tail is carried high curving over the back. Details of its structure and carriage are variable among aboriginal dogs. In majority of dogs, the tip of the tail lies on the back, but some dogs have the tip of the tail rigidly curved like a fishhook. Among aboriginal dogs, there are individuals with a sickle-shaped tail, but it is considered faulty by the modern breed standard. *The body is slightly longer than the height or nearly square and with well-muscled forequarters and hindquarters. Legs are straight and parallel. Front feet are directed forward or slightly east‚Äìwest and hind legs are straight and in many dogs slightly cow-hocked. The breed standard rejects square body proportions, cow hocks and east‚Äìwest position of front feet. The angulation at stifles is normally developed and look like in wild canids. Feet are strong, compact and elongate. Toes are strong, flexible and well arched. Reproduction The majority of females of the West Siberian Laika have one estrus per year, usually in February and March. Some females have their first estrus not fixed by a certain season. The first estrus can be at age of one to two and a half years. Russian experts do not recommend breeding Laikas until they are at least two years old. The number of puppies per litter varies from one to nine, but litters of three to seven puppies are most frequent. Females of the West Siberian Laika are good mothers and, if conditions permit, dig their own whelping dens, give birth to puppies and raise them without any assistance as soon as the food is available. Character and behavior The West Siberian Laika is a very affectionate and devoted to the master dog. The majority of them bark at strangers approaching the house. Their attitude to unfamiliar people varies individually and depending on the situation. Some dogs first bark and then wag their tails, greeting the guest and allow themselves to be petted. Many West Siberian Laikas are aloof with a strange person, avoid hands and watch him suspiciously. Some dogs become protective of the master, his family and their property. Many West Siberian Laikas accept a new owner with difficulty and need time to adjust to a new place. According to standard, aggressiveness to unfamiliar people is not typical. West Siberian Laika is highly territorial and may be aggressive to other intruding dogs of the same sex. Adult Laikas, especially males, should only hunt with dogs raised in the same household. West Siberian Laika can easily learn to leave alone farm animals and are naturally capable of telling apart wild game from domesticated animals. Cats of the same household are accepted, but stray cats will be treated like game. Utilitarian qualities Laika hunting raccoon. The West Siberian Laika is primarily a hunting dog. Anyone who decides on a puppy of this breed should expect a full package of traits of a typical hunting Spitz. It is an emotional dog, very observant to the habits of its master, his mood and often can foresee his intentions. It does not hesitate to express its strong feelings by barking and other noises. The West Siberian Laika is a poor kennel dog. If the dog is left alone, locked up in a small backyard or in a pen, some dogs develop a habit of barking, seemingly without a purpose. Permanently penned or fenced West Siberian Laikas attempt to dig under the fence or climb over it. Some dogs not trained to stay penned, try to bite the wires and thereby they damage their teeth. Once freed or turned loose, such a dog will be hard to control. It will run too far, chase other animals and likely get into trouble. West Siberian Laikas that are kept well exercised, busy with hunting and contacts with other dogs, animals and people, are content, obedient and never bark without a reason. Therefore, to make a happy dog and its owner, the right conditions of the environment for hunting plus time dedicated to the dog must be met. All West Siberian Laikas are naturally protective against wild animals, especially predators, and some dogs are protective against strangers acting suspicious or violent. A West Siberian Laika will make a good companion dog for a hiking trip. However, its extraordinary interest in wildlife demands special attention because the dog may tree some animals and stay far behind for some time. The West Siberian Laika is a great psycho-therapy dog for able bodied active people, who are not lazy to walk a lot and hunt. He needs regular free exercising between hunting seasons. Take him for walking trips in safe places often and stay healthy. A 4 month old WSL female pup, it is at this stage that their unique natural hunting instincts become evident.If you have bears in the woods near you, this dog would be the best to warn you or your loved ones in time about the bear's presence and may even show you a treed bear. If a Laika sees a bear, they will run toward the bear, not from it, and they will be barking. When a Laika barks at a bear, their voice sounds as if they were barking at a human--very unlike when they are barking at a squirrel. Treeing squirrels and other small game comes naturally. Just take your puppy in woods and turn him loose. He will start finding his own squirrels by age of 4 to 10 months. Mansi, Khanty, Russians and any other ethnic groups of people living in Russia use the same dogs for hunting and as alarm dogs. Some West Siberian Laikas work well herding reindeer herds. During any activity or training, hunting overrules everything else. A Mansi never minds if his Laika abandons his reindeer herd for a while, especially if his Laika finds valuable game. Mansi and Khanty use reindeer and, in some cases, horses as a draft animal, but good hunting dogs are never used to pull sleds. It would be like using a valuable dagger to chop firewood. If a sled dog is needed, they use another kind sturdy built and larger dog called in Russian \\"Yezdovaya Laika\\" or sled Laika. This is practiced mainly in polar tundra where reindeer have nothing to eat. References Sources in Russian Language: *Dmitrieva-Sulima, M., \\"Laika and Hunting With It\\", Sanct-Peterburg, 1911.

It was developed by Strand Century in the late 1970s. Originally, AMX192 was only capable of controlling 192 discrete channels of lighting. Later, multiple AMX192 streams were supported by some lighting desks. AMX192 has mostly been replaced in favour of DMX, and is typically only found in legacy hardware.  History  The name AMX192 is derived from an acronym of Analog MultipleXing and the maximum number of controllable lighting channels (192). AMX was developed to address a significant problems in controlling dimmers. For many years, in order to send a control signal from a lighting control unit to the dimmer units, the only method available was to provide a dedicated wire from the control unit to each dimmer (analogue control) where the voltage present on the wire was varied by the control unit to set the output level of the dimmer. In the late 1970s, the AMX192 serial analogue multiplexing standard was developed in the US, permitting one cable to control several dimmers.

According to traditional Ethiopian historiography, he was the second abun after Frumentius (Salama I) and took the name Salama II. The Ethiopian sources, however, place the episcopate of Frumentius in the reign of King Ezana (c. 320‚Äì360) and that of Minas in the reign of Anbasa Wedem, twenty-six kings later, yet before the Arab conquest of Egypt (c. 640). This may indicate a long gap in the episcopal succession. Alternatively, it may indicate \\"a fresh start of vigorous Christian activities\\" under Minas. This would also explain why he was considered by later Ethiopians to be a second Salama.Getachew Haile, \\"Ethiopian Prelates (c.300‚Äìfl. second half of eleventh century): Minas (fl. sixth century)\\", in The Coptic Encyclopedia (Macmillan, 1991), Volume 3, pp. 999a‚Äì1003b. Retrieved from Claremont Colleges Digital Library on 13 October 2019. According to the Gadla Afse, Minas was bishop when the Nine Saints came to Ethiopia between the late 4th and 6th centuries. Although there is no information on Minas' origins, modern scholars have been quick to assume he was an Egyptian. This would make him the first Egyptian abun in a continuous line down to the 20th century. His name was common in Egypt.Stuart C. Munro-Hay, Ethiopia and Alexandria: The Metropolitan Episcopacy of Ethiopia (Warsaw, 1997), pp. 68‚Äì69. Minas is credited with several works of Ethiopian literature. He wrote sermons, six of which are still part of the liturgy of Ethiopian monasteries, read a designated times of the year. These six cover the Apostles, the Seventy Disciples, the Dormition of the Virgin, the Feast of the Cross, the 318 attendees of the First Council of Nicaea and the season of spring. Tradition also ascribes to him the translation of the Book of Revelation into Ge Ωez. The translation of the Ge Ωez text The Story of How the Interiors of Ethiopia Came to Christianity, an extract from Tyrannius Rufinus on the mission of Frumentius, may also be the work of Minas.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Thoma is known for his indiscretion while a POW in the British captivity, when he unwittingly revealed the existence of the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 weapons programmes. He was subject to surveillance by the British intelligence and while speaking to another German officer, was recorded discussing rockets that were being tested at Kummersdorf West, which he observed while on a visit that also included Generalfeldmarschall Walther von Brauchitsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. British reconnaissance flights over Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center in May and June 1943 brought back unmistakable images of rockets at the facility; the subsequent bombing of the site severely disrupted the programme. Military career Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma was born in Dachau in 1891 as son of a Bavarian tax official and became career officer with the Bavarian Army. Thoma took part in the first World War with 3rd Bavarian Infantry Regiment (part of 2nd, then, from 1915, 11th Bavarian Infantry Division) on the Western (1914/15/16/17/18) and Eastern Front (1915/16), the Serbian Campaign (1915) and the Romanian Front in 1916/17. During the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918 he was captured by French-American forces and became Prisoner of war until September, 1919. He was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Bavarian Military Max Joseph Order, the highest military decoration for bravery in the Bavarian Army and was awarded the noble title of Ritter. After the war, Thoma remained in the new German army, the Reichswehr.Mitcham, p. 155 During the Spanish Civil War, he served in Spain commanding the ground element of the Condor Legion, following the Nazi Germany intervention on the side of the Nationalists led by Francisco Franco. During the 1941 Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, Thoma led the 17th Panzer Division and then the 20th Panzer Division, which took part in the Battle of Moscow. In December 1941, Thoma received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. In September 1942 Thoma was transferred to serve with the Afrika Korps in North Africa, where he took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. Under British surveillance as POW On 4 November 1942, Thoma was captured by the British forces and for the remainder of the war he was a prisoner in several senior officer prisoner-of-war camps in Great Britain, including Trent Park, Wilton Park, Grizedale Hall and Island Farm. Thoma was subject to surveillance by the Secret Intelligence Service and while speaking to another POW, General Ludwig Cr√ºwell, was recorded discussing rockets that were being tested at Kummersdorf West, which he observed while on a visit that also included Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and other technical programme details.PBS show \\"Secrets of the Dead,\\" Episode \\"Bugging Hitler's Soldiers,\\" transcript at https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/bugging- hitler%E2%80%99s-soldiers-program-transcript/950/ Following his indiscretion, further British reconnaissance flights over Peenem√ºnde in May and June 1943 brought back unmistakable images of rockets at the facility which was developing guided missiles and long-range ballistic missiles better known as the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 ballistic missile. When reconnaissance and intelligence information regarding the V-2 became convincing, Churchill's War Cabinet directed the first planned raid (Operation Hydra), the attack of Peenem√ºnde in August 1943, as part of Operation Crossbow, the Anglo-American campaign against the Vergeltungswaffe, the German long-range weapons programme. In late 1945, Waffen-SS commander Kurt Meyer, captured in Belgium in September 1944 while commanding the 12th SS-Panzer Division \\"Hitler Jugend\\", arrived at Trent Park and noted that Thoma, the German camp leader, was \\"...highly thought of by the English. Relations between him and the guards is excellent\\".Meyer 2005, p. 344. Churchill's high regard for Thoma is evident from his many later quotations of Thoma's opinions on strategic matters, especially in his book about the war. After Montgomery invited Thoma to dine with him in his private trailer, Churchill remarked: \\"I sympathize with General von Thoma: Defeated, in captivity and... (long pause for dramatic effect) dinner with Montgomery\\".Hayward 1998, p. 105. Thoma died of a heart attack in 1948 in his home town of Dachau.

Founded in 1995 by drummer Fabrizio Cislaghi. History Formerly known as Land of Dark Souls, the band was inspired by the combination of gothic imagery and music, and the members have been known for contrasting dual female/male vocals. Macbeth is an established Italian gothic metal band in the international music scene. Founded in 1995 by the drummer Fabrizio Cislaghi, the group debuted in 1997 releasing Nocturnal Embrace, a demo tape in a limited numbered copies. In 1998, Macbeth signed a recording contract with Dragonheart Records, a division of Audioglobe and the same year they released their first album Romantic Tragedy's Crescendo. The album was a success, receiving rave reviews throughout Europe, and was regarded as one of the best symphonic gothic metal albums of the year. After a promotional tour and a few changes in the line-up, Macbeth entered the studio to record their second work Vanitas, which was released in 2001. The album showed a more aggressive approach without losing that trademark melodic side of the band. However a further leap was made with the publication of Malae Artes in 2005. The third album, recorded by a renewed line-up, was released in Mexico, Russia, Taiwan, Baltic countries and the United States. The promotional tour took the band from Europe to South America and in the major cities of Mexico. In 2006 Macbeth performed in Beirut, headlining the Rock Nation festival. Singer Morena guested on the musical project Rezophonic along with many artists of the Italian rock scene, and worked as host in the Morning Glory and ' programs on Rock TV channel. In 2007 the band released Superangelic Hate Bringers containing the single \\"Without You\\", and the promotional video reaches over 500.000 plays on YouTube. Superangelic Hate Bringers was the most direct of Macbeth's album with a truly great production. The British magazine Classic Rock published a rave review in December of the same year, which raised interest around the band. In 2008, Macbeth went to England for a tour for the first time and returned to Belgium for the sixth edition of the Metal Female Voices Fest. The same year the singer Morena participated as a guest at the March Metal Day Festival in Athens. The song \\"Don't Pretend\\" from Superangelic Hate Bringers was used by Sky Sports throughout the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship. While already at work on new album in 2009, the band was forced to take a long break due to personal problems, but the long gestation allowed the group to prepare a new album with superior qualities. Macbeth had set Neo- Gothic Propaganda as the title of their fifth studio album. The new sound combined a wide range of influences and is heavier, dynamic and more melodic. Neo-Gothic Propaganda was made up of ten brand new melodic and heavy songs and mixed gothic atmospheres into music that does not fit into any categories. Neo-Gothic Propaganda is a manifesto, is a movement, is the soundtrack of contemporary decadence. Macbeth's fifth studio album entitled Neo-Gothic Propaganda was released on February 24, 2014. \\"Scent of Winter\\" is the title of the first single and video of the album.

Tromp with 12 ships spotted the Spanish fleet on the 16th, but waited for de With to arrive with five more ships before attacking. Despite his numerical inferiority Tromp got the upper hand in a running fight which lasted into the night. The next day, Zeeland Commodore Joost Banckert, arrived to reinforce the Dutch with 12 more ships. Fighting continued until the Dutch ran out of gunpowder when D'Oquendo retreated to the roadstead of the Downs hoping on English protection which would eventually lead to the Battle of the Downs, where D'Oquendo was decisively defeated. This fight is notable because Tromp used the line of battle for the first time.

The firm manufactured motorcycles from 1960 through to 1975. History Rickman Triumph Cafe racer Initially the frame designs were for scrambles, and then for road racing. Later, in 1966, road bikes were produced as well. The first street legal bike used a Triumph Bonneville engine. Rickman initially supplied frame kits to the public, as no major British motorcycle manufacturers would sell engines separately. The frame kits were built for many engines, including Triumph twins, BSA singles and Matchless. In the mid-1960s, Rickman also produced road-racing frames for AJS 7R singles, and in the 1970s they began selling chassis kits for Japanese bikes like the Honda CB750 and Kawasaki Z1. The road bikes were the first to use disc brakes both front and rear (a joint project with Lockheed).The Rickman Story by Dave Gittins. Nostalgia Books Other innovations included the use of large diameter telescopic forks (1-5/8\\" or 41.2mm) and oil carried in the frame tubes to help dissipate heat and save weight. An eight valve cylinder head conversion (700cc) for Triumph 650cc twins was developed in the late 1960s which considerably increased power output (up to 60 bhp or more depending on state of tune) and showed up some weaknesses in the Triumph crankcases and connecting rods. Chain adjustment was via eccentric discs rather than drawbolts to avoid misalignment. After the Royal Enfield factory closed, a little over 200 Series II Interceptor engines were stranded at the dock in 1970, originally on their way to Floyd Clymer (of Clymer repair manuals and Enfield \\"Indians\\" fame) in the United States, but unfortunately he had just died, and his export agents, Mitchell's of Birmingham, were left to dispose of them. They approached the Rickman brothers for frames, and as the Rickman brothers' main problem had always been engine supply, a limited run of 137 Rickman Interceptors were built. In about 1971, Rickman began producing complete motorcycles in 3 displacements, 100 cc 125 cc and 250 cc. The 100s had Japanese Hodaka engines, the 125s had German Zundapp engines, while the 250s featured Spanish Montesa powerplants. Many of these little Motocross bikes were produced from 1971 to 1975, most being shipped to America. In 1974, Rickman was awarded the \\"Queen's Award to Industry\\" for their export business, but it was the same year Norton Villiers Triumph collapsed. The Rickman brothers turned their attention to larger Japanese motorcycle engines, and produced Rickman Honda 750s, Rickman Kawasaki Z1/Z900s, Rickman Honda Bol d'Or 10th century, Rickman Kawasaki Z1000s, and Rickman Suzuki GS1000s.American Motorcyclist, Dec 2007 Vol. 61, No. 12. Page 57. The bikes or frame kits were known for their beautiful fiberglass work and nickel-plated frames and are often referred to as \\"Metisse\\" frames, a term used for their own first effort. The Rickmans had a sense of humour. Google translates the word politely as \\"mongrel\\". The company stopped producing complete motorcycles in 1975, continuing to produce accessories. In the 1980s the Rickmans sold their parts to a company called MRD (Model, Replica & Design until then specialising in model aeroplanes). 'MRD Metisse' was born, and run by Pat French, a Rickman Metisse enthusiast.Remember Metisse? Motorcycle Sport, June 1989, pp.276-279. Accessed 8 September 2019 Business was good throughout the late '80s but the early '90s saw a levelling off of the business. In 1999 a new enthusiast arrived on the scene and set up a new company (M√©tisse Motorcycles Ltd) and bought Pat French's business including some later parts and the rights to use the word 'Metisse'. Throughout this period another Rickman enthusiast, successful scrambler and friend of the Rickman's Adrian Moss was the first to spot that the Mark III would be the most popular model over time. Adrian was already building and racing Rickman bikes and spares. He set up the successful British Bike Bonanza in 1981,British Bike Bonanza for pre-65 machines and enthusiasts, which is still going, to this day. The company name was also licensed to Adrian,'Rickman Motorcycles Limited' and later passed to him, enabling the production of genuine Rickman Motorcycles to continue as they always had done. Derek and Don Rickman were inducted into the A.M.A. Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2007. Kit cars By 1985, before the Rickman brothers retired, Rickman Engineering Limited diversified into general engineering and into the production of a kit car for amateur constructors to create four wheeled vehicles, namely the Rickman Ranger, with GFRP body version similar to Suzuki Jeep, and the Metisse sports coupe, based on donor-vehicle mechanicals, individually builder- sourced. Rickman, and later by the Lomax Company, produced over 1000 vehicles.http://www.rickmancarsownersclub.org.uk/history.htm The Ranger was later produced in Russia by Avtokam.

Doomsday device is a term used in professional wrestling to reference a tandem move in which one wrestler hoists the opponent on their shoulders so that they are facing in the same direction in what is known as the electric chair position, while another wrestler climbs the ring post to the top turnbuckle and delivers a flying attack on the opponent. The move was introduced by the tag team The Road Warriors, who were sometimes also known as the Legion of Doom throughout their careers. Variations The Dudleyville device Other variations of the maneuver, which use alternative flying attacks to knock opponents backward off the shoulders of another wrestler are often named after the doomsday device, or are described using the device term. One variation of the standard device, sometimes known as the Dudley Boyz's Dudleyville device, sees the wrestler (in this case Bubba Ray Dudley) keep hold of the opponent's legs, falling backward with them and completing a traditional electric chair drop maneuver. Most frontal attack variants can see the grounded wrestler simply release, or, fall backward with the opponent, as in the basic doomsday device. However, not all variations of the device see the elevated wrestler attack an opponent head on, some see wrestlers strike from behind to propel the opponent forward off the other wrestler's shoulders. This allows the grounded wrestler to utilize a version of the electric chair which sees them drop to a seated position with the opponent landing face first between the wrestler's legs. =Doomsday clothesline= This variation is the one that is usually used when tag teams perform the doomsday device. This variation has one wrestler lift one opponent up in an electric chair position followed by another wrestler climbing to the top rope and performing a diving clothesline onto the elevated opponent, making the opponent fall backward off the wrestler's shoulder making them crash into the mat. =Doomsday DDT= This variation sees one wrestler lift their opponent in regular doomsday fashion and another wrestler climb to the top rope and perform a diving DDT onto the elevated opponent. =Doomsday diving crossbody= This variation sees one wrestler lift their opponent in regular doomsday fashion and another wrestler climb to the top rope and perform a diving crossbody onto the elevated opponent =Doomsday dropkick= This variation sees one wrestler lift their opponent in regular doomsday fashion and another wrestler climb to the top rope and perform a missile dropkick to knock their opponent down. =Doomsday rana= Unlike the previous variation, this device variant sees a headscissors throw used to pull the opponent forward off the shoulders of the other wrestler. The flying head scissors throw performed is commonly known as a diving hurricanrana, and is where this move gets the \\"Rana\\" part of its name. =Elevated cutter= Another variation exists which is the same doomsday style attack but rather than a bulldog or a clothesline, the attacking wrestler performs a cutter off of the elevated surface (usually the turnbuckle) pulling the opponent face first off the partners shoulders. =Elevated diving bulldog= This variation sees the elevated wrestler come from behind the raised opponent to push/drag them forward off the grounded wrestler's shoulders and down to the ground using a diving bulldog.

The track features an eight-lane Mondo Track, the same surface used for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. The track was made possible by generous donations from Wayne and Russ Vandenburg of EPT Management and Mark Fry. The track was dedicated in former Miner legend Larry K. Durham's name. His contribution gave Kidd Field a makeover in 2011, and it was dedicated in his name in April 2012. A state-of-the-art Daktronics video board was added in January 2008. The 9x15-foot LED video display plants fans right into the action on the track, providing graphics and video elements that display real-time highlights throughout a meet. The lit facility also houses throws and jumps arenas, making Kidd Field one of the top track-only complexes in the country.

Early life Son of Anthony Gustav de Rothschild (1887‚Äì1961) and Yvonne Lydia Louise Cahen d'Anvers (1899‚Äì1977), he was named after his uncle Evelyn Achille de Rothschild who was killed in action in World War I. Evelyn de Rothschild spent several of his boyhood years in the United States during World War II. He was a pupil at Harrow School‚ÄòROTHSCHILD, Sir Evelyn de‚Äô, Who's Who 2009, A & C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2008 accessed 27 Feb 2009 and then studied history at Trinity College, University of Cambridge but dropped out before gaining a degree. Born into great wealth, Evelyn de Rothschild became one of England's most eligible bachelors, spending his youth travelling, socialising, driving exotic sports cars, enjoying thoroughbred horse racing and playing polo. It was not until age 26 that he decided to join N M Rothschild & Sons banking house to be trained in the family's business. In 1955, a couple years prior to Sir Evelyn's entry into the family's business, his father had to retire from the position of chairman due to illness and his cousin Victor Rothschild took over as chairman. Career Evelyn de Rothschild was appointed a director of Paris-based de Rothschild Fr√®res in 1968 while Guy de Rothschild from the French branch of the family became a partner at N M Rothschild & Sons. In 1976 he took over as bank chairman from Victor Rothschild and in 1982 became chairman of Rothschilds Continuation Holdings AG, the co-ordinating company for the merchant banking group. He became co-chairman of Rothschild Bank A.G., Zurich in 1994, serving until 2003 when he oversaw the merger of the family's French and UK houses. David Ren√© de Rothschild of the French branch took over as executive chairman of Rothschild International after the different branches had been merged and Sir Evelyn continued as non-executive chairman of N M Rothschild & Sons. In 2003, he founded with his wife, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a holding company, E.L.

Political cinema exists in different forms such as documentaries, feature films, or even animated and experimental films. Notion Political cinema in the narrow sense of the term refers to political films which do not hide their political stance. This does not mean that they are necessarily pure propaganda. The difference to other films is not that they are political but how they show it. Even ostensibly \\"apolitical\\" escapist films, which promise \\"mere entertainment\\" as an escape from everyday life, however, fulfill a political function. The authorities in Nazi Germany knew this very well and organized a large production of deliberately escapist movies. In other entertainment movies, for example westerns, the ideological bias is evident in the distortion of historical reality. A \\"classical\\" western would rarely portray black cowboys, although there were a great many of them. Hollywood Cinema or more generally speaking so called Dominant Cinema, was often accused of misrepresenting black, women, gays and working-class people. More fundamentally not only the content of individual films is political but also the institution of cinema itself. A huge number of people congregate not to act together or to talk to each other but, after having paid for it, to sit silently, to be spectators separated from each other. (Of course the behaviour of the public is not always the same in all countries.) Guy Debord, a critic of the society of the spectacle, for whom \\"separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle\\" was therefore also violently opposed to Cinema, even though he would make several movies portraying his ideas. Cinema, World War I and its aftermath Before World War I French cinema had a big share of the world market. Hollywood used the collapse of the French production to establish its hegemony. Ever since it has dominated world film production not only economically but has transformed cinema into a means to disseminate American values. In Germany the Universum Film AG, better known as UFA, was founded to counter the perceived dominance of American propaganda. During the Weimar Republic many films about Frederick II of Prussia had a conservative nationalistic agenda, as Siegfried Kracauer and other film critics noted. Communists like Willi M√ºnzenberg saw the Russian cinema as a model of political cinema. Soviet films by Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov and others combined a partisan view of the bolshevist regime with artistic innovation which also appealed to western audiences. Film and National Socialism Leni Riefenstahl has never been able or willing to face her responsibility as a chief propagandist for National Socialism. Almost unlimited resources and her undeniable talent led to results which despite their hideous aims still fascinate some film aficionados. There is much controversy around her work, but it is generally accepted that Riefenstahl's main commitment was to moviemaking, rather than to the Nazi party. Proof of that might be seen by the portrayal of Jesse Owens' victory on the movie Olympia (about the Olympic games in Germany) and in her later work, mostly on her photographic expeditions to Africa. (This section is heavily biased and impartial. It needs rewording.) The same is certainly not true of the violent antisemite films of Fritz Hippler. Other Nazi political films made propaganda for so-called euthanasia. Forms The form has always been an important concern for political filmmakers. While some, like pioneering Lionel Rogosin, argued that radical films, in order to liberate the imagination of the spectator, have to break not only with the content but also with the form of Dominant cinema, the falsely reassuring clich√©s and stereotypes of conventional narrative film making, other directors such as Francesco Rosi, Costa Gavras, Ken Loach, Oliver Stone, Spike Lee or Lina Wertm√ºller preferred to work within mainstream cinema to reach a wider audience. The subversive tradition dates back at least to the French avant-garde of the 1920s. Even in his more conventional films Luis Bu√±uel stuck to the spirit of outright revolt of L'√Çge d'or. The bourgeoisie had to be expropriated and all its values destroyed, the surrealists believed. This spirit of revolt is also present in all films of Jean Vigo. Remembrance and reflection Especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, many filmmakers considered focusing on remembrance of and reflection upon major collective crimes such as The Holocaust, slavery and disasters such as the Chernobyl disaster to be their political and moral duty. Globalization and related world issues Political cinema of the twenty- first century seems to focus on controversial topics such as globalization, AIDS and other health-care concerns, issues pertaining to the environment, such as world energy resources and consumption and climate change, and other complex matters pertaining to Discrimination, Capitalism, Politics, terrorism, war, peace, religious and related forms of intolerance, and civil and political rights and other human rights.

It is one of two enantiomers of the compound racemorphan. It was first described in Germany in 1946. The drug has been in medical use in the United States since 1953. Pharmacology Levorphanol acts predominantly as an agonist of the Œº-opioid receptor (MOR), but is also an agonist of the Œ¥-opioid receptor (DOR), Œ∫-opioid receptor (KOR), and the nociceptin receptor (NOP), as well as an NMDA receptor antagonist and a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Levorphanol, similarly to certain other opioids, also acts as a glycine receptor antagonist and GABA receptor antagonist at very high concentrations. Levorphanol is 6 to 8 times as potent as morphine at the MOR. Relative to morphine, levorphanol lacks complete cross-tolerance and possesses greater intrinsic activity at the MOR. The duration of action is generally long compared to other comparable analgesics and varies from 4 hours to as much as 15 hours. For this reason levorphanol is useful in palliation of chronic pain and similar conditions. Levorphanol has an oral to parenteral effectiveness ratio of 2:1, one of the most favorable of the strong narcotics. Its antagonism of the NMDA receptor, similar to those of the phenylheptylamine open-chain opioids such as methadone or the phenylpiperidine ketobemidone, make levorphanol useful for types of pain that other analgesics may not be as effective against, such as neuropathic pain. Levorphanol's exceptionally high analgesic efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain is also conferred by its action on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, similar to the opioids tramadol and tapentadol, and mutually complements the analgesic effect of its NMDA receptor antagonism. Levorphanol shows a high rate of psychotomimetic side effects such as hallucinations and delirium, which have been attributed to its binding to and activation of the KOR. At the same time however, activation of this receptor as well as of the DOR have been determined to contribute to its analgesic effects. Chemistry Levorphanol and its stereoisomer dextrorphan, the enantiomers of the racemic mixture racemorphan. Chemically, levorphanol belongs to the morphinan class and is (‚àí)-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan. It is the \\"left-handed\\" (levorotatory) stereoisomer of racemorphan, that is the racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers with differing pharmacology. The \\"right-handed\\" (dextrorotatory) enantiomer of racemorphan is dextrorphan (DXO), an antitussive, potent dissociative hallucinogen (NMDA receptor antagonist), and weakly active opioid. DXO is an active metabolite of the pharmaceutical drug dextromethorphan (DXM), which, analogously to DXO, is an enantiomer of the racemic mixture racemethorphan along with levomethorphan, the latter of which has similar properties to those of levorphanol.

Its productions include the last series of Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts, the TV specials Horton Hears a Who and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, and the feature film The Phantom Tollbooth, all released by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer.  History  The studio was founded in 1960 as \\"S I B Productions, Inc.\\", which in 1962 had hired the just developing Filmation Associates to animate a syndicated series called Rod Rocket. It afterward evolved into \\"Sib Tower 12, Inc.\\", being taken over by Chuck Jones after he was fired from Warner Bros. Cartoons, where he had served for over 30 years directing the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. A number of animators who had worked under Jones during his Warner Bros. career followed him to Sib Tower 12, as did voice actor Mel Blanc and storyman and writer Michael Maltese. Sib Tower 12 Productions received a contract from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce a new series of Tom and Jerry cartoons, which proved successful.

In addition to the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jones worked on one other short, The Dot and the Line (1965), an abstract piece based upon a children's book by Norton Juster. It won the 1965 Academy Award for Animated Short Film. The studio also turned to television, producing two highly acclaimed TV specials based on books by Dr. Seuss. How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, which aired in 1966, and Horton Hears a Who! in 1970. The studio's most ambitious work was its 1970 feature film The Phantom Tollbooth, adapted from another Norton Juster book. After the studio closed in late 1970, Chuck Jones went on to found Chuck Jones Film Productions which produced television specials based on the stories of Rudyard Kipling and of The Cricket in Times Square series.

In situations where digital materials are licensed, access to these materials is often lost after the licensing agreement has expired. In many cases, the two parties involved in the license agree that it is necessary for the license to retain access to these materials after the license has lapsed. In the licensing of software products, a perpetual license means that a software application is sold on a one-time basis and the licensee can then use a copy of the software forever. The license holder has indefinite access to a specific version of a software program by paying for it only once. Perpetual access is a term that is used within the library community to describe the ability to retain access to electronic journals after the contractual agreement for these materials has passed. Typically when a library licenses access to an electronic journal, the journal's content remains in the possession of the licensor. The library often purchases the rights to all back issues as well as new issues. When the license elapses, access to all the journal's contents is lost. In a typical print model, the library purchases the journals and retains them for the duration of the contract but also after the contract expires. In order to retain access to journals that were released during the term of a license for digital electronic journals, the library must obtain perpetual access rights. Perpetual access is closely related to digital archiving, which is the preservation of electronic documents. Often, if an institution is to retain perpetual access, it must design a way in which to preserve the electronic documents that are granted by the license. Several initiatives have developed methods in which to retain electronic documents and retain perpetual access. The most notable of these are the LOCKSS program and the Ithaka Portico program.

Early life and marriage  Annie Cohen was born in Latvia to Levi (Leib) and Beatrice (Basha) Cohen. She had two older siblings, Sarah and Bennett. Her family moved to the United States in 1875 and she became a citizen as a child, only four or five years old. They settled in Boston, Massachusetts, and lived in a tenement on Spring Street. On January 17, 1887, her father died, and her mother died two months later. Her older sister Sarah was already married and living in Maine, leaving Annie (age 17) and her brother Bennett (age 20) to take care of their younger siblings Jacob and Rosa (ages 10 and 8 or 9 at the time, respectively). Annie and Bennett both soon married, and brought their spouses to share their Spring Street home. In 1888 Annie Cohen married Simon \\"Max\\" Kopchovsky, a peddler. They had three children in the next four years: Bertha Malkie (Mollie), Libbie, and Simon. Her brother Bennett married Bertha, and they had two children. Her brother Jacob died of a lung infection at age 17. Max, a devout Orthodox Jew, attended synagogue and studied the Torah, while Annie sold advertising space for several daily Boston newspapers.  Trip around the world  =The wager= The inspiration for betting (or falsely claiming there was a bet) on a bicycle journey around the world likely came from a former Harvard student E. C. Pfeiffer. Under the pseudonym Paul Jones, he started bicycling in mid-February 1894 claiming to be attempting a trip around the world in one year on a $5,000 wager. Two weeks later, the bet was revealed to be fake. Later in 1894, two rich Boston men allegedly wagered $20,000 against $10,000 that no woman could travel around the world by bicycle in 15 months and earn $5000. It is doubtful there was ever a wager. The alleged bettors were never named. Londonderry's great-grand nephew and author of the authoritative history of her journey, Peter Zheutlin, has stated that \\"It's virtually certain, for example, that she concocted the wager story to sensationalize her trip\\".Backstory: Chasing Annie Londonderry: Part 1 Zheutlin, Peter. Christian Science Monitor. 28 August 2006. Retrieved 6 March 2019. If Annie's gambit was a stunt, one person stood to benefit: Colonel Albert Pope, the owner of Pope Manufacturing Company of Boston and Hartford, which produced, among many other things, Columbia bicycles. His senior salesman at Columbia's main store in Boston delivered one of their models for the start of the journey. The choice of a woman was an obvious extension of previous exploits. In 1887 Thomas Stevens had become the first person to bicycle around the world. Moreover, the bicycle craze of the 1890s was providing women with an independent method of transportation and fomenting an evolution in women's clothing, from full skirts and heavy material to bloomers that allow for more mobility and freedom of movement. Annie Kopchovsky was a highly unlikely choice for the completion of this wager, starting with her name, which identified her as a Jew in a city and country where anti-Semitism was widespread. She lacked the experience, never having ridden a bicycle until a few days before her trip, and had a slight build, only 5 foot 3, about 100 pounds. In addition, she was a married woman and a mother of three children, ages five, three, and two. Sponsorships were crucial to financing the enterprise and the publicity surrounding it. Her 42-pound Columbia women's bike carried a placard attached to the rear wheel that advertised New Hampshire's Londonderry Lithia Spring Water Company, for which the company paid her $100 and she in turn agreed to go by the name \\"Annie Londonderry\\" for the duration of her trip. =Setting out= On June 27, 1894, at about 11 o'clock in the morning, Londonderry set off from the Massachusetts State House on Beacon Hill. The 24-year-old wore a long skirt, corset and high collar and carried with her a change of clothes and a pearl-handled pistol. On her route to Chicago, she chose cycling routes published in tour books by the L.A.W. These tour books contained distances, road conditions, landmarks, places to eat, and hotels that offered cyclist discounts, and provided company as many other cyclists rode the same routes. With good weather and roads, she was able to average between eight and ten miles per day. When she arrived in Chicago on September 24, she had lost 20 pounds and the desire to continue. Winter was coming, and she realized she could not make it across the mountains to San Francisco before snow started to fall. Prior to leaving Chicago to ride home to Boston, she met with Sterling Cycle Works, whose offices and factory were located on Carroll Avenue. The company offered to sponsor her trip and gave her an ivory and gold men's Expert Model E Light Roadster with the words \\"The Sterling\\" painted on the frame. It had a single gear, no freewheel mechanism, and no brake, but it was 20 pounds lighter than her Columbia. She also switched from a dress to bloomers, and eventually wore a men's riding suit. =Europe and Asia= With the change in dress and bicycle, Londonderry was determined to complete her world trip, even though she only had eleven months to make it back to Chicago. She followed her route back to New York City, and on November 24, 1894, she boarded the French liner La Touraine, destined for Le Havre on France's north coast. She arrived on December 3 and became wrapped up in bureaucracy. Her bike was confiscated by custom officials, her money was taken, and the French press wrote insulting articles about her appearance. She managed to free herself and rode from Paris to Marseille. Despite being held up by bad weather, she arrived in two weeks by cycling and train with one foot bandaged and propped up on her handlebars due to an injury on the road. Londonderry left Marseille on the 413-foot steamship Sydney with only eight months to get back to Chicago. The wager did not dictate a minimum cycling distance, so she sailed from place to place, completing day-trips at each stop along the way. She visited many places, including Alexandria, Colombo, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nagasaki and Kobe. =Return to the United States= On March 9, 1895, Londonderry sailed from Yokohama, Japan, and reached the Golden Gate in San Francisco on March 23. She rode to Los Angeles, through Arizona and New Mexico and on to El Paso. At one point, she and another cyclist were almost killed by a runaway horse and wagon. They received minor injuries, yet she claimed that she had been knocked out and taken to a hospital in Stockton where she coughed up blood for two days. In fact, she had given a lecture in Mozart Hall in Stockton the evening after the accident. The Southern Pacific Railway tracks offered many benefits to cyclists traveling across southern California and Arizona, and Londonderry took advantage of them. Riders could follow service roads made of hard packed dirt and stop at shelters for train crews, where they could get a meal and a bath. Some presume she rode the train across parts of the desert, though she claims to have declined rides from passing train crews. From El Paso, she traveled north, leaving Albuquerque on July 20, 1895, bound for Denver, where she arrived on August 12. She rode the train across most of Nebraska because of the muddy roads. Near Gladbrook, Iowa, she broke her wrist when she crashed into a group of pigs and was forced to wear a cast for the remainder of her trip. On September 12, 1895, Londonderry arrived in Chicago, accompanied by two cyclists she had met in Clinton, Iowa, and collected her $10,000 prize. She had made it around the world fourteen days under allowed time. She was back home in Boston on September 24, arriving fifteen months after she had left. When she published an account of her exploits in the New York World on October 20, 1895, the newspaper headline described it as \\"the Most Extraordinary Journey Ever Undertaken by a Woman\\". Despite criticism that she traveled more \\"with\\" a bicycle than on one, she proved a formidable cyclist at impromptu local races en route across America.  Entrepreneurship  Londonderry was a brilliant saleswoman and an exceptional storyteller, raising all of the money and attracting the media attention necessary for her trip to be a success. Her main income was from selling advertising space on her bike and person, hanging ribbons and signs for products ranging from bicycle tires to perfume. Her first sponsor was the Londonderry Lithia Spring Water Company of New Hampshire, which paid her $100 to carry a placard on her bike with its company name and to use the name \\"Annie Londonderry\\" throughout her trip. In Chicago, she received sponsorship from Sterling Cycle Company for promotion of its products when she swapped her bulky Columbia for the faster and lighter Sterling Roadster. During her travels, she gave lectures about her adventures, often exaggerating her exploits. These enthralled the media and boosted her popularity. For instance, in France she described herself as an orphan, wealthy heiress, a Harvard medical student, the inventor of a new method of stenography, and the niece of a U.S. senator. While in the United States, she told stories about hunting tigers in India with German royalty and getting sent to a Japanese prison with a bullet wound. She also gave cycling demonstrations and sold promotional photos of herself, souvenir pins, and autographs. After the trip, she accepted an offer to write about her adventures as the \\"New Woman\\" and moved her family to New York City to continue her journalism career. The article began \\"I am a journalist and a 'new woman,' if that term means that I believe I can do anything that any man can do.\\"  Legacy  Londonderry died in obscurity in 1947. In 2007 Peter Zheutlin, her great-nephew, published Around the World on Two Wheels: Annie Londonderry's Extraordinary Ride. In 2011, Evalyn Parry premiered SPIN, her bicycle-themed performance piece that includes a song about Londonderry (\\"The Ballad of Annie Londonderry\\"), and presented it on tour in Canada and the US. Gillian Klempner Willman of Spokeswoman Productions wrote, directed and produced a 26-minute documentary film titled The New Woman - Annie \\"Londonderry\\" Kopchovsky. It premiered in February 2013 at the DC Independent Film Festival, where it won the award for Best Documentary.DC Independent Film Festival 2013 Winners. Accessed November 7, 2019.

Achkan () also known as Baghal bandi is a knee length jacket worn by men in the Indian subcontinent much like the Angarkha. Etymology The word achkan is derived from Angarkha (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ó‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ï, anga-rakshaka 'body protector').Zaira Mis, Marcel Mis (2001) Asian Costumes and Textiles: From the Bosphorus to Fujiama The angarkha was worn in various parts of the Indian subcontinent, while the basic cut remained the same, styles and lengths varied from region to region.Kumar, Ritu (2006) Costumes and textiles of royal India History Chandragupta II depicted with achkan on gold coinage, Gupta Empire Greeks mention achkan and gown like dresses worn by men and women all the way during mauryan period, The earliest iconographic evidence for such a dress appears in sculptures and rock relief in Iran as well as paintings from Parthian Empire. The earliest iconographic evidence in India is from Kushan Empire which was founded by Central Asian nomadic tribe called Yeuzhi by the Chinese. However, since the Yeuzhi Kushans adopted many aspects of their culture from Greco Parthian Kindgom, therefore its plausible that this dress is the legacy of Parthian culture. It can be distinguished from the Sherwani through various aspects, particularly the front opening. Achkan traditionally has side-opening tied with strings, this style of opening is known as baghal bandi but frontal opening were not uncommon, similar to Angarkha. While sherwani always has straight frontal opening, due to its function as outer-coat. Achkan, like Angarkha was traditionally worn with sash known as patka, kamarband or dora wrapped around the waist to keep the entire costume in place. While sherwani was traditionally worn as decorative outer-coat for special occasions during medieval times. Achkan is always worn with either dhoti or churidar. Achkan is made from various fabrics for both formal and informal occasions, it features traditional embroidery like gota and badla. Today, achkan is commonly worn by the grooms during wedding ceremonies or other formal festive occasions in the Indian subcontinent. There are various regional variations of achkan worn throughout the Indian subcontinent, and are known by regional names such as Daura in Nepal and Northeast India, Angi in Southern India and Chola or Cholu in Indian Himalayas.

The focus of ATSSB is on serving the needs of small school band students, directors, parents, and administrators. ATSSB was created in 1991. ATSSB Membership is open to any band director and/or assistant director, those high schools which the University Interscholastic League classifies as class 4A(AAAA) and below (beginning in 2014-15) or middle school that feeds a 4A or smaller high school or a private middle school, with classifications determined by enrollment. The school must be accredited by the Texas Education Agency or an accrediting agency approved by the Texas Private School Accreditation Commission. The Association of Texas Small School Bands is headquartered in Houston, Texas. Although, ATSSB was formed out of frustration with the Texas Music Educators Association (believing it, and especially its All-State Band, to be dominated by the larger AAAA and AAAAA schools), the two organizations regularly work together, (alongside with the Texas Bandmasters Organization), to promote music education in Texas. ATSSB meets twice each year in General Session - once in February and once in July. In addition, the ATSSB All-State Bands rehearse and perform in San Antonio in February. Each year, ATSSB hosts an audition process to select two high school all-state bands and a jazz band. History At a Texas Music Educators Association Executive Board meeting in 1981, Region 2 Chairman Lonnie Dooley made a request for a feasibility study to consider designating one of the existing All-State bands for 4A and down students only. This request was based on information that although half of the students in Texas attended schools class 4A and down, less than twelve percent of the students in the All-State Bands were from those classifications. Less than three percent were from 3A schools and down. The proposal was defeated by a vote of 55 to 6 to make the study. Lonnie asked what had to be done to get the issue before the general membership and TMEA President Bill Woods responded by naming a committee to study the proposal. The committee returned a negative report and after some discussion, the measure failed. After 1981, the number of small school bandsmen in the All-State Band continued to decline as the quality and quantity of private lesson programs in 4A and 5A schools increased, in effect eliminating small school students from an allstate experience. In 1989, Mike Marsh, from Eldorado High School and TMEA Band Division Chairman of Region VII, sent a letter to small school band directors across the state. In his letter, he called for directors to petition their Region Band Chairs to call for a referendum on the creation of a small-school All-State Band at the TMEA Band Division meeting to be held in February. Scott Taylor (TMEA Band Division Vice-President) appointed a ‚ÄúSmall-School All-State Band Committee‚Äù which met in February prior to the Band Division meeting. Because this committee brought a negative report to the Band Division (8 were against, 6 for, and 2 abstained), it was quickly set aside. Before the issue could be dismissed, Kenneth Griffin from Van High School made a motion that a committee be named to ‚Äústudy the feasibility of creating an All-State Band specifically for students from 1A, 2A, and 3A classification schools‚Äù and that the findings of this committee be reported to the band division for their consideration at the 1991 convention. The motion was quickly seconded and the motion resoundingly passed, so Taylor subsequently appointed members to the All-State Band Reorganization Study (ASBROS). Mike Marsh (one of the appointees) had sent out a questionnaire asking who in small schools was for or against the creation of a small-school All-State Band. He received 210 responses - 202 for and 8 against. Frank Coachman took over as Band Division Vice-President (Scott Taylor moved on to TMEA President) and guided the ASBROS committee to come up with the proposal concerning the small school All-State Band. However, Coachman added the inclusion of CCC students - something no one had ever proposed in initial discussions. In the ensuing 1991 Band Division meeting, several directors spoke for and against the proposal. Kenneth Griffin made a motion that the vote be taken to include only A, AA and AAA schools. His motion was ruled out of order by Frank Coachman and ballots were cast. The vote was 554 to 372 against the creation of a small-school All-State Band as presented by the ASBROS committee. The frustration small-school directors experienced at that February meeting inspired John Gibson from Ballinger to immediately write a letter to several small-school directors asking if they would be interested in forming a small-school band association. The positive responses he received led him to invite directors across the state who had expressed an interest in small school bands to meet in Abilene. The meeting was held in the Wylie High School band hall in Abilene, Texas, on Saturday, March 16, 1991. A long afternoon of discussion centered around several topics, including: 1) the need for such an organization; 2) its purpose; 3) its philosophy; 4) its function - including the possibility of creating and maintaining an A-AA-AAA All-State Band; and 5) the need for immediate funds (it was decided that each one present would contribute $100 to cover the expenses of getting started). It was agreed that the purpose of the association was not in defiance of or opposition to already established organizations, but was to more fully disseminate information to, and educate and refine the unique role of, small school bands in the state of Texas. The organization was named the ‚ÄúAssociation of Texas Small School Bands.‚Äù In discussion regarding the organization of ATSSB, it was decided that a Region Coordinator should be named to represent the association at the region level. These were either named from directors in attendance at that meeting or were to be secured at a later date. It was decided that the Association would make plans to have an All-State Band clinic in San Antonio February 5‚Äì8, 1992. After objections about it being in conjunction with the TMEA convention, it was argued that it was also in conjunction with the Fat Stock Show and other lesser conventions, but that it would be difficult for small school directors to take off from school for the two events, and that most would remain as members of TMEA in addition to belonging to and participating in the activities of ATSSB. The consensus was that if at least 100 directors would participate the first year, the organization and the ensuing All-State Band would be successful. Actually, 380 directors joined that first year. In April 1991, a letter was sent to all A, AA, and AAA band directors in Texas inviting them to join the Association. They were told that ATSSB would: be a non-profit organization dedicated to the needs of students in Texas A, AA and AAA programs; support and recognize excellence in A, AA and AAA band programs and the students involved in them; be dedicated to the promotion and advancement of A, AA and AAA band programs; promote music education in Texas A, AA and AAA schools and their supporting communities through their band programs; and make every effort to organize a AAA All-State Band to recognize the individual excellence of A, AA and AAA band members in Texas. The second meeting of the Association was held in Abilene on June 8, 1991. Mike Marsh and Kenneth Griffin reported on their trip to San Antonio to determine if there was a site for rehearsals and housing for the proposed All-State Band. After checking with area hotels (cost prohibitive and unavailable ballrooms for rehearsals - Beethoven Hall too small and the Majestic Theater booked), they were directed to the Scottish Rite Auditorium. After visiting with the staff and booking space for the rehearsal and performance, they stepped out of the auditorium and noticed the Ramada Emily Morgan Hotel in the next block adjacent to the Alamo. Entering the hotel and visiting with the Sales Manager, they booked rooms for the all-state students during the clinic. Final arrangements were completed regarding the organization of the Association, including the adoption of the Constitution and By-Laws, region alignment, area alignment, audition procedures, color instrument taped audition procedures, selection of the Prescribed Music List for auditions for 1991-92, and the establishment of a quarterly Newsletter. During the summer and fall of 1991, several meetings were held with the TMEA Executive Committee and officers to discuss: using TMEA region band auditions to certify ATSSB Area students (denied); using the state of Texas for ATSSB All-State Band patches (required no permission); and allowing students to audition for both TMEA and ATSSB at the Area level (it was decided that ATSSB would hold Area auditions on the same date as TMEA but in different locations). Since that summer and fall, continuing discussion with successive leaders in TMEA leadership has: allowed ATSSB All-State students access to TMEA exhibits and clinics for a fee which was dropped in 1999; allowed ATSSB meetings and All-State Band rehearsal schedules and concerts listings in TMEA programs; and given the ATSSB membership the opportunity to hear candidates for TMEA office. ATSSB and TMEA agreed to align their audition processes in 1999-2000, using identical rules and procedures for auditions, but allowing ATSSB to maintain the use of its own Prescribed Audition List and separate funding for all activities. The ATSSB All-State Band Since its inception, ATSSB has not only kept its ever-increasing number of members informed of small school band activities across the state, it has also sponsored the ATSSB All-State Band: The first ATSSB All-State Band met in rehearsals in San Antonio under the direction of Gary Lewis from the University of Michigan in February 1992. There were 123 students in the first band from at least 76 different A, AA and AAA high schools in Texas. There were initially 380 ATSSB members during the first year. In 1996, One student was recognized for making the ATSSB All-State Band for all four years and was given a $1000 scholarship for the achievement (the fund was started in April 1995 after a proposal by Wayne Smith as the ATSSB 4-Year All-State Band Scholarship ‚Äì the three students who had made the ATSSB All-State Band all four years in 1995 were also awarded the $1000 scholarship retroactively). In 1997 the addition of a second all-state band for ATSSB: the Symphonic Band was led by Dr. Tim Lautzenheiser and the Concert Band was led by Dr. Gary Garner from West Texas State University. Additionally, the ATSSB State Board of Directors voted to award the $1000 scholarship to the original three students who had made the ATSSB All-State Band all four years. In 2003, the Scholarship program was expanded, increasing the 4-year scholarship to $2000 and adding a $500 scholarship to seniors who made all-state three years. In 2004 the ATSSB All-State Jazz Ensemble was added with Shelly Berg from the University of Southern California as the first clinician. In 2013, The band was divided by vote of the membership into the Concert Band (Class 1A-3A Track) and Symphonic Band (1A-4A Track) with color instruments divided among the band on an open track.

The game is set in the same universe (and runs on the same game engine) as Silent Storm, an earlier product by the same company. Background story Germany has recently been divided between Soviet and Western zones, the Cold War has just begun, and the Americans still have a monopoly on the atomic bomb. Gameplay The player takes on the role of a Soviet commando assigned to operate behind British-American lines in 1949 post-World War II Germany. The game features an open ended storyline whereby the player's actions determine the course of the game. The player also has significant control over the movement of his team between game maps and the passage of time, both of which also affect the storyline. The player can assign feats for his team members with each level-up as well as outfit them with disguises for moving through towns without attracting attention. A wide range of authentic weapons of the era can also be scavenged from dead enemies to outfit the player's team as well as bought and sold for cash. As with Silent Storm, nearly all structures are completely destructible with enough firepower. Hammer & Sickle also employs ragdoll physics for bodies according to the precise velocity of an impact. Fully three-dimensional mapping allows for obstruction calculations and cover effects from all angles, bullets ricochet and their stopping power depends on the weapon. Things are somewhat exaggerated for a more cinematic experience. Reviews Reviews of the game have generally been average to poor, with the polish and high difficulty of the end product being the most common complaint. Strategy specialist reviewers have highly praised the non-linearity and difficulty of the game.

The attack is usually carried out by way of a standard dictionary attack, where valid e-mail addresses are found by brute force guessing valid e-mail addresses at a domain using different permutations of common usernames. These attacks are more effective for finding e-mail addresses of companies since they are likely to have a standard format for official e-mail aliases (i.e. jdoe@example.domain, johnd@example.domain, or johndoe@example.domain). There are two main techniques for generating the addresses that a DHA targets. In the first, the spammer creates a list of all possible combinations of letters and numbers up to a maximum length and then appends the domain name. This would be described as a standard brute force attack. This technique would be impractical for usernames longer than 5-7 characters. For example, one would have to try 368 (nearly 3 trillion) e-mail addresses to exhaust all 8-character sequences. The other, more targeted technique, is to create a list that combines common first name and surnames and initials (as in the example above). This would be considered a standard dictionary attack when guessing usernames for e-mail addresses. The success of a directory harvest attack relies on the recipient e-mail server rejecting e-mail sent to invalid recipient e-mail addresses during the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) session. Any addresses to which email is accepted are considered valid and are added to the spammer's list (which is commonly sold between spammers). Although the attack could also rely on Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) to be sent to the sender address to notify of delivery failures, directory harvest attacks likely don't use a valid sender e-mail address. The actual e-mail message generated to the recipient addresses will usually be a short random phrase such as \\"hello\\", so as not to trigger a spam filter. The actual content that is to be advertised will be sent in a later campaign to just the valid email addresses. One theory is that spammers also use DHAs to disseminate spam, and not just to collect email addresses for a later spam campaign. Using the method in this way, similar to a paper-based leaflet drop, the sender achieves the goal based on sheer volume, and not on accuracy of delivery. Using this method, the message would likely contain the content that the spammer is advertising, and not a short random phrase.

The Inca state was known as the Kingdom of Cuzco before 1438. Over the course or the Inca Empire, the Inca used conquest and peaceful assimilation to incorporate the territory of modern-day Peru, followed by a large portion of western South America, into their empire, centered on the Andean mountain range. However, shortly after the Inca Civil War, the last Sapa Inca (emperor) of the Inca Empire was captured and killed on the orders of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, marking the beginning of Spanish rule. The remnants of the empire retreated to the remote jungles of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo-Inca State, which was conquered by the Spanish in 1572. The Quechua name for the empire after the reforms under Pachacuti was Tawantin Suyu, which can be translated The Four Regions or The Four United Regions. Before the Quechua spelling reform it was written in Spanish as Tahuantinsuyo. Tawantin is a group of four things (tawa \\"four\\" with the suffix -ntin which names a group); suyu means \\"region\\" or \\"province\\". The empire was divided into four suyus, whose corners met at the capital, Cuzco (Qosqo).  Origin stories of the Incas  The Inca have four types of origin :In one, Tici Viracocha of Colina de las Ventanas in Paqariq Tampu sent forth his four sons and four daughters to establish a village. Along the way, Sinchi Roca was born to Manco and Ocllo, and Sinchi Roca is the person who finally led them to the valley of Cuzco where they founded their new village. There Manco became their leader and became known as Manco C√°pac. :In another origin myth, the sun god Inti ordered Manco C√°pac and Mama Ocllo to emerge from the depths of Lake Titicaca and found the city of Cuzco. They traveled through caves until reaching Cuzco where they established Hurin Cuzco, or the first dynasty of the Kingdom of Cuzco. :In a third origin myth, an Inca sun god told his wife that he was lonely. She proposed that he create a civilization to worship him and keep him company. He saw this as a wise plan and carried it out. The Inca were born from Lake Cusco and populated the Andes and worshiped their sun god. :In the last origin myth, Manco C√°pac, who was the son of the sun, and his sister Mama Occlo, the daughter of the moon, were sent by the sun to look for a place to build an empire. They were to tell when they were at the right place by carrying a special rod with them at all times. Wherever the rod sank into the ground, this was where they were to create a new city. The rod sank into the ground in Cuzco. The knowledge of these myths is due to oral tradition since the Incas did not have writing. Manco C√°pac, who became the leader of his tribe, probably did exist, despite lack of solid evidence. The archeological evidence seems to indicate that the Inca were a relatively unimportant tribe until the time of Sinchi Roca, also called Cinchi Roca, who is the first figure in Inca mythology whose existence can be supported historically. The Inca people began as a tribe in the Cusco area around the 12th century. Under the leadership of Manco C√°pac, they formed the small city-state of Cusco Quechua Qosqo. In 1438, under the command of Sapa Inca (paramount leader) Pachacuti, whose name meant \\"world-shaker\\", they began a far-reaching expansion. The land Pachacuti conquered was about half the Andes mountain range. Pachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cusco into an empire, the Tahuantinsuyu, a federalist system which consisted of a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW), and Qullasuyu (SE). Pachacuti is also thought to have built Machu Picchu, either as a family home or retreat. Pachacuti would send spies to regions he wanted in his empire who would report back on their political organization, military might and wealth. He would then send messages to the leaders of these lands extolling the benefits of joining his empire, offering them presents of luxury goods such as high-quality textiles, and promising that they would be materially richer as subject rulers of the Inca. Most accepted the rule of the Inca as a fait accompli and acquiesced peacefully. The ruler's children would then be brought to Cuzco to be taught about Inca administration systems, then return to rule their native lands. This allowed the Inca to indoctrinate the former ruler's children into the Inca nobility, and, with luck, marry their daughters into families at various corners of the empire. It was traditional for the Inca's son to lead the army; Pachacuti's son T√∫pac Inca began conquests to the north in 1463 and continued them as Inca after Pachucuti's death in 1471. His most important conquest was the Kingdom of Chimor, the Inca's only serious rival for the coast of Peru. T√∫pac Inca's empire stretched north into modern- day Ecuador and Colombia. T√∫pac Inca's son Huayna C√°pac added significant territory to the south. At its height, Tahuantinsuyu included Peru, southwest Ecuador, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, northern Chile and a small part of southwest Colombia. Tahuantinsuyu was a patchwork of languages, cultures, and peoples. The components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal, nor were the local cultures all fully integrated. The portions of the Chachapoya that had been conquered were almost openly hostile to the Inca, and the Inca nobles rejected an offer of refuge in their kingdom after their troubles with the Spanish. For instance, the Chim√∫ used money in their commerce, while the Inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labour (it is said that Inca tax collectors would take the head lice of the lame and old as a symbolic tribute). Economic productivity was based on collective labor which was organized in order to benefit the whole community. The ayni was used to help individual members of the community in need, such as a sick member of the community. The Minka or teamwork represented community service and the Mita was the tax paid to the Inca in the form of labor. The Inca did not use currency, economic exchanges were by reciprocity and took place in markets called catus.  Spanish conquest and Neo-Inca State  Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro explored south from Panama, reaching Inca territory by 1526. It was clear that they had reached a wealthy land with prospects of great treasure, and after one more expedition (1529), Pizarro traveled to Spain and received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy. At the time the Spanish returned to Peru, in 1532, a war of succession between Huayna Capac's sons Hu√°scar and Atahualpa and unrest among newly conquered territories‚Äîand perhaps more they were said to have hidden a city or gold in a vault. Significantly, smallpox, which had spread from Central America‚Äîhad considerably weakened the empire. Pizarro did not have a formidable force; with just 170 men, 1 cannon, only 27 horses and 356 bananas, he often needed to talk his way out of potential confrontations that could have easily wiped out his party. Their first engagement was the battle of Pun√°, near present-day Guayaquil, Ecuador; Pizarro then founded the city of Piura in July 1532. Hernando de Soto was sent inland to explore the interior, and returned with an invitation to meet the Inca, Atahualpa, who had defeated his brother in the civil war and was resting at Cajamarca with his army of 80,000 troops. Pizarro met with the Inca, who had brought only a small retinue, and through interpreters demanded that he convert to Christianity. A widely disputed legend claims that Atahualpa was handed a Bible and threw it on the floor, the Spanish supposedly interpreted this action as adequate reason for war. Though some chroniclers suggest that Atahualpa simply didn't understand the notion of a book, others portray Atahualpa as being genuinely curious and inquisitive in the situation. Regardless, the Spanish attacked the Inca's retinue (see Battle of Cajamarca), capturing Atahualpa. Thereby, the victory of the comparatively small Spanish force can be attributed to the presence of Spanish horses, which were unknown to the Inca before the arrival of Pizarro, as well as to the usage of guns and cannons by the Spanish men. Furthermore, the local educational investments, which had an impact on economic growth and development, did not equal those of the Spaniards, with the numeracy level of Peruvian Inca Indios amounting to half the numeracy level of Spanish invaders. Pizarro used the capture of Atahualpa to gain gold as a ransom. Atahualpa offered the Spaniards enough gold to fill the room he was imprisoned in, and twice that amount of silver. The Incas fulfilled this ransom. Over four months, almost 8 tons of gold was collected. Pizarro was supposed to let the ruler of the Incas free once the ransom was paid, but he refused to release the Inca after that and instead had him strangled in public. During Atahualpa's imprisonment Hu√°scar was assassinated. The Spanish maintained that this was at Atahualpa's orders; this was one of the charges used against Atahualpa when the Spanish finally decided to put him to death, in August 1533. The Spanish installed his brother Manco Inca Yupanqui in power; for some time Manco cooperated with the Spanish, while the Spanish fought to put down resistance in the north. Meanwhile, an associate of Pizarro's, Diego de Almagro, attempted to claim Cusco for himself. Manco tried to use this intra- Spanish feud to his advantage, recapturing Cusco (1536), but the Spanish retook the city. Manco Inca then retreated to the mountains of Vilcabamba and founded the Neo-Inca State, where he and his successors ruled for another 36 years, sometimes raiding the Spanish or inciting revolts against them. In 1572 the last Inca stronghold was discovered, and the last ruler, T√∫pac Amaru, Manco's son, was captured and executed, bringing the Inca empire to an end.  After the Spanish conquest  After the fall of Tahuantinsuyu, the new Spanish rulers repressed the people and their traditions. Many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system. The Spanish used the Inca mita (mandatory public service) system to get labourers for mines and plantations. One member of each family was forced to work in the gold and silver mines, the foremost of which was the silver mine at Potos√≠. When one family member died, which would usually happen within a year or two, the family would be required to send a replacement. The major languages of the empire, Quechua and Aymara, were employed by the Catholic Church to evangelize in the Andean region. In some cases, these languages were taught to peoples who had originally spoken other indigenous languages. Today, Quechua and Aymara remain the most widespread Amerindian languages. The legend of the Inca has served as inspiration for resistance movements in the region. These include the 1780 rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II against the Spanish, as well as contemporary the guerrilla movements T√∫pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) and Sendero Luminoso in Peru and Tupamaros in Uruguay.  Notes  * Before the official orthography, during the use of Hispanic spellings, it was written as tahuantinsuyo. See: Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift * Tawantin suyu derives from the Quechua \\"tawa\\" (four), to which the suffix \\"-ntin\\" (together or united) is added, followed by \\"suyu\\" (region or province), which roughly renders as \\"The land of the four parts together\\".

In September 1985, after the separate school system was implemented, the school was renamed to St. Joseph‚Äôs Secondary School by Percy Beaudette, and moved to its present location. The school initially educated Grades 9, 10 and 11 students, with Grade 12 added in September 1986 and Grade 13/OAC courses added in September 1987. In September 1993, the school was expanded to its current size and layout. In the summer of 2018, the renovation of the closed General Vanier Intermediate School took place to include a separate grade 7-8 wing in St. Joseph due to area elementary schools switching to a K-6 program or being consolidated. Academics St. Joseph's offers courses in accordance with Ontario's secondary school curriculum. Being a Catholic school, religion courses are mandatory in grades 9-12. However according to the Ontario Education Act R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER E.2 43 (13). Students may be exempt from religion course, provided the parents notify the school in writing. The Ontario Superior Court has ruled that student at a Catholic high school who is entitled to be excused from religious courses must also be excused, if they wish, from religious field trips and attending mass. In addition, Specialist High Skill Majors (SHSM) are offered in Automotive, Business and Hospitality to provide students with certifications. Athletics St. Joseph's offers a full co-curricular athletic programme. Each year, a full slate of teams compete against other independent schools in the Eastern Ontario Secondary Schools Athletic Association (EOSSAA). St. Joseph's competitive sports teams are known as the \\"Panthers\\".

The game was never released in Europe and the game is not playable on PAL consoles. The story takes place in the post-apocalyptic year of 2777, after Earth has been devastated by nuclear war and natural disasters, with the island nation of Xexyz now being threatened by alien robots. The Japanese Famicom version is based on the tales of Urashima Tar≈ç, features cutscenes throughout the game, a choice of three endings and has minor graphical differences in some of the NPCs.  Gameplay  The game revolves around the main character Apollo, who progresses through the game in an alternating format that switches between platform, side-scrolling action (similar to the Super Mario Bros. series) and side-scrolling shooter action (similar to Konami's Gradius series). The goal of the game is to destroy the evil Goruza, rescue Princess Maria, and save the planet. In the platforming levels, defeated enemies drop life ('L' blocks) or money ('E' blocks) power-ups. Apollo can collect the currency of the land ('Balls'/'E Ball') in order to exchange it for power-ups and information, as well as access to minigames. Vendors are scattered throughout the platforming levels through doors or hidden gates. In the shooter levels, the player can obtain 'S' and 'P' items that upgrade speed and weapons, respectively. The first platformer area of Xexyz. = Platformer gameplay = The odd-numbered stages in the game (1, 3, 5, etc.) utilize mostly platform-style gameplay. These stages work in the familiar manner; the character progresses at his/her own pace, picking up new weapons and power-ups along the way. To leave the initial area of each of these levels the player has to collect a \\"force star\\" by defeating an enemy found in a hidden room. Once this star is obtained the character is able to enter the \\"mechanical castle\\" in the region. The mechanical castles, being mazelike indoor environments full of robots and machines, stand in stark contrast to the earlier parts of each level, which are organic outdoor environments. Each mechanical castle also has a brief auto-scrolling shooter segment through which the player must pass; these segments foreshadow the imminent transition to the following even-numbered stages. The segments in question consist of a sequence of corridors, at the end of which are two doors; choosing the wrong door loops the player back. Finally, at the very end of each mechanical castle, there is a door leading to a boss fight. The boss fights are set against a solid black background and Apollo must fight while standing on a controllable floating platform. = Side-scrolling shooter gameplay = For the even-numbered stages (2, 4, 6, etc.) the character is prompted to jump into a vehicle (a different one each time) and take part in an auto-scrolling Gradius-like level ending with a boss fight.http://theretrocorner.com/nes-hidden-gems/ = Boss fights = Xexyz title screen. In the transition area after the platform-style levels, prior to the boss fight, Apollo is prompted to jump on a platform that lets him float. After moving into a previously out-of-reach door, the fight begins. In side- scrolling shooter areas, the player simply appears in a boss area in the ship they played the level in. The fights consist of a black area where the player fights a giant robot/ship. Their attack pattern, resembling that of a Manic shooter, is repetitive and avoidable; the player shoots the boss with either their conventional weapon or the in-ship weapon. = Tube Shooter gameplay = The final level is a \\"fixed\\" shooter. More specifically, it is a \\"tube shooter\\" where the player approaches the last boss's fortress and attempts to destroy it. Apollo, in a more enhanced ship than any seen before, rotates from the sides of the screen to the bottom, shooting at the center while avoiding enemy fire. = Weapons and items = Apollo receives weapons and items from a goddess character to help him on his way. All weapons can be powered up by visiting a shop that specializes in powering up weapons, or by talking to the goddess character a second time.

The film stars Dilip Kumar, Nargis and Raj Kapoor in a love triangle, with Cukoo and Murad in supporting roles. The film's music was provided by Naushad and lyrics written by Majrooh Sultanpuri. It is the only film to feature Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor together onscreen. At the time of its release, Andaz was the highest-grossing Indian film ever, until its record was broken by Raj Kapoor's Barsaat that same year. Plot Nargis, Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar in scene from the film. Neena (Nargis) is the spoiled daughter of a rich businessman (Murad). One day while horseriding, she loses control of her horse and is rescued by a young man named Dilip (Dilip Kumar). Dilip instantly takes a liking to her and starts to frequently visit her house where he entertains her with his singing along with Neena's friend Sheela (Cukoo). Neena's father dislikes this; he tries to make her realise that spending so much time with Dilip is not wise, as Dilip might misconstrue their friendship as love. On the day of Sheela's birthday party, Dilip realises he has fallen in love with Neena and tries to tell her. However, tragedy strikes on the same day when Neena's father dies of a heart attack, leaving Neena devastated. Dilip comforts her and Neena gives him the responsibility of looking after her father's business and staying in a spare room at her home. Dilip tries to confide in Neena about his feelings for her but is shocked when her fianc√© Rajan (Raj Kapoor) returns from London. Rajan and Neena eventually get married, and Dilip finally reveals his true feelings for Neena on the wedding day. Neena is shocked by Dilip's revelation as she thinks of him only as a friend. Dilip tries to leave but stays to avoid any suspicion from Rajan. A few years later, Rajan and Neena are the parents of a daughter. On their daughter's birthday, Dilip arrives with a present. When the electricity cuts off and causes a blackout in their home, Neena tries to secretly tell Dilip that she does not love him and that he should leave, unaware that she has said all this to Rajan. Rajan accuses Neena of having an affair with Dilip and Dilip decides to clear Rajan's misunderstanding. He confronts Rajan and tries to convince him that he is wrong about Neena. In a fit of rage, Rajan attacks Dilip rendering him unconscious. He leaves home and takes his daughter with him. Neena comes to Dilip's aid and tells a doctor to save him as he is proof that she has not cheated on Rajan. When Dilip awakens, he is half mad and tries to molest Neena, insisting she really is in love with him. Neena grabs a gun and shoots Dilip, killing him instantly, and is then imprisoned. Rajan testifies against Neena in court about her affair with Dilip and how she killed him to hide her infidelity. While Neena awaits for the judge's verdict, Rajan tells his daughter that she is not coming back and tears up the doll that Dilip had given her on her birthday. Inside the doll he finds a letter Dilip had written for Neena, saying that Rajan is the fortunate one who she loves and he has realised this now. Upon reading the letter, Rajan realises he had been wrong about Neena and that Neena loved only him. The judge sentences Neena to life imprisonment and Rajan and his daughter come to see her before she is taken away. Cast *Dilip Kumar \\\\- Dilip *Raj Kapoor \\\\- Rajan *Nargis \\\\- Neena *V.

This section, close to the station at Helen's Bay, is now a public lane. The bridge (just about visible through the trees) carries the Belfast-Bangor railway line. The Clandeboye Estate is a country estate located in Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland, outside Belfast. Covering , it contains woodlands, formal and walled gardens, lawns, a lake, and of farmland. The estate is currently home to Lindy, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, widow of the last Marquess (the title being extinct).  History  Clandeboye was first settled in 1674, but the Clandeboye House of today dates from 1801, utilising a design by Robert Woodgate that incorporated elements of the previous building and was built for the politician Sir James Blackwood, 2nd Baron Dufferin and Clandeboye. It was then known as Ballyleidy. In memory of his mother, Helen, Lady Dufferin (granddaughter of the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan), Lord Dufferin and Ava built the stone edifice Helen's Tower on the estate, which has since been immortalised by Tennyson in the poem of the same name. The tower has taken on an unforeseen poignancy, as an almost exact replica of it, the Ulster Tower, was built at Thiepval to honour the men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who fell at the Battle of the Somme. The estate was used for army training during the First World War, and the 36th (Ulster) Division trained beside Helen's Tower before leaving for France. The tower can be reached via the Ulster Way, a five-mile (8 km) section of which traverses the estate. The parklands familiar to visitors today were originally laid out by the 1st Marquess, who was also responsible for the addition of the banqueting hall to the house in 1898.  Flora and fauna  As a result of the work of the 1st Marquess, Clandeboye is home to the largest area of broad-leaved woodland in Northern Ireland, consisting mostly of oak, birch, and beech. The estate is also home to a large variety of animal species; those recorded as present on the estate include the osprey, red kite, tree sparrow, barn owl, yellowhammer, song thrush, pipistrelle bat, red squirrel, fallow deer, common newt, marsh fritillary, and the wall brown butterfly. The estate is home to the Conservation Volunteers Northern Ireland. Publication The 2011 BBC television series The Country House Revealed was accompanied by a full length illustrated companion book, which featured Clandeboye Estate as a dedicated chapter appearing as Chapter Five of the book edition.

Biography Olney was born in Marathon, Iowa. He lived in a house above the village of Solli√®s-Toucas in Provence, France, for most of his adult life, where he wrote many classic and influential cookbooks of French country cooking. He had first moved to France in 1951, to Paris, where he was close friends with (and painted many of) the American and English bohemian expatriate set, including James Baldwin, filmmaker Kenneth Anger, painter John Craxton, poet John Ashbery, and composer Ned Rorem. His deep knowledge of traditional classic French food and wine got him a job writing a column entitled Un Am√©ricain (gourmand) √† Paris for the journal Cuisine et Vins de France beginning in 1962. After The French Menu Cookbook was published in English in 1970, his then-revolutionary approach of seasonal menus and close attention to wine pairings began to attract notice in Britain and America. By the time he wrote Simple French Food in 1974, he was one of the most important food writers of the era, with a huge impact on nouvelle cuisine and California cuisine. Alice Waters, of Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, California, and Kermit Lynch, the well-known Berkeley wine writer and retailer, were both disciples. He introduced LynchKermit Lynch Interview - Terrance Gelenter to many French wine growers, including Lucien and Lulu Peyraud of Domaine Tempier, who were then re-establishing the Bandol AOC as a vineyard area of the first rank. James Beard was an important American mentor, and Olney, in the midst of his career, taught a series of cooking classes in Beard's West Village apartment. Despite this, Olney, in a memoir, presents a mixed picture of Beard's character. From 1977 to 1982, Olney edited the 28-volume Time-Life book series The Good Cook. By the time of his death, from heart failure, in addition to the Time-Life set he had written many of his own brilliant, idiosyncratic, poetic books about food and wine. His last book, Reflexions, a memoir, was published posthumously by Brick Tower Press. Olney died aged 72 in Solli√®s-Toucas, France. The Observer Food Monthly panel of chefs, cooks, writers and restaurateurs elected The French Menu Cookbook as their favourite cookbook in early 2010, but were saddened that it was very difficult to find. Since then the book has been republished.Observer Food Monthly, December 2010, no. 115.

Career Younghusband moved to St. John's, Newfoundland with his family in 1978 and began his career as a stage actor in 1986, then branched out into different media and different formats, including radio and television, filling roles in both writing positions and as an on-air personality. He has worked in serious and comedic roles, as well as documentary, reality and news productions. One of his comedic appearances was an on-stage and television appearance at the Halifax Comedy Festival. His early television writing duties were in comedic environments, but recently, he has written for the two Canada's Worst reality series. Toiling in limited roles through the 1990s, Younghusband made several guest appearances in television series as well as making modest film appearances, several of which placed him on the same sets \\"rubbing elbows\\" with notable Canadian (and fellow Newfoundland natives) personalities including Rick Mercer, Cathy Jones and Mary Walsh. In 1999, he was co-creator, writer and actor in the short-lived Canadian series Dooley Gardens, playing the role of Tracy, a homicidal ex-con Zamboni driver. Later that year, he began hosting and co-wrote a Salter Street production called Foodessence, which lasted 65 episodes. The Gemini award- winning Foodessence explored how, why and what we eat through anthropology, social-science, history and science. The reality-based and historical aspects of the show seemed to signal the beginning of a change of direction for Younghusband's career. In 2000, he earned critical acclaim for his role in the film Violet as Carlos, the brilliant, gay son of the title character played by Walsh. The film, set in Newfoundland, was first screened in August at the Montreal Film Festival. Salter Street was purchased by Alliance Atlantis and after the completion of his work on Foodessence, he signed up to participate in a new Life Network reality TV production called Tall Ship Chronicles. Departing Lunenburg, Nova Scotia in December 2000 on a 19-month, around the world voyage, Younghusband became a crew member of the barque Picton Castle. On board were the captain and nine other professional crew members, along with 35 trainees including Younghusband. Although he was the narrator of the program, he also had to act as bona-fide member of the crew who was required to live under 19th-century conditions. During the voyage, the footage was aired (beginning in June 2001) as a 16-part documentary on Life Network and later on other networks like the UK incarnation of the Travel Channel. Topsail Entertainment, which produced the series, later went on to produce the popular series Trailer Park Boys. Younghusband made a guest appearance as Corporal Anderson on the Topsail-produced series Black Harbour in 1998. Younghusband appeared on CBC Newsworld regularly in a segment called Inside Media, in which he shows a talent for political satire. In 2004, he hosted a national radio show on CBC One and Two called Crank It Up. Following his experiences in the genre, Younghusband has since worked frequently in reality TV. He served as the host and co-writer for the series Canada's Worst Driver, which ran for 14 seasons. He also served as the host and co-writer of Canada's Worst Handyman, which ran for six seasons. In June 2013, while filming Canada's Worst Driver Ever, he began hosting Don't Drive Here, chronicling driving experiences in some of the worst places to drive in the world (Delhi, Bangkok, Mexico City, Manila, Lima and Ulaanbaatar). The show ran for two seasons but was not renewed for a third due to poor ratings. Personal Younghusband was born in Canberra, Australia, while his father was attending university there. Younghusband now resides in Toronto, Ontario. Over the course of his life and career, he has visited over 40 countries.

A. Milne play Toad of Toad Hall based on the book. Character Mr. Toad is an anthropomorphic common toad who is the village squire, being the wealthy owner and occupant of Toad Hall. Toad is very rich and a bit of a fop, with a penchant for Harris tweed suits. He owns his own horse, and is able to indulge his impulsive desires, such as punting, house boating and hot air ballooning. Toad is intelligent, creative and resourceful; however, he is also narcissistic, self-centred, and completely lacking in even the most basic common sense. His reckless interest in motor cars leads to an episode in which he steals one and drives it recklessly. The result of this is a twenty-year prison sentence, but he escapes from prison dressed as a washer woman to regain his family seat of Toad Hall from the clutches of the weasels. Although he has escaped from jail, and the police initially pursue him, he is never re- arrested. No reason is ever given for this, but in the 1949 Disney movie, he is shown being framed for theft when he should be in jail for twenty years. In The Willows in Winter, the sequel to the 1995 animated film, Toad is arrested again after being recognised by the Chief Judge as the criminal he convicted before and is hauled before a court, but he is released because of several good deeds he has done since his escape. Ultimately, Toad has his heart in the right place, often showing kindness and strong loyalty to his friends. His characteristics have made him arguably the epitome of the stock character of the lovable rogue.  Film and television  *In the 1949 Disney film adaptation The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (which also contains a version of Washington Irving's 1820 story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\"), the character's full name is given as \\"J.

Inspiration The inspiration for Mr. Toad's wayward mischievousness and boastfulness was Kenneth Grahame's only child Alastair: a family friend, Constance Smedley, overheard Grahame telling Alastair the exploits of Toad as a bedtime story, and noted that \\"Alastair's own tendency to exult in his exploits was gently satirized in Mr. Toad\\".Mattanah, Jonathan. \\"A Contemporary Psychological Understanding of Mr. Toad\\" in Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows: A Children's Classic at 100 edited by Jackie C.

Colonel Francis Cecil Ricardo CVO CBE (1852‚Äì1924), the first owner of a car in Cookham in Berkshire, where Grahame wrote the books is also thought to have been an influence.

It was led by Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and others and is famous for issuing the 21 demands of MKS on 17 August, that eventually led to the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement and creation of Solidarity. Background The widespread strikes of 1980 were far from being the first clashes between the ruling party and the working class in Poland after World War II. Despite having a \\"socialist\\" government, the elite of the Polish ruling class averaged an income twenty times that of the blue-collar worker. This elite ruling class owned or largely controlled the police, media and industry of the state, including the state-organized unions. Insufficient pay and food shortages, in addition to a growing movement in favor of independent union activism led to strikes in 1956 and 1970 which left hundreds of workers dead from clashes with police, and both the 1970 and 1976 strikes ended with some concessions but subsequent additional repressions from management. Workers were increasingly dissatisfied with their standard of living and the half-hearted responses of the government to their calls for social justice, and when in July 1980 the government attempted to raise the price of meat even further, sit-in strikes started up again. The early days Lenin Shipyard employees on strike in August 1980 Citizens of Gda≈Ñsk gathered outside the gate to the Lenin Shipyard during the strike in August 1980 When, in August 1980, Anna Walentynowicz lost her job at the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard because of her position as editor of the underground newspaper Robotnik Wybrzeze, her fellow workers took action. Around 16,000 employees of the shipyard discontinued their work and occupied its premises on the morning of August 14, demanding Walentynowicz's re- employment, the erection of a monument in honor of the victims of the strikes of 1970, and a pay rise of 2000 zlotys, amongst other things. After negotiating with management and having most of their demands met, a vote was taken on August 16 leading to the strike being called off. By this time, however, many of the workers at facilities surrounding the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard had begun their own strikes making similar demands, and it was decided that in solidarity with them, the workers in the shipyard would continue to strike despite their own demands having been met. By the next morning the Inter- Enterprise Strike Committee (Polish shorthand: MKS) had been formed within the gates of the shipyard, intending to unite workers in the Gda≈Ñsk-Sopot-Gdynia area, coordinating action and maintaining and order to ensure the safety of the strikers. Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, an electrician who had lost his job at the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard in the strikes of 1976 was elected as chair of the MKS, while the remainder of the committee was composed of delegates from other facilities including Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda, and others. By August 18, the MKS represented workers from 156 separate enterprises, and the number was steadily growing. Just two days after the formation of MKS the Polish economy was brought to a standstill as workers struck at factories and ports all along the Baltic coast. By August 21, much of the country was affected by strikes, even including the inland mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area, as more and more workers joined independent unions. The Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee at Gda≈Ñsk was becoming the national center for trade union movement: a phenomenon which was itself unique to this series of events. In the strikes of the 1950s and '70s it was the lack of a central organized structure that had limited the mobilization potential of striking workers. Now the MKS had been specifically designed with this problem in mind - the decentralization of the workers' movement ‚Äì and was working for the first time to unify and strengthen the movement, coordinating strikes all across Poland. It was for this reason that the government of Edward Gierek found they could no longer buy off strikers with small concessions, and finally had to settle into heavy negotiations with the MKS. Negotiations Government delegates: Mieczys≈Çaw Jagielski and Tadeusz Fiszbach and Klemens Gniech (Lenin Shipyard manager) arriving for negotiations with MKS On the day that the committee was formed, August 17, MKS posted a handwritten list of twenty-one demands in the shipyard. These demands were far broader and all-encompassing that the original postulates of the Gda≈Ñsk strikers, pushing for free trade unions and the legal right to strike, an end to the repression of independent activists, improvement of health care services, and the increased availability of basic consumer goods and foodstuffs, amongst other things. In these demands, the workers were calling on the government to protect the constitutional rights of the Polish people, and take steps to improve the low standard of living of blue-collar citizens. After weeks of negotiations with Wa≈Çƒôsa and his MKS, the Communist party first secretary Edward Gierek was forced to accede to all twenty-one of the strikers' demands, signing the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement on August 31, which allowed workers the right to strike and organise independent unions. Solidarity With the signing of the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement on August 31, delegates from MKS ‚Äì representing 3500 separate enterprises and 3 million workers, intellectuals and students ‚Äì met in Gda≈Ñsk. The Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, which had become a national federation of unions now officially became Poland's first independent trade union since World War II: Solidarity (Solidarno≈õƒá). Some historians claim that within weeks Solidarity's membership included almost 80 percent of Poland's working population, while more conservative estimates claim membership peaked at 50 percent.

It is distributed from just south of Sydney to eastern Victoria. Description This is a small species of tree frog, up to about in length. Adults are normally green on their dorsal surfaces (although at times they can be brown), but metamorph frogs are always dull brown in colour. They are very similar to the leaf green tree frog, (Litoria phyllochroa), and distribution and call are used to distinguish the two. The tympanum is indistinct (it is distinct in L. phyllochroa). A black stripe on the side of the head starts at the nostril and continues down the side of the frog; it often gets larger the further down the frog it goes. A gold stripe occurs above the black one and follows it in the same direction. Ecology and behaviour This species has only recently been separated from the leaf green tree frog; Sydney is considered the dividing point for the two species. L. nudidigitus ranges to the south and L. phyllochroa to the north, although hybridisation is possible around southern Sydney from the Royal National Park to about Wollongong, this area is regarded as the hybrid zone. This species is associated with streams and creeks in rainforests and wet or dry sclerophyll forests. It is rarely found away from running water. Males have a call similar to that of R. phyllochroa, composed of a long first note, and followed by a series of shorter notes. Males call during spring and summer from vegetation around a stream.

They are caused by the chemical or physical interaction of two dissimilar materials. Staining is used for biochemical research, metal staining, and art (e.g., wood staining, stained glass). Types There can be intentional stains (such as wood stains or paint), indicative stains (such as food coloring or adding a substance to make bacteria visible under a microscope), natural stains (such as rust on iron or a patina on bronze), and accidental stains such as ketchup on a shirt. Different types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern textile engineering. Formation The primary method of stain formation is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled out onto the surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface. The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and wood stains are of this nature. A secondary method of stain involves a chemical or molecular reaction between the material and the staining material. Many types of natural stains fall into this category. Finally, there can also be molecular attraction between the material and the staining material, involving being held in a covalent bond and showing the color of the bound substance. Properties In many cases, stains are affected by heat and may become reactive enough to bond with the underlying material. Extreme heat, such as from ironing or dry cleaning, can cause a chemical reaction on an otherwise removable stain, turning it into a chemical compound that is impossible to remove. Removal Various laundry techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and stain removers are an important type of chemical in laundry detergents. Some stand-alone stain removers also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the stain or stain mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.Solutions for Clothing and Laundry Stain Removal See also *Bleach *Dye *Foxing References Further reading *Stain & Spot Removal Handbook: Consumer guide. by the editors of Consumer Guide.

This wrap primarily supports the wrist and knuckles, but each athlete has their own preference. A hand wrap or a wrist wrap or Kumpur is a strip of cloth used by boxers (and participants in other combat sports) to protect the hand and wrist against injuries induced by punching. It is wrapped securely around the wrist, the palm, and the base of the thumb, where it serves to both maintain the alignment of the joints, and to compress and lend strength to the soft tissues of the hand during the impact of a punch. A hand wrap protects against several common types of injuries that are familiar to most boxers. For instance, it supports the wrist joint, keeping it aligned when the impact of a punch is absorbed by the wrong part of the hand. It also secures the base of the thumb to the hand, thereby reducing the chance of a sprain or fracture that can result from the thumb striking an opponent's elbow. Most importantly, it significantly strengthens the metacarpus, reducing the likelihood of a fracture of one of the metacarpal bones. Such a fracture is often called the \\"boxer's fracture\\"‚Äîwhich is usually a fracture in the neck of the fourth or fifth metacarpal‚Äîbecause of its ubiquity among fighters. Hand and wrist wraps are used to compress (and keep compressed when hitting) the bones and tissues in the hand. The claim is that such compression allows boxers to hit with greater force than if they did not use them. Boxers claim they feel less pain when hitting so their opponent may feel more pain. Each sportsperson, cornerman or cutman has a preferred wrapping method based on the situation and experience. Variations can produce more wrist support, thumb support, padding for the knuckles or less fabric within the fist. Sometimes a single wrap between fingers over the finger-web help stabilize the wrap and keep it from \\"riding up\\" within a looser-fitting glove. Competition rules may restrict the type and amount of material used, giving each fighter a limited amount of gauze and tape which may be divided and rolled in various ways for a particular fighter or match. Training wraps are usually re-usable cloth and may be secured with a small tie-tab or with velcro. Conventional hand wraps are non-elastic. Mexican-style hand wraps are slightly elasticized and are popular with many boxers. The length of wraps will vary depending on rules, personal preference, hand size and the type of glove to be worn, with shorter wraps common for fingerless \\"grappling gloves\\" used in mixed martial arts. A new alternative to hand wraps are foam or gel-lined fingerless gloves worn inside any boxing glove; these can be used to reduce and prevent harm to the hands and head for bag work, sparring or competition depending on the rules of the governing organization. They take much less time and hassle than gauze, although they are generally seen as not being as effective.

Life He was born in Rousse (modern Ruse, Bulgaria) as a subject of the Ottoman Empire. A grain merchant, he amassed considerable wealth, and was rumored at the time to be the wealthiest man in the Balkans. In 1803, he was awarded the boyar rank of paharnic by Constantine Ypsilanti, Prince of Wallachia. The yard of Manuc's Inn in 1841 In 1808, the highly influential Manuc was advanced by his protector, the Ottoman general Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, to occupy the Moldavian throne, but was prevented from taking the throne by the fall of his protector; he himself had to flee Istanbul to avoid execution. Settling in Bucharest (after a short period of refuge in Transylvania), Manuc-Bey kept the inn known today as Manuc's Inn; in time, he also acquired estates in Bessarabia, near H√Ænce≈üti and Reni, and was to remain the main financial backer of Ypsilanti, lending the treasury 160,000 thalers in all. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812, he was also a mediator (1809) between the Russian Imperial Army of Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich and a rebel Ottoman garrison in Giurgiu. A Russian agent, Manuc took part in the negotiations for the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest between the Russian and Ottoman empires, which were held in his inn in Bucharest. Manuc Bei's Manison in H√Ænce»ôti Towards the end of his life, he retired to his estate of H√Ænce»ôti, where his son later built a manor house.

It trained cadres from newly formed units in combat operations under simulated field conditions around which new combat groups would be formed. It was established as the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) in 1942 and redesignated the following year. In addition to its training function, the school also developed as a tactical doctrine development center, assuming the functions formerly assigned the Air Corps Tactical School. In June 1946, the center became the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command. History =Background= As the threat of entry of the United States into World War II increased, the United States Army decided to close the Air Corps Tactical School in 1940 in order to use its experienced personnel at headquarters, and in expanded training and tactical units. As a result, the responsibility for the development and change to tactics for Air Corps units was scattered among various Air Corps units. Moreover, no single element of the Air Staff or special committee was responsible for overseeing tactical doctrine for the Army's air elements.Reither, p. 8 The field organizations primarily responsible for development of tactics and associated doctrine were the Army Air Force Board, the Air Defense Board, the Fighter Command School and the Army Air Forces Proving Ground.Reither, p. 11 In addition, the splitting of existing combat groups into cadres for new groups had become impracticable as the number of new groups increased. At the entry of the United States into World War II on 7 December 1941, the Army Air Forces (AAF) had expanded to 67 groups from a pre-1939 total of 15, but approximately half were paper units just forming. The entry into the war meant an immediate significant increase in the numbers of new combat groups, expanding to 269 groups by the end of 1943. =Formation of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics= Headquarters USAAF originally intended that four tactical schools be developed across the United States, one each for air defense, air service, air support and bombardment. However \\"to save administrative costs and physical outlay\\"Reither, p. 25 and to facilitate coordination between the schools, all four would be consolidated at a single location. Orlando Army Air Base, Florida was chosen 1 November 1942, primarily because it was already the location of Fighter Command School, which would be subordinated to the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT). The AAF determined this organization would conduct tactical development and training and provide tactical training for flyers who were preparing to deploy to theaters of operation.Reither, p. 22 The commandant of AAFSAT was Brigadier General Hume Peabody, formerly the assistant commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School. The Fighter Command School became AAFSAT's Air Defense Department at once. The 91st Service Group at Fort Dix Army Air Field moved to Orlando and became the Air Service Department. 5th Interceptor Command moved from San Francisco and became the Interceptor Command School.The school quickly adopted the former name of the Air Defense Department and became the Fighter Command School. The other two departments, Air Support and Bombardment were built up from scratchReither, pp. 24‚Äì27 AAFSAT was organized into three directorates: Tactical Development, School Activities, and Demonstration Air Force, with three combat groups acting as both school units and demonstration air force units. The Directorate of School Activities was responsible for the four functional departments. The school officially opened 12 November 1942. An important component was the Army Air Forces Board, which supervised developmental projects. This board also assigned developmental projects to AAFSAT's departments, and had two subordinate boards, the Air Defense Board and, after April 1943, the AAF Equipment Board. Although the Board had been operating before AAFSAT was activated, it only became official in July, when the school became the AAF Tactical Center. It was reassigned from the center directly to Headquarters, AAF in October 1943.although the commandant of the center remained a member of the board.Reither, pp. 30‚Äì31 =Army Air Forces Tactical Center= In October 1943, AAFSAT was reorganized and became the Army Air Forces Tactical Center. A \\"new\\" AAFSAT was organized as one of the center's subordinate units. The first group receiving AAFSAT training to deploy overseas was the 390th Bombardment Group in July 1943, based in England with the Eighth Air Force. By September 1945, the AAF Center had trained 54,000 personnel and the cadres of 44 bombardment groups. During 1943-1945 the AAF Tactical Center operated a combat simulation facility in Florida. Units and airfields were established throughout an area of north central Florida designated a mock \\"war theater\\" stretching roughly from Tampa to Titusville to Starke to Apalachicola in which war games were conducted. AAFSAT also had a bombing range at Ocala AAF, a service center at Leesburg AAF, and an air depot at Pinecastle Army Air Field. =Transfer and transition= Due to a major reorganization of the Tactical Center and a change in the types of courses conducted by the institution, the Army Air Forces redesignated the \\"new\\" AAFSAT as the Army Air Forces School on 1 June 1945, while the Tactical Center dropped the \\"Tactical\\" from its name and became the AAF Center. Following the end of World War II, in preparation for its post-war educational operations, the AAF moved the AAF School from Orlando to Maxwell Field, Alabama on 29 November 1945 and assigned it directly to Headquarters, AAF. Having lost its developmental function, the AAF Center moved to Eglin Field in March 1946 and became the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command.Lineage, including assignments and stations, through 2008 in Lineage * Established as the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics on 27 October 1942 : Activated on 12 November 1942 : Redesignated Army Air Forces Tactical Center on 16 October 1943 : Redesignated Army Air Forces Center on 1 June 1945 : Redesignated Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command on 8 March 1946 : Redesignated Air Proving Ground Command on 10 July 1946This unit is not related to the Proving Ground Command, which was activated on 15 May 1941 at Orlando Army Air Base as the Air Corps Proving Ground, moved to Eglin Field in June 1941, was redesignated Proving Ground Command on 1 April 1942 and was disbanded on 1 June 1945. : Redesignated Air Materiel Proving Ground on 20 January 1948 : Redesignated Air Proving Ground on 3 March 1948 : Redesignated Air Proving Ground Command on 20 December 1951 : Redesignated Air Proving Ground Center on 1 December 1957 : Redesignated Armament Development and Test Center on 15 July 1968 : Redesignated Armament Division on 1 October 79This unit is not related to the Armament Division, which was activated as the Air Materiel Armament Test Center at Eglin AFB on 14 December 1949 and assigned to Air Materiel Command, redesignated Armament Test Division and reassigned to Air Research and Development Command c. 5 January 1951, redesignated Air Force Armament Center on 26 December 1951, Armament Division on 1 December 1957 and inactivated on 5 February 1958. : Redesignated Munitions Systems Division on 15 March 1989 : Redesignated Air Force Development Test Center on 15 July 1990 : Redesignated Air Armament Center on 1 October 1998 : Inactivated on 1 October 2012 =Assignments= * United States Army Air Forces (later United States Air Force), 27 October 1942 * Air Materiel Command, 20 January 1948 * United States Air Force, 1 June 1948 * Air Research and Development Command (later Air Force Systems Command), 1 December 1957 * Air Force Materiel Command, 1 July 1992 ‚Äì 1 October 2012 =Stations= * Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, 12 November 1942 * Eglin Field (later Eglin Air Force Base), Florida, 8 March 1946 ‚Äì 1 October 2012 =School units= The AAF Tactical Center medium and heavy bomber school unit from 31 October 1942 was the 9th Bombardment Group. In February 1943, a close air support school unit, the 415th Bombardment Group was added.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 299 The fighter school unit from 23 March 1943 was the 50th Fighter Group. Night Fighter training initially began with the 50th Group's 81st Fighter Squadron, but by 1943 was concentrated in the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group. However, the AAF was finding that standard military units like these groups, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization not well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in the spring of 1944 in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 In preparation for this reorganization, the 9th Bombardment Group moved to Nebraska, where it was reassigned to Second Air Force to become a Boeing B-29 Superfortress unit.Ironically, its new cadre were themselves trained at the Tactical Center in June 1944. The 50th Fighter Group began to concentrate on training in preparation for deployment to the European Theater of Operations in March 1944, the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group continued its mission, but transferred to Fourth Air Force in California in January 1944. The transition to the new organization took place on 14 April 1944. With a ground school at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, presenting a two-week academic course, AAFSAT also taught a two-week field course utilizing eleven training airfields in Florida representing all conditions likely to be found in combat, from bare fields to prepared bomber air bases having runways. =Components= ;

In his campaign speeches prior to his defeat by Governor George Pataki in 1994, Mario Cuomo promised to bring high speed (maglev) rail up the Hudson Valley and along the Catskill Mountains route.For New York, steel-wheel plus maglev is envisioned - New York State passenger rail upgrades Railway Age, Dec, 1993 It was not a priority for the subsequent administration. Currently, Amtrak's Acela service between Washington, D.C., and Boston, Massachusetts is available to New York City, but the cities in Upstate New York and Western New York remain isolated from high- speed rail service. Further, destinations outside the New York metropolitan area have experienced delayed service for decades. In some areas, New York State has been quietly endorsing and even implementing rail improvements for years. Frequently cited as a partial solution for Upstate and Western New York's economic stagnation, faster rail transportation between New York City and the rest of the state has been suggested as a way to make rural areas grow into suburban destinations for daily commuters, and easily accessible for businesses to relocate to cheaper real estate. Many politicians also endorse closer ties with destinations in Canada.  History  NYCRR map of the four- track water-level route Rail travel in New York has its roots in the early 19th century. The New York Central water-level route roughly followed the path of the Erie Canal, with four tracks along much of the route. For many years the Twentieth Century Limited and Empire State Express services, to Chicago and Buffalo were among the fastest trains in the world, with average speeds topping and top speeds reportedly well over . Rail travel largely stagnated in the post-World War II economic boom, as the New York Thruway was built, and then the rest of the highway transportation and suburban lifestyles burgeoned. Nonetheless, rail culture lived on in the New York metropolitan area. It was kept alive by the subway culture in New York City, as well as suburban routes on Long Island and the northern suburbs of the city. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad are the two largest commuter railroads in the United States. New Jersey Transit, which serves New Jersey commuters to Manhattan, Philadelphia, and points within New Jersey, is also a major player in the U.S. commuter rail market. Potential also exists for a high-speed rail line to Montreal, Quebec, Canada along existing train right of way. Interest in updating the state's aging rail infrastructure was sparked in the early 1990s. In the early 1980s the State of New York paid Conrail to install cab signals from Poughkeepise to Hoffmans, west of Schenectady, to allow 110 mph train service. This service actually went into service. In the late 1990s, ground was broken on a new rail station in Rensselaer, at the time reported as the ninth busiest station in the entire United States; federal funding was secured for the project.\\"Governor Pataki Breaks Ground At New Rensselaer Rail Station .\\" New York State press release: June 2, 1999. In 2001, the state tested a newly rebuilt Turboliner RTL-III gas turbine trainset capable of reaching .\\"Governor Announces Successful 125 MPH Run of NY's High Speed Train .\\" New York State press release: February 23, 2001. In 2004, the Turboliner rehabilitation project had a falling out between Amtrak and New York State and the contractor doing the rehab. After lawsuits were filled, a settlement was reached to liquidate the unfinished Turboliner project. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, New York Governor George Pataki attempted to secure, among other things, a high-speed rail link to Schenectady using federal emergency aid money.Haberman, Clyde. \\"Isn't Heartland Still Part of Homeland?\\" The New York Times: June 9, 2006 From 2004 until 2012, the unused Turboliners sat in storage at a cost of $150,000 per year to the taxpayers until a decision by Governor Andrew Cuomo to liquidate the remaining fleet for scrap metal.Virtanen, Michael (May 31, 2012).

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  In 2009, The New York State Department of Transportation released a statewide rail plan, including a program of capital investments to increase passenger rail speed and reliability.New York State Rail Plan, 2009 In October 2009, the state applied for funding for a number of these projects from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail program.NY State High Speed Rail Funding Application, 2009 The NYSDOT also named a project manager for high speed rail, Marie Corrado. New York governor- elect Andrew Cuomo sent a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood shortly after his victory in the 2010 New York gubernatorial election requesting that New York receive the money granted by the federal government to high-speed rail projects in Wisconsin and Ohio that the governors of both states pledged to cancel. According to a study by America 2050, the corridor between New York City and Albany has high potential among 8,000 possible routes nationwide as a high-speed corridor. =Projects= The state received $151 million from the federal government in early 2010, of which $58 million was planned to be used to build an stretch of track between Riga and Byron capable of speeds.High-speed rail plans for New York take shape This was planned to be an entirely new track parallel to the existing CSX line used solely for Amtrak trains. The remainder of the money was used to construct a second track between Albany and Schenectady. Negotiations between the state and CSX around the Western New York third track came to a halt in late spring of 2010 after CSX disclosed a requirement that the new track be located at least from its right-of-way; in some places along the route, that amount of space is unavailable. The two parties subsequently came to an agreement, however, after further meetings arranged by Representative Louise Slaughter, allowing planning for the trackage to continue. Between Albany and Schenectady, construction of the third track is planned to begin in 2011. An additional $354 million, composed of funds rejected by other states, was granted to New York in May 2011. Of that, $58 million will be allocated to the ongoing Albany-Schenectady upgrades, $1.4 million will be allocated for a preliminary study for a new terminal in Rochester, and the remainder will go to New York City.Benjamin, Elizabeth (2011-05-09). NY lands $354 million for high-speed rail . State of Politics. Retrieved 2011-05-09. Beginning in 2010, a study was conducted by the New York State Department of Transportation for the Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement on high speed rail service from New York City to Niagara Falls. The Tier 1 Draft EIS was released to the public in early 2014 and eliminates the alternatives with tops speeds of and due to high costs.

Issues in constructing high-speed rail lines in New York  RTL Turboliner in the 1980s. The entire upstate network lacks electrification for conventional high-speed service. In the past, New York investigated gas turbine alternatives which would not require electrification, such as the new JetTrain by Bombardier Transportation or the older Turboliner fleet, but neither project proved feasible. Sections of the Hudson River route have tight curves. Some portions, notably the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge are operating with only a single track. Most sections of the routes north and west of Albany share track with freight trains and extra tracks would be necessary to achieve high speed on the route; the federal government considers this to be \\"one of the largest projects\\" if upgrading.  Proposals  Other proposals involve extensions of existing corridors or cooperation with agencies in other states or in Canada. = Montreal to New York City = On October 6, 2005, the Albany Times-Union reported that New York Governor George Pataki and Quebec Premier Jean Charest \\"called for the creation of high-speed rail service between Montreal and New York City as a way to boost the regional economy during the third Quebec-New York Economic Summit on Wednesday,\\" October 4, 2005.

He maintains that a Toronto high-speed rail service has the potential to increase environmentally-friendly traffic and decrease congestion on the Peace Bridge.\\"Opportunities for Cross-Border High Speed Rail.\\" City of Toronto: October 22, 1999 The existing passenger rail link is served by Amtrak and Via Rail. = Binghamton to New York City = Senator Charles Schumer and others have proposed passenger rail service from Binghamton, New York, along former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad trackage, via Scranton, PA and the Lackawanna Cutoff in New Jersey to New York City, which would provide the Southern Tier with intercity passenger rail for the first time in decades. The right-of-way from Binghamton to Scranton and along the Lackawanna Cutoff are suitable for high-speed service, although the rest of the route (which passes through the Pocono Mountains) is not, so it has sometimes been proposed to make the service high-speed where it is suitable. The route currently does not have rail service, although the Lackawanna Cutoff is in the process of having rail service restored by approximately 2018. As of January 2010, Scranton, PA and Binghamton, NY did not win high-speed rail funding announced by President Obama. The only funded high-speed rail project in Pennsylvania is between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. However, construction on the cutoff at the New Jersey end of the cutoff began in late 2011. This route would also require connection of the Binghamton line to the Empire Corridor to avoid a dead end, most likely through the existing New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway's northernmost branches to either Syracuse or Utica; the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad line that connected the cutoff to Buffalo via a route through the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes is mostly abandoned. In any of these cases, the terrain is not favorable to high-speed rail service and would have to switch to conventional rail in this section. = Gateway Project = The Gateway Project is a proposal to build a high-speed rail right-of-way and to alleviate the bottleneck along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Penn Station in Newark, New Jersey, and New York Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. The project would create routing alternatives and add 25 train scheduling slots to the current system used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit by constructing another Hudson River crossing. Originally planned by Amtrak to come on line in 2030, Gateway was announced soon after cancellation of NJT's Access to the Region's Core (ARC) project in 2010. It remains unclear how engineering work, design, and real estate acquisition for ARC will be used for Gateway. In November 2011 U.S. Congress allotted $15 million for initial studies. = Other out-of-state connections = New high-speed routes through from Albany to Boston and Buffalo to Kansas City and/or Minneapolis through Cleveland are also proposed, most likely along the routes of current Amtrak services. Through service from Washington, D.C. to upstate New York via the Northeast Corridor is also proposed. These services would require heavy cooperation with other states and the United States federal government. Many civic and business leaders in New England have recently shown interest in better service to New York City and Boston.The Star-Ledger: Train like a plane: It could be the future on the Northeast Corridor.

Tormod Engelsviken: Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder (Store norske leksikon) Biography = Early life = Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder was born in Sogndal in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway in 1817. As a theological student, he was very interested in missionary work, and wrote a treatise entitled A Few Words to the Church of Norway on Christian Obligation to be Concerned about the Salvation of Non-Christian Fellow Men. Unlike other missionaries who describe their missionary work as a \\"calling\\", Schreuder saw it more as a \\"duty\\".Rakkenes (2003), p.25 = Early missionary work = In 1842 the Norwegian Missionary Society was created. Schreuder became its first missionary, arriving in Port Natal (now Durban, South Africa) on New Year's Day 1844. He then made his way north of the Tugela River on the advice of a fellow missionary, Robert Moffat. Schreuder became the first permanent missionary in Zululand, the kingdom of the Zulus. Starting in the early 1850s, Schreuder managed to start twelve missionary stations. The first baptism took place in 1858. His success was limited in respect to gaining converts, however; at no time in his life did the number exceed 300. Nevertheless, he was consecrated 'Bishop of the Mission Field of the Church of Norway' in 1866.Odd Magne Bakke: H P S Schreuder, Misjon√¶r (Norsk biografisk leksikon) In his many years in Kwa Zulu, Schreuder became very fluent in their language. He is responsible for authoring the very first complete grammar of the Zulu language. His scholarship ranged beyond linguistics and theology; he became a student of the Zulu culture and history, as well as an expert in the wealth of plant and animal life in the area.Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder (Allkunne AS) = Mediation= Because of Schreuder's friendship with the Zulu King Mpande, and also because of the trust placed in him by the British, Schreuder was able on several occasions to remove misunderstandings and prevent clashes between the two nations. Under Cetshwayo, Mpande's son and successor, relations became more strained. Cetshwayo wanted the missionaries to leave his country. On the other hand, he also desired British recognition of himself as the rightful leader of his people. Cetshwayo therefore sought the advice of Schreuder, who agreed to approach the government of Natal in the matter. As a result of Schrueder's aid, in 1873 Cetshwayo was formally installed as king of the Zulus. An important part of the ceremony was the full assent given by the king to the introduction of new laws, the first of which was that the indiscriminate shedding of blood should cease.Schreuder, Hans Paludan Smith (Christian Cyclopedia. LCMS) = Role in Anglo-Zulu War = In the years following Cetshwayo's installation, Schreuder acted as an intermediary between the Zulu king and the British authorities in Natal. In the war that eventually broke out he offered his services, in the interest of peace, to Zulus and British alike. Sir Garnet Wolseley, commander-in-chief of the British forces during the Anglo-Zulu War, reportedly wanted him to act as a spy for the British, however Schreuder refused. Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder (NRK.no) = Personal information = Although Schreuder was twice married, he had no children. Bishop Hans P. S. Schreuder died in 1882, in the Colony of Natal, South Africa. Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder (Mission Archives) Gravesite of Bishop Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder in Ntunjambili, Zululand, South Africa. The Lutheran mission church at Ntjunjambili, Zululand, South Africa was built by Bishop Schreuder. Bishop Schreuder's grave is next to this church.

History It was established in 1933 on the site of Daley's brick pit, Thomas Daley operated the Standsure Brick Company from 1886 to 1914. The brickworks occupied 9 acres (3.6 ha) and employed approximately 60 people. When the brickworks closed the pits filled with rain and ground water. The largest waterhole was known as \\"The Blue Hole\\"¬îand was 40 to 80 feet in places (12.2 to 24.4 metres). Marrickville Council purchased the site in 1923 as it was a serious danger. Unfortunately nine young boys drowned in the old water hole. In 1932 a grant was received to level the ground and work commenced as part of the Unemployment Relief Scheme. The oval is set within a shallow hollow, formed by the upper edges of the former brickpit. This is the only one of the many parks formed on the sites of former brickpits which has retained evidence of its former use in its shape. Henson Park was named after William Henson, who was Mayor of Marrickville in 1902, 1906 to 1908 and his son Alfred Henson, who was an Alderman of Marrickville Council from 1922 to 1931. It was officially opened on 2 September 1933 with a cricket match between a representative Marrickville Eleven team and a North Sydney District team, which included Sir Don Bradman. The Mayor of Marrickville, Alderman Rushton, bowled the first ball, and North Sydney won the match. Cricket may have been the first sport played on Henson Park but the park is better known as a rugby league field. It is the home ground of Newtown Jets Rugby League Club, which is one of the founding rugby league clubs. Newtown still has a team in the New South Wales Cup. The first premiership game of Rugby League was played on 1 April 1936, when Newtown defeated University 20-0. Apart from football, the ground has had a long association with cycling. It was the principal cycling venue for the 1938 British Empire Games, as well as the venue for the games closing ceremony. The Sydney Morning Herald (14/2/1938) reported the awesome scene of athletes and officials from all the competing nations standing in ordered lines under their country's banner on Henson Park. During the games crowds regularly exceeded 40 000. The velodrome surrounding the playing field was removed during the late 1970s and replaced by a grass running track used for local school athletics carnivals. Charlie Meader Memorial Gates Henson Park, Charlie Meader Memorial Gates. The Henson Park gates on the Centennial Street entrance were named as the \\"Charlie Meader Memorial Gates\\" in 2001 as a dedication to the memory and the recognition of Mr Meader's work as caretaker/groundskeeper of Henson Park for many years. Mr Meader joined Marrickville Council at the age of 16, and continued working there for another 53 years and was the longest serving council employee. Mr Meader was also the son of a former employee of the brick pit. The Jack Chaseling Drive Jack Chaseling was one of the greatest of all Newtown Rugby League officials. He worked tirelessly for 32 years for the club. He was a delegate for NSWRL and also served on many sub-committees with NSWRL. He was manager for the 1935 Australian Kangaroos tour of New Zealand. Marrickville Council acknowledged his work by naming the Sydenham Road entrance \\"Jack Chaseling Drive\\". Facilities King George v Memorial Grandstand Henson Park has changed little since it was first opened. * On the western side is the King George V Memorial Grandstand, which accommodates about 1000 people. During the 1980s, when the high-profile adman John Singleton was club's chief benefactor, attempts were made to take the traditionally working-class Bluebags up-market. The upper section, named the Jet Set Lounge, at one stage was enclosed with glass and waiters served members and their guests food and drinks. * From the north west to the south-east side of the ground runs a grass hill - one of the largest in Sydney. * From the south east to the west, there is a bitumen bank where cars can park. About 200 cars can fit and it has always been popular to watch matches from your car seat. * There is also a brick scoreboard with a kiosk in the north-east corner. * Media/Corporate centre also with a kiosk to the northern side of the King George V Memorial Grandstand. * Full Stadium lighting was installed in the late 1970s for the benefit of night games and for significant games to be televised. 2011/12 Facilities upgrade A $920,000 Henson Park upgrade was funded by the Australian Government Community Infrastructure Grants program. And was announced prior to the 2010 federal election to upgrade facilities in the Park. *Installation of electronic scoreboard. *Replacement of asbestos roofing on grandstand and waterproofing and repainting of grandstand. *Resurfacing of forecourt of grandstand to provide ramp access. *Refurbishment of public toilets and the canteen. Newtown Jets Since 1937, the ground has been primarily known as the home of the Newtown Rugby League Football Club nicknamed \\"The Bluebags\\", today known as the Newtown Jets. The Jets played in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, a forerunner to the National Rugby League, until 1983 when they were dropped from the competition for financial reasons. However the club was re-established as a senior club in 1990 and returned to play at the ground. The Jets compete in the NSW Cup and were the feeder team for the NRL side the Sydney Roosters until the end of the 2014 season after the Roosters announced they were ending a nine-year relationship with the club.http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/sydney-roosters-dump- newtown-jets-as-their-feeder-club-20140712-zt5j2.htmlNewton Jets In 2015, Newtown signed a contract to become Cronulla-Sutherland's feeder side with the deal finishing at the end of the 2023 season. In 2019, Henson Park hosted a Magic Round which consisted of 3 Canterbury Cup NSW games played at the ground on the same day in Round 10 of the 2019 season. Other sports Henson Park is also used occasionally for competition matches in soccer and Australian rules football. It hosts several matches per season in the Sydney AFL competition, including the finals and hosted games from the 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships and the Community Cup. The Argentine Rugby Union side used Henson Park as a training venue during the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Attendances & Records Hill on the eastern side * The highest recorded attendance was during the 1938 British Empire Games when around 40,000 fans attended the cycling. * In round 8 (9 June) 1957, St George Dragons defeated Newtown Bluebags 10-7 in front of a crowd of 21,588. However, the ground record crowd for a Rugby League match is 30,500, for a match between St George and Western Suburbs in round 10 (24 May) 1959. This was the first time the teams had met since the previous year's Grand Final. * In round 5 (28 March) of the 1982 NSWRFL season, Newtown Jets drew nil all with Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. It is the only nil all draw in competition history. * The last time Henson Park hosted a first grade rugby league match was on Sunday 26 August 1990. The Eastern Suburbs Roosters hosted the Cronulla Sharks in the final game of the season, and won the game 16-11.

Owned by Great American Media, it broadcasts a classic rock format serving the Panama City market. History The station began broadcast in 1986 as WVBM, which was the area's first and only African-American-owned radio station. At noon on November 14, 1987, after the call sign was changed to WRBA, the station's format shifted to easy listening and oldies under the name \\"Bay 96 FM\\". In a News-Herald interview, then-owner Peter Michael Bardach described its format as being \\"halfway between WGNE (AM) and Sunny 98 (FM)\\" and that it was targeted toward adults between 25 and 54. Over time, the format changed to a mix of modern rock and adult contemporary. In October 1994, WRBA did away with the adult contemporary, and \\"Arrow 95.9\\" debuted. The \\"Arrow\\" originally stood for \\"All Rock & Roll Oldies\\", and to begin with, solely played rock from the seventies. Over its 18-year history, Arrow 95.9 kept its classic rock format, but expanded it to other decades (namely the 1960s through 1990s). In 2012, the station was renamed \\"Classic Rock 95.9\\", but kept the same format.

On July 3, 2019, Gulf Coast broadcasting sold WRBA, WASJ, and WKNK to Great American Media for $700,000. In June 2020, the station rebranded as B95.9, maintaining its classic rock format (despite using the branding \\"Classic Hits\\"), but dropping most music from the 1990s to focus exclusively on the 1970s and 1980s.

The fictional island of St. Gregory serves as a stand-in for the real-life islands Guernsey and Jersey, and the story is compiled from the events on both islands. Produced by Granada Television in Manchester, Island at War had an estimated budget of ¬£9,000,000 and was filmed on location in the Isle of Man from August 2003 to October 2003.

In a review by Anita Gates for The New York Times, Gates wrote, \\"You can call 'Island at War' a soap opera, as some British television critics have, but if that's true this soap opera is a gripping, poetic one‚Äîabout moral courage in many guises. You might also call it a drama of manners.\\" New York magazine called the series \\"reasonably absorbing but no great classic.\\" In the Channel Islands themselves, the series faced widespread criticism in the local press due to inaccuracy, mispronunciation of names (for example, 'Mahy' was pronounced 'Mah-hee' rather than the correct 'Ma'yee'), and the fact that the series was filmed not on the islands themselves, but the Isle of Man. The Guernsey Press noted that \\"the programme caused outrage among many people who accused the producers of distorting Guernsey history.\\"  DVD Release  The complete DVD collection was released in 2008, by Acorn Media UK. The DVD received a second release in 2017 by Network.  Cancelled second series  Although highly successful during its initial transmission the series ended, rather abruptly. The writer Stephen Mallatratt died from cancer shortly after the series broadcast. This, coupled with the high production cost and controversy over historical accuracy, meant the series came to an end. Each episode cost around ¬£1 million to produce.

His best known works are on the research of the Hebrew language and the history of the human race entitled (1) The Hebraic Tongue Restored: And the True Meaning of the Hebrew Words Re- Established and Proved by their Radical Analysis, and (2) Hermeneutic Interpretation of the Origin of the Social State of Man and of the Destiny of the Adamic Race. Other works of renown are on the sacred art of music entitled Music Explained as Science and as Art and Considered in its Analog Relationship with Religious Mysteries, Ancient Mythology and the History of the Earth, and a translation and commentary of Pythagoras's thirty-six Golden Verses. His interest in Pythagoras and the resulting works started a revival of Neo-Pythagoreanism that would later influence many occultists and new age spiritualists. He attempted an alternative interpretation of Genesis, based on what he considered to be connections between the Hebrew alphabet and hieroglyphs. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone and the subsequent decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs that followed would prove much of this particular work technically mistaken. He was declared a non-person by Napoleon I. An interesting story involves his supposed healing of a deaf boy, Rodolphe Grivel, of his hearing impairment, and then having Napoleon officially declare that he is never again to heal another person of deafness. He indicates that he kept the letter of notice out of amusement. Outside of esotericism, he also invented the poetic measure of eumolpique. He had an discussion with Lord Byron over the British poet's publishing of a play, Cain, in which he said that since both of them were raised as reformed Protestants, he wrote: \\"We can understand one another perfectly; and if I didn't have anything to reprove you as a heretic, you would not have to fear my orthodoxy\\". D'Olivet thought that because Lord Byron did not use the original Hebraic version of the text of Sacred Scripture, but instead a misleading English translation in the play, is therefore leading others towards falsity and away from truth.https://sca.org.br/uploads/news/id35/20LordByron.pdf Early life and education Born Antoine Fabre on 8 December 1767, but later changing his name to Fabre d'Olivet by dropping the name 'Antoine' and adding his mother's name d'Olivet, he grew up in the Languedoc province in the south of France. When he reached the age of eleven or twelve he was sent to Paris by his father, a businessman in the international silk industry, who wished his son to receive a good education and assist the family business. He spent five years in the French capital, where he learned Latin, Greek and English. Having completed his studies, in 1786 he travelled as a salesman for his father's company, learning German in the process, but with little commercial success. During his travels he met a young woman, Chrisna; the effects of the encounter on him were long-lasting and later inspired the first of his songs to be published. Revolutionary period and aftermath Antoine Fabre returned to Paris in 1789, ostensibly for purposes related to his father's firm. However, Paris was about to undergo revolutionary upheaval later in the year and he became actively involved in political pursuits; recalling the period later in his life, he wrote that he had written speeches designed to appeal to moderate Parisians. Although his political stance during this era would later cause him problems, he survived both the French Revolution, and the subsequent period of terror it unleashed, unscathed. Following this period of political upheaval, he turned his attention to his artistic interests. These included both music and literature, and during this time he wrote for the stage ‚Äì both drama and the libretto for the Paris Op√©ra's 1794 work Toulon soumis ‚Äì as well as poetry, fiction and journalism. It was at this time that he changed his name to Fabre d'Olivet. D'Olivet's father fared less well after the Revolution; his silk business failed and consequently his son's own prospects of financial independence were ended. As a result, Fabre d'Olivet sought employment and in 1799 secured work in the French War Ministry. In his autobiography, Mes souvenirs (published posthumously), he later admitted that he worked on a number of personal literary projects instead of fulfilling his official duties. The year after joining the War Ministry, he fell in love with Julie Marcel but decided against marrying her. Her death in 1802, after they had parted, later influenced his philosophical thinking; he claimed that she had appeared to him on several occasions, and he credited her with his theories concerning both the soul's immortality and Providence.

History Elsdon Best and Percy Smith, 1908 The society was co-founded in 1892 by Percy Smith and Edward Tregear, largely in response to a conviction, widely held at the time, that the MƒÅori and other Polynesian peoples were a dying race. Smith and his friends hoped that it would help to preserve the traditional lore of the MƒÅori before it disappeared and provide scholars with a forum for learned discussion of their ethnographic research (Byrnes 2006). The initial membership of the society was 112, which had grown to 1,300 by 1965. Presidents have included bishops H. W. and W. L. Williams; James Henry Pope, Edward Tregear, Percy Smith, Elsdon Best, William Skinner, Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata, Harry Skinner, J. M. McEwen, Professor Sir Hugh Kawharu and Dame Joan Metge. The present president is Dr Richard Benton. Until her death in 2006, the society's patron was the MƒÅori Queen Te Arikinui Dame Te Ata-i-rangi-kaahu (1931‚Äì2006); Dame Te Ata was succeeded by the current patrons, Le Afioga Tuiatua Tupua Tamasese Efi, Head of State of Samoa, and Te Ariki Tumu Te Heuheu, Paramount Chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa. Publications From its earliest days, the society published the quarterly Journal of the Polynesian Society, which became the society's principal means to publish information about the indigenous peoples of Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia. The journal is a rich repository of the traditions of Oceania. Its first editors were S. Percy Smith and Edward Tregear. Smith was its chief contributor until his death in 1922. The list of subsequent editors includes W. H. Skinner, Elsdon Best, Johannes C. Andersen, H. D. Skinner, C. R. H. Taylor, W. R. Geddes, W. C. Groves, Bruce Biggs, Melvyn McLean and Richard Moyle. The present editors are Judith Huntsman and Melinda Allen. In addition to this journal, the society has published many notable monographs, including S. Percy Smith's History and Traditions of the Taranaki Coast (1910) and The Lore of the Whare Wananga (1913‚Äì15); A. Shand's The Moriori People of the Chatham Islands (1911); Elsdon Best, The Maori (1924) and Tuhoe (1925); J. C. Andersen, Maori Music (1934); and C. R. H. Taylor, A Pacific Bibliography (1951), and two catalogues of the Oldman Collection of MƒÅori and Polynesian artifacts (2004). Other major works include A. Ngata and Pei Te Hurinui Jones Nga Moteatea (1959‚Äì1990), a definitive four- volume collection of traditional MƒÅori song with translations and commentaries, which has been published in a new, enhanced edition by Auckland University Press in association with the Polynesian Society. A history of the society and its journal, M. P. K. Sorrenson's Manifest Duty: The Polynesian Society over 100 years, and a Centennial Index 1892‚Äì1991 (D. Brown, compiler) were published in 1991.

The bulk composition of the air is mostly uniform so the concentrations of molecules are the same throughout the homosphere. The top of the homosphere is called the homopause, also known as the turbopause. Above the homopause is the heterosphere, where diffusion is faster than mixing, and heavy gases decrease in density with altitude more rapidly than lighter gases. Some of the processes driving this uniformity include heating convection and air flow patterns. In the troposphere, rising warm air replaces higher cooler air which mix gases vertically. Wind patterns push air across the surface mixing it horizontally. At higher altitudes, other atmospheric circulation regimes exist, such as the Brewer-Dobson circulation in the terrestrial stratosphere, which mixes the air. In Earth's mesophere, atmospheric waves become unstable and dissipate, creating turbulent mixing of this region.  Earth's homosphere  A graph showing the seven largest component gases of the Earth's atmosphere. Relative concentrations maintain the same ratios from 0 to around 100 km, represented by relatively horizontal lines. The crossing curves of the rightmost nine-tenths of the graph show how these ratios vary considerably at higher altitudes. The Earth's homosphere starts at the Earth's surface and extends to the turbopause at about 100 km. It incorporates all of the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lower part of the thermosphere. Chemically the homosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other molecules, such as argon and carbon dioxide. It contains over 99% of the mass of the Earth's atmosphere. The density of air decreases with height in the homosphere. =Variations in concentration= One large-scale exception to effective mixing is the ozone layer, centered at about 20 - 30 km in altitude, where the concentration of O3 is much higher than in the rest of the atmosphere. This is due to incoming ultraviolet light, which turns O2 into O3. This created ozone itself blocks most ultraviolet light from penetrating to lower layers of the atmosphere and creating similar levels of ozone there. With a half-life of about a day at room temperature, ozone breaks down before it can mix completely with the lower levels of the atmosphere. The ozone hole is a relatively stable structure caused by a combination of pollution and antarctic wind patterns in the stratosphere. Water vapor concentration (humidity) varies considerably, especially in the troposphere, and is a major component of weather. Water evaporation is driven by heat from incoming solar radiation, and temperature variations can cause water-saturated air to expunge water in the form of rain, snow, or fog. The heat gained and lost by water through these processes increases turbulence in the lower atmosphere, especially at mesoscale and microscale. The Brewer‚ÄìDobson circulation is a theory of large-scale ozone circulation. Concentrations of other trace gases are higher near natural and artificial sources. This includes pollution from human activity (especially agriculture, industry, and transportation), natural gas fields, radon produced by radioactive decay in certain minerals, volcanic gas, emissions from limnic eruptions. Oxygen is emitted and carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants and microorganisms performing photosynthesis, but CO2 levels are most strongly affected by wild fires and human activity.

It was founded on March 17, 1994, with the purchase of the Woolco Canada chain from the F. W. Woolworth Company. Originally consisting of discount stores, Walmart Canada's contemporaries include Giant Tiger, Home Hardware, Canadian Tire and Dollarama. Based on the success of the US format, Walmart Canada has focused on expanding Supercentres from new or converted locations, offering groceries which puts them in the same market as supermarket chains such as Loblaws, Real Canadian Superstore, Metro, Sobeys, Thrifty Foods, Safeway, Save-On-Foods, Country Grocer, Fairway Markets, Quality Foods, Co-op and others. Walmart is the second largest retailer in Canada by revenue. Walmart Canada held grand openings of 15 supercentres in January 2016, completing its expansion plan for the company's fiscal year, ending January 31, 2016. As of July 31, 2020, Walmart Canada's total count is 408 stores, including 343 supercentres and 65 discount stores in every province and territory except for Nunavut.Walmart Store Finder Walmart Canada's principal developer and landlord is SmartCentres; other significant landlords include Riocan and First Capital Realty. History Walmart Canada was established on January 14, 1994 through the acquisition by Walmart of 122 Canadian leases of Woolco, a troubled subsidiary of Woolworth Canada. The same year, these Woolco stores were renovated and converted into the Walmart banner. Wal-Mart did not acquire 22 other Woolco stores that were either unionized or had downtown locations. Some former Woolco stores were sold and re-opened as Zellers stores. The Walmart store in Estevan, SK in January 2014 All 16,000 former employees of the Woolco stores that Walmart acquired were retained, retrained, and given a five percent raise. Mario Pilozzi, a senior vice-president at Woolco when the deal was signed, eventually became CEO of Walmart Canada. Pilozzi, who retired in 2008, has proclaimed that he and \\"his management team took a limping chain and turned it into the Walmart powerhouse that became a game-changer on the Canadian business scene. Retailers changed, Canadian manufactures faced demands and volumes they had not seen before, real estate transitioned from enclosed malls to big-box plazas\\". Reflecting on the 1994 deal in 2013, a Walmart Canada spokesman was quoted as saying \\"Even though Woolco had seen better days and was struggling, there was still an enormous amount of talent in that company. I think that is one of the reasons Walmart has succeeded in Canada, is because we started with a fantastic team that we re-motivated\\". Since 1994, many of the shopping centres in which Walmart is located have been developed by SmartCentres (originally known as First Pro), a real estate company founded by Mitchell Goldhar. At present, Smartcentres is the landlord for approximately 100 Walmarts in Canada. Beginning in the fall of 2006, Walmart opened new Supercentres in Canadian cities. Walmart Canada also operated Sam's Club stores in Ontario from 2003 to 2009. On February 26, 2009, they announced that it would close all six of its Canadian Sam's Club locations. This was part of Walmart Canada's decision to shift focus towards Supercenter stores, but some industry observers suggested that the operation was struggling to compete with Costco and the non- membership Real Canadian Superstore (known as Maxi & Cie in Quebec). Sam's Club also rebranded two unopened locations as new Walmart Supercentres. From originally taking over much of the Woolco chain, Walmart Canada has expanded and opened new stores. It grew to 260 stores by 2005, making it Canada's second-largest retail chain. A Supercentre in Vaughan, ON in January 2008. A Supercentre at Northgate Centre in Edmonton, AB in August 2020. In 2011, Walmart Canada acquired the leases of 39 Zellers stores from Target, originally one of the 189 leaseholds purchased from Hudson's Bay Company and slated for conversion to Target Canada stores. Walmart Canada managed to convert and reopen some of the former Zellers stores before Target Canada's launch. Unlike Walmart's 1994 move into Canada, Walmart Canada this time did not guarantee the jobs of the employees whose stores it was acquiring. Walmart Canada launched the \\"Urban 90\\" format in 2012, a set of smaller Supercentres averaging . On May 8, 2015, following the bankruptcy of Target Canada, Walmart Canada announced its intent to acquire thirteen former Target locations, along with its distribution centre in Cornwall, Ontario subject to court approval. These locations include an unopened location at the Bayshore Shopping Centre in Ottawa. In September 2018, Walmart Canada began offering same-day delivery at some of its locations through a partnership with Instacart. =Supercentres in Canada= Walmart in Fort Saskatchewan, AB, with the old design in August 2016. This has since been renovated. However, ones in Vegreville and Okotoks retain this design. Richmond Hill, ON (1070 Major Mackenzie Drive East, Bayview & Major Mackenzie) in Feb 2020 Remodelled Walmart Supercentre in Brockville, ON in March 2013 With the success of both Walmart in Canada and Walmart Supercenters in the United States, it was announced in late 2005 that the Supercentre concept would be arriving in Canada. On November 8, 2006, Canada's first three Supercentres opened in Ancaster, London, and Stouffville in Ontario. Alberta became the second province with Supercentres in September 2007. The first Supercentre in Vancouver, British Columbia opened in January 2009 in a former Costco/Price Club location, which moved to a new larger site nearby in Burnaby. Walmart Supercentres range from . Walmart Supercentres stock everything a Walmart Discount Store does, but also include a full- service supermarket, including meat and poultry, baked goods, delicatessen, frozen foods, dairy products, garden produce, and fresh seafood. Many Walmart Supercenters also feature a garden centre, pet shop, Axess Law office, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical centre, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, a clinic and numerous alcove shops, such as cellular phone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores (including Redbox rental kiosks), local bank branches, and fast food outlets, Walmart Canada Bank launched its application for banking licence in 2008 to compete with similar stores in Canada such as Loblaw. On July 24, 2009, Walmart Canada Bank was incorporated under the Bank Act in Canada. On May 17, 2018, Wal-Mart Canada announced it had reached a definitive agreement to sell Wal-Mart Canada Bank to First National co-founder Stephen Smith and private equity firm Centerbridge Partners, L.P., on undisclosed financial terms. On the purely coincidental date of April 1, 2019, Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and Stephen Smith jointly announced the closing of the previously announced acquisition of Wal-Mart Canada Bank and that it was to be renamed Duo Bank of Canada, to be styled simply as Duo Bank.Ibid. Though exact ownership percentages were never revealed in either company announcement, it has also since been revealed that Duo Bank was reclassified as a Schedule 1 (domestic, deposit-taking) federally chartered bank of the Bank Act in Canada from the Schedule 2 (foreign-owned or -controlled, deposit-taking) that it had been, which indicates that Stephen Smith, as a noted Canadian businessman, is in a controlling position. =Discount stores in Canada= Walmart Discount Stores are discount department stores varying in size from , with the average store covering about . They carry general merchandise and a selection of dried goods. Many of these stores also have a garden centre, pharmacy, medical clinic, Tire & Lube Express, optical centre, one-hour photo processing lab, cell phone store and fast food outlet, usually McDonald's. Walmart Discount Stores carry limited grocery items, which are limited mostly to dried goods.

On February 26, 2009, they announced that it would close all six of its Canadian Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club also rebranded two unopened locations as new Walmart Supercentres. This was part of Walmart Canada's decision to shift focus towards supercenter stores. Some industry observers suggested that the Canadian Sam's Club never enjoyed the success of its American counterpart due to competition with Costco and the non-membership the Real Canadian Superstore (known as Maxi & Ci] in Quebec), as both chains that had a well-established history in Canada while Sam's Club was a late entrant. That same year, Walmart Canada confirmed that it was in discussions with home improvement chain Lowe's to take over five of the six Sam's Club locations.

(2009‚Äìpresent) Controversy Mapleton, Moncton, NB in October 2008 Walmart Canada has been criticized for using low prices to drive out rivals and local businesses. Within ten years of Walmart's entry into Canada, well-established retailer chains such as Zellers, The Bay, and Sears Canada have struggled, with Kmart Canada being sold to Zellers while Eaton's (whom Walmart Canada overtook to become Canada's largest retailer) filed for bankruptcy. The continued difficulties of competing against Walmart Canada eventually led to HBC selling the leases of most Zellers stores to Target Canada, who also went out of business. In June 2005, Vancouver City Council voted 8‚Äì3 to reject Wal-Mart's proposal to build its first store in the city, a store on Southeast Marine Drive. All eight Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) councillors against the project, while Mayor Larry Campbell and Non-Partisan Association (NPA) councillors, Sam Sullivan and Peter Ladner, were in favor. Wal-Mart's proposed store was designed by local architect Peter Busby for sustainable development, with windmills generating power and underground wells heating and cooling the building which would consume 1/3 the energy of a normal store, and it was endorsed by city planners and staffers. Councillor Anne Roberts stated that her opposition was due to potential traffic and congestion that the store would bring to south Vancouver, although she later remarked \\"I'm not a fan of Wal-Mart, and I've always been concerned about their labour practices, about getting goods from sweatshops\\". =Labour= Like its American parent, Walmart Canada has been the subject of criticism that it has engaged in practices that discourage associates from exercising their right to join a union and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement. Walmart Canada has been accused of undermining internet rights and freedom of speech, as a result of its June 2009 decision to seek an injunction against the Walmart Workers Canada campaign and its longstanding Walmart Workers Canada website in particular, a labour rights website sponsored by United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada (UFCW Canada). In Saskatchewan, Walmart fought unionization drivers at stores in Weyburn and North Battleford. The company's tactics eventually resulted in the Labour Relations Board imposing a fine and ordering them to hand over relevant documents, including the anti-union handbook for managers. A Walmart store in Windsor, was unionized in 1997, but workers dissolved the union three years later after it failed to sign contract with management. Entrance of Walmart (formerly Zellers from late 1970s‚Äì2012) through the mall of Centre Domaine in Montreal, QC, in October 2012. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had long been unsuccessful in unionizing Walmarts in the United States and much of Canada, was able to take advantage of Quebec's union-friendly laws to make some progress. These laws permit card check organizing, which gives unions more power than secret ballot organizing used in the rest of Canada, and mandates arbitration if the two sides fail to reach a contract. The UFCW argued that union card-signing was more democratic than secret votes because \\"when there is a vote Walmart uses intimidation tactics\\". In addition, Quebec's labour relations board had ordered Walmart Canada to stop \\"intimidating and harassing\\" cashiers at a store in Sainte-Foy, near Quebec City in the midst of an organizing drive. Walmart has responded, mostly by shutting down unionized stores or stalling labour contract negotiations. For instance they closed their Saguenay, Quebec store, in April 2005 after workers unionized and just days before contract settlement by binding arbitration, putting 190 employees out of work. Walmart argued that the store wasn't profitable and the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed 6‚Äì3 on November 27, 2009 that the company had the legal right to close the store. Walmart also closed its automotive centre in Gatineau, Quebec, after employees unionized and an arbitrator imposed a 33% wage increase. Kingston, ON Walmart store in June 2005. There was the successful unionization by the UFCW of a Walmart store in Jonqui√®re, Quebec in August 2004, as told in the documentary Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price. The initial card check organizing efforts fell one vote short, and in April 2004 a secret ballot to join the union was defeated 53% to 47%. However, when a group of managers gathered just outside the front door to celebrate for the TV cameras and taunt union supporters as they left the store, this spectacle offended many of the workers that originally voted against the union and caused them to switch sides, leading to a second and successful card check that unionized the store in August 2004. However, nine days of negotiation between the UFCW and Wal-Mart were fruitless, with the union accusing the company of not negotiating in good faith while Walmart argued that the union wanted the store to hire an additional 30 workers. Walmart closed the store five months later because the company did not approve of the new \\"business plan\\" a union would require, and this move was permitted by Quebec law as long as the closure was permanent. This labour dispute between Walmart and the UFCW made headlines worldwide; three of the other forty-six Walmarts in the province of Quebec were temporarily closed by bomb threats, while a TV broadcaster likened Wal-Mart to Nazi Germany, and Saguenay mayor Jean Tremblay denounced the company as a \\"freebooting scofflaw\\". Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott Jr. argued that the Jonqui√®re store was struggling, while polls in Canada showed that 9 of 10 Canadians believed that the store closure was mainly due to the unionization. A local newspaper columnist accused the UFCW leaders in Washington, D.C. of using the Jonqui√®re store workers (in a city with chronically high unemployment, and whose stores had been wiped out by the opening of the Place du Royaume shopping mall in Chicoutimi) as \\"cannon fodder\\" to provoke a fight in order to incite public opinion against the Walmart, knowing that Walmart headquarters would not tolerate a unionized store. In September 2005, the Quebec Labour Board ruled that the closing of a Walmart store amounted to a reprisal against unionized workers and has ordered additional hearings on possible compensation for the employees, though it offered no details. Union organizers suggested that Walmart was making an example of the Jonqui√®re store to pressure workers at other locations not to unionize. At the Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec Walmart, the 200 employees had organized successfully in January 2005 but contract negotiations stalled and an arbitrator was called in, finally reaching a two-year deal on April 9, 2009. However the Saint-Hyacinthe contract was seen largely as a Pyrrhic victory for the UFCW, as the arbitrator portrayed \\"Walmart as at least as good an employer-even a superior employer- compared with other retailers\\", noting that Walmart workers were paid more than their counterparts at Zellers. The union's calls for wage and benefit increases were all rejected, particularly their demand for an automatic-progression annual wage scales, as that would have conflicted with the company-wide annual performance evaluation, a key component of Walmart's business model. The arbitrator awarded existing workers (but not new hires) a small wage gain of 30¬¢ an hour to prevent them from being \\"impoverished\\" by dues paid to a union that failed to justify wages increases to the arbitrator. In 2011, the Saint-Hyacinthe Walmart employees voted (147 out of 250) to decertify United Food and Commercial Workers as their representative union; it has been suggested that employees were disappointed in their union whose 2009 contract was tilted strongly in favour of their employer. Walmart employees in Gatineau, Quebec joined the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) in 2008. This was followed by two years of stalled negotiations before an arbitrator imposed a collective agreement. In November 2011, after one year with their first collective agreement, the 150 Wal-Mart employees voted to decertify. On August 15, 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada cleared the way for Walmart employees in Weyburn, Saskatchewan who voted 51‚Äì5 to decertify United Food and Commercial Workers as their representative union. This left no unionized Wal-Mart stores in the whole of Canada. =Security= On July 14, 2015 Walmart Canada disabled their online photo site, blaming a third party vendor, believed to be PNI Digital Media. Walmart's shutdown was followed shortly after by other companies suspending their photo site whilst an investigation took place. In common with other potential victims there was no confirmation or denial about whether hackers had stolen customer photographs as well as data and payment information.

It is located 13 km west of Greenwood and 51 km east of Osoyoos along Highway 3. Midway's welcome sign History Originally called Boundary City, the land was purchased by the Midway Town site Company. The Company divided the land into lots in 1893 and sold each for about $100. The name was changed by one of the owners, Captain R.C. Adams, the next year. It is thought that he named it after Midway Plaisance at the Chicago World Fair of 1893. A year after its establishment, an elementary school was built. The town was slowly populated. During mining booms in the 1890s, the population reached up to 6000. Midway also expanded in 1899 with the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway, making it a centre point for the distribution of ore. Government Midway's local government consists of a mayor and four councillors elected to four year terms. The current mayor is Martin Fromme. The councillors are Dick Dunsdon, Darrin Metcalf, Fred Grouette, and Gary Schierbeck. James McMynn, Midway's first mayor, was the longest-serving mayor in Canada, retiring after 38 years. Representation for school board is elected to School District 51 Boundary which is based in Grand Forks. It operates two schools in Midway; Boundary Central Secondary School and Midway Elementary School. Local Attractions Midway is Mile Zero of the Kettle Valley Rail Trail, a popular wilderness cycling trail which follows the rail bed of the old Kettle Valley Railroad. At the trail's start, the Village of Midway operates the Kettle Valley Museum which highlights the life of early Boundary Country settlers. Notable museum features include a windmill from the Bubar farm that was originally purchased from the T. Eaton Co. Construction of a bunk house has been started. When complete, the bunkhouse will offer accommodations for cyclists using the trail. The Midway Curling Club is a popular destination for Boundary Area curlers. A hockey rink next door is popular with local youth. The curling rink is home to the Boundary District Curling Club Across the street from the curling rink and arena is McMynn park, a large green space which hosts many ball tournaments and picnics. Adjacent to the Boundary Central Secondary School is a park in which two trees have grown together after being entwined together when the village was young. The trees were joined together by Sinixt people as a symbol of the International Boundary Line dividing their people and territory. A plaque at the site reads: When the International Boundary Line was being surveyed in 1857-1861, the major portion of the large Indian band then living in this area then moved to the reservation in Colville, Washington. One of the Indians entwined two saplings, saying \\"Though divided we are united still - We are one.\\" Tubing the Kettle River is a popular summer activity, and the village maintains a stock of inner tubes at Frank Carpenter Memorial Park. The park is also a local campground, and is particularly popular with rv owners traveling through. Midway features a grass airstrip known as Midway Aerodrome which is suitable for small planes. Hangars were added in 2005 to the airstrip. Plans exist for a paved runway, but the completion date is uncertain at this point. Midway is also a host to ever growing music festival, named The Groove Music Festival. Television Midway was featured on the historical television series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns, Season 3, Episode 11.

It explores the dilemmas created by \\"European\\" rule over an \\"Oriental\\" society and presents a tableau portrait of Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, during the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic period that preceded the long era of Soviet rule. It was published under the pseudonym Kurban Said. The novel has been published in more than 30 languages, with more than 100 editions or reprints. The book was first published in Vienna in German in 1937, by E.P. Tal Verlag. It is widely regarded as a literary masterpiece and since its rediscovery and global circulation, which began in 1970, it is commonly considered the national novel of Azerbaijan. There has been a good deal of interest in the authorship of Ali and Nino. The true identity behind the pseudonym \\"Kurban Said\\" has been the subject of some dispute. The case for Lev Nussimbaum, aka Essad Bey, as the author originally surfaced in 1944. In Tom Reiss's 2005 international bestseller The Orientalist: Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life, Reiss makes a thorough case that the novel is the work of Nussimbaum, which continues a claim dating to Nussimbaum's correspondence and writings 1938‚Äì1942 and the writings of Ahmed Giamil Vacca-Mazzara in the 1940s. A claim for Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli as author originated in 1971. The argument for Chamanzaminli was presented in a special 2011 issue of Azerbaijan International entitled Ali and Nino: The Business of Literature, in which Betty Blair argued that Nussimbaum merely embellished a manuscript of which she surmises that Chamanzaminli must be the \\"core author,\\" a position that had already been advanced by Chamanaminli's sons and their supporters for some years. The novel's copyright holder, Leela Ehrenfels, maintains that her aunt the Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels von Bodmershof authored the book, mainly because the book's publishing contract and subsequent catalog record identify her as Kurban Said, though few support this as proof of her authorship. Plot Cross-cultural couples did exist in Baku early 1900s. Here Georgian woman Alexandra from a Christian background was married with Azerbaijani man Alipasha Aliyev of Muslim tradition. Pictured here with their daughter Tamara, early 1900s. In the novel, Ali and Nino have a daughter named \\"Tamar\\".Ali and Nino: The Business of Literature, special issue of Azerbaijan International, 15, no. 2‚Äì4 (2011), Photo 5, p. 23. Baku Realni School, the setting of the first scene in the novel Ali and Nino. Today, this building houses the University of Economics, Istiglaliyyat (Independence) Street. Ali and Nino is the story of an Azerbaijani youth who falls in love with a Georgian princess. Essentially, the book is a quest for truth and reconciliation in a world of contradictory beliefs and practices ‚Äì Islam and Christianity, East and West, age and youth, male and female. Much of the novel is set in Baku's Old City (Ichari Shahar) on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution beginning around 1914. Ali Khan Shirvanshir, a descendant of a noble Muslim family, is educated in a Russian high school for boys. While his father is still culturally Asian, Ali is exposed to Western values in school and through his love of Georgian princess Nino Kipiani, who has been brought up in a Christian tradition and belongs more to the European world. The book describes the love of Ali for Nino, with excursions to mountain villages in Daghestan, Shusha in Azerbaijan, Tbilisi, Georgia, and Persia. Upon graduating from high school, Ali determines to marry Nino. At first she hesitates, until Ali promises that he will not make her wear the veil, or be part of a harem. Ali's father, despite his traditional Muslim view of women, supports the marriage while trying to postpone it. The book takes a dramatic turn when a (Christian) Armenian, Melik Nachararyan, whom Ali thought was a friend, kidnaps Nino. In retaliation, Ali pursues him on horseback, overtakes his \\"lacquered box\\" car and stabs him to death with a dagger. Contrary to the tradition of honor killing urged by Ali's friend Mehmed Heydar, Ali spares Nino's life. Ali then flees to Dagestan to escape the vengeance of Nakhararyan's family. After many months, Nino finds Ali in a simple hilltown in the mountains near Makhachkala. The two marry on the spot and spend a few months in blissful poverty. As turmoil follows the Russian Revolution, Ali Khan makes some tough ideological decisions. When the Ottoman Army moves closer to his native Baku, Ali Khan watches the developments closely. The Bolsheviks recapture Baku, and Ali and Nino flee to Iran (Persia). In Tehran, Ali is reminded of his Muslim roots, while Nino is fundamentally unhappy in the confinement of the harem. Upon establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Ali and Nino return and become cultural ambassadors of their new country. Ali is offered a post as ambassador to France ‚Äì an idea Nino had arranged ‚Äì but Ali declines, because he fears he will be unhappy in Paris. When the Red Army descends on Ganja, Azerbaijan, Ali takes up arms to defend his country. Nino flees to Georgia with their child, while Ali Khan dies in battle as the Bolsheviks take the country. (The Bolshevik victory led to the establishment of Soviet domination of Azerbaijan from 1920 to 1991 and the end of the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which lasted from May 1918 to April 1920.)  Art, theater, and film related to Ali and Nino  In 1998 Hans de Weers of Amsterdam-based Egmond Film & Television, sought to find American partners for a film adaptation of Ali & Nino, which was to be shot in English and written by Academy Award- winning Azerbaijani screenwriter Rustam Ibragimbekov. De Weers was reported to have \\"pieced together 30% of the $8 million budget from the Netherlands and Azerbaijan.\\"Sharon Swart, \\"Umbrella stand helps Euros foot market bill,\\" Variety, February 23 ‚Äì March 1, 1998, p. A3. In 2004 the Dutch film company Zeppers Film & TV, in a coproduction with NPS, released a 90-minute documentary by Dutch director Jos de Putter entitled Alias Kurban Said. The film examines the disagreements over the novel's authorship. Variety called it a \\"Magnificent historical whodunit, wherein crumbling photographs, yellowing documents, and forgotten reels of 35 mm film are invested with tremendous evocative power.\\"Ronnie Scheib, \\"Alias Kurban Said\\" [film review], Variety, June 28 ‚Äì July 11, 2004. The film shows documentary evidence that Abraham Nussimbaum was a proprietor of oil wells sold to the Nobel firm in 1913. The film was an official selection of the Tribeca Film Festival, the International Film Festival, Rotterdam, and the 2005 Netherlands Film Festival. Its music won the prize for Best Music at the Netherlands Film Festival. Ali and Nino was adapted as a play at the Baku Municipal Theater in 2007. The Azerbaijani theater company that staged it in 2007 also performed the play at an international theater festival in Moscow in 2012. In February 2010 an Azerbaijani news organization reported that Georgian film director Giorgi Toradze was planning to make a \\"documentary\\" about the \\"creation\\" of Ali and Nino, though the description of the film in the news report suggested that it would be a fictional rendition. According to the report, the project \\"has been submitted to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Culture and Tourism by film producer Giorgi Sturua.\\" A moving metal sculpture created by Georgian sculptor Tamara Kvesitadze in 2007, titled \\"Man and Woman,\\" which is said to have been well received at the Venice Biennale of 2007, was installed in Batumi, Georgia in 2010 and re-titled \\"Ali and Nino,\\" after the title characters of the Kurban Said novel. The novel was reportedly Kvesitadze's inspiration for the work. See the sculptor's web site in which the sculpture is still titled \\"Man and Woman\\" A \\"musical re-imagining\\" of the novel, titled In the Footsteps of Ali and Nino, premiered in Paris at the Richelieu Amphitheater of University of Paris IV, Paris-Sorbonne in April 2012. Its \\"originator, project leader and pianist\\" was Azerbaijani pianist Saida Zulfugarova. Her \\"soundtrack\\" to the novel used \\"both Georgian and Azerbaijani traditional music and works by Azer Rzaev, Uzeyir Hajibeyli, Vagif Mustafazadeh, Fritz Kreisler and, of course, Kara Karayev, amongst many others.\\" It was directed by Charlotte Loriot. As of 2013, the novel is being adapted for a film by British screenwriter and playwright Christopher Hampton. Asif Kapadia has been named as director and production of the film is slated to start in 2014. The film's producer is Leyla Aliyeva, Vice President of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation.  Authorship debate  For decades, there has been a controversy about the identity of Kurban Said, the pseudonym used to hide the identity of the author of this novel. No one has located or identified any existing manuscript of Ali and Nino. The publisher, Lucy Tal, claims that all papers were deliberately destroyed when the Nazis entered Vienna. The closest anyone has come to such a find is Mireille Ehrenfels-Abeille, who claims in the 2004 film Alias Kurban Said to possess half of the manuscript of The Girl From the Golden Horn, the other novel published under the name Kurban Said. In the film itself, however, she was unable to locate the manuscript in her home and said that in fact she may not have seen it for ten or twenty years.Mireille Ehrenfels-Abeille in Alias Kurban Said. =The case for Lev Nussimbaum's authorship= The claim that Lev Nussimbaum was the novel's author began circulating in 1944, when an Italian translation of the novel appeared, listing the author listed as \\"Mohammed Essad Bey.\\"Mohammed Essad Bey, Al√¨ Kh√†n (Rome: Editoriale I.T.L.O., 1944) Tom Reiss notes this as \\"a first posthumous restoration\\" of Nussimbaum's authorship. (Of course, this Italian edition was brought to press by Dr. Ahmed Giamil Vacca-Mazzara (n√© Bello Vacca), who claimed himself to be Kurban Said and denied that Essad Bey was a Jew named Lev Nussimbaum.). When the novel was translated into English by Jenia Graman and published by Random House in 1970, John Wain, the author of the introduction, described the figure behind the name Kurban Said, without naming him, as having the biographical attributes of Nussimbaum.John Wain, introduction to Ali and Nino first published in the 1970 Random House edition and reprinted in the 1999 Overlook Press edition. Assertions that Nussimbaum was the author were occasionally repeated thereafter.Nussimbaum is named directly in the book review of Ali and Nino by Hasan Javadi in The Middle East Journal 47, no. 4 (Autumn 1993): 720‚Äì721. Azerbaijani translator Charkaz Qurbanov, identified in the list of interviewees at the end of the film, Alias Kurban Said as \\"Cherkes Burbanly\\" identifies himself (as transcribed and transliterated in the English subtitles) as \\"Cherkes Qurbanov has argued, in a discussion shown in the film Alias Kurban Said, that \\"Kurban Said is the literary pseudonym of Mohammed Essad Bey. Statistics have shown, and so has my research, that the novels written by Essad Bey and Kurban Said are in exactly the same style. There is no difference. In Essad Bey's work you see Azerbeidshan [i.e., Azerbaijan] underneath.\\" Another participant, identified in the list of interviewees at the end of the film Alias Kurban Said as \\"Zeydulla Achaev.\\" It may be that this person is the man more commonly known as Zeydulla Aƒüayevd…ôn, who has translated Ali and Nino into Azeri. The discussion said \\"The text is German, but it is an Azerbeidshan [i.e., Azerbaijani] type of German. Essad Bey's German is what a real German would never use. The sentence structure shows that he is not German.\\"Jos de Putter, director, Alias Kurban Said, Zeppers Film & TV, 2004.  Documentary evidence for Lev Nussimbaum's authorship  There are three documents written by people who knew Nussimbaum attesting that he was the author of the book. One is a letter published in the New York Times in August 1971 from Bertha Pauli, an Austrian literary agent who knew Nussimbaum in Vienna from 1933 to 1938 and had helped him get publishing opportunities through a writers' cooperative called Austrian Correspondence (which Pauli said she \\"had organized to provide authors whose work was ‚Äòundesirable‚Äô in the Third Reich with opportunities for publication elsewhere\\"). Pauli had also negotiated the contract for the second Kurban Said novel, The Girl from the Golden Horn. Describing herself as Nussimbaum's \\"colleague and friend,\\" Pauli wrote to the New York Times in 1971 that she had \\"read the novel at the time of its successful, first publication, 1937, in my native Vienna and talked to the author himself about it.\\" She remarked that \\"The new, excellent English translation brings the German original vividly to my mind; I seem to hear Essad talking again in his particularly witty way.\\"Bertha Pauli, letter to the editor, \\"Ali and Nino,\\" New York Times, August 8, 1971, p. BR27. Another testimonial is by Baron Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels in his foreword to a 1973 Swiss edition of the second Kurban Said novel, The Girl From the Golden Horn. Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels was the husband of Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels von Bodmershof and coincidentally the father of Leela Ehrenfels, the current copyright holder. The complicated story is told by Leela Ehrenfels in \\"'Ali and Nino'. Identifying \\"Kurban Said\\" with the man he would have known in the 1930s as Nussimbaum/Bey, the baron writes: \\"As a young man I founded the ‚ÄòOrient-Bund‚Äô for Afro-Asian students in Vienna and through it I became friends with the quietly observing Azerbaijani Kurban Said.... My way brought me shortly after that to India, from where I returned to Europe for the first time in 1954 and immediately went to visit the traditional Muslim grave of my then apparently forgotten friend which stood outside the wall of the cemetery in Positano.\\"Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels, foreword to Kurban Said, Das M√§dchen vom godenen Horn (Basel: Desch, 1973), quoted in and cited on p. 378. Lucy Tal, the spouse of E. P. Tal, the novel's original 1937 publisher, believed that \\"Essad Bey\\" (Nussimbaum) had probably written it but that she was not sure as her husband Peter had dealt with the contracts but had died suddenly of a heart attack and she had fled Vienna with the Anschluss. Furthermore, she did not trust Essad Bey in regard to the contracts: \\"Essad sometimes was the real Oriental fairytale story teller. What was true or not true did not always bother him much.\\"Betty Blair, \\"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: About the Authorship of Ali and Nino,\\" Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4, pp. 52‚Äì137, \\"frequently asked question\\" number 31 and 32. Tom Reiss's case for Lev Nussimbaum's authorship Tom Reiss has argued‚Äîfirst in a 1999 article in The New Yorker and then at greater length in his 2005 biography of Nussimbaum, The Orientalist‚Äîthat it is \\"almost certain that Kurban Said was a cover for him so that he could continue to receive royalties from his work.\\" Reiss cites and quotes documentary evidence not only linking the pseudonym Kurban Said to Nussimbaum and Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels von Bodmershof, but also showing reasons that the Jewish Nussimbaum would have needed a new pseudonym after he was expelled from the (Nazi) German Writers Union in 1935, that he received income from books published under that name, and that he himself claimed authorship of Ali and Nino. =Tom Reiss's documentary evidence for Lev Nussimbaum's authorship= From the beginning, in 1937 and 1938 Baroness Ehrenfels held the legal copyright to the works of Kurban Said, quotes from page 1556 of the Deutscher Gesamtkatalog for the years 1935‚Äì39: \\"Ehrenfels v. Bodmershof, Elfriede, Baronin [Baroness]‚ÄîAli und Nino, Roman [novel]. Von Kurban Said [d.i. Baronin Elfriede Ehrenfels v. Bodmershof].‚ÄîWien, Leipzig: Tal 1937. Ehrenfels v. Bodmershof, Elfriede, Baronin [Baroness]‚ÄîKurban Said [d.i. Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels v. Bodmershof]. Das M√§dchen vom Goldenen Horn. Roman. [novel.]‚ÄîWien, Leipzig: Zinnen-Verlag 1938.\\" a copyright that has now passed by inheritance to her niece Leela Ehrenfels. Leela Ehrenfels's lawyer, Heinz Barazon, has successfully defended the Ehrenfels family's ownership of the copyright to Ali and Nino. Reiss argues, however, that rather than being the actual author behind the name Kurban Said, Baroness Ehrenfels instead acted as an \\"Aryanizer\\" for Nussimbaum, meaning she took legal ownership of the pseudonym Kurban Said while passing income to him generated from books published under that name. Heinz Barazon, Reiss reports, pointed out that a publishing contract for Ali and Nino was signed in Vienna on April 20, 1937, well before Nussimbaum, as a Jew, would have lost the right to publish in the wake of the Anschluss, or Nazi German annexation of Austria, which took place in March 1938. Reiss counters Barazon's point by arguing that Nussimbaum had an economic incentive to publish under a pseudonym owned by his friend the Baroness Ehrenfels because, as opposed to Austria and Switzerland, where Nussimbaum could have published under his pen name Essad Bey, Nazi-controlled Germany was the largest market by far for German-language publications. Reiss paraphrases Professor Murray Hall, an expert on publishing in interwar Austria, who told him \\"It wasn‚Äôt profitable to publish a book if you could not sell it in Germany, so Austrian publishers needed to get their books past the Nazi censors to reach the majority of the German-reading public.\\" This theory is supported by Bertha Pauli's 1971 letter to the New York Times, in which she wrote that a reason Nussimbaum may have used the pseudonym for his work in this period was that \\"as 'Kurban Said' it could still be sold in the German market.\\" Reiss writes of finding \\"a trail of letters\\" in \\"the files of the Italian Fascist Political Police in Rome\\" attesting that the Nazi police apparatus had thwarted an effort by Nussimbaum to sell his work in Nazi Germany. He cites a July 8, 1937, internal note from an Italian police service showing that the service believed Nussimbaum/Bey had \\"tried to smuggle\\" his works into Germany but that \\"the trick was, however, discovered.\\"Tom Reiss, \\"The Man from the East,\\" The New Yorker, October 4, 1999, p. 75. \\"Though this does not prove,\\" concluded Reiss, \\"that Essad [Bey, Lev Nussimbaum's adopted name] was concealing his identity behind Kurban Said, it shows that he had cause to.\\" Reiss further quotes Nussimbaum's correspondence with Baron Omar- Rolf Ehrenfels in 1938 to show that Nussimbaum received royalty payments for Kurban Said publications via Baroness Ehrenfels, whom he referred to as \\"Mrs. Kurban Said.\\" (Leela Ehrenfels cites a September 14, 1938, letter from \\"Essad Bey\\" to Baroness Ehrenfels, written in Positano, Italy, in which he again refers to her as \\"Mrs. Kurban Said\\" and congratulates her on something unmentioned ‚Äì Leela Ehrenfels interprets this as a reference to The Girl From the Golden Horn.) Reiss also quotes letters in which Nussimbaum unequivocally affirms being the novel's author. In one Nussimbaum states directly that he was using Baroness Ehrenfels as a legal cover in order to circumvent the ban on his work in Nazi Germany: Nussimbaum explains that Ali and Nino could still be published everywhere, since \\"according to the law on pseudonyms, K.S. is a woman! A young Viennese baroness, who is even a member of the Kulturkammer!\\", the German Writers‚Äô Union from which Nussimbaum had been expelled., quoting a letter from \\"Essad Bey\\" to Pima Andrae, September 21, 1940. In this same letter Nussimbaum recommended to his addressee that \\"she buy a copy of Ali and Nino herself, bragging that it was his favorite of his own books.\\" In another letter, Nussimbaum wrote of having had only two writing experience in which \\"I thought neither of the publishing company, nor of royalties, but just wrote happily away. These were the books Stalin and Ali and Nino,\\" adding that \\"The heroes of the novel simply come to me demanding, ‚ÄòGive us shape‚Äô ‚Äî ‚Äòwe also possess certain characteristics that you‚Äôve left out and we want to travel, among other things.‚Äô \\", citing a letter from \\"Essad Bey\\" to Pima Andreae, June 11, 1942. (Betty Blair has interpreted this statement as an \\"admission\\" that Nussimbaum had \\"gained access to the original manuscripts\\" already written by someone else, Yusif Vavir Chamanzaminli, and had \\"embellished them.\\"Blair writes: \\"Essad Bey's admission suggests that neither of these works were his own, but that he gained access to the original manuscripts and embellished them. How is it that Essad Bey could be so nonchalant and carefree about writing books that dealt with the most serious issues of his day - the cruel expansion of Bolshevism, and the rise to power of its most prominent proponent ‚Äì Stalin? And why would any author admit further need for character development if the books were his in the first place? Who exactly was Essad Bey referring to as the author who \\"left out\\" essential features in the first place? What a strange acknowledgement for an author to comment that he did not have to fret about the usual financial arrangements and publication details of these works ‚Äì that he was free to write to his heart's content, elaborating upon his original work.\\" Betty Blair, \\"'CUT AND PASTE'\\" AUTHOR: Essad Bey's Fingerprints in Ali and Nino,\\" Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4 (2011): 230‚Äì251. Elsewhere, Blair elaborates: \\"Essad Bey's explanation that 'certain characteristics' had been 'left out' does not make sense if the works were his own creation in the first place; but it becomes perfectly logical if publishers passed these works onto him which others had initially authored, suggesting that he develop them further. This would explain why the novel's basic ideas could come from Chamanzaminli, while some of the folkloric peripheral decorative elements can absolutely be traced to Essad Bey.\\" Betty Blair, \\"Frequently Asked Question\\" number 15, \\"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: About the Authorship of Ali and Nino,\\" Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4 (2011): 52‚Äì137.) Reiss also quotes other letters in which Nussimbaum identifies himself as Kurban Said. In his final, unpublished manuscript, Der Mann der Nichts von der Liebe Verstand, Nussimbaum also refers to himself as \\"Ali.\\" Thus, while Reiss has not claimed absolute proof that Nussimbaum, rather than Ehrenfels or Chamanzaminli, is the primary author, he does cite documentary evidence showing that Nussimbaum had a need in 1937 to \\"Aryanize\\" his publications in order to continue to generate income from them, was receiving income from checks written to the name of Kurban Said, made several documented references identifying himself as Kurban Said, and continued to use the pseudonym on his final, unpublished manuscript Der Mann der Nichts von der Liebe Verstand. =Tom Reiss's textual comparisons= In addition to the documentary evidence Reiss offers for Lev Nussimbaum's authorship, Reiss also suggests several interpretive parallels between Nussimbaum's known life experiences and his writings under the pseudonym Essad Bey. In The Orientalist Reiss cites the testimony of Alexandre Brailowski (aka Alex Brailow), a schoolmate of Lev Nussimbaum's at the Russian gymnasium in Charlottenburg, Berlin. It is not clear from Reiss's account whether Brailow had been in touch with Nussimbaum during the 1930s, particularly in 1937 when Ali and Nino was first published in Vienna; in any case Reiss does not report that Brailow claimed receiving from Nussimbaum (or anyone else) any verbal or written acknowledgement of Nussimbaum's authorship. Reiss quotes Brailow, in his unpublished memoirs, as remembering that Nussimbaum had a \\"talent for telling stories.\\" Reiss further cites Brailow's unpublished introduction to a planned book entitled The Oriental Tales of Essad-Bey (a collection of Nussimbaum's early writings in Brailow's possession), in which Brailow interpreted characters in Ali and Nino as autobiographical references to Nussimbaum's schoolmates from his gymnasium. The Nino character, Brailow believed, was based on Nussimbaum's teenage love interest Zhenia Flatt. Reiss writes that because Zhenia Flatt \\"transferred her affections... to an older man named Yashenka,\\" Brailow \\"always believed that Yasha was Lev‚Äôs model for Nachararyan, the 'evil Armenian' in Ali and Nino, who is Ali‚Äôs rival for Nino‚Äôs love.\\" Brailow wrote: \\"The whole love affair, including the elopement of Nino and the subsequent pursuit and killing of Nachararyan, is as much of a wish-fulfillment as is the autobiography of Ali whose adolescence and youth are a curious mixture of Essad‚Äôs own and of what he would have liked them to be.\\" Reiss also notes that Brailow also remembered an incident that recalls the moment in Ali and Nino in which Ali murders Nachararyan: \\"one day he pulled a knife on his tormentor and threatened to cut his throat. Brailow recalled that 'Essad, besides being a nervous type, seemed to indulge in outbursts of murderous rage, perhaps because he felt that this was his obligation as an ‚ÄòOriental‚Äô for whom revenge would be a sacred duty.' Brailow intervened to prevent his friend's 'Caucasian temper' from leading to murder.\\" Reiss asserts that \\"though clearly juvenilia,\\" Nussimbaum's unpublished early stories \\"had an irony that was instantly recognizable as the raw material of Ali and Nino and so many of the Caucasian books Lev would write.\\"  Additional evidence for Lev Nussimbaum's authorship: plagiarism and repetition  Tamar Injia's book Ali and Nino ‚Äì Literary Robbery! demonstrates that portions of Ali and Nino were \\"stolen\\" from the 1926 novel The Snake's Skin (Das Schlangenhemd) by Georgian author Grigol Robakidze. (It was published in Georgian in 1926 and in German in 1928. Injia analyzed the two books, found similar and identical passages, and concluded that \\"Kurban Said\\" (whom she identifies as Essad Bey) deliberately transferred passages from Robakidze's novel.Tamar Injia, Ali and Nino ‚Äì Literary Robbery! (Norwalk, Conn: IM Books, 2009). =The case for Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli's authorship= Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli (Yusif V…ôzir C…ôm…ônz…ôminli in Azeri), Azerbaijani author, whom Betty Blair argues is the \\"Core Author\\" of Ali and Nino, using textual comparisons between the diaries, essays, short stories and novels of which he is the undisputed author and the novel Ali and Nino, the authorship of which is in dispute. The claim that the Azerbaijani novelist Yusif Vazir, known popularly as Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli, is the true author of Ali and Nino appears to have begun in the preface to the 1971 Turkish edition of the novel, in which the Turkish translator Semih Yazichioghlu, claimed that Lucy Tal, the late widow of the original publisher E.P. Tal, had written a letter stating that in the 1920s \\"a handsome young man\\" had \\"left a pile of manuscripts\\" that the company published in 1937. (Lucy Tal unequivocally denied having written the statement, calling the assertions \\"monstrous claims.\\"Betty Blair, \\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of Ali and Nino\\", Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4, pp. 52‚Äì137, \\"Frequently Asked Question\\" number 30 and 31 and endnotes 56‚Äì60, citing Semih Yazlcioghlu's preface in Kurban Said, Ali ile Nino (Istanbul: Hurriyet, 1971), pp. 7‚Äì15 (specifically page 12) and correspondence made available by \\"Martin Skala, trustee of Lucy Tal's Archives, Connecticut.\\") Chamanzaminli's late sons Orkhan and Fikret have continued to make the claim. They began advocating for it at least by the 1990s after the first Azeri translation of Ali and Nino was published in 1990. An earlier Azeri translation had been made in 1972, but a complete rendering in Azeri, by Mirza Khazar, was published for the first time, serially, in three issues of the magazine Azerbaijan in 1990. Following this theory, Chamanzaminli has been listed as the author (rather than the standard \\"Kurban Said\\") in a number of editions, particularly in Azerbaijan where the has declared Chamanzaminli to be the author. In the 2004 film Alias Kurban Said, directed by Jos de Putter, Yusif Vazirov Chamanzaminli's late son Fikrat Vazirov offered an argument for Chamanzaminli's authorship. Chamanzaminli had been in a romantic relationship with a girlfriend named Nina who, he argued, became \\"Nino\\" in the novel. \\"Anyone can say they are Kurban Said, but they can't tell you how they met Nino in Nikolay Street.\\" He attested that his father had met a young woman named \\"Nino\\": \\"She was walking along Nikolay Street and father came from the Institute. They met here in the park, just like in the novel. He was nineteen and she was seventeen.\\" A short story by Chamanzaminli, published in 1927, autobiographical in appearance, featured a starving writer in Paris in the mid-1920s (when Chamanzaminli was there) who works as a ghostwriter producing articles under the signature of someone else and getting only 25 percent of the earnings for them. Blair offers this as a clue that Chamanzaminli had in reality, not in fiction, produced writings that appeared under others' signatures. Blair implicitly conjectures that the novel must have also passed out of his possession and that he thus lost the capacity to receive credit for its writing. Fikret Vezirov has proffered the claim that Chamanzaminli had to hide his identity behind the name Kurban Said so that he would not be identified with the anti-Bolshevik views contained in Ali and Nino. If Chamanzaminli had a copy of the manuscript, Vezirov said, it must have been among those Vezirov reports Chamanzaminli burning in 1937 when Chamanzaminli fell under the suspicion of the KGB. Vezirov referred to an article from the 1930s, the authors of which, in Vezirov's characterization, resented Nussimbaum's use of the name \\"Essad Bey\\" and protested \\"that he wrote pornography that had nothing to do with history, that he was just inciting nations against each other.\\" Vezirov cited the fact that his father had traveled to Iran, Tblisi, Kislovodsk, and Daghestan (all visited by the novel's characters) as another self-evident link. \\"Draw your own conclusions,\\" he declared.Alias Kurban Said. Panah Khalilov (alternative spelling: Penah Xelilov), as shown in the film Alias Kurban Said, is the creator of the Chamanzaminli archive. He referred in the film to a Chamanzaminli story published in 1907 which he believes is a \\"primary variant,\\" rather than \\"the complete Ali and Nino.\\" He also referred to \\"a book, written in German and published in Berlin\\" whose author had met Nussimbaum, had read Blood and Oil in the Orient, and \\"had written an essay about it in which he accuses him of insulting his people by saying that the core of the Azerbeidshan people were Jews\\" ‚Äì a characterization that Cerkez Qurbanov, who translated Blood and Oil into Azeri, vociferously denied was true about Blood and Oil in the Orient. Wendell Steavenson, in her 2002 book Stories I Stole: From Georgia reported that \\"Vazirov the younger called Lev Nussimbaum a fraudster, a 'charlatan', not a Bakuvian, who wrote twelve books 'of an adventurist nature' but had nothing to do with Ali and Nino. Ali and Nino, he declared 'is a pure Azerbaijani novel.' His father, he said, had written Ali and Nino and managed to get it published in Vienna through a cousin who lived there. There were too many details that matched: Kurban Said must have been an Azeri. 'He even knew all about a special kind of Shusha cheese, which only a man from Shusha would know about.' Vazirov argued.\\"Wendell Steavenson, Stories I Stole from Georgia (New York: Grove Press, 2002), p. 165. Assertions that Azerbaijani nationalism motivates the advocacy of Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli's authorship At least four scholars of Azerbaijani literature and culture have expressed skepticism about Azerbaijan International‚Äôs arguments for Chamanzaminli‚Äôs authorship of Ali and Nino. They have offered two kinds of criticism: one is a political rejection of the latent exclusionary nationalism they feel has motivated the campaign for establishing Chamanzaminli as the novel‚Äôs \\"core author.\\" The other criticizes Azerbaijan International's interpretation of the book as having derived from Chamanzaminli himself. The Azerbaijani novelist and literary critic Chingiz Huseynov (or Guseinov), who teaches at Moscow State University, cautioned in 2004 against being \\"driven by 'ethno-emotions' that may compel us to tie this piece to Azerbaijani literature at any cost.\\" Renowned Azerbaijani poet, mathematician, and founder of Baku‚Äôs Khazar University Hamlet Isakhanli oglu Isayev has also spoken out against nationalistic motivations in the campaign for Chamanzaminli's authorship. \\"I think that appealing to the Azerbaijanis' sense of national pride by trying to prove that Chamanzaminli wrote the novel is counterproductive. ... As an Azerbaijani I don‚Äôt feel any more proud because an ethnic Azeri supposedly wrote the novel.\\" Another commentator is Alison Mandaville, a professor of literature at California State University, Fresno who has translated fiction from Azerbaijani to English and has published extensively on Azerbaijani literature and culture. Alison Mandaville's articles on Azerbaijani literature and culture include \\"Mullahs to Donkeys: Cartooning in Azerbaijan.\\"Over any obstacle: a conversation with Azerbaijani Writer Afaq Masud,\\" World Literature Today (Sept. 1, 2009): 14‚Äì17\\"Working Around Words: Rauf Talishinsky's Azerbaijani Web Cartoons,\\" International Journal of Comic Art 11, no. 2 (2009)\\"Trading Culture: Practical Background for Azerbaijani-English Poetry Translation,\\" Khazar Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences(2011); \\"Beyond Bread and Busses: Women and Work in Azerbaijan in the 21st Century,\\" Journal of Azerbaijani Studies (2009)\\"Four Alphabets in 100 Years: State Control of Writing in Azerbaijan,\\" in Bruno De Nicola, Yonatan Mendel, and Husain Qutbuddin, eds., Reflections on Knowledge and Language in Middle Eastern Societies, 285‚Äì311 (Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Pub., 2010)Her Azerbaijani translation work includes Mandaville and Shahla Naghyieva, eds., Buta, The Baku Workshop, 2010: Contemporary Fiction and Poetry by Azerbaijani Women with additional works by American and Turkish co-participants (Baku: Sonmaz Mashal Cultural Relations Public Union, 2010) and a translation of Afaq Masud, \\"The Crash,\\" World Literature Today (September‚ÄìOctober 2009) For Mandaville, Azerbaijan International's attempt to establish Chamanzaminli's authorship of Ali and Nino reflects a narrow sense of literature as a form of \\"property\\" that detracts from the appreciation and promotion of literature itself and reflects a contemporary sense of communalist Azeri nationalism that is divorced from the multicultural nationalism reflected in the novel. \\"This controversy reads like a view of literature as property ‚Äì political, national property ‚Ä¶ as if the most important thing is not the literature itself, but who gets to 'own' it. In my opinion, Azerbaijan would be much better served by supporting and promoting literature itself, rather than getting into ‚Äòwhose‚Äô it is. For anyone that reads today, literature is global. And anyone doing research on origins of literature during the Ali and Nino period knows that nation was a highly fluid thing at that point in history.\\"  Betty Blair and Azerbaijan Internationals case for Yusif Vazir Chamanaminli's authorship  Research findings by Betty Blair and associated researchers were published in a special 2011 edition of Azerbaijan International magazine entitled Ali and Nino: The Business of Literature.Ali and Nino: The Business of Literature, Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4. (Some articles are co-credited to other authors in addition to Blair.)Blair reports that the research was conducted over a period of six years (2004‚Äì2010) and that documents were studied and analyzed in 10 languages: Azerbaijani, Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Turkish, Georgian, Persian and Swedish and materials were found in National Archives of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine. Blair points to numerous parallels between events from Chamanzaminli's life and writings and the text of Ali and Nino. She offers only a small handful of circumstantial events in Chamanzaminli's life on the basis of which she constructs a hypothetical scenario in which a manuscript by Chamanzaminli ‚Äì the existence of which is conjectural ‚Äì would somehow have been written by him, then would have been acquired by the Viennese publisher, E.P. Tal. Somehow Lev Nussimbaum would have been given this hypothetical manuscript and would have \\"embellished\\" it before its publication. =Blair's hypotheses on a Chamanzaminli manuscript= Betty Blair, in Azerbaijan International, has asserted that \\"there are too many links between Chamanzaminli and Ali and Nino to explain as being merely circumstantial. Irrefutable evidence points directly to Chamanzaminli as the core writer.\\" However she has not shown any paper trail of documentary sources showing that Chamanzaminli had anything to do with Ali and Nino, nor demonstrated any link between any Chamanzaminli manuscript (either what she hypothetically refers to as \\"the core manuscript\\" or any other manuscript known to be authored by Chamanzaminli) and the publication of Ali and Nino. She links Chamanzaminli to Ali and Nino through textual parallels, relying on proposed textual parallels between Chamanzaminli's life and writings and the novel's content as \\"irrefutable evidence.\\" Blair attempts to offer outlines of the way in which a transmission from Chamanzamini to Tal and Nussimbaum might have taken place. She proposes two hypothetical scenarios. She bases these scenarios on reported and speculative actions and movements made by Chamanzaminli and some claims made about Lev Nussimbaum, as well as on statements that have been retracted or which Blair notes as unreliable, or which falls under the \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\" doctrine because it was obtained under interrogation. In her first hypothetical scenario, Blair asserts that Chamanzaminli's presence in Europe in the early- to mid-1920s makes his authorship theoretically possible. Chamanzaminli lived in Paris in the years 1923 to 1926. It is possible, Blair asserts, that he sold or left a manuscript in Europe, which Nussimbaum would have later altered to produce the present text. Chamanzaminli had reason to do so, she argues, because he had a need for income and because of the wisdom of not being in possession of any anti-Bolshevik writings upon his entry into the Soviet Union in 1926. She posits that Chamanzaminli \\"did stop in Berlin in 1926\\", citing a statement Chamanzaminli made under interrogation to a Soviet police agency and asserting, based on this source, that \\"we know for certain\\" that he visited Berlin. In 1926 however, Nussimbaum \\"would have just been starting his writing career with Die literarische Welt\\" and \\"we have no record that they ever met directly together.\\" Blair provides no evidence that Chamanzaminli and Nussimbaum ever met at all or had any one-to-one connection.Betty Blair, \\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of Ali and Nino\\", Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4, pp. 52‚Äì137, \\"Frequently Asked Question\\" number 21 and endnote 36, citing Azerbaijan National Security Ministry Archives, No. PR-16870 (Former KGB Files) Considering the Berlin connection too remote, Blair proposes a Vienna connection. There is no evidence that Chamanzaminli ever visited Vienna, but Blair's speculates that the writer \\"would have\\" traveled by train to Istanbul on his return to Baku in 1926 and \\"could have\\" gone to that city on his way, \\"to visit Tal at his publishing company.\\" Blair implies hypothetically that a manuscript \\"would have\\" passed from Chamanzaminli's hands into Tal's possession at that moment. Blair purports that this stop in Vienna is possible because Chamanzaminli \\"would have\\" taken the Orient Express (which passed through Vienna) because it was \\"the most famous train route of its day.\\"Betty Blair, \\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of Ali and Nino\\", Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4, pp. 52‚Äì137, \\"Frequently Asked Question\\" number 21 and sidebar. Blair offers a further elaboration of this Vienna scenario based on a statement attributed to the original publisher's wife, Lucy Tal, which Tal vociferously denied ever making. Blair reports that the preface to the 1971 Turkish edition asserts that the author behind Kurban Said is Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli. The translator, Semih Yazichioghlu, writes in this preface that two Azerbaijanis living in the United States ‚Äì Mustafa Turkekul (who has said that he studied with Chamanzaminli in the 1930s) and Yusuf Gahraman (a former teacher and radiologist) read the book when the first English translation came out in 1970. The two \\"recognized\\" the novel's descriptions of \\"familiar streets, squares, mansions\\" of Baku as well as \\"the names of some of the Oil Baron families mentioned in the book.\\" They then contacted Random House, the publisher, \\"hoping to learn more about the identity of Kurban Said.\\" They assert in this foreword that Lucy Tal (the wife of E.P. Tal, the novel's original Viennese publisher) had replied: \\"It was in the 1920s (Mrs. Tal couldn't remember exactly what year it was). A handsome young man came to the publishing house and spoke with my husband [E.P. Tal] at length and then left a pile of manuscripts. I still don't know what they talked about as my husband never told me... My husband went on to publish these manuscripts in 1937.\\" Andreas Tietze translated this preface from Turkish into English on May 31, 1973, for Tal's lawyer F.A.G. Schoenberg on May 31, 1973. Tietze, perhaps the first to give credence to the Chamanzaminli theory, commented that \\"the evidence, although not conclusive, does have a certain weight, and perhaps Chamanzaminli is really identical with Kurban Said.\\" Yet within days of hearing of the quote attributed to her, Lucy Tal unequivocally denied having written the statement. In a letter to Schoenberg on June 2, 1973, Tal wrote: \\"Having read that document, I am quite startled. Never did I write such a letter to any Turks or anybody else. Why and what for? And it would have been so entirely unlike me. Such monstrous claims, how can one disprove them???\\" Tal und Co. published at least 15 books in Vienna in 1937 in addition to Ali und Nino. Blair's second hypothetical scenario involves a transmission in Istanbul, Turkey rather than Berlin, Germany or Vienna, Austria. Blair cites a claim by Giamil Ahmad Vacca-Mazzara, an associate of Lev Nussimbaum's in his final years in Positano, Italy that \\"Essad Bey\\" (Vacca-Mazzara denied that this name was a pseudonym for Lev Nussimbaum) wrote Ali and Nino in Istanbul based on Vacca-Mazzara's own story, and that Vacca-Mazzara was himself \\"Kurban Said,\\" which he claims was Nussimbaum's nickname for him. Blair notes that Vacca-Mazzara \\"cannot be relied upon as a credible witness,\\" but nonetheless hopes that \\"there may be some hints of truth to some parts of his story.\\" Blair asserts that a passage in Chamanzaminli's writing represents \\"a paper trail\\" demonstrating that Chamanzamanli \\"spent considerable time in three libraries in old Istanbul while living there (1920‚Äì1923) after his appointment as Azerbaijan's ambassador was terminated with the takeover of Bolshevik government in Baku.\\" Beyond Chamanzamanli's mere presence in Istanbul, moreover, \\"he even wrote that he had left some of his works in those libraries.\\" Blair's \\"paper trail\\" consists of the following statement from Chamanzaminli's writings: \\"We gave some documents to the Qatanov [Katanov] Library of Suleymaniye in Istanbul. They are related to the last period of Azerbaijan's Independence, a two-year collection of the newspaper Azerbaijan in Russian, The News of Azerbaijan Republic Government, along with magazines and books about our national economy, and documents describing Armenian-Muslim conflict in Caucasia.\\" The quote does not state that the donations in question were authored by Chamanzaminli, nor that they included fiction or any unpublished writings.Betty Blair, \\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of Ali and Nino\\", Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4, pp. 52‚Äì137, \\"Frequently Asked Question\\" number 29 and endnotes 54 and 55. Blair offers the two hypothetical scenarios, rather than a documentary paper trail, as a theory of how something conjecturally written by Chamanzaminli would have been published in an altered form as Ali and Nino in 1937. Lacking any evidence of a material connection, Blair offers instead an accumulation of parallels. =Parallels Blair draws between Chamanzaminli and Ali and Nino= Referring to parallels between passages in Chamanzaminli's writings and evidence from his life events, Blair asserts that Chamanzaminli is the \\"core author\\" of the novel Ali and Nino. Blair's \\"core author\\" argument is based on a list of 101 correlations found by comparing aspects of Chamanzaminli's and writings as well as evidence about his life experiences and his works including his diaries, articles, short stories and novels.\\"101 Reasons why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of Ali and Nino\\", in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2‚Äì4, pp. 262‚Äì333. Chamanzaminli's papers are held in the Chamanzaminli Fund at the Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan, Baku. Blair asserts that in the writings that Nussimbaum published as Essad Bey, he shows himself to have a negative attitude toward Azerbaijan, that when he left he was \\"thrilled to have closed that chapter of his life.\\" He is \\"seemingly untouched emotionally\\" by Azerbaijan's loss of independence. In contrast, Ali and Nino portrays the country's conquest by the USSR in 1920 as an agonizing tragedy. Blair writes: However, in a scene reminiscent of that same Blood and Oil in the Orient quotation, in chapter 22 of Ali and Nino, Ali tells his father, \\"Asia is dead...\\" To which Ali's father replies, \\"Asia is not dead. Its borders only have changed, changed forever. Baku is now Europe. And that is not just a coincidence. There were no Asiatics left in Baku any longer.\\" The working title of Ali and Nino, according to the 1937 contract between Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels von Bodmerschof and the Tal publishing company, was The Dying Orient.; described also by Leela Ehrenfels in the film Alias Kurban Said. Blair relies on an accumulation of evidence employed to suggest that Lev Nussimbaum, who wrote as Essad Bey, could not have written Ali and Nino by himself. She acknowledges that Nussimbaum left \\"fingerprints\\" on the book, but asserts that his contribution is limited to folkloric and legendary material, some of which he copied from his earlier books, which she shows is often neither culturally or ethnically reliable. (Much of this echoes Tom Reiss's account of Nussimbaum's writing.) Blair asserts that Nussimbaum could not have acquired the knowledge of Azerbaijan evident in Ali and Nino during his time in Baku, which ended when he was 14 years old, and during which time he had limited contact with Azerbaijani life. Therefore, in her view, he could not have written significant portions of the novel. She claims that Nussimbaum did not sympathize with the Azerbaijani national cause embodied in the novel and that he wrote his books, she judges, too quickly to have written them by himself. Therefore, she hypothesizes, he must have \\"gained access to the\\" (hypothetical) \\"original manuscripts\\" and \\"embellished them.\\" She posits that the novel has a self-contradictory quality that can be explained through the hypothesis that it was based on something Chamanzaminli wrote but that it had been altered by Nussimbaum.Betty Blair, \\"Essad Bey as Core Author of Ali and Nino: Seven Reasons Why It Just Ain't So,\\" \\"Folklore: What Essad Bey Didn‚Äôt Know. Portrait of the Caucasus,\\" and \\"'Cut and Paste' Author: Essad Bey‚Äôs Fingerprints in Ali & Nino,\\" Azerbaijan International 15, no. 2‚Äì4. pp. 180‚Äì251. =Criticisms of Blair's argumentation= Azerbaijani journalist Nikki Kazimova has reported that \\"most of the evidence of Chemenzeminli‚Äôs authorship is suggestive rather than factual, and plenty of AI‚Äôs arguments are a ‚Äòproof by contradiction.‚Äô\\" Some scholars of Azerbaijani literature and culture, after being exposed to Blair's arguments, continue to express doubts about the possibility that Chamanzaminli is the novel‚Äôs author. Hamlet Isakhanli oglu Isayev, who chaired a December 2010 meeting in which Blair presented her findings, remarked that the findings \\"left many questions unanswered.\\" Others have offered more specific criticisms. Leah Feldman, the 2010 recipient of the Heydar Aliyev award for scholarship on Azerbaijan, presented by the Consulate General of Azerbaijan and a research associate at Princeton University‚Äôs Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies, who studies Orientalism and Azerbaijani literature,\\"Contributors,\\" boundary 2 39, no. 2 (2012), 213‚Äì214; DOI 10.1215/01903659-1597961 attended one of Blair‚Äôs presentations at the Writers' Union in Baku in December 2010. Feldman has characterized Betty Blair's approach as based on a \\"theory of authorship as autobiography,\\" explaining that \\"Blair‚Äôs argument indicates that what she calls the 'core author' of Ali and Nino is not the man who penned the text (Essad Bey/Lev Nussimbaum) but rather the individual whose life and ideas are most readily expressed by the protagonists.\\" Feldman's assessment of the novel leans toward Nussimbaum as author. \\"To me,\\" she has written, \\"the novel read as an Orientalist piece.\\" As an \\"Orientalist\\" novel, it would represent a primarily European point of view regarding Azerbaijan. Mandaville's assessment of Ali and Nino also favors Nussimbaum's authorship. Referring to the fact that Nussimbaum was of the Azerbaijani Jewish minority while Chamanzaminli was part of the Muslim majority, Mandaville writes that \\"the most interesting thing about the novel is the intense love/hate super-nostalgic relationship expressed for the region ‚Äì exactly the kind of thing a person who was a (minority) child in an area they are now exiled from would write.\\" =The case for Baron and Baroness Ehrenfels's authorship= Austrian Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels (1894‚Äì1982) registered the novel Ali and Nino with German authorities, and her niece Leela Ehrenfels (in association with the Baron Omar Rolf von Ehrenfel's second wife, the Baroness Mireille Ehrenfels-Abeille) has claimed that the pseudonym Kurban Said belonged to her aunt Elfriede, and that she wrote both Kurban Said novels, Ali and Nino and The Girl from the Golden Horn.See Leela Ehrenfel's statements in the film Alias Kurban Said. No one has offered any robust contextual comparison between Ali and Nino and other known writings by Elfriede Ehrenfels, but Leela Ehrenfels has noted several coincidences between her aunt's and father's lives and writings that suggest their, or at least Elfriede's, authorship of the novel. One is that the April 20, 1937, working title of the novel was The Dying Orient, and her father and aunt (the Baron and Baroness Ehrenfels) had previously written an article together entitled \\"The Dying Istanbul.\\" Another is that the Ehrenfels made a film entitled The Great Longing, which is \\"about a man who is disappointed with the world. And he is looking for true love or truth.\\" (The unspoken implication may be that this is similar to Ali and Nino.) Third, Baron Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels set up the \\"Orient Bund\\" for Muslim students in Berlin \\"in order to bring Europeans and Muslims closer together.\\" Leela Ehrenfels and Mireille Ehrenfels-Abeille have also said it is possible that Elfriede had an affair with Lev Nussimbaum. Fourth, according to the April 20, 1937, contract with E.P. Tal & Co., Baroness Elfriede was the author behind the pseudonym Kurban Said, and Leela has said, \\"that makes it obvious to me that she wrote both books.

Yes, I produced it.\\" The word \\"produced\\" is left ambiguous.  Editions  = 1944 Italian edition = An Italian edition using the title Ali Khan appeared in 1944 with the author listed as M[ohammed] Essad Bey, Nussimbaum's pen name. In this edition, Nino Kipiani is called \\"Erika Kipiani\\" (obviously not a true Georgian name). The name of Nussimbaum's wife was \\"Erika\\", but she had run off with his colleague, Ren√© F√ºl√∂p-Miller, in a scandalous divorce (1935). Other changes were made in this edition as well. This Italian edition was published posthumously under suspicious conditions by Essad Bey's friend Vacca Bello, who called himself \\"Ahmed Giamil Vacca- Mazzara\\". He tried to show that he was related to Essad Bey four generations back and, thus, Essad Bey's only living descendant, and therefore in line to inherit Essad Bey's royalties from his various books.

Set Details Pirates of the Crimson Coast had 130 total pieces, and its expansion symbol was a compass. It was the first set to introduce Forts and the Schooner ship type, and also the first to include French ships, with 19 ships as well as a fort and various crew. There was a single Super Rare piece in the set, the Roanoke, a preview of the American faction from the following set, Pirates of the Revolution. Notable Ships *Roanoke - America, 5-mast, 13 points. This ship is Super Rare and the only American ship in the set. It is relatively slow, and has average cannons, but can handle both Pirate and American crew, making it a flexible choice of ship. *La Ville de Paris - France, 5-mast, 16 points. A giant French ship that moves slowly but has very good cannons. This ship, with a Helmsman crew and a Firepot Specialist is an extremely fierce ship with accurate cannons and a lot of them. *El Neptuno - Spain, 5-mast, 12 points. This ship is fast and long-ranged in cannons. With a possibility for an attack range of 2L, this ship can hit an enemy before it can hit back. Though the accuracy is not good, having 5 cannons increases the chance of a hit. *HMS Swiftsure - England, 1-mast, 10 points. This ship is fast and accurate. With some cannons never being able to hit it, this ship can severely damage ships without taking a hit if the opposing ship has only long range cannons. Outfitted with a captain, this ship could strike a ship with a total range of L+L+S and the best accuracy any ship naturally has in the game. *Raven - Pirate, 2-mast, 10 points. The Raven is fast (S+S+S) with a generous hold (4 cargo). Usually deployed as a treasurer runner with a helmsman and explorer, the enemy is hard pressed to catch her at S+S+S+S before she grabs treasure and heads home. Should the enemy get too close, her double 2S cannons will certainly make the opposing ship remember the engagement. *Le Dauphin Royal - French, 5 mast, 14 points. The Le Dauphin Royal goes one L, had 5 cargo, and relatively accurate cannons. It gains 1+ to its cannon rolls against English ships. This ability makes it a very powerful ship against the English fleet. Notable Crew *Pirate - Havana Blackman (SAC Captain), Hag of Tortuga (0LR +5 fleet points), Jonah (0pts, crew cost 0 on this ship) *English - Administrator Scott Bratley (0LR +5 fleet points) *Spanish - Contessa Anita Amore (0LR +5 fleet points) *French - Vicomte Jules de Cissey (0LR +5 fleet points), Capitaine Arathiel (SAC Captain) Crimson Coast ","title":"Pirates of the Crimson Coast"},{"id":"4885031","text":"The Pr√ºfer -group with presentation , illustrated as a subgroup of the unit circle in the complex plane In mathematics, specifically in group theory, the Pr√ºfer p-group or the p-quasicyclic group or p‚àû-group, Z(p‚àû), for a prime number p is the unique p-group in which every element has p different p-th roots. The Pr√ºfer p-groups are countable abelian groups that are important in the classification of infinite abelian groups: they (along with the group of rational numbers) form the smallest building blocks of all divisible groups. The groups are named after Heinz Pr√ºfer, a German mathematician of the early 20th century. Constructions of Z(p‚àû) The Pr√ºfer p-group may be identified with the subgroup of the circle group, U(1), consisting of all pn-th roots of unity as n ranges over all non-negative integers: :\\\\mathbf{Z}(p^\\\\infty)=\\\\\\\\{\\\\exp(2\\\\pi i m/p^n) \\\\mid 0 \\\\leq m < p^n,\\\\,n\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}^+\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{z\\\\in\\\\mathbf{C} \\\\mid z^{(p^n)}=1 \\\\text{ for some } n\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}^+\\\\\\\\}.\\\\; The group operation here is the multiplication of complex numbers. There is a presentation :\\\\mathbf{Z}(p^\\\\infty) = \\\\langle\\\\, g_1, g_2, g_3, \\\\ldots \\\\mid g_1^p = 1, g_2^p = g_1, g_3^p = g_2, \\\\dots\\\\,\\\\rangle. Here, the group operation in Z(p‚àû) is written as multiplication. Alternatively and equivalently, the Pr√ºfer p-group may be defined as the Sylow p-subgroup of the quotient group Q/Z, consisting of those elements whose order is a power of p: :\\\\mathbf{Z}(p^\\\\infty) = \\\\mathbf{Z}[1/p]/\\\\mathbf{Z} (where Z[1/p] denotes the group of all rational numbers whose denominator is a power of p, using addition of rational numbers as group operation). For each natural number n, consider the quotient group Z/pnZ and the embedding Z/pnZ ‚Üí Z/pn+1Z induced by multiplication by p. The direct limit of this system is Z(p‚àû): :\\\\mathbf{Z}(p^\\\\infty) = \\\\varinjlim \\\\mathbf{Z}/p^n \\\\mathbf{Z} . We can also write :\\\\mathbf{Z}(p^\\\\infty)=\\\\mathbf{Q}_p/\\\\mathbf{Z}_p where Qp denotes the additive group of p-adic numbers and Zp is the subgroup of p-adic integers. Properties The complete list of subgroups of the Pr√ºfer p-group Z(p‚àû) = Z[1/p]/Z is: :0 \\\\subsetneq \\\\left({1 \\\\over p}\\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\right)/\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\subsetneq \\\\left({1 \\\\over p^2}\\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\right)/\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\subsetneq \\\\left({1 \\\\over p^3}\\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\right)/\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\subsetneq \\\\cdots \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathbf{Z}(p^\\\\infty) (Here \\\\left({1 \\\\over p^n}\\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\right)/\\\\mathbf{Z} is a cyclic subgroup of Z(p‚àû) with pn elements; it contains precisely those elements of Z(p‚àû) whose order divides pn and corresponds to the set of pn-th roots of unity.) The Pr√ºfer p-groups are the only infinite groups whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion. This sequence of inclusions expresses the Pr√ºfer p-group as the direct limit of its finite subgroups. As there is no maximal subgroup of a Pr√ºfer p-group, it is its own Frattini subgroup. Given this list of subgroups, it is clear that the Pr√ºfer p-groups are indecomposable (cannot be written as a direct sum of proper subgroups). More is true: the Pr√ºfer p-groups are subdirectly irreducible. An abelian group is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a finite cyclic p-group or to a Pr√ºfer group. The Pr√ºfer p-group is the unique infinite p-group that is locally cyclic (every finite set of elements generates a cyclic group). As seen above, all proper subgroups of Z(p‚àû) are finite. The Pr√ºfer p-groups are the only infinite abelian groups with this property.See Vil'yams (2001) The Pr√ºfer p-groups are divisible. They play an important role in the classification of divisible groups; along with the rational numbers they are the simplest divisible groups. More precisely: an abelian group is divisible if and only if it is the direct sum of a (possibly infinite) number of copies of Q and (possibly infinite) numbers of copies of Z(p‚àû) for every prime p. The (cardinal) numbers of copies of Q and Z(p‚àû) that are used in this direct sum determine the divisible group up to isomorphism.See Kaplansky (1965) As an abelian group (that is, as a Z-module), Z(p‚àû) is Artinian but not Noetherian.See also Jacobson (2009), p. 102, ex. 2. It can thus be used as a counterexample against the idea that every Artinian module is Noetherian (whereas every Artinian ring is Noetherian). The endomorphism ring of Z(p‚àû) is isomorphic to the ring of p-adic integers Zp.See Vil'yams (2001) In the theory of locally compact topological groups the Pr√ºfer p-group (endowed with the discrete topology) is the Pontryagin dual of the compact group of p-adic integers, and the group of p-adic integers is the Pontryagin dual of the Pr√ºfer p-group.D. L. Armacost and W. L. Armacost,\\"On p-thetic groups\\", Pacific J. Math., 41, no. 2 (1972), 295‚Äì301 The Pr√ºfer group as a ring As both the integers \\\\mathbb{Z} and the p-adic rationals \\\\mathbb{Z}[1/p] are rings in addition to groups, the quotient ring \\\\mathbb{Z}(p^\\\\infty) = \\\\mathbb{Z}[1/p]/\\\\mathbb{Z} is the Pr√ºfer p-group with a ring structure, or the Pr√ºfer p-ring. Equivalently, \\\\mathbb{Z}(p^\\\\infty) could also be defined as the direct limit of the system of rings \\\\varinjlim \\\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\\\mathbb{Z}, where the homomorphisms \\\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{Z}/p^{n+1}\\\\mathbb{Z} are induced by multiplication by p. This second definition allows a positional numeral system representation of the circle ring in base p. The product ring of \\\\mathbb{Z}(p^\\\\infty) and the integers \\\\mathbb{Z} yields the ring of p-adic rationals \\\\mathbb{Z}[1/p], while the product ring of \\\\mathbb{Z}(p^\\\\infty) and the p-adic integers \\\\mathbb{Z}_p yields the p-adic numbers \\\\mathbb{Q}_p. The group G=\\\\mathbb{Z}(p^\\\\infty) cannot be given a non-trivial ring structure. To see this, assume the contrary. The dual of G is torsion free (by Thm 24.23 in Hewitt and Ross: Abstract Harmonic Analysis). Let h be any element of the dual, and let g be any element of G. The mapping s\\\\mapsto h(gs) from G to the circle, is an element of the dual of finite order. It is therefore zero. Since h(gs)=0 for every h in the dual, gs=0 for every g,s\\\\in G.

Sunwah ‚Äì PearL Linux established the (SWP) Sunwah ‚Äì PearL Linux Training & Development Centre on the university campus in January 2001. SWP promotes open source software (OSS) technology. Evolution Since its incorporation, SWP has positioned itself as the open source technology transfer centre of its region. It developed skill transfer programs based on open source. In the early years, SWP's own developed programs were module by module based on specific applications for operating systems or programming languages. In 2005, SWP started to become more focussed on information security. Besides short training programs, SWP started to work on Higher Education (HE) programs. SWP cooperated with the University of Glamorgan and the University of Sunderland in the United Kingdom, to offer programs in Hong Kong. SWP and the University of Glamorgan cooperate to offer postgraduate education in computer forensics, forensic accounting and information security. SWP and the University of Sunderland cooperate to offer BA (Hons) Top-up Graphic Design program in Hong Kong. In the summer of 2009, SWP became an accredited centre of Edexcel and NCC Education. The accreditation lets SWP offer Foundation Studies and Higher National Diploma (HND) courses. Difficult times * In 2003, SARS attacked the region and training activity stopped. Positioned as a skill transfer centre, the major revenue source is delivering skill transfer training classes. This put SWP in a financial crisis. * Linux and OSS business has proven challenging. The revenue model was not based on grants, while pure Linux and OSS business might not generate enough revenue to keep SWP going. SWP had to rethink a way to survive, or its own generated funding would be ended by mid-2004. Skill transfer training courses Since its establishment in January 2001, SWP has been working with the open source community on developing skill transfer training. SWP has developed courses on operating systems including Linux and BSD Unix, and on programming including PHP, Java, MySQL database, Ajax, XML, JavaScript, and Extreme programming. OSS events SWP has conducted technical seminars on open source technology. Some open source leaders like Zeev Suraski, Jeremy Allison, Andrew Tridgell, Jon Hall, and others were guest speakers at its seminars. SWP organized the first Software Freedom Day in Hong Kong in 2007. Community links SWP has contributed to international and local open communities. Some of them include the International Information and Communication Technology Council Certification Program, The Hong Kong Linux User Group, The Opensource Application Knowledge Association, The Linux Professional Institute Certification Program, The Hong Kong Samba Association, and Software Freedom Day. The team Board of Directors: * Dr. Lui Sun Wing * Professor Jonathan Choi * Mr. Andrew Young * Mr. Alwin Wong * Professor Keith Chan * Mr. Alex Banh * Mr. Daniel Lee * Mr. Albert Chung Many members of the operational team come from the local OSS community.

Two clasps were instituted and could be worn on the medal ribbon, Air Crew Europe and France and Germany. The Second World War Stars On 8 July 1943, the Star (later named the Star) and the Africa Star became the first two campaign stars instituted by the United Kingdom, and by May 1945 a total of eight stars and nine clasps had been established to reward campaign service during the Second World War. One more campaign star, the Arctic Star, and one more clasp, the Bomber Command Clasp, were belatedly added on 26 February 2013, more than sixty-seven years after the end of the war.Stephen Stratford Medals site: British Military & Criminal History, 1900 to 1999. 1939‚Äì45 Star (Access date 1 April 2015)War Service (Decorations) ‚Äì Statement in the House of Commons by Winston Churchill on 3 August 1943 (HC Deb 03 August 1943 vol 391 cc2091-3) (Access date 9 April 2015)The National Archives ‚Äì Ministry of Defence ‚Äì Arctic Star and Bomber Command Clasp (Access date 1 April 2015) Including the Arctic Star and the Bomber Command clasp, no-one could be awarded more than six campaign stars, with five of the ten clasps denoting service that would have qualified for a second star.

Since only the first of the Atlantic Star, Air Crew Europe Star and France and Germany Star to be earned could be awarded to any one individual, the possible Star and Clasp combinations for these three campaign stars are: * The Atlantic Star with either the Air Crew Europe Clasp or the France and Germany Clasp. * The Air Crew Europe Star with either the France and Germany Clasp or the Atlantic Clasp. * The France and Germany Star with the Atlantic Clasp. As a result of the different date ranges involved, the earlier period Air Crew Europe Clasp could not be added to the later period France and Germany Star. Institution The Battle of the Atlantic took place between 3 September 1939 and 8 May 1945, as German U-boats attacked convoys transporting vital supplies from America and the Colonies to Britain. Warships of the Royal Navy and aircraft of the Royal Air Force escorted these convoys, hunted the U-boats and, despite some notable successes by the U-boats, eventually won a comprehensive victory in the Atlantic. The Atlantic Star was instituted in May 1945 to honour those who took part in the Battle of the Atlantic and was intended primarily for award to those who served in shipping convoys and their escorts and anti-submarine forces, as well as to those who served on fast merchant ships which sailed alone.NZDF Medals site New Zealand Defence Force - British Commonwealth War And Campaign Medals Awarded To New Zealanders - The Atlantic Star (Access date 4 April 2015) Two clasps were instituted to be worn on the Atlantic Star's ribbon, 'Air Crew Europe' and 'France and Germany'. British uniform regulations stipulated that no one person could be awarded more than one clasp to any one campaign star, and as neither the Air Crew Europe Star nor the France and Germany Star could be awarded to a recipient of the Atlantic Star, any subsequent entitlement to either of these two stars was denoted by the appropriate clasp to the Atlantic Star, with only the first clasp earned being worn. Award criteria =Broad criteria= The qualifying areas for the award of the Atlantic Star were the Atlantic and Home Waters excluding the Mediterranean, the south Atlantic between the longitude of Cape Horn and longitude 20¬∞ East (South Africa), and the convoy routes to ports in North Russia. The Atlantic Star was awarded for six months service afloat in the Atlantic or in Home Waters within the period from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945. It was also awarded to air crew who had taken part in operations against the enemy at sea within the qualifying areas, subject to having served for two months in an operational unit. The 1939‚Äì1945 Star must have already been earned by six months service, or two months for air crew, before commencing qualifying service for the Atlantic Star.GOV.UK - Defence and armed forces ‚Äì guidance - Medals: campaigns, descriptions and eligibility - Atlantic Star (Access date 3 April 2015)Veterans Affairs Canada - Atlantic Star (Access date 4 April 2015) Merchant seaman also qualified for the award of the medal, also on condition that the 1939‚Äì1945 Star must have already been earned. They were required to have served in the Atlantic, Home Waters, North Russia Convoys or the south Atlantic.The National Archives - Merchant seamen's campaign medal records 1939-1945 (Access date 2 April 2015) =Special criteria= The award of a gallantry medal or Mention in Dispatches for action while serving in the qualifying areas, qualified the recipient for the award of the Atlantic Star, regardless of service duration. Personnel whose required service period was terminated prematurely by death, disability or wounds due to service were also awarded the Star regardless of service duration.Joslin, Litherland, and Simpkin (eds), British Battles and Medals, (1988), Spink. Certain special conditions applied governing the award to those Naval personnel who entered operational service less than six months before the end of the War, with them receiving for the Atlantic Star provided this was their last operational theatre of the war. Description The set of nine campaign stars was designed by the Royal Mint engravers. The stars all have a ring suspender which passes through an eyelet formed above the uppermost point of the star. They are six‚Äìpointed stars, struck in yellow copper zinc alloy to fit into a 44 millimetres diameter circle, with a maximum width of 38 millimetres and 50 millimetres high from the bottom point of the star to the top of the eyelet.Returned Services Association - Military Medals - The Atlantic Star (Access date 11 October 2018) ;Obverse The obverse has a central design of the Royal Cypher \\"GRI VI\\", surmounted by a crown.

They are inscribed \\"AIR CREW EUROPE\\" and \\"FRANCE AND GERMANY\\" respectively and were designed to be sewn onto the medal's ribbon. Regulations only allow one clasp, the first earned, to be worn with the Star. When the ribbon is worn alone, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon bar to denote the award of a clasp. ;Ribbon The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with shaded and watered bands of blue, white and sea-green, with the colours representing the colours of the Atlantic Ocean. The ribbons for this medal and the Defence Medal as well as those of the other Second World War campaign stars, with the exception of the Arctic Star, were devised by King George VI. Order of wear The order of wear of the Second World War campaign stars was determined by their respective campaign start dates and by the campaign's duration. This is the order worn, even when a recipient qualified for them in a different order. The Defence Medal and War Medal are worn after the stars. The Canadian Volunteer Service Medal is worn after the Defence Medal and before the War Medal, with other Commonwealth war medals worn after the War Medal. * The 1939‚Äì1945 Star, from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, the full duration of the Second World War. * The Atlantic Star from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Battle of the Atlantic and the War in Europe. * The Arctic Star, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Arctic Convoys and the War in Europe. * The Air Crew Europe Star, from 3 September 1939 to 5 June 1944, the period until D-Day minus one. * The Africa Star, from 10 June 1940 to 12 May 1943, the duration of the North African Campaign. * The Pacific Star, from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Pacific War. * The Burma Star, from 11 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Burma Campaign. * The Italy Star, from 11 June 1943 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Italian Campaign. * The France and Germany Star, from 6 June 1944 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Northwest Europe Campaign. * The Defence Medal, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945 (2 September 1945 for those serving in the Far East and the Pacific), the duration of the Second World War.New Zealand Defence Force - The Defence Medal Eligibility Rules (Access date 21 April 2015) * The War Medal, from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, the full duration of the Second World War.New Zealand Defence Force - The War Medal 1939-45 Eligibility Rules (Access date 22 April 2015) The Air Crew Europe Star is therefore worn as shown: 1939‚Äì1945 Star Atlantic Star Arctic Star * Preceded by the 1939‚Äì1945 Star. * Succeeded by the Arctic Star.

It issues postage stamps and postal stationery, denominated in United States dollars for the office in New York, in Swiss francs for the office in Geneva and in euros (formerly schillings) for the office in Vienna. As such, UNPA is the only postal authority that issues stamps in three different currencies. The Administration has a dual mandate: first, to disseminate information on the activities and achievements of the United Nations system through the medium of postage stamps, and second, to generate revenue for the organization. Usage and limitation United Nations stamps, in the appropriate currency, are only valid for postage when used on mail at certain United Nations offices. The three facilities that accept these stamps are the UNPA offices at: United Nations Headquarters, the Palais des Nations and Vienna International Centre. On 4 September 2007, the UNPA posted on its Web page new rules limiting the mailings it will accept. Express mail and Priority Mail are no longer available to the public, and mailings from the public are limited to 100 pieces. The UNPA stated that the reason for this is that it was not established to provide all postal services, and that its primary function was to issue stamps for philatelic purposes. History =Beginnings= The idea for the United Nations to issue stamps was first proposed in 1947 by the delegation of Argentina. The head of the delegation, Jos√© Arce, who was also President of the United Nations General Assembly, was himself a philatelist and wanted the United Nations to start issue stamps. Arce thought that the stamps would serve three primary purposes for United Nations: # The ability to issue postage stamps, a privilege formerly reserved solely for sovereign states, would lend the United Nations authority. # The sale of these stamps would serve as an excellent source of revenue for the United Nations. # The stamps would serve as global ambassadors for the United Nations, spreading its messages, philosophies, and missions across the world. On 20 November 1947, the General Assembly passed a resolution asking the Secretary-General to make inquiries into the possible creation of a United Nations postal service. This was followed by additional resolutions in 1948 and 1949 asking the Secretary-General to continue arrangements for the establishment of a postal service. Finally, on 16 November 1950, the General Assembly formally created the Postal Administration and asked the Secretary- General to appoint a committee to design the first United Nations stamps. An agreement was signed on 28 March 1951 between the United Nations and the United States Post Office Department which stipulated that the United Nations could start issuing postage stamps with two main provisions. First, that any stamps produced had to be denominated in United States dollars. Second, that these stamps could only be used at United Nations Headquarters. The Postal Service was formally inaugurated on United Nations Day in 1951, with its first set of stamps also going on sale that day. =First stamps and collectivity= The UNPA issued its first stamps for the New York offices in 1951. There was intense collector interest in the early issues, and a million stamps or more were sold of many of the early commemoratives. The scarcest item from this period, although still quite affordable, is the UN 10th anniversary souvenir sheet, Scott #38, of which 250,000 were printed. A precancel of the first 1¬Ω-cent stamp that was used on a number of mass mailings has been extensively forged. By 1957, the UNPA's commemoratives regularly sold out, though they might take several months to do so. Faced with this success, officials increased print runs from the usual million stamps to as many as five million. Surprisingly, sales increased tremendously, and sales of each commemorative stamp remained in the 1.5 to 3 million range through the 1970s. In 1967, the UNPA issued five stamps in Canadian dollar denominations for use at the United Nations pavilion at Expo 1967 in Montreal, Quebec. They became invalid when Expo 1967 closed. In 1968, the UNPA made an agreement with Swiss postal authorities, and on 4 October 1969http://www.sandafayre.com/atlas/unswitz.htm began to issue stamps in franc denominations for use at the Geneva offices. A 1979 agreement with Austria led to similar stamps for Vienna.http://unstamps.un.org/UNPACommerce/en/display_info.jsp?id=200005 There was a resurgence of interest in UN stamps in the 1970s, which may have peaked with the almost immediate sellout of the panes of 20 issued for the UNPA's 25th anniversary--three of the four denominations sold out on the date of issue (8 October 1976); the fourth sold out within two and a half months. A similar issue, in 1979, for the International Year of the Child sold out on the day of issue. The story made the front page of The New York Times. In 1980, the first of an annual series depicting members' national flags sold nearly 3.5 million of each individual stamp. =Controversy= The controversial 1981 United Nations stamp focusing on the \\"Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People\\". In 1981, interest began to diminish after controversy erupted concerning the UNPA's issuance of stamps for the \\"Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People\\". The proposal for issuance, and the issuance itself, was extensively and critically covered by The New York Times and by Linn's Stamp News. The fifteen cent denomination became the first UNPA stamp since 1954 to sell fewer than a million copies when more than a million were printed. By 1983, many more stamps were selling fewer than a million copies, though sales of Vienna stamps remained strong. In 1986, the souvenir sheet for the World Federation of United Nations Associations became the first issue to sell fewer than a half-million copies where at least that many were printed in UNPA history. =Reviving collector interest= In an effort to increase sales, the UNPA used a combination of smaller printings of stamp issuances, aggressive marketing, and having famous artists create stamp designs. Still, stamp sales have never recovered to previous levels and today print runs are on the order of 400,000 stamps. Due to these lower printing quantities, the stamps from the late 1990s and 2000s are harder to find on the discount postage market. Although it is rare, some issues have sold out. The most notable of regularly issued UN stamps is the 2005 General Assembly 60th Anniversary Souvenir Sheet, of the one dollar denomination, which is currently being sold by stamp dealers for more than 10 times its original face value. =Personalized sheets= In 2003, the UN Postal Administration began issuing \\"personalized\\" sheets for New York. These sheets have ten or twenty stamps and a large decorative border, with a tab to the right of each stamp. Visitors to the UN Building in New York can go to a kiosk where a personal picture can be printed onto a sheet with blank tabs. Most \\"personalized\\" sheets are produced for stamp shows and specific UN events with related designs already printed on the tabs. Truly personalized sheets rarely reach the secondary market. The UN Post Offices in Geneva and Vienna began offering this type of sheet in 2009. Two sheets were produced in 2007 and two in 2008 denominated in Euros. The editors of the Scott Catalog question whether they were ever actually sold at the UN Post Office in Vienna, a primary criterion for recognizing them as a legitimate postal issue. The Scott Catalog lists them as footnotes without assigned catalog numbers. The UNPA continues to issue stamps, including personalized stamps. It is responsible also for sorting and delivery of mail to the offices under its jurisdiction. Archive sale controversy A recent controversy concerns the 2003 purchase by one organization of the UNPA's entire postal archive, including original artwork and artist's proofs. Apparently this was to raise money for the UNPA, and it may have netted the organization about $2.5 million. However, there have been serious allegations that improper procedures approving the sale were followed. Also, resale of items at several times their initial values have apparently occurred, thus raising more questions about the entire matter. As of 2006 the issue remains under internal UN investigation.United Nations Probes Sale of Irreplaceable Stamp Archive - FoxNews.com, 26 April 2006 References Further reading * Conway, Herbert. 25 years of philatelic highlights.

Williamson (February 2, 1934 ‚Äì April 2, 2019) was an American businessman and politician who served as the mayor of Flint, Michigan from 2003 to 2009. He was married to Patsy Lou Williamson, who owns several car dealerships in the Flint area. He was chairman of The Colonel's International, Inc., which manages two raceways. Background Williamson was born and raised in Flint, Michigan. He married Patsy Lou, and together they managed a growing number of car dealerships. In 1962, Williamson was convicted for several business scams. He served three years in prison before being paroled. He bought cars with bad checks and purchased other items without paying for them. Williamson owned Brainerd International Raceway and Colonel's. He merged them into The Colonel's International, Inc.. he sold Brainerd International Raceway to Jed & Kristi Copham in 2006.\\"Brainerd Int'l Raceway Hosts Memorial Day Carnival and Drag Races\\" Political life In 1999 Don Williamson challenged incumbent Mayor Woodrow Stanley and lost. After Stanley was recalled, Williamson was elected to his first full term in 2002, defeating former State Representative Floyd Clack. Willamson faced off against Flint Club founder and former president, Dayne Walling, in 2007, when he won reelection. =Election controversy= During his 2007 mayoral campaign, Williamson was accused of bribing citizens for votes by handing out more than $20,000 at the car dealership that his wife owns as part of a \\"Customer Appreciation Day.\\" Each person who received money also was given his campaign literature. During the 2007 campaign, Williamson claimed that the city had an $8.9 million surplus. But, after the mayoral elections, he revealed that the city had a $4 million deficit. Williamson had to fire 60 city employees: he proposed firing 60 police officers and 9 firefighters, and closing the city jail. In both elections, Williamson, a Democrat, was opposed by the state Democratic party for a variety of reasons. They disapproved of him and his wife having made substantial campaign donations to the presidential campaigns of Republican George W. Bush. They contributed the maximum amount. =Administration= The Williamson administration had reported a balanced budget for fiscal year 2005, 2006 and delivered a balanced budget for fiscal year 2007. The City of Flint received a national budget award for 2006. After he replaced the Budget Director, and the city began a downward spiral of \\"emergency spending\\", leading to the city finishing the 2007-08 fiscal year with an $8.3 million deficit, and likely staring at another multimillion- dollar deficit in 2009.\\"New Flint administration announces deficit\\", Flint Journal, February 2009 In March 2009, projections were for the deficit to exceed 14 million dollars.\\"Flint's budget deficit is $14.3 million\\", Flint Journal , March 2009, Williamson appointed Darryl Buchanan, a city councilman, as the City Administrator after his second term election. At present, the city is in a $9 million deficit, much of it due to the various lawsuits against Don Williamson. In February 2008, Williamson sued Flint city clerk Inez Brown for not convening a panel to investigate \\"her profane and threatening\\" language with an employee. During the Flint mayoral election, Williamson said that paving of hundreds of miles of roads was one of his proudest achievements as mayor. Time magazine ranked Flint the \\"most dangerous city in America\\" in a 2007 issue. The 14th Annual CQ press publication of \\"Most Dangerous Cities in America\\" ranked Flint as third. Residents and officials disputed this study. =Recall campaign= On October 2008, petitions were submitted in the city clerk's office to recall Williamson as mayor. There were enough valid signatures to proceed. Williamson's legal challenges were unsuccessful, and a recall election was scheduled for February 24, 2009. =Resignation= Williamson began making major changes in department heads. He replaced the City Administrator, Darryl Buchanan, with Michael Brown, and appointed Buchanan to the nonexistent position of deputy mayor. On February 8, 2009, Williamson announced his resignation as mayor effective Saturday, February 14, stating health reasons. Because he resigned, under Michigan law, the scheduled recall election was canceled. On February 16, 2009, city administrator Michael Brown succeeded as temporary mayor. Williamson ran for governor of Michigan in 2010. Death Williamson died on April 2, 2019 at the age of 85 due to complications from a respiratory illness.

The Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library (PCL) is the main central library of the University of Texas at Austin library system in Austin, Texas. PCL is located at 21st Street and Speedway in Austin, TX. The UT Austin campus library system holds nearly eight million volumes, ranking it as the fifth largest library among academic institutions in the United States, and the eleventh largest overall in the country. Planning and funding for the PCL were approved in 1972, a construction contract was awarded in early 1974 to Stokes Construction Company, and the facility was opened to the public in 1977. The Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library is named for two former University professors, Ervin S. Perry and Carlos E. Casta√±eda. Professor Perry was the first African American to be appointed to the academic rank of professor and Professor Casta√±eda played a central role in the early development of the Benson Latin American Collection. It has long been claimed that the Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library was designed to appear, when seen from above, in the shape of Texas. This is officially denied by the University, which stated: \\"If you look at a campus map the right way and use your imagination, it's possible to think of the outline of the library as similar to the shape of Texas. But this wasn't intentional. Officially it's called a \\"rhomboid shape,\\" and it complements the similarly designed Graduate School of Business building across the street, which was completed the same year.\\" The PCL is an example of brutalist architecture and has been recognized as Austin's best example of this architectural style.http://www.austinchronicle.com/best-of- austin/year:2014/poll:critics/category:architecture-and-lodging/1558485/ Shooting PCL was the site of a shooting on Tuesday, September 28, 2010. Police reports state that student Colton Tooley fired shots on his walk from Guadalupe Street to the library's front entrance. He ascended to the sixth floor where he took his own life in the northeast corner of the topmost floor of the library and thirty feet from the children's book section. No one else was injured, except for one sprained ankle suffered by a female student fleeing the scene. There were reports of a second gunman and authorities locked down the entire campus for several hours until they were able to determine the reports were false.http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared- gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2010/09/28/police_on_scene_of_shooting_on.html See also * Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library Map Collection References  External links  * University of Texas Libraries: Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library Category:1972 establishments in Texas Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States Category:Libraries in Austin, Texas Category:University of Texas at Austin campus Category:Library buildings completed in 1977 Category:University and college buildings completed in 1977 ","title":"Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library"},{"id":"4885152","text":"Angelburg is a community in western Marburg-Biedenkopf in northwest Middle Hesse in Germany.  Geography  = Geographical location = The community is found about 12 km south of Biedenkopf in the Gansbach valley north of the Schelder Wald (forest), whose north end consists of the Angelburg Mountain (609 m above sea level) with its television transmitter. = Neighbouring communities = The community is bounded on the north and east by Steffenberg. Bad Endbach's municipal area borders with Angelburg's constituent community of Bottenhorn, likewise in the east. In the south, Angelburg's municipal area abuts Siegbach, and in the west Eschenburg, both in the Lahn-Dill district. = Municipal divisions = The community consists of the following places: * Frechenhausen * G√∂nnern * Lixfeld  History  The community of Angelburg began its life between 1972 and 1974 within the framework of Hessian municipal reform. The community of Lixfeld has a history stretching back at least to the Middle Ages. It was mentioned in the Codex Eberhardi, a compilation by a monk in Fulda in the twelfth century, and the mention was attested to by a later document, dating from 1238. This was Lixfeld's first documentary mention. At that time, the village was also known as Lixfeld, but it has undergone several name changes over the centuries, having been known as Lykisvelt or Litzfeld, but now once again Lixfeld. Lixfeld was part of the Wittengestein landholdings. Digs on the Kirchberg have revealed that sometime in the 9th or 10th century, a castle with a tower was built in the glen overlooking the old road. Lixfeld was also one of the oldest seats of an early mediaeval court of law and enjoyed something of a heyday at that time. The local Imperial count moved into the castle and held court under a great linden tree with the local freemen. The castle's masters also forced merchants using the road down below to pay tolls. Charcoal works were set up in the forests, and in the dales, bloomeries and smithies were busy smelting and working iron. In 1238, the court was made a Zent (‚âàsoke) of the Battenberg Counts, who then sold it to the Archbishop's Estate of Mainz. As of 1246, the von Lixfelds and the D√∂rings owned the court as joint inheritors. In 1321-23, the castle was remodelled for church purposes. A \\"pastor von Lykisuelt\\" was first mentioned in 1334 and a parish church in 1358. The church was under the Deaconate of Breidenbach and was under the patronage of the von Hohenfels and D√∂ring families.  Politics  The community is a member of the intercommunal Lahn-Dill-Bergland association. = Municipal council = After the municipal election on 06 March 2016, the council's seats were distributed thus: * CDU: 7 seats * SPD: 8 seats * BGL/FWG (citizens' coalition): 8 seats = Coat of arms = The municipal arms might be described as party per fess, above in azure the Hessian lion striped argent and gules armed Or, langued gules, wearing a crown Or, below in argent three six-pointed stars gules. The lion refers to the early Hessian lordliness, and the three stars stand for the three constituent communities within Angelburg.

It includes the final screen appearance of Hattie McDaniel. This film is now in the public domain. Plot Billy Coy (Mickey Rooney) arrives in the town of Carrell, California and offers himself as a mechanic for Arthur \\"Red\\" Stanley (Thomas Mitchell) at his garage. Red turns down Billy initially, but after seeing a photo of his father, \\"Cannonball\\" Coy, a famous driver, Red scares up a job for Billy. Billy's father died in an accident at the Indianapolis 500 several years previously. Red was Cannonball's mechanic, riding with him the day he died in the north turn of the Indianapolis motor speedway. Red inquires after \\"her\\"; he still carries a torch for Mary (Spring Byington), Cannonball's widow and Billy's mother. At the garage, Billy befriends a tomboy, Louise Riley (Mary Hatcher), whose father owns the nearest racetrack. Billy gets a chance to prove his skills as a driver in a qualifying race, but he is too arrogant to follow his employer's advice and is unsuccessful. He asks Louise to meet on Saturday night at the track. Thinking it is a date, Louise does the unheard of for her‚Äîshe buys a dress and heels (in which she is unskilled at walking), assisted by her family's maid (Hattie McDaniel). As it turns out, Billy needed her help with changing some carburetors, much to Louise's disappointment. She gamely wobbles on high heels with him to the garage, buoyed by her love of cars and affection for Billy. Billy gets another chance to drive for another car owner, Deacon Jones. The car is green and referred to as a \\"Hoodoo Wagon\\" due to a racing superstition that green cars are unlucky. A helpful gadfly in the pits reminds Billy this is the same color as the car his father drove when he crashed and burned. Billy drives but is pushed off the track by driver Vic Sullivan (Michael O'Shea). Billy survives the crash but fails to qualify. He vents his frustration at the dirty trick by punching Vic. Distracted by the spectacle, another driver injures his hand by absentmindedly placing it on the searing exhaust pipe of his car in which he's sitting; Billy is offered the opportunity to drive in the incapacitated man's stead. Billy wins the next race and continues driving for Jones. Together with his team's other driver, Happy Lee (Steve Brodie), they make headlines with their success. Billy gets arrested for speeding after he has too much to drink. Red bails him out, and contrary to Red's advice, Billy goes on to race that same night. When the left rear wheel in Happy's car breaks, Billy tries desperately to catch up to Happy and alert him but instead crashes into Happy's car after the wheel comes off. The car skids to a stop in Billy's path. Happy's car is smashed through the wall, rupturing the gas tank and the car bursts into flames. Despite Billy's frantic efforts to save him, Happy dies in the blaze. After the race, the other drivers avoid Billy, convinced Billy made good his tyro promise to \\"...drive over them\\" and he is fired from Jones's garage. Billy decides to move \\"back east, where the big cars and the big money are.\\" Billy stays in contact with Louise, and starts fresh as a race car driver. In his absence, his mother and Red get married. On the day of the next Indianapolis 500 race, Mary, Red and Louise turn out to support Billy. He drives one of Red's cars and leads, but on the final lap Billy drives through flaming gasoline from a wreck which causes Billy's engine to catch fire. Battling the smoke, Billy finishes the race, taking third place, leaping from the car just before it explodes. Billy is bitterly disappointed not to have won, especially since without a winning purse Red can't afford to race again. To Billy's delight, in a show of great sportsmanship, the winner insists officials give the trophy to Billy for his bravery.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68743/The-Big-Wheel/ Cast * Mickey Rooney as Billy Coy * Thomas Mitchell as Arthur 'Red' Stanley * Mary Hatcher as Louise Riley * Michael O'Shea as Vic Sullivan * Spring Byington as Mary Coy * Hattie McDaniel as Minnie (as Hattie McDaniels) * Steve Brodie as Happy Lee * Lina Romay as Dolores Raymond * Allen Jenkins as George * Richard Lane as Reno Riley (as Dick Lane) * Eddie Kane as Head Waiter * Charles Irwin as Drunk * Kippee Valez as Carla * Denver Pyle as Doctor * George Fisher as Announcer * Jackson King as Announcer (as Jack Colin) Production Rooney returned from the war and made four films for MGM. He wanted to enter independent production and MGM agreed provided he promise to make five films for them. In April 1949 Rooney announced he would make four films in partnership with producer Sam Stiefel of which Big Wheel would be the first, directed by Edward Ludwig based on a story by Robert Smith. It would be followed by Buckaroo based on an idea by Rooney, and Quicksand. The agreement between Rooney and Stiefel ended before Rooney had made a film due to a financial disagreement. Rooney agreed to make three films for Stiefel as a salaried employer. The producer said Rooney owed him $180,000 and he was paying Rooney $100,000 a film; he was to pay it off at $60,000 a film, and thus would only get $40,000 cash. Filming started 21 June 1949. Wilbur Shaw acted as technical adviser. Rooney's character was based on Mauri Rose. In August 1949 it was announced the film would be produced by Stifel, Harry Popkin and Jack Dempsey. Reception The film was previewed in November 1949. The Los Angeles Times said the track scenes were \\"thrilling\\". Lawsuit In January 1950 driver Bill Holland sued Rooney, Dempsey, Popkin, Stifel and his brother for $250,000 in damages claiming the film was based on the 1949 Memorial Day race. Holland won the race and argued the film damaged his reputation by implying he won by a fluke.

It is a Grade II listed building. History In William Harrison's Survey of the Manor of Sheffield, dated 29 September 1637, there is a mention of an early \\"Sheffield Towne Hall\\". The early \\"Sheffield Towne Hall\\" was replaced by a second building, which had been designed by William Renny in 1699 and opened in 1700. The second town hall was next to the parish church, on a site with little space for extension. The third town hall, now referred to as the \\"Old Town Hall\\", was designed by Charles Watson in the Neoclassical style and built between 1807 and 1808. It was designed to house not only the Town Trustees but also the Petty and Quarter Sessions. Initially building was of five bays and faced Castle Street. It was extended in 1833 and again in 1866 to designs by William Flockton (1804‚Äì64) of Sheffield and his partner George Abbott. The most prominent feature was the new central clock tower over a new main entrance that reoriented the building to Waingate, the materials of which came from the parts of the building which had been demolished. At the same time the building's courtrooms were linked by underground passages to the neighbouring Sheffield Police Offices. The first Town Council was elected in 1843 and took over the lease of the Town Trustees' hall in 1866. The next year the building was extensively renovated and the clock tower designed by Flockton & Abbott was added. By the 1890s Sheffield's administration had again outgrown the building, and the current Sheffield Town Hall was built further south. The Old Town Hall was again extended between 1896 and 1897, by the renamed Flockton, Gibbs & Flockton, and became the local meeting place for the Crown Court and the High Court. The drinking fountain on the Castle Street side of the building was added at this time. In 1973 the Old Town Hall was made a Grade II listed building. In the 1990s these courts moved to new premises, and since at least 1997 to present, the building remains disused. In 2008 the Victorian Society named the building as one of its top ten buildings most at-risk. A campaign group, The Friends of the Old Town Hall was formed in November 2014 with the aim of getting the building's owner G1 London Property to state its intention for its future use. In September 2015 the building was put for sale with an asking price of ¬£2,000,000. The sale brochure was withdrawn from the internet after about ten days. In December 2019 plans were approved to develop the building into Pod hotel rooms and apartments. Sheffield City Council said the 42,000 sq ft building can be developed while \\"preserving it as much as possible\\". The new plans are for serviced apartments, shops, cafes and hotel rooms.

After five years he shifted to performing as a singer-songwriter, touring the Southeast. In the mid-1990s, Irwin branched into performances for children and since then has appeared in hundreds of schools (from preschools to colleges) and countless public libraries. Irwin continued to perform as a singer-songwriter and added storytelling to these performances, usually telling one story (about ten to twenty-five minutes in length) during a show. In the fall of 2004, he decided to pursue storytelling as a career and quickly achieved national prominence. Irwin now appears regularly in storytelling festivals across the United States. He has released several albums which feature stories, songs or whistling and has collected numerous awards for these albums. In 2013, Irwin received the Circle of Excellence Award from the National Storytelling Network. Currently, Irwin divides his time between storytelling concerts and children's performances.

Baker (December 29, 1921 ‚Äì March 13, 2006) was an inventor and Cornell University professor. He invented the chicken nugget as well as many other poultry-related inventions. Due to his contributions to the poultry sciences, he is a member of the American Poultry Hall of Fame. Education A Lansing, New York, native, Baker earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1943 and then went on to major in pomology at the university's College of Agriculture. For his graduate work, Baker took his master's degree at Penn State University and his doctorate at Purdue University. Baker was a member of the Alpha Zeta fraternity. Career and innovations Robert Baker traveled the world innovating how people eat and view chicken. He spent his entire academic life at Cornell University (1957‚Äì1989) and published some 290 research papers. In 1970 he founded the university's Institute of Food Science and Marketing. Baker was elected a fellow of the Institute of Food Technologists in 1997. Accredited to him are more than 40 poultry, turkey and cold cut innovations, making him the \\"George Washington Carver of poultry\\". In addition to creating the chicken nugget, he is also responsible for a revolutionary way to bind breading to chicken, co-invented the machine responsible for deboning chicken and created the chicken and turkey hot dogs and turkey ham. McDonald's is often falsely credited with the invention of the chicken nugget. In fact, Baker published his chicken nugget recipe in the 1950s as unpatented academic work, while McDonald's patented its recipe for Chicken McNuggets in 1979 and started selling the product in 1980. Baker's famous recipe for Cornell Chicken was actually innovated while Baker was at Penn State but never gained appreciation until he joined the faculty of Cornell. In popular culture Comedic singers Paul and Storm have a song titled \\"Nugget Man\\" on their album Gumbo Pants, which pays tribute to the late inventor and his most popular invention, the Chicken Nugget. The song humorously explores the career of Baker, lists a few of his other inventions, details the formula for Chicken Nuggets, and the impact of this invention. In the TV series The Wire, three of the street drug dealer characters discuss who may have invented the chicken nugget and what fortune it may have brought him, with D'Angelo Barksdale, the Crew Chief, pointing out that any such person would have been unlikely to have received any great reward but rather the heads of McDonald's were more likely to have been the main beneficiaries. In the Netflix series Bill Nye Saves the World, Baker is portrayed by actor Michael Ian Black in the angry scientist section of season 3 episode 4.

The case involved the arrest of four adults seen restraining a juvenile, who punched one of the adults who was restraining him. The trial court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, arguing that the warrantless entry was not supported by exigent circumstances; the Utah Court of Appeals and Utah Supreme Court both affirmed the trial court's ruling. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case on May 22, 2006. Background On July 23, 2001, at about 3:00 AM, four Brigham City police officers were dispatched to a loud house party. At the front door, the officers determined that knocking would not be productive and made their way down the driveway alongside the house to investigate. Through a slat fence they saw two minors drinking and entered the backyard, having probable cause to do so. While in the backyard, the officers saw a fight inside the house, which appeared to be four adults restraining a juvenile. At one point, the juvenile broke free and struck one of the occupants of the house in the nose with his hand. Two officers opened the screen door and \\"hollered\\" to identify themselves, but the occupants didn't notice. After entering the house, one officer shouted again to identify himself, this time alerting the occupants. The occupants then became upset at the presence of the officers in the residence without permission. The officers arrested the adults and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. The defendants filed a motion to suppress with the trial court. The trial court sided with the defendants, and the city twice appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals and the Utah Supreme Court, which both affirmed the trial court's ruling.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Utah Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered a separate concurring opinion. =Exigency= The Court ruled that the officers' warrantless entry into the home was justified under the emergency aid exception to getting a warrant because their entry \\"was plainly reasonable under the circumstances.\\" In ruling the officers' entry was supported by exigency, the Court cited Mincey v. Arizona, , 393‚Äì394: > [W]arrants are generally required to search a person‚Äôs home or his person > unless 'the exigencies of the situation' make the needs of law enforcement > so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under > the Fourth Amendment.\\" ... One exigency obviating the requirement of a > warrant is the need to assist persons who are seriously injured or > threatened with such injury. ... Accordingly, law enforcement officers may > enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured > occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury. Mincey, supra, at > 392; see also Georgia v. Randolph, 547 The court found that \\"the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence in the kitchen was just beginning.\\" =\\"Knock and announce\\" rule= The Court found that \\"the manner of the officers' entry was also reasonable.\\" The court found that after seeing the punch, one officer opened the screen door to the kitchen and yelled in \\"police.\\" Upon nobody hearing him, he stepped into the kitchen and then announced himself again, which prompted the tumult to subside. The Court ruled that: :...the officer's announcement of his presence was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen door. Indeed, it was probably the only option that had even a chance of rising above the din. Under these circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment‚Äôs knock-and- announce rule. Also, the Court ruled that once the officers announced their presence, they were free to enter the house to deal with the tumult, as it would be pointless to stand at the door waiting for a response while people brawled inside.

Together they devised and wrote the BBC sitcom Hancock's Half Hour (1954‚Äì1961), the first two series of Comedy Playhouse (1961‚Äì1963), and Steptoe and Son (1962‚Äì1974). Early life Simpson was born in Brixton, south London, and was educated at Mitcham County Grammar School for Boys. He was a football fan and supported Brentford. After leaving school he worked as a shipping clerk and was a member of a church concert party. He contracted tuberculosis aged 17 in 1947 and was admitted to Milford Sanatorium near Godalming in Surrey, where he spent 13 months. How we met, Alan Simpson at The Independent.

Retrieved 9 May 2016 Galton and Simpson While at the Milford Sanatorium, Simpson was housed with fellow patient Ray Galton, also 17 at the time. The two found they shared similar tastes in comedy, and quickly became friends. After leaving the sanatorium, they jointly applied and got jobs at the BBC, writing sketches for its various comedians. One of the plotlines in Linda Grant's 2016 novel The Dark Circle was based on Simpson's experience of broadcasting on hospital radio with Galton during their time at the sanatorium and its role in their subsequent careers. Following their break with the Derek Roy vehicle Happy Go Lucky, they became writers for Tony Hancock, including the Hancock's Half Hour radio show and Hancock's later television specials. Subsequently, the pair wrote several comedy series for television, including Comedy Playhouse and Steptoe and Son. The latter became the basis for the American series Sanford and Son and the Swedish series Albert & Herbert. Many of their works were re- adopted for later production, such as the Paul Merton revival of the Hancock's Half Hour for ITV, and the 2009 audio plays Galton and Simpson's Half Hour broadcast on BBC Radio 2 to celebrate the team's 60th anniversary. Galton and Simpson continued to write for other one-off comedies and series until Simpson's retirement in 1978, after which the two remained in contact. Later life Simpson retired from scriptwriting in 1978 around the time Kathleen, his first wife, died. He then concentrated on business interests and becoming an after dinner speaker. He was appointed an OBE in 2000, and he and Galton received a BAFTA Fellowship on 8 May 2016 for their comedic contributions. BAFTA fellowship 2016 Ray Galton and Alan Simpson.

History Demonstration of the NSV The NSV was founded in 1976 by Edwin Truyens as a radical splinter group of the Katholiek Vlaams Hoogstudentenverbond (KVHV; \\"Catholic Flemish Student Union\\"). This split occurred after the national council of the KVHV resented the radical Flemish nationalist stances of Truyens and his faction, including accepting nothing less than full Flemish independence. Throughout their history, they have made the news several times by being present at demonstrations of the radical fringe of the Flemish Movement. They are considered the counterweight to leftist student organisations in the universities and other institutions of higher education. Despite the controversy surrounding the NSV's radical profile, it is recognized at all the large Flemish universities. The NSV celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2006. Ideology The NSV maintains an ideology of conservative, radical nationalism and is very active in the Flemish Movement. Many top figures in the Vlaams Belang (formerly Vlaams Blok) started their political activities in the NSV, but the organization still claims party-political independence. They also have very close ties to other grassroots organisations in the Flemish independence movement like the Vlaamse Volksbeweging (VVB) and Voorpost. Internationally the NSV maintains informal relations with several European nationalist organizations, such as Generation Identity, the Movimento Giovani Padani and the publishing house Arktos. Colours and symbols Members of the NSV can be easily recognised by their grey student's hat and student's ribbons (a tradition in Flanders, imported in the early 20th century from Germany). The colours of their ribbons are black- white-red, these colours are also present on the student's hat. The black relates to the Flemish flag, and white and red are the heraldic colours of Antwerp (the city where the NSV was founded).

John Brown (June 15, 1763 - December 11, 1842) was the third president of the University of Georgia. He served in that capacity from 1811 until his resignation in 1816. He was born on June 15, 1763 in County Antrim, Ireland, the son of Walter and Margaret Brown, who were Scottish-Irish Presbyterians. At the age of three, he emigrated with his parents to America aboard the ship The Earl of Donegal, arriving in Charleston, South Carolina harbor on December 22, 1767. Brown's father obtained 200 acres per the Bounty Act of the South Carolina General Assembly, passed the 25th day of July 1761 to Protestants willing to settle in the South Carolina back-country that became Chester County. The Browns joined the Fishing Creek Presbyterian church. When the American Revolution came to their area in 1780, John Brown, then 17, joined the South Carolina Militia under the command of Capt. John McClure and General Thomas Sumter. He was in the first attack on the British at Rocky Mount and at the Battle of Hanging Rock. Being a known patriot family, the British burned the family home, driving his parents to Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Brown's sister, Jane Brown Gaston, was known for her bravery during the war as well. After the war, John resumed his education. He studied under Dr. S. E. McCorkle in Salisbury, North Carolina and received a Doctor of Divinity degree. In 1788, the Presbytery of Concord (NC) licensed Brown as a Presbyterian minister. The now Reverend John Brown's first pastoral post was Old Waxsaw Presbyterian church, in Lancaster, South Carolina. Also in 1788, he married the former Miss Mary McCullough of Salisbury. In 1792, Brown reorganized the congregations of Upper, Middle, and Lower Fishing Creek Presbyterian churches into one, and renamed them Richardson Presbyterian. From here in 1793, Brown was called to be the pastor of Beaver Creek, Hanging Rock and Miller's congregations in Kershaw County, South Carolina. One of Brown's main concerns was education. For the next ten years, he was a professor at South Carolina College (later the university). During this time, he helped start schools: Lancaster Academy (SC) in 1802, and Wadesboro Academy (NC) in 1803, and served as a trustee and president. In 1811, Brown became President of the University of Georgia in Athens. He served in this post until 1816. After he resigned as President of the University of Georgia, Brown became pastor of Mt. Zion Church in Hancock County, Georgia. He ministered to this congregation for the next twelve years. Next, he was pastor at the Washington (GA) Presbyterian church before he began missionary work in the south Georgia frontier near Fort Gaines in Clay County, Georgia. Brown died on December 11, 1842 in Fort Gaines. He is buried in the Old Pioneer Cemetery, alongside his wife of 48 years.

The Ruhr Area is often nicknamed Revier . It can be as tiny as a personal workplace. The song 'Ich bin der letzte Kunde' by 1980s East German pop group Silly about closing time in a corner bar includes the line 'Der Klofer hat m√§chtig zu tun im Revier', meaning 'the toilet attendant has a lot of work to do in his area'. During the Nazi period it could have more sinister meaning when abbreviated from German Krankenrevier, or \\"sick bay\\", \\"dispensary\\"). In the language of Nazi camps was a barrack for sick concentration camp inmates. Most of the medical personnel were inmates themselves. The conditions in reviers varied drastically depending on the type of the camp. In everyday language it does not have any relation with concentration camps, but it is used to define animal territory or a working area. Extermination camps In extermination camps (as well as in many labor camps, where extermination through labor was practiced) the idea of revier was immediately associated with death in many respects. Death was to be expected immediately upon entrance to a revier: An \\"insufficiently\\" sick person could be classified as malingerer, who was avoiding labor. The penalty was death. Even being admitted into the revier gave little hope: while the medical personnel (inmates) could be highly qualified doctors, they could not offer any help beyond very basic first aid. For example, the supply of medicine was very limited. In addition, rations for the sick were lower than for the inmates who could work and no hygiene was maintained. Finally, at any moment the residents of a revier were subject to extermination for various reasons (e.g. a threat of an epidemic, due to overcrowding or deemed incurably sick).

Award criteria =Broad criteria= The 1939‚Äì1945 Star was awarded for specified periods of operational service overseas between 3 September 1939 and either 8 May 1945 in Europe or 2 September 1945 in the Far East theatre. The broad criteria were 180 days of service between these dates, with more specific criteria depending on service arm.GOV.UK ‚Äì Defence and armed forces ‚Äì guidance ‚Äì Medals: campaigns, descriptions and eligibility ‚Äì 1939 to 1945 Star (Access date 1 April 2015)Extract from the Regulations: The 1939‚Äì1945 Star * Naval personnel qualified after 180 days afloat between certain specified dates in areas of operations as laid out in the regulations. * Army personnel had to complete 180 days of service in an operational command. * Airborne troops qualified if they had participated in any airborne operations and had completed 60 days of service in a fully operational unit. * Air Force air crew qualified after 60 days of service in an operational unit, including at least one operational sortie. The 1939‚Äì1945 Star was also awarded to crews of transport aircraft who flew over certain specified routes. Air crew of fighter aircraft engaged in the Battle of Britain were also awarded the Battle of Britain Clasp, while air crew of bomber aircraft who participated in at least one operational sortie in a Bomber Command operational unit were awarded the Bomber Command Clasp in 2013. * Ground crew and other Air force personnel qualified upon completion of 180 days of service in an area of operational army command. * Merchant Navy personnel qualified upon completion of 180 days of service with at least one voyage made through an operational area.The National Archives ‚Äì Merchant seamen's campaign medal records 1939‚Äì1945 (Access date 2 April 2015) =Special criteria= The award of a gallantry medal or Mention in Dispatches qualified the recipient for the award of the 1939‚Äì1945 Star, regardless of service duration. Personnel whose qualifying service period was terminated prematurely by their death or disability due to service were awarded this Star. In addition, some special criteria applied when, at certain specified times, just one day's service was required. These latter instances were actions for which a more specific campaign medal was not awarded and the regulations for award made provision for a number of operations in Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Theatre and India and Burma, in which entry into operational service for one day or part thereof qualified personnel for the award of the 1939‚Äì1945 Star. Some notable examples are:Joslin, Litherland, and Simpkin (eds), British Battles and Medals, (1988), Spink. p. 248. * The Battle of France in France or Belgium from 10 May to 19 June 1940. * The St Nazaire Raid from 22 to 28 March 1942. * The Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942. * The Anglo-Iraqi War in Iraq from 10 April to 25 May 1941. * The Japanese conquest of Burma from 22 February 1942 to 15 May 1942. * The Battle of Madagascar to capture Vichy French-controlled Madagascar from 5 May 1942 to 5 November 1942. In the case of personnel in operational service at the end of active hostilities in Europe on 8 May 1945, the actual operational service requirement period for the award of the Atlantic Star, Air Crew Europe Star, Italy Star and France and Germany Star was reduced to entry into a theatre of operations and the prior six or two months service requirements did not apply. The 1939‚Äì1945 Star, however, was not awarded in any of these cases in which actual operational service amounted to less than six or two months. Description The set of nine campaign stars was designed by the Royal Mint engravers. The stars all have a ring suspender which passes through an eyelet formed above the uppermost point of the star. They are six‚Äìpointed stars, struck in yellow copper zinc alloy to fit into a 44 millimetres diameter circle, with a maximum width of 38 millimetres and 50 millimetres high from the bottom point of the star to the top of the eyelet.Free Czechoslovak Air Force ‚Äì British Medals awarded to Czechoslovak airmen in WW2 ‚Äì 1939‚Äì1945 Star (Access date 2 April 2015) ;Obverse The obverse has a central design of the Royal Cypher \\"GRI VI\\", surmounted by a crown.

The rosettes, to be worn on the ribbon bar when medals are not worn, are silver-gilt for the Battle of Britain Clasp and silver for the Bomber Command Clasp. ;Ribbon The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with equal width bands of Navy blue, Army red and Air Force blue, with the dark blue band representing the Naval Forces and the Merchant Navy, the red band the Armies and the light blue band the Air Forces. The equal width bands represent the equal contributions of the three service arms towards victory. The ribbons for this medal and the Defence Medal as well as those of the other Second World War campaign stars, with the exception of the Arctic Star, were devised by King George VI. Order of wear The order of wear of the Second World War campaign stars was determined by their respective campaign start dates and by the campaign's duration. This is the order worn, even when a recipient qualified for them in a different order. The Defence Medal and War Medal are worn after the stars. The Canadian Volunteer Service Medal is worn after the Defence Medal and before the War Medal, with other Commonwealth war medals worn after the War Medal. * The 1939‚Äì1945 Star, from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, the full duration of the Second World War. * The Atlantic Star from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Battle of the Atlantic and the War in Europe. * The Arctic Star, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Arctic Convoys and the War in Europe. * The Air Crew Europe Star, from 3 September 1939 to 5 June 1944, the period until D-Day minus one. * The Africa Star, from 10 June 1940 to 12 May 1943, the duration of the North African Campaign. * The Pacific Star, from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Pacific War. * The Burma Star, from 11 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Burma Campaign. * The Italy Star, from 11 June 1943 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Italian Campaign. * The France and Germany Star, from 6 June 1944 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the North-West Europe Campaign. * The Defence Medal, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945 (2 September 1945 for those serving in the Far East and the Pacific), the duration of the Second World War.New Zealand Defence Force - The Defence Medal Eligibility Rules (Access date 21 April 2015) * The War Medal, from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, the full duration of the Second World War.New Zealand Defence Force - The War Medal 1939-45 Eligibility Rules (Access date 22 April 2015) The 1939‚Äì1945 Star is therefore worn as shown: 1939‚Äì1945 Star Atlantic Star * Succeeded by the Atlantic Star. =South Africa= On 6 April 1952 the Union of South Africa instituted its own range of military decorations and medals.

It consisted of two parts, the Rebecca airborne transceiver and antenna system, and the Eureka ground-based transponder. Rebecca calculated the range to the Eureka based on the timing of the return signals, and its relative position using a highly directional antenna. The 'Rebecca' name comes from the phrase \\"Recognition of beacons\\". The 'Eureka' name comes from the Greek word meaning \\"I have found it!\\". The system was developed in the UK at the Telecommunications Research Establishment by Robert Hanbury Brown and J.W.S. Pringle. Rebecca was essentially an ASV radar fit to a new broadcaster unit, while the Eureka system was all-new. Initial production began in 1943, and the system was used for dropping supplies to resistance fighters in occupied Europe, after delivery of the portable Eureka unit. The US Army Air Force started production in the US as well, and both examples could be used interchangeably. Over time, the Rebecca/Eureka found a number of other uses, including blind-bombing, airfield approach, and as a blind-landing aid in the BABS (Beam Approach Beacon Signal) form. As many of the war-era systems used similar display units, the Lucero system was introduced to send the proper signals to interrogate any of these systems, allowing a single display unit of any type to be used for H2S, ASV, AI, Rebecca and BABS. History =Lucky accident= Mk. IV-equipped Bristol Beaufighter Rebecca/Eureka owes its existence largely to the efforts of Robert Hanbury Brown, an astronomer and physicist who worked with the Air Ministry's AMES group on the development of radar. During 1940, Brown had led development of a new version of the AI Mk. IV radar that included a pilot's indicator, better known today as a C-scope. This display directly represented the relative position between the fighter and its target, as if the pilot were looking through a gunsight. It was hoped that this would greatly ease the problems that the radar operators had trying to relay instructions from their instruments to the pilot, especially at closer range. Prototype sets became available in late 1940, with the first production examples arriving in January 1941. During a test flight in February, the aircraft was flying at when Hanbury Brown's oxygen supply failed and he passed out. The test pilot, Peter Chamberlain, realized what had happened and quickly landed the plane. Brown awoke in an ambulance. This accident, along with the many previous flights at high altitude, aggravated an ear injury he had received at RAF Martlesham Heath in 1939, and during the spring he was hospitalized for a mastoidectomy operation in Brighton. The operation was successful, but a post-operation infection caused him to go deaf in both ears and several follow-up visits were required. By the time he returned to the AMES research center, now in Worth Matravers and renamed the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), major research on the early AI sets had ended in favour of new systems working at microwave frequencies using the recently invented cavity magnetron. Brown had missed most of the development of this system, and he was no longer allowed to fly at high altitudes, so his work on AI ended. He was instead placed in a new group led by John Pringle, a zoologist from Cambridge University, and the two began to study new applications for radar technologies. =Beacons for Army Co- operation= In June 1941, Brown visited the Army headquarters at Old Sarum Airfield to see if the RAF Army Co-operation Command's School of Army Co- operation might put radar to good use. The Army Co-operation squadrons carried out a variety of missions including artillery spotting, general reconnaissance, and ground attack. He found the group was only mildly interested in radar, thinking it might make a useful device for warning of the approach of enemy fighters, but were perfectly happy using flags and smoke signals for navigation and communications. Brown then visited a military exercise involving ground attacks in close coordination with the Army, and was convinced that radar systems could be used to improve these results. However, he also came to realize that almost all such missions would be carried out by aircraft of other forces, notably the RAF, so any system they proposed would have to be mounted in those aircraft. Pringle then arranged for Brown and himself to meet with the Commander in Chief (C-in-C) for Army Co-operation, Sir Arthur Barratt. In a long conversation, the two outlined the possibilities of radar for bombing, navigation and return-to-base roles, all of which proved to be interesting to Barratt. Barratt then stated that any system they did adopt would have to fit in single seat aircraft like the Tomahawk, which eliminated most of these possibilities. Both Pringle and Brown then focused on the use of a transponder system combined with existing radars to allow accurate bombing or delivery of supplies or troops by parachute, a role that would almost always be carried out by twin-engine aircraft or larger. If this broadcast on the 200 MHz frequency then being used by many British radars, any aircraft with AI or Air-to-Surface Vessel radar could pick it up. To illustrate the concept, Brown gave them a small transponder and told them to hide it anywhere within of Army Co-operation headquarters in Bracknell. One of the TRE aircraft from RAF Christchurch would attempt to find it and fire a smoke signal within of its location. The test was carried out on 28 July 1941, and while they waited for their aircraft to arrive, another aircraft approached the hiding spot and flew around several times before flying off again. The Army suspected that they had sent this aircraft to spy out the location. Just as Brown managed to convince them they were not spies, their own aircraft, a Bristol Blenheim, arrived and fired a smoke signal only 50 yards from the transponder. To be sure, the Army was told to hide it again in another location, this time choosing to place under a tree on the lawn of their headquarters. Their Blenheim once again easily found it. It was later learned that the first aircraft was from the Fighter Interception Unit who saw the odd blip on their radar and decided to investigate. In spite of the successful demonstrations, and enthusiastic support from Barratt and others, no orders for a transponder system were immediately forthcoming. A visit to the airborne headquarters at RAF Ringway would ultimately result in orders for both the UK and US, but those would be some time in the making. =SOE= A more immediate outcome of the visit to Ringway was an invitation for Brown to meet a secretive group known as the Special Operations Executive (SOE) at Whitehall. Brown arrived to find this was not actually their office, and had to prove his identity before being told the real address was quite a distance away. When he finally arrived at Baker Street he was not impressed. SOE then explained the problem they were having dropping supplies to partisans operating across Europe, as far away as Poland. Brown explained that their beacon could be seen as far as under good conditions, but that might drop to as short as 5 miles if it was under trees or otherwise blocked. SOE stated that they could be reasonably certain to place it on open ground. However, they also stated that they could only navigate to perhaps ten miles of the beacon, which would be only marginally satisfactory. Brown asked why they could not use the Gee navigation system to address this, and when they admitted they had no idea what this was, he had the satisfaction of saying he could not explain it to them because it was secret. Ultimately, Brown was taken to meet the C-in-C of the SOE and arranged a demonstration similar to the one given earlier for the Army. SOE was given the transponder and told to hide it anywhere within a large area, and their aircraft would not attempt to find it until a week later. On 11 February 1942 one of the TRE's Avro Ansons took off from RAF Hurn and picked it up at a range of , approaching and dropping two containers within 200 yards. An order was placed immediately. =Prototypes= One of the major problems with the original AI radars was that the transmissions spread out over the entire front hemisphere of the aircraft. Shorter wavelengths, like those used in AI, tended to scatter from the ground, sending a portion of the signal back towards the aircraft, the \\"ground reflection\\" or \\"ground return\\". For the simple reason that the ground is much larger than a target aircraft, the scattered signal overwhelmed any target return, and made it impossible to see any target further away than the aircraft's current altitude. For the supply mission, which was carried out at very low altitudes, this was clearly not going to work. As the SOE had their own aircraft, and there was no need to make the system work with an existing production radar design, the solution was relatively simple. Instead of the transponder replying on the same frequency, and thus being lost in the ground reflections, it would receive the signal from the radar and then re-broadcast it on a second frequency. In the aircraft, the receiver would be tuned not to the radar's broadcasts, but the transponder's. This way the ground reflection would simply be ignored, although at the cost of requiring the transponder to have two antennas. Powering the transponder was a more serious problem. The system had to operate in any weather, which made conventional lead-acid batteries unsuitable due to their poor cold-weather performance. The system also had to be stored for long periods of time before being activated, which again argued against lead-acid. The solution was found to be small nickel-iron batteries that could be repeatedly and rapidly recharged in the field, and operated across a wide range of temperatures. To protect the system from capture, it was fitted with small explosives that would destroy enough of the circuitry to make it impossible to determine the exact frequencies being used. The transponders were mounted in suitcases, selected on a case-by-case basis to match common types in use in that area. A dozen transponders supplied to the SOE in 1942, at which point the TRE's involvement largely ended. Brown later learned that these were used extensively throughout the war. One example, dropped in Norway, was used on seven separate drops, in spite of being buried for the better part of a year in a biscuit tin. = Airborne use= The Airborne Forces Equipment Committee took up development of the system in the summer of 1942, funding low-priority development of a Mark II system intended for use on glider tugs and paratroop aircraft. At the time, it was decided that each Eureka should be able to handle interrogation from up to 40 aircraft at a time. They also selected a design based on several sub-units that would allow the equipment to be changed simply by swapping sub-units out from a common chassis. Both Rebecca II and Eureka II were developed by Murphy Radio with early pre-production of Rebecca II by Dynatron Radio. A system using a selection of tuned capacitors was used to select the operational frequency, from a set of four. Looking for a controller, Murphy selected a General Post Office 5-position electromechanical system used in their telephone exchange systems. A similar selection of four channels was available in the Eureka units, but these were selected manually. Rebecca was powered off the aircraft mains, while Eureka was battery powered with a lifetime of about six hours. In testing, Eureka II proved to be too heavy for practical use, so A.C. Cossor was selected to build a Mk. III version. They used US miniature 9000-series tubes for this version and used a much smaller battery with a three-hour life. =US use= US Navy Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar training photo Airborne Long Wave Rebecca Responsor training photo In December 1942 Brown was flown to the US via Pan Am Clipper to meet with the US I Troop Carrier Command. They started production of a number of versions of the Mk. III as the AN/PPN-1 (Eureka), AN/PPN-2 (Portable Eureka) and AN/TPN-1 (Transportable Eureka). The AN/APN-2 (Rebecca), also known as the SCR-729, used a display that saw use for a number of purposes. When many British military gliders failed to reach their landing zones in Sicily even in excellent conditions, a rushed effort to develop an even smaller and lighter Rebecca III system started. Cossor was again selected for the development, using a super-regenerative receiver and batteries for only 30 minutes of operation. The Rebecca IIIN version was used for strike aircraft in the Pacific theatre. These versions used capacitors in all five positions of the rotary switch. The introduction of the miniature B7G tubes in 1944 led to a new round of development of the Rebecca/Eureka. Dozens of different variations were eventually developed. Description The airborne Rebecca interrogator transmitted a 4-5 Œºs (microsecond) long pulse at a rate of 300 pulses per second on a frequency between 170 and 234 MHz. Upon receiving this signal, the Eureka rebroadcast the pulses on a different frequency. The Eureka unit also included a keying system that periodically lengthened the pulses over a period of seconds, allowing a morse code signal to be sent for station identification. This rebroadcast signal was received by two directional yagi antennas on the aircraft carrying the Rebecca unit, the usual location for the aerials being on either side of the aircraft cockpit. The signal was then sent to a conventional ASV radar display, with the vertical axis measuring time (and thus distance) and the horizontal showing the strength of the signal. If the aircraft was approaching the Eureka from the side, the horizontal pulse would extend further on one side of the display than the other, indicating the need for the aircraft to turn toward the shorter blip in order to fly directly toward the Eureka. There was a slight delay in the Eureka between signal reception and the return pulse. As the Rebecca units approached the Eureka the return signal would eventually overlap the interrogation pulse, and render the system ineffective. This occurred at a range of about two miles. At this time the crew had to switch to visual means of locating the drop zone. Reliance on Eureka without visual confirmation invariably resulted in premature drops, as during the American airborne landings in Normandy. Versions There were many versions of the system. Early models were limited to a single frequency; later ones could switch between five frequencies. =British= Eureka Mk VII was a rack-mounted, non-mobile transponder used at RAF bases for aircraft to home onto. A Mark X version of both Rebecca and Eureka that worked in the 1000 MHz range. This was developed for use during in-flight refueling, enabling the receiving aircraft to locate the tanker while maintaining radio silence. The tanker aircraft carried the Eureka and the receiving aircraft carried the Rebecca. This equipment was trialled by 214 Squadron in the early 1960s. =American= 1943 Rebecca transponding radar at the National Air and Space Museum * AN/PPN-1 * AN/PPN-1A * AN/PPN-2 The Rebecca code name was derived from the phrase \\"recognition of beacons\\".

The school offers classes for students in grades three through twelve. In 1979 the school was renamed in honor of Golda Meir, the fourth Prime Minister of Israel, who attended the institution from 1906 to 1912. There are two campuses: the lower campus and the upper campus. The 1890 lower campus building is a National Historic Landmark, designated in 1990 for its association with Meir.  Description  Situated next to the historic Schlitz Brewing Complex of the same era, the Fourth Street School, now the Meir School lower campus, was designed in 1889 by noted Milwaukee architect Henry C. Koch in Romanesque Revival style. Hallmarks of the style are the rough stone foundation (to give it a sense of rootedness) and the round-topped arches. The school was completed by 1890 and opened its doors on September 2, 1890. H-shaped in plan, the school building has four stories (basement included) and contains 16 classrooms along with an auditorium. A single story heating plant was added in 1915, with a fuel room to follow in 1937. Fire escapes and enclosure of the stairways brought the building up to code in 1957. Renovation of the interior and exterior took place in 1976, during which a cafeteria was added. Golda Meir had three classrooms in grade 3, grade 4, and grade 5. That left it with only enough room for one class in grade 6, grade 7, and grade 8. As a result, there were about 90 students in each of the elementary grades but only 30 students in each of the middle school grades. The 60 other students had to go to school somewhere else after grade 5. In 2011, parents asked the school board to allow grade 6 though 8 to move into the closed Milwaukee Education Center middle school, which is adjacent to Golda Meir's property. The building previously housed the Malt House of the long-closed Schlitz Brewery. The expansion has allowed all of Golda Meir's students to remain in the school. Golda Meir added grade 9 in 2014 and will continue to add grades until the Schlitz building has a high school population of 600 students. Golda Meir School, as it was renamed on May 4, 1979, is one of the city's original magnet schools. The Gifted and Talented Program was implemented in the 1970s to further stimulate and develop the abilities of talented pupils. A two block long mural on the playground retaining wall was started in 1979 by students. Titled \\"Milwaukee Illustrated\\" it celebrated the city's history until removed in 1998 to make way for a new theme, \\"Golda's Gallery: The Decades on Display.\\" In commemoration of the events of September 11, 2001, a \\"Labyrinth of Peace\\" was drawn on to the school playground. The single circuit labyrinth is used as a tool for students to reflect on what peace means to them.  Golda Meir, immigrant student  Golda Mabovitch, before 1910 Golda Meir was born Golda Mabovitch in Kiev, Ukraine in 1898 to a Jewish family and spent her early years in the part of Imperial Russia where Jews were allowed to live. In 1903 her father Moshe came to Milwaukee to work as a carpenter. In 1906 Golda, her sister, and her mother followed. The family settled on Walnut Street at the south end of the Brewer's Hill neighborhood, and Golda enrolled at the Fourth Street School. She recounts in her book My Life that she \\"learned a lot more than fractions or how to spell at Fourth Street School...\\" When she was in fourth grade, Meir undertook her first public works project by organizing a fundraiser to pay for her classmates' textbooks. She rented a hall and scheduled a public meeting for the event. In 1912 the girl who had arrived as a poor Jewish-Ukrainian immigrant with weak English graduated from Fourth Street School as valedictorian. Four years later she graduated from Milwaukee's North Division High School and entered teachers' college, but her interest in Palestine was growing. She joined the Labor Zionist Movement in 1915, led rallies for them, and during WWI worked for Jewish relief programs and taught Yiddish in Milwaukee's Jewish Community Center. She kept Milwaukee as her home base until 1920, when she and her husband moved to New York, then emigrated to Palestine in 1921. She later wrote: > I took a great deal with me from America to Palestine, more perhaps than I > can express: an understanding of the meaning of freedom, and awareness of > the opportunities offered to the individual in a true democracy and a > permanent nostalgia for the great beauty of the American countryside. In Palestine she worked for the labor organization Histadrut and in the 1930s she traveled back to the U.S. to lecture and raise funds for the Jews of Palestine. During WWII she worked to rescue Jews from the Nazis. In 1948, as European Jews flooded to Palestine and around the time the State of Israel was established, she returned to the U.S. to raise more funds for Israel. In following years she served as Israel's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Minister of Labor, Foreign Minister, and Prime Minister from 1969 to 1974. Golda Meir On October 3, 1969, Prime Minister Meir revisited her old Fourth Street School in Milwaukee, accompanied by U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and local Aldermen Vel Phillips and Orville Pitts. The school was renamed in her honor in 1979. The school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990.

It was initiated in 1981 by then Premier John Buchanan after Halifax's water supply had been shifted from the Spruce Hill/Long Lake/Chain Lakes watershed to the Pockwock Lake watershed near Hammonds Plains. The 2095-hectare park, formally established in 1984, constitutes the bulk of these former watershed lands. Other portions were deeded to the municipality of Halifax, and the area around the Chain Lakes is still administered by the Halifax Regional Water Commission, since the Chain Lakes remain the city's emergency water supply. History The lands included within the present park boundaries have had a long history of human use, including logging, several farms and many small granite quarries which provided the stones for many of the 19th century buildings in downtown Halifax. As part of its development as Halifax's watershed lands, in the early part of the 20th century an earthen dam was erected on Pine Hill Lake, greatly enlarging it. A long concrete and earth dam was constructed on Long Lake, again significantly expanding its area. A pipeline was built connecting the two lakes, and to the adjacent Chain Lakes. The entire area has been logged extensively in the early part of the 20th century, but a few scattered old growth trees remain. The north eastern side of Long lake featured world war I barracks location, extensive trenches and machine gun battle emplacement which protected movement from the St. Margaret's Bay and Prospect bay roads into Halifax. This fortification is known as Chain Lake Position - Locality 2 HRM Archives document number (BB1-1-4863) [City Engineer's Office] No. BB1-1-4863 Dated: September 3, 1914 The lands were part of Halifax's old water supply system. In order to protect the water quality, about 16,000 acres of land was left \\"virtually untouched\\" into the 1970s. In the years leading up to the 1977 commissioning of the new Pockwock water supply system, concern began to mount over the fate of the old watershed lands, which were considered to have high ecological and recreational value. Residents feared that the area would be spoiled by suburban development. A regional plan adopted in July 1975 proposed that the watershed lands would form one of seven new regional parks in the Halifax- Dartmouth area. The 2,095-hectare watershed lands were acquired by the province in 1981 and put under the management of the Department of Natural Resources for use as a provincial park. Long Lake Provincial Park was formally created by Order in Council (OIC) 84-1189 on October 9, 1984, comprising part of the old watershed lands. Application altered (by the withdrawal of 1.23 hectares) by OIC 93-364 on April 14, 1993. Management Long Lake is a provincial park controlled by the Department of Lands and Forestry of the Government of Nova Scotia (formerly called the Department of Natural Resources). However, the park has never had a fully approved management plan and so is relatively unknown as a public space, despite its proximity to central Halifax and its large size (rivalling that of the Halifax peninsula). In 2003, the Department of Natural Resources entered into consultation with the Long Lake Provincial Park Association on the development of a management plan. As of November 2009 it is unclear when, if ever, the management plan will be completed. On behalf of Bicycle Nova Scotia and the mountain bike community in general Randy Gray submitted a Mountain Biking Management Plan to be included either in the main body or as an appendix to the Management Plan. This was submitted after about six years of involvement and consultation with the Long Lake Park Association's Board of Directors and the Long Lake Park Association's Management Plan Committee. It can be read here: Mountain Bike Management Plan Submission. It was never discussed by the Long Lake Provincial Park Association after submission. It was rejected by the Department of Natural Resources. Long Lake has been designated by DNR as a \\"conservation- oriented\\" provincial park and can be viewed as an \\"urban wilderness\\", even though much of its area has been altered by previous human activities and uses. It is anticipated that there will be no campgrounds or other high-impact projects planned for the park in the foreseeable future. This is in contrast to an aborted early plan to develop a resort area and artificial beach on the south side of Long Lake, which resulted in a wide roadbed stretching from halfway between Long Lake and the intersection of Old Sambro Rd. and Leblin Drive, to within about 183 meters of the lake itself. Extensive erosion along this roadbed has resulted in a strip of exposed bedrock which has been subsequently dubbed the \\"scar road\\" and is easily visible from the air. Most of the large southern portion of the park is expected to be designated as a \\"conservation zone\\" in the final version of the development plan, along with selected areas of the deciduous and mixed forest in the more heavily used northern region discussed above.

The management plan proposes another parking lot be built off the Old Sambro Rd, and there is discussion with the city to use a portion of the Exhibition Park lands as a parking lot mainly for the park, with concomitant restoration of the major park access point there as well. There is the parking lot built in 2018 on Old Sambro Rd near where it meets Dunbrack Street (formerly North West Arm Drive). This location also includes a Kayak launch. Paddle boards are also popular here and can be rented from a local business. The northern portion of Long Lake Provincial Park (north of Long Lake itself) and the adjacent Water Commission lands between the park's boundaries and the St. Margaret's Bay Rd. is home to a network of narrow single-track mountain bike trails that is noteworthy for its challenging terrain. Many of the trails are organized into a series of loops (approximately 9.5 kilometers of trail) that can be ridden a number of ways. Most trails are unmarked. Although this area of the park represents a small portion of its total area, it and an adjacent narrow strip of land at the northwest end of the park (which contains a small waterfall and a popular swimming spot) receives over 90% of the park's total usage. Hydrology Long Lake Provincial Park is home to a number of lakes and ponds. The eponymous Long Lake, with an area of 154 hectares, is the largest. It was created in the 19th century when a wooden dam was built on McIntosh Run, causing rising water levels to connect two pre-existing lakes, Cocked Hat Lake and Beaver Lake. The resultant Long Lake has a maximum depth of 30 metres. The park's second- largest water body, Spruce Hill Lake, was formed in a similar manner. A dam was built on Spruce Lake in 1867, connecting it to nearby Fosses Hill Lake. Today, the resulting Spruce Hill Lake is 102 hectares large, and has a maximum depth of 12 metres. Other lakes in the park include Witherod Lake (12 ha) and Narrow Lake (9 ha). Park usage Child and dog playing in Long Lake Long Lake in fall 2012 The park is used by a number of overlapping groups, including: * Mountain bikers, who developed most of the trail system between 1994 and 1999. However, the number of bikers has declined significantly since about 2001, when trail systems began to be created elsewhere in the area. Still, as of fall 2008, there are a significant number of mountain bikers in the park - but almost exclusively in the small northernmost portion discussed above. * Hikers: folks simply out for a walk in the woods. Most hikers again use this same small portion of the park, but some make use of the older network of old roads and trails in the much larger southern portion. * Dog walkers. Despite a regulation prohibiting un-leashed dog walking in provincial parks, Long Lake Provincial Park has become a mecca for off-leash dog walkers in the Halifax area. The vast majority of them use the area within a 20-minute walk of the park's only parking lot, mentioned above. * Swimmers: the lake is deep, the water quality is excellent overall, and there are a number of excellent spots for swimming. As with other lakes in the region, the water is warm enough for swimming from June through September. Virtually all the swimming in the lake takes place in the small area discussed above (i.e. the portion north of Long Lake), plus there is a good swimming area just west of where a small stream known for its scenic waterfall enters the lake, near the southwest end. There is very limited trail access to the lake outside of this area, but for those adventurous enough two small sandy beaches offer secluded swimming on the south side. At the other end of the park, there is swimming spot on the earthen dam at the north end of Pine Hill Lake, where Harrietsfield children swim. * Cross-country skiers: most of these use the trails and old roads just north of Long Lake. * Geocaching: an active and long-established geocaching tradition exists in the Halifax region, and the area within the park is particularly popular, perhaps due to the varied terrain within park boundaries, * fishers: the lake is not stocked, but it is reported that there is still good fishing from a few spots on the lake, * Boaters in kayaks, paddle boards and canoes. This is not as popular an activity as it could be, due to the scarcity of boat-launching places. The new kayak launch on Old Sambro has helped improve this access. Use of motorized vehicles of any kinds, including boats, is prohibited within park boundaries, as with other provincial parks in Nova Scotia, so park planners have not made provisions for an easy place to launch boats, out of concern that power boats might also be launched. * Birdwatchers and other naturalists: the park's terrain is quite variable and there are many excellent habitats for bird watching. Access to many of the best habitats for birds is still limited, but this is seldom a barrier to the most eager of birders. * Photography: The park offers a great wealth of opportunities for scenic and natural history photography, from scenic vistas around the lakes, to the many large glacial erratics (boulders dropped by the melting glaciers as they retreated, about 14,000 years ago), beautiful old trees, and a surprisingly wide variety of flora and fauna. * Groups on organized field outings: Youth groups of various kinds, hiking clubs, cross-country runners, field naturalists, hiking associations, school groups and others often make use of the park's extensive trail system for outings of both the educational and recreational kinds. In addition to the legal activities detailed above, illegal park uses include: *Off-road vehicles: as discussed elsewhere, this activity occurs exclusively in the large northern portion of the park, and has caused considerable environmental harm, especially to wetlands. *Hunting: This is not a serious problem in the park, fortunately, but it does occur nevertheless. Mostly, deer are the target of hunting in the area. Though, hunting is permitted on the Crown land outside of the park boundaries so long as legal safety distances are maintained. *Trapping: Trap lines were occasionally reported in the park until around the year 2000, but not since then. *Camping and squatting: This is a periodic problem, especially when trees are cut for firewood and for use in shelter and \\"camp\\" building. No camping is permitted within park boundaries, and no camp grounds are included in the current management plan. *Party use, usually by youth: this is a serious problem because of the fire hazard involved, and because frequently used party spots become trampled clearings which both encourage future use and would take decades to recover if left alone. Litter and potential wildlife disturbance are also factors to consider, plus the safety hazards associated with parties in semi-remote areas involving extensive alcohol usage. The two largest islands in Long Lake and the island in Withrod Lake have been considerably damaged by party-related activities. *Marijuana growing: Not a serious or widespread problem, but over the years a number of small plots of marijuana have been found within park boundaries. *Off-leash dog walking and dog walkers refusing to pick up after their pets. Environmental challenges Like most other parks in Halifax, it suffered extensive tree-loss as a result of Hurricane Juan on September 29, 2003. Many paths were blocked and some of the less-used ones remain that way. Most have since been cleared by citizens, however, since the province does not actively manage provincial parks before a management plan is created and approved. The slash created by these downed trees, which include many mature large, mature spruce trees, has created a significant fire hazard, although to date this has not created a problem. As mentioned elsewhere in the article, many of the more often used trails suffer from extensive erosion, and some have become quite wide because of people avoiding wet areas or creating short- cuts. Water quality is good overall, but is affected somewhat by runoff from the nearby Bayers Lake Industrial Park, and locally, by off-leash dogs swimming in the lake. In the large southern region of the park, extensive damage has been done by all-terrain vehicles, especially in boggy areas and along trails. This is an ongoing problem which will hopefully be remediated via education and more vigorous enforcement of regulations. In November 2015, around 3.8 hectares of land within the park was illegally clearcut by a private company. Resourcetec Inc. was hired by Dexter Construction to cut trees on property owned by Dexter along Old Sambro Road, beside the park. Resourcetec subcontracted the work to Scott and Stewart Forestry Consultants, who accidentally cut down trees on Crown land. Resourcetec was alleged to be the most culpable party. The company pleaded guilty and was fined in 2016. In response to this incident, provincial fines against illegal cutting on Crown land were significantly increased in November 2016. Flora and fauna Habitats within the park are extremely varied, and include various kinds of wetlands, old-growth vegetative successions from areas previously farmed, an area planted with pine trees by the Boy Scouts in the 1960s, extensive barrens in the southwestern portion of the park, some mixed hardwood/softwood and predominantly hardwood (oak, beech, witch hazel, birch, red maple) areas in the small northern part of the park discussed above, and extensive areas of boreal forest in the SE region - largely red and black spruce, balsam fir and red maple. As with most parts of Nova Scotia, large, old white pines dot the park, being left over from the logging which most areas underwent before their designation as watershed lands. It is worth noting that healthy populations of orchids can be found in some of the marshy portions in the park. The park's fauna is healthy and varied and includes many deer, the occasional moose, multitudes of squirrels, fox, bobcats, chipmunks, three or four species of frogs and salamanders, many fish and bird species, beavers (who have extensively altered portions of the park), muskrats, snakes and others. Unverified reports of lynx tracks and spoor also exist . Bears have not been reported within the park in recent years. Trails Lakeview Trail, pictured shortly after its 2016 opening The park possesses an extensive trail system comprising: * old roads associated with the farms in the area, including one connecting the Old Sambro Rd. in Spryfield, and Goodwood (on the Prospect Rd.), and another from Goodwood to Harrietsfield, * The \\"pipeline trail\\", above the pipeline between Pine Hill to Long Lakes. Most of this has unfortunately become flooded and swampy in recent years, hence impassable, * older trails associated with habitation, watershed usage, quarries and general uses such as fishing, swimming, berry picking, hiking and hunting and * newer trails developed by mountain bikers, as discussed above. Many of the more extensively used trails suffer from erosional problems, and various remedial proposals including trail closures have been discussed as part of the creation of the park's development plan. However, the majority of the damage to the trails occurred during the drop of mountain bike use and the increase in hiker/dog walker traffic. * a new 5-kilometre trail system on the northeast side of the park, called the Lakeview Trail, opened on Earth Day in 2016. It includes washrooms, benches, a car park, and bicycle racks. Several new entrances to the park were built along Dunbrack Street. The trails were funded by a private developer building a subdivision on the opposite side of Dunbrack Street.

There are more than 600 ethnicities in Indonesia, making it a multicultural archipelagic country with a diversity of languages, culture and religious beliefs. The population of Indonesia according to the 2010 national census was 237.64 million, and it was estimated to reach 255.4 million in 2015. 51% live on the island of Java, the world's most populous island. Around 95% of Indonesians are Native Indonesians (formerly grouped as \\"Pribumi\\"), with Javanese and 15% Sundanese forming the majority, while the other 5% are Indonesians with ancestry from foreign origin, such as Chinese Indonesians. One of the staple food of Indonesians is Tempe. Tempe is made from fermented soybean, formed into blocks and later can be cooked for various dishes. It is most common in Western Indonesia.  Population  As of 2018, Indonesians make up 3.5% of world total population, and Indonesia is the fourth most populous country after China, India and the United States. Despite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since the 1967, for the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1.49 percent. At that rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the present population of the United States and would - if the current US population did not rise ‚Äì become the world's third biggest after China and India by 2043. The family planning already revitalised based on the 1967 program to avoid Indonesia becoming the world's third most populous country. With a population of 150 million, Java is home to 51 percent of the Indonesian population, and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the centre of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. The other major islands of Indonesia are Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and New Guinea, which are home to the other 49 percent of Indonesian population. There are also other small populated island(s) such as Bali, Bangka, Madura, Nias, Maluku, Lesser Sunda Islands, Riau Islands and others. = Ethnic groups = football match There are over 600 ethnic groups in Indonesia. This number makes Indonesia one of the most diverse populations in the world. 95% of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry. The largest ethnic group in Indonesia is the Javanese who make up nearly 40% of the total population. The Javanese are concentrated on the island of Java but millions have migrated to other islands throughout the archipelago because of the transmigration program. The Sundanese, Malay, and Madurese are the next largest groups in the country. Many ethnic groups, particularly in Kalimantan and Papua, have only hundreds of members. Most of the local languages belong to Austronesian language family, although a significant number, particularly in Maluku Islands and West Papua belong to Papuan languages. The Chinese Indonesians population makes up a little less than 1% of the total Indonesian population according to the 2000 census. Some of these Indonesians of Chinese descent speak various Chinese dialects, most notably Hokkien and Hakka. The classification of ethnic groups in Indonesia is not rigid and in some cases unclear due to migrations, cultural and linguistic influences; for example some may consider Bantenese and Cirebonese to be members of Javanese people, however some others argue that they are different ethnic groups altogether since they have their own distinct dialects. This is the same case with Baduy people that share many cultural similarities with the Sundanese people. An example of hybrid ethnicity is the Betawi people, descended not only from marriages between different peoples in Indonesia but also with foreign origin like Arab, Chinese and Indian migrants since the era of colonial Batavia (Jakarta).  Culture  = Language = An example of Javanese script The Indonesian language ( ) is the official language of Indonesia. It is a standardized variety of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Most Indonesians also speak one of more than 700 indigenous languages. Most Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in another regional language (examples include Javanese, Sundanese and others), which are commonly used at home and within the local community. Most formal education, and nearly all national media and other forms of communication, are conducted in Indonesian. In East Timor, which was an Indonesian province from 1975 to 1999, Indonesian is recognised by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other being English), alongside the official languages of Tetum and Portuguese. = Religion = Minang wedding Indonesia is constitutionally a secular state and the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation, Pancasila, is \\"belief in the one and only God\\". A number of different religions are practised in the country, and their collective influence on the country's political, economic and cultural life is significant. The Indonesian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. However, the government recognises only six official religions (Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism). Although based on data collected by the Indonesian Conference on Religion and Peace (ICRP), there are about 245 non-official religions in Indonesia. Indonesian law requires that every Indonesian citizen hold an identity card that identifies that person with one of these six religions, although citizens may fill in 'believer' on that section in case that person adhere to other religion than six recognized religion or leave that section blank. Indonesia does not recognise agnosticism or atheism, and blasphemy is illegal. In the 2010 Indonesian census, 87.18% of Indonesians identified themselves as Muslim (with Sunnis more than 99%, Shias 0.5%,There are approximately 1 million Shia Muslims in the country which approximates to 0.5% of the total Muslim population. See: Ahmadis 0.2%There are approximately 400,000 Ahmadi Muslims in the country, which equates to 0.2% of the total Muslim population. See: ), 6.96% Protestant, 2.91% Catholic, 1.69% Hindu, 0.72% Buddhist, 0.05% Confucianism, 0.13% other, and 0.38% unstated or not asked. Indonesia's political leadership has played an important role in the relations between groups, both positively and negatively, promoting mutual respect by affirming Pancasila but also promoting a Transmigration Program, which has caused a number of conflicts in the eastern region of the country. = Literature = Indonesian literature can refer to literature produced in the Indonesian archipelago. It is also used to refer more broadly to literature produced in areas with common language roots based on the Malay language (of which Indonesian is one scion). This would extend the reach to the Maritime Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, but also other nations with a common language such as Malaysia and Brunei, as well as population within other nations such as the Malay people living in Singapore. There are also works written in and about Indonesia in unrelated languages. There are several languages and several distinct but related literary traditions within the geographical boundaries of the modern nation of Indonesia. For example, the island of Java has its own Javanese pre-national cultural and literary history. There are also Sundanese, Balinese, and Batak or Madurese traditions. Indonesia also has a colonial history of Dutch, British and Japanese occupation, as well as a history of Islamic influence that brought its own texts, linguistic and literary influences. There is also an oral literature tradition in the area. The term \\"Indonesian literature\\" is used in this article to refer to Indonesian as written in the nation of Indonesia, but also covers literature written in an earlier form of the Indonesian language i.e. Malay written in the Dutch East Indies. = Architecture = Tongkonan, Toraja traditional house The Architecture of Indonesia reflects the diversity of cultural, historical and geographic influences that have shaped Indonesia as a whole. Invaders, colonizers, missionaries, merchants and traders brought cultural changes that had a profound effect on building styles and techniques. Traditionally, the most significant foreign influence has been Indian. However, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also played significant roles in shaping Indonesian architecture. Religious architecture varies from indigenous forms to mosques, temples, and churches. The sultans and other rulers built palaces. There is a substantial legacy of colonial architecture in Indonesian cities. Independent Indonesia has seen the development of new paradigms for postmodern and contemporary architecture. = Cuisine = Tumpeng rice, the national dish of Indonesia. Indonesian cuisine is one of the most vibrant and colourful cuisines in the world, full of intense flavor. It is diverse, in part because Indonesia is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 18,000 in the world's largest archipelago,\\"Indonesian Cuisine.\\" Epicurina.com . Accessed July 2011. with more than 300 ethnic groups calling Indonesia their home. Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences. Indonesia has around 5,350 traditional recipes, with 30 of them considered the most important. Indonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences.\\"Indonesian food.\\" Belindo.com . Accessed July 2011. Sumatran cuisine, for example, often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables such as gulai and kari, while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hint of Chinese influence. The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Elements of Chinese cuisine can be seen in Indonesian cuisine: foods such as bakmi (noodles), bakso (meat or fish balls), and lumpia (spring rolls) have been completely assimilated.

Most Indonesian people are genetically close to Asians while the more eastern one goes how more people show Melanesian affinity. Geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza claims that there is a genetic division between East and Southeast Asians. Other geneticists have found evidence for four separate populations, carrying distinct sets of non- recombining Y chromosome lineages, within the traditional Mongoloid category: North Asians, Han Chinese, Japanese and Southeast Asians.TAJIMA Atsushi, PAN I.-Hung, FUCHAROEN Goonnapa, FUCHAROEN Supan, MATSUO Masafumi, TOKUNAGA Katsushi, JUJI Takeo, HAYAMI Masanori, OMOTO Keiichi, HORAI Satoshi, \\"Three major lineages of Asian Y chromosomes: implications for the peopling of east and southeast Asia,\\" Human Genetics 2002, vol. 110, no1, pp. 80‚Äì88 The complexity of genetic data has led to doubt about the usefulness of the concept of a Mongoloid race itself, since distinctive East Asian features may represent separate lineages and arise from environmental adaptations or retention of common proto-Eurasian ancestral characteristics.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Mongoloid  See also  * List of Indonesian people * Native Indonesians (Pribumi) * Ethnic groups in Indonesia * Culture of Indonesia Non- indigenous Indonesians: * African Indonesians * Arab Indonesians * Chinese Indonesians * Filipino Indonesians * Indian Indonesians * Indo people (mixed European-Indonesians) * Jewish Indonesians * Pakistani Indonesians * Totok (Dutch Indonesians)  References  ","title":"Indonesians"},{"id":"4885607","text":"The twelve-wired bird-of-paradise (Seleucidis melanoleucus) is a medium-sized, approximately long, velvet black and yellow bird-of-paradise.

The fourth son of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and Mary Wortley Montagu, he was born in Kenwood House, London. There is a famous painting in the Tate Gallery, London, of him aged 10 stealing eggs and chicks from a bird's nest. He had several notable brothers and sisters, including John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute (1744‚Äì1814); The Most Rev. and Hon. William Stuart (1755‚Äì1822), a clergyman who became Archbishop of Armagh, and James Archibald Stuart (1747‚Äì1818), another soldier who raised the 92nd Foot in 1779. His sisters were Lady Louisa Stuart (1757‚Äì1851), a writer who died unmarried, Lady Mary Stuart (c. 1741 ‚Äì 1824), who married James Lowther, later the 1st Earl of Lonsdale; Lady Anne Stuart (born c. 1745), who married Lord Warkworth, later the 2nd Duke of Northumberland; Lady Jane Stuart (c. 1748 ‚Äì 1828), who married George Macartney, later the first Earl Macartney; and Lady Caroline Stuart (b. 1763 ‚Äì 1813), who married The Hon. John Dawson, later first Earl of Portarlington.Cokayne, George Edward, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom Extant, Extinct, or Dormant. Military career =Early career= Stuart embarked upon a military career in 1768, when he enlisted as an ensign in the 37th Regiment of Foot. He purchased a lieutenancy in the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers) in 1770 and a captaincy in the 37th Foot in 1775. Late that year, he became a major commanding a battalion of the regiment, and saw service in the American War of Independence. In 1777, he was commissioned as a lieutenant-colonel of the 26th Regiment of Foot, which he commanded until 1779. On a visit home to England, he married Anne Louisa Bertie, daughter of Lord Vere Bertie, on 19 April 1778. He returned briefly to America, before coming back to London as a liaison to the ministry. A harsh critic of the Army's conduct, he was, however, highly favored by Sir Henry Clinton, with whom he corresponded regularly. His two sons were born after his return from America: *Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay (2 January 1779 ‚Äì 6 November 1845) *Captain John James Stuart (29 August 1782 ‚Äì 19 March 1811), died aboard his command, the frigate . John James's son Charles Stuart (1810‚Äì1892) was British Army general and MP. He was promoted to colonel in 1782, but his criticisms and the disfavor of George III towards his father prevented further military commands. He had been elected MP for Bossiney in 1776, succeeding his elder brother Lord Mount Stuart, who had been created Baron Cardiff. Stuart continued an MP for the remainder of his life, except the years 1794‚Äì1796, but showed little interest in politics. In 1792, on the death of his father, he inherited the estate of Highcliffe House in Hampshire. With the opening of hostilities against France by the First Coalition, he returned to active service. On 23 May 1794, he took command of the army in Corsica, and supervised the taking of Calvi (the action in which Horatio Nelson lost an eye). Col. John Moore was at the time his adjutant general. Stuart was promoted to lieutenant-general for this action, and on 24 October 1794, was made colonel of the 68th Regiment of Foot. However, his pride and violent temper led him to quarrel with Lord Hood, commanding the Mediterranean Fleet, and with the civilian viceroy of Corsica, Sir Gilbert Elliot, Bt. His partiality for Pasquale Paoli against Elliot, and other conflicts, led Stuart to resign in February 1795. On 25 March 1795, he left the colonelcy of the 68th for that of the 26th Regiment of Foot, which he held for the remainder of his life. =Defence of Portugal= He took command of a force sent to Portugal in January 1797 to defend Lisbon, and was notably successful in instilling discipline and spirit into the force, which was partly foreign in composition. =Capture of Menorca= In 1798, he was sent to attack Menorca (historically called \\"Minorca\\" by the British) with 3,000 men, an appointment heartily approved by Lord St Vincent, who praised Stuart as an excellent general and inspiring leader of troops. Though unequipped with siege artillery, he successfully dissimulated and bluffed the Spaniards into surrendering the island without loss of life, an exploit for which he was made a Knight of the Bath. From 15 November 1798 until 1800, he served as the British governor of the island. In March 1799, he responded to an appeal by Admiral Nelson (who, like St Vincent, thought him an excellent leader), and brought the 30th and 89th Regiments under Col.

For a variety of reasons King James I had upset many in the House of Commons in his first parliament. These included issues over the Court of Chancery's decision to deny Sir Francis Goodwin's place in the Commons, the imprisonment of Sir Thomas Shirley and his brother Sir Anthony Shirley, and the Bishop of Bristol's book favouring the King's ideas on a union between England and Scotland. The document claimed that James, a foreign king, was ignorant of the Commons' \\"privileges and liberties\\" that, the document purported, were their \\"right and due inheritance, no less than our very lands and goods.\\" A Commons' committee of more than seventy members was appointed on 1 June, on Sir Thomas Ridgeway's suggestion, to \\"take a survey of all the Acts and proceedings of the House, which have been excepted unto, or whereof any misinformation hath been given unto his Majesty, from the beginning of the session...\\" Approximately a fortnight later the committee had drawn up the document \\"to be presented to his Majesty\\" and on 20 June Ridgeway presented the draft to the Commons. Francis Bacon, who was a member of the committee, spoke against it. The document met opposition in the Commons, including committee members, and many doubted whether it was wise to present it to the King due to its tone and its claims. Parliament was prorogued on 7 July and the document was not debated again. The clerk requested to transcribe proceedings into the Commons' Journal and copied the document for half a page and left several sheets blank without completing it. The document was never passed by the Commons and therefore would not have been formally presented to the King. Historiography Early historians who wrote about this period, like Thomas Carte and David Hume, do not mention this document. In the nineteenth century Whig historians Henry Hallam and Samuel Rawson Gardiner claimed this document was a precursor of the battles between Charles I and Parliament and that from this point onwards the Commons was in near constant conflict with the monarchy until the Glorious Revolution of 1688 settled the conflict over the constitution. Geoffrey Rudolph Elton in 1965 criticised this traditional interpretation of the document by claiming that its viewpoints represented a minority opinion which was rejected by the Commons as being too extreme and that the constitution was much the same as it was under the Tudors.

Early life Chauncey Rose was born in Wethersfield, Connecticut to Scottish immigrants on December 24, 1794. Chauncey was one of eight children, all of whom died childless. Two of his brothers, George and John, went on to successful business careers in Charleston, South Carolina and New York City, New York, respectively. Rose was educated in the common schools of his Connecticut district, and at the age of 23 headed west to the states of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama to find a suitable place to enter into business. He decided upon western Indiana and settled in Rosedale, then known as Dotyville, in Parke County in 1819, where he first turned his attention to milling, building his first mill in Coxville just outside Rosedale. As his revenue grew, Rose expanded into other investment realms in nearby Terre Haute in Vigo County, which was developing into the commerce center of the region. Rose was instrumental in getting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under Major Cornelius A. Ogden, supervisors of the construction the Cumberland Road, to relocate their headquarters from Indianapolis to Terre Haute. When Terre Haute was awarded a district branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana in 1834, Rose furnished a facility in which the bank could operate while awaiting construction of the bank branch. This provided Major Ogden with a secure place to issue payroll. Rose then constructed a fine hotel east of the village, called The Prairie House, so that Ogden and other West Point graduates associated the Corps of Engineers would have a superb residence. This hotel later became the first Terre Haute House, so renamed by Rose in 1855. Business success Following a six-year stretch overseeing milling operations in Parke County, Rose moved back to Terre Haute to expand his businesses and became quite successful. His profits were in turn reinvested in real estate, and he amassed an even larger fortune, some of which he subsequently invested in railroads. In 1847, Rose was the principal founder of the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad, which was renamed the Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad in 1865. He also aided others, including William D. Griswold and Josephus Collett, to establish other railroads. Philanthropy Upon the death of his brother John, Chauncey learned that he was the sole heir to an estate worth $1,600,000. Concerned that the laws of New York would prevent the proper fulfillment of his brother‚Äôs wishes, Chauncey instituted legal proceedings and, after six years of court battles, won the right to disperse his brother‚Äôs estate. Chauncey distributed his brother‚Äôs money, totaling $1,500,000 to various charities, mostly in the New York area. Rose was equally generous with his money in Terre Haute, where his philanthropic activities were reported in an 1875 New York Times article to have exceeded $2,000,000 in currency of that day. Among his numerous benefactors were the Providence Hospital, the Free Dispensary and the Rose Orphan Asylum, to whom he endowed enough money to ensure it would remain permanent. Rose also contributed enough money to build and endow the Rose Polytechnic Institute (now the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology). The cornerstone for the college was laid on September 11, 1875, but it did not begin operations until March 5, 1883, long after Rose's death. It remains to this day one of the few colleges solely dedicated to science and engineering. Rose organized it as the Terre Haute School of Industrial Sciences with an initial endowment of $500,000, so that ‚Äúthis institution has a productive capital, exclusive of buildings‚Äù. Significantly, Rose intended none of the institutions funded or founded by him, save the incorporated name of Rosedale to bear his name. Other name ties resulting from posthumous commemorative changes by his grateful recipients. Rose died in Terre Haute, Indiana on August 13, 1877.

Any given measure is valid for only a short period of time, often less than a day. Above the freezing altitude, the temperature of the air is below freezing. Below it, the temperature is above freezing. The profile of this frontier, and its variations, are studied in meteorology, and are used for a variety of forecasts and predictions. Whilst not given on general weather forecasts, it is used on bulletins giving forecasts for mountainous areas. Measuring Dual-polarization radar image of an easily identifiable freezing layer, denoted by the yellow ring around the radar. There are several different methods to examine the structure of the temperature of the atmosphere: *A radiosonde attached to a weather balloon is the oldest and most common method used. Each area releases two balloons a day in locations hundreds of kilometres apart. *Measuring devices attached to commercial airliners permit reporting the isotherm, and its height, to aerial traffic. *Weather satellites are equipped with sensors which scan the atmosphere and measure the infrared radiation it emits. *Weather radar detects bright bands, which are radar echoes produced just underneath the isotherm caused by the melting of snow in the layer above 0 ¬∞C. *A wind profiler, an upward pointing radar, can detect the speed of precipitation, which is different for rain, snow, and melting snow. Depending on the frequency and resolution at which these readings are taken, these methods can report the isotherm with greater or lesser precision. Radiosondes, for example, only report a reading twice daily and provide very rough information. Weather radar can detect a variation every five to ten minutes if there is precipitation, and can scan a radius of up to two kilometres. Variations in the isotherm The isotherm can be very stable over a large area. It varies under two conditions: #A change in the density of air due to weather fronts. This changes the isotherm gradually, over tens of kilometres for a cold front, and hundreds for a warm front. #Local levels can be changed by wind, reflection of the sun, snow, and humidity level. These factors can cause the isotherm to change rapidly over several kilometres, in both winter and summer. Also, atmospheric subsidence and ascendence can contribute to variations in the isotherm. These conditions imply that the 0 ¬∞C isotherm varies globally.

Central block of Regent Court. Aerial view of Regent Court back gardens and car park 1930 info on Regent Court 1930 info on Regent Court Access balcony Rear view of the east wing of Regent Court Typical layout of 3 bedroom flat on Regent Court Regent Court is a block of flats in the Hillsborough district of Sheffield, England. It is located on Bradfield Road and is close to the Hillsborough shopping area and about half a mile from the Sheffield Wednesday football ground. The building was designed in 1936 by Edgar Gardham and completed in 1937; it was the largest housing complex in the city at the time. Little is known of the architect and he designed a similar apartment block that was in Duke Street, Sheffield; this was demolished after the Second World War. While he also designed some housing for local authority development in other parts of the country, Regent Court was his most well known commission. According to an article published in the Sheffield Daily Independent on Saturday 13 November 1937, the vision and capital to undertake the building came from Armin Krausz who travelled extensively, making a thorough study of this kind of building. The site was a man-made swamp because of its vicinity to the Nether Owlerton Dam that had served the Nether Owlerton Wheel works which meant that the footings for the building were much deeper than originally planned. Despite lying in a working class area, the building boasted high specifications and rents. With styling loosely inspired by in the Streamline Moderne style, it was arguably the first workers' housing of the modern movement in the UK, preceding the purer Kensal House in London by a year. Regent Court was built round three sides of a square with the open side facing south and is nine storeys high in the main block and seven storeys on the east and west wings with a central entrance leading to a communal lounge. The central block and each wing have a lift though these are quite small and slow; there is no service lift. In total, it comprises 202 flats, ranging from one to three bedrooms which are accessed along open balcony walkways. The heating at Regent Court was included with the rent as was the constant supply of hot water and the rates. Each flat was self contained and also had its own sun balcony; some of those have now been incorporated into the internal living space of the flat. Kitchenettes were equipped with modern devices and the bathrooms had both a toilet and a bath. There was an on site laundrette. Each flat owner has to contribute to the cost of upkeep/maintenance of the block and pay for things like the caretaker's wage, gardening, heating etc. When originally built, Regent Court had a Tennis court and gardens, some lock up garages and a children's playground. In the 1930s this was fairly far sighted. The proposed swimming pool and bowling green were never built, perhaps due to cost and possibly the war. An article written in the Sheffield Property Guide (Saturday 24 June 1972) stated that by the 1960s the flats had deteriorated to near slums and had new owners in 1971 who began renovating them. The renovations included the replacement of a leaky roof and the replacement of the coal fired heating system with an oil fired three boiler system; 3 new lifts were custom built at a cost of ¬£30,000. All empty flats were refurbished, including rewiring and redecorating and then offered for sale. Regent Court was renovated again the late 1990s after years of neglect and it is now a popular residential location. The flats were used in the film, The Full Monty and also on the artwork of Made in Sheffield, an album by Tony Christie (a former resident).

Mythology Slaying of NG∆Ø TINH During L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n's time, the people of Van Lang was still undeveloped and isolated. In the Eastern sea, there appears a giant Fish called Ng∆∞ Tinh (Vietnamese for \\"fish monster\\" or \\"fish spirit\\"). This fish has lived for centuries, with the size of its mouth, it can consume a ship with 10 fisherman at the same time. Whenever the Fish swim, waves can reach the sky, drown multiple ships, all the people passing through the area were all eaten by the fish. Ng∆∞ Tinh lives in a big cave under the sea, above the cave is a huge mountain which divide the sea into two areas. L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n decided to slay the beast to help the people. He built a huge ship, made a burning human-shaped piece of metal, then sailed straight to Ng∆∞ Tinh nest. There he held the human-shaped piece of metal up to trick Ng∆∞ Tinh. Ng∆∞ Tinh thought it was a human than opened its mouth and tried to swallow to burning metal. Qu√¢n threw the burning metal into Ng∆∞ Tinh's mouth. Ng∆∞ Tinh 's throat was burning, it struggled but tried to sink Qu√¢n's ship. Qu√¢n then took his sword out and slew the beast, slicing it into three pieces. Slaying of the nine-tailed fox After slaying Ng∆∞ Tinh, Qu√¢n went down to Long Bi√™n. There appears a nine-tailed fox that live for thousand years, called H·ªì Tinh (Vietnamese for \\"fox monster\\" or \\"fox spirit\\"). The fox lived in a deep cave, under a rock mountain in the West Long Bi√™n. This fox often disguised into human shape, lure the women, then bring them to the cave and feed on them. This fox has been harassing people from Long Bi√™n to T·∫£n Vi√™n mountain. The innocents were so afraid of the fox that they have to leave their homes, farms to other places in order to live peacefully. Qu√¢n brought his sword to the beast's nest and tried to slay the beast. When Qu√¢n reached the cave, the fox smelled human, then suddenly attacked, Qu√¢n then used magic to call the elements of wind and thunders to trap the beast. After 3 days, the beast has weakened, tried to find a way to run away. Qu√¢n caught the beast and sliced its head off. The beast revealed itself as a huge nine-tailed fox. Qu√¢n got into the cave and rescued everybody that was alive and tortured by the fox. Descendant of Dragon and Fairy L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n is a son of Long M·∫´u Th·∫ßn Long, the dragon goddess that rules the sky and the ocean. L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n was married to ƒê·∫ø Lai's daughter, √Çu C∆°. She gave birth to a sac of a hundred eggs, which were hatched into a hundred boys. One day, Qu√¢n confessed to her: \\"I am a descendant of the Dragon, you are descendant of the Fairy, fire and water cannot live together in harmony.\\" The two of them then divided their children. Fifty sons followed their mother to the mountainous north, the other fifty followed their father to live in the south; these children are ancestor of B√°ch Vi·ªát.

The NAACP offered to pay the bail for the remaining nine protesters but they refused, and on February 2, they began serving out their 30-day sentences on the county prison farm. After beginning their sentence on the county farm, the nine protesters were quickly given the appellation \\"Friendship Nine\\" by the press, and the case became famous nationwide. Motorcades of other protesters and supporters converged on the prison, and members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) came to Rock Hill and demonstrated; they too were arrested, jailed and refused bail. Over the course of the next year further demonstrations and arrests followed in Rock Hill, as well as in other cities throughout the United States. Protesters across the country adopted the \\"jail no bail\\" policy implemented by the Friendship Nine, and served out their jail sentences rather than helping to subsidize a system that supported segregation and inequality. These acts of heroism by the Friendship Nine and others helped to spur even larger protests like the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August 1963 and the famous march from Selma to Montgomery in March 1965. (..)\\"\\"The 'Jail, No Bail' strategy became a new tactic in the fight for civil rights. Documentary produced by South Carolina ETV documenting the key moment in civil rights history.\\" (Video and Audio)\\"(..) In previous sit-ins across the South, protestors were arrested, processed by the police, fined and then released, creating a dubious revenue stream from which many municipalities easily profited. But when the Friendship students went before the judge, they chose to serve their time behind bars. For the first time, not only did the city not collect its $100 per person, it actually had to pay to house and feed the men. (..) Word of their action spread like wildfire, receiving national media attention, including the New York Times. The ‚ÄúJail, No Bail‚Äù strategy became the new tactic that helped galvanize the civil rights protest movement. (..)\\"\\"(..) At the October 1960 SNCC strategy conference in Atlanta, some activists argue for \\"Jail-No-Bail\\" tactics. They take a Gandhian position that paying bail or fines indicates acceptance of an immoral system and validates their own arrests. And by serving their sentences, they dramatize the injustice, intensify the struggle, and gain additional media coverage. There is also a practical component to \\"Jail-No-Bail.\\" The Movement has little money and most southern Blacks are poor. It is hard to scrape up bail money, and sit-in struggles are faltering ‚Äî not from lack of volunteers to risk arrest ‚Äî but from lack of money to bail them out. Moreover, paying fines provides the cops with financial resources that are then used to continue suppressing the freedom struggle. By refusing bail, they render meaningless the no-money-for- bail barrier and by serving time they put financial pressure on local authorities who have to pay the costs of incarcerating them. (..)\\" which lessened the huge financial burden civil rights groups were facing as the sit- in movement spread across the South. They became known as the Friendship Nine because eight of the nine men were students at Rock Hill's Friendship Junior College. Background The first sit-in happened in February 1960 when four black students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University sat down at a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. The movement spread across the South, reaching Rock Hill on Feb. 12, when about 100 black students staged sit-ins at various downtown lunch counters. Over the next year, several sit-ins were held in the city. Ongoing demonstrations On Jan. 31, 1961, students from Friendship Junior College and others picketed McCrorys's on Main Street in Rock Hill to protest the segregated lunch counters at the business. They walked in, took seats at the counter and ordered hamburgers, soft drinks and coffee. The next day, 10 were convicted of trespassing and breach of the peace and sentenced to serve 30 days in jail or to pay a $100 fine. One man paid a fine, but the remaining nine ‚Äî eight of whom were Friendship students ‚Äîchose to take the sentence of 30 days hard labor at the York County Prison Farm. Their choosing jail over a fine or bail marked a first in the Civil Rights Movement since the 1960 Nashville sit-ins, and it sparked the \\"jail, no bail\\" strategy that came to be emulated in other places. A growing number of people participated in the sit- ins and marches that continued in Rock Hill through the spring and into the summer. Prison strikes Since these protestors chose prison instead of bail, they were sent to a work camp, where twice they refused to work, were put on bread and water as punishment. The nine In 2007 the city of Rock Hill unveiled an historic marker honoring the Friendship Nine at a reception honoring the men. At that time, eight of the Friendship Nine were living. * Robert McCullough (died on August 7, 2006) * John Gaines * Thomas Gaither (at the time, he was a field secretary with the Congress of Racial Equality and was the only one of the nine who was not a Friendship student) * Clarence Graham (died on March 25, 2016) * Willie Thomas [W.T. \\"Dub\\"] Massey (is now a Substitute teacher in the Rock Hill area) * Willie McCleod * James Wells (died on July 7, 2018) * David Williamson Jr. * Mack Workman The significance \\"What made the Rock Hill action so timely ... was that it responded to a tactical dilemma that was arising in SNCC discussions across the South: how to avoid the crippling limitations of scarce bail money,\\" wrote Taylor Branch in Parting the Waters, his Pulitzer Prize winning account of the Civil Rights Movement. \\"The obvious advantage of 'jail, no bail' was that it reversed the financial burden of the protest, costing the demonstrators no cash while obligating the white authorities to pay for jail space and food. The obvious disadvantage was that staying in jail represented a quantum leap in commitment above the old barrier of arrest, lock-up, and bail-out.\\" Convictions overturned In 2015, Judge John C. Hayes III (nephew of the original judge who sentenced the Friendship Nine to 30 days jail time at York County, SC chain-gang) of Rock Hill overturned the convictions of the nine, stating: \\"We cannot rewrite history, but we can right history.\\" At the same occasion, Prosecutor Kevin Brackett apologized to the eight men still living, who were in court. The men were represented at the hearing by Ernest A. Finney, Jr., the same lawyer who had defended them originally, who subsequently went on to become the first African-American Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court since Reconstruction.

Bay (; born 1960 in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois) is an American attorney. He is the former United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico. Bay was the first Chinese-American United States Attorney. Bay is the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He is currently a partner at the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Background A second- generation Chinese-American, Bay was born to a father of Hebei descent and a mother of Shanghai descent, who immigrated together to the United States after World War II. Bay was raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and graduated from Albuquerque Academy. He attended Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School. After law school, he clerked for Judge Otto Richard Skopil Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He then worked in the Legal Adviser's Office of the United States Department of State. From 1989 to 2000, he was a federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia and in New Mexico. Before becoming a United States Attorney, he was a supervisor of the Violent Crime Section in New Mexico. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, he tried cases in D.C. Superior Court and U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia and New Mexico. He also has experience in appellate advocacy and has argued a number of cases in the D.C. Court of Appeals, the D.C. Circuit, and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals that have resulted in reported opinions. United States Attorney Attorney General Janet Reno named Bay as the Interim U.S. Attorney in New Mexico on March 8, 2000. At the time Bay was named Interim U.S. Attorney, he was a supervisor in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Mexico and had been an Assistant U.S. Attorney for more than a decade. President Bill Clinton nominated Bay to the Senate on May 25, 2000, and the Senate unanimously confirmed Bay on September 8, 2000. As United States Attorney in New Mexico, Bay inherited the Wen Ho Lee case, which had been charged before Bay took office. This case involved a Chinese-American scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets. Six months after Bay became Interim U.S. Attorney, the case was resolved through a plea agreement. At the hearing, Judge James Parker criticized other top government officials but called Bay an \\"outstanding\\" member of the Bar whom he held in the \\"highest regard.\\" After his successor, David Iglesias, was confirmed by the Senate, Bay resigned as U.S. Attorney on October 15, 2001. Academia In the spring of 2002, Bay began teaching at the University of New Mexico School of Law. He became a tenured professor of law, and his subjects included constitutional law, criminal law, and evidence. His scholarship interests included national security law and criminal procedure, and he wrote in both of those areas. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission In 2009, Bay became the Director of Enforcement at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D.C. According to Reuters in 2012, \\"FERC‚Äôs Office of Enforcement, run by Norman Bay, has stepped up its game lately, taking the lead among regulators in cracking down on trades that cross both physical and financial markets.\\" In 2013, an energy trade journal named Bay as one of the top ten most influential people in energy. Harvard Professor William Hogan expressed concern about FERC's Office of Enforcement's practices. Hogan said the Office's practices were \\"alarming\\" and could \\"unravel\\" the power markets. In its case against FERC, Deutsche Bank stated that FERC's views were \\"radical,\\" though it later settled the case for nearly $1.7 million, including over $170,000 in \\"unjust profits\\" without admitting or denying wrongdoing. J.P. Morgan paid $410 million to settle the FERC investigation without admitting wrongdoing. J.P. Morgan stated \\"We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter.\\" On January 30, 2014, Bay was nominated by President Barack Obama as Commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and upon appointment to be made Chairman of the Commission. On May 20, 2014, Bay appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for his confirmation hearing. Bay was introduced by former Republican Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Senate Energy Committee member Martin Heinrich (D-NM). The former Energy Chairman testified, \\"The job that he is seeking demands somebody just like him,\\" Domenici said. \\"And obviously I would urge that this Committee support him. \\"I'm not a great fan of the President of the United States and people know that, but I think this is a great appointment. So I am on his side on this. I don't see how you can miss.\\" On June 18, 2014, the Committee approved Bay to lead FERC and he was voted out of committee 13-9. He was subsequently confirmed by the Senate 52-45 on July 15, 2014. Under his tenure, FERC moved up in rankings based on the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, and FERC was the highest rated mid-sized agency in 2017. Bay resigned from FERC in January 2017.

The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century (see the four French and Indian Wars, Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War). Eventually, the last of the colonial wars‚Äîthe French and Indian War‚Äîresulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region. After the war, many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies. Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana, where they became known as Cajuns, a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians. The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline, which helped galvanize Acadian identity. In the last century, Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada. As French settlers =Port Royal Habitation (1604-1613)= Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts built the Habitation at Port-Royal in 1605 as a replacement for his initial attempt at colonizing Saint Croix Island (present day Maine). The trading monopoly of de Monts was cancelled in 1607, and most of the French settlers returned to France, although some remained with the natives. Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just led a second expedition to Port Royal in 1610. =Arrival of the first European families= The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region. In the early years of Acadian settlement, this included recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women. Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites, for example, the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626.Buckner, P. and Reid J. (eds), The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History, Toronto University Press. 1994. There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites, and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities. Some settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia, such as La Tour's second wife, Fran√ßoise-Marie Jacquelin, who joined him in Acadia in 1640. Governor Isaac de Razilly's administration at LaHave, Nova Scotia, prepared the ground for the arrival of the first recorded migrant families on board the Saint Jehan, which left La Rochelle on 1 April 1636. There were a number of sailings from the French Atlantic Coast to Acadia between 1632 and 1636, but this is the only one for which a detailed passenger list has survived. Nicolas Denys, who was stationed across the LaHave River at Port Rossignol (Liverpool Bay), acted as agent for the Saint Jehan.Griffiths, 2005, p. 50 After a 35-day crossing of the Atlantic, the Saint Jehan arrived on 6 May 1636 at LaHave, Nova Scotia. There were seventy-eight passengers and eighteen crew members. With this ship, Acadia began a slow shift from being primarily a matter of explorers and traders, of men, to a colony of permanent settlers, including women and children. While the presence of European women is a signal that settlement was seriously contemplated, there were yet so few of them in this group of migrants that they did not immediately affect the status of Acadia as basically a colony of European transients. By the end of the year, the migrants were moved from LaHave and re-established at Port Royal. At Port Royal in 1636, Pierre Martin and Catherine Vigneau, who had arrived on the Saint Jehan, were the first European parents to have a child in Acadia. The first-born child was Mathieu Martin. In part because of this distinction, Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneury of Cobequid (1699). Kennedy (2014) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne and Aquitaine regions of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure. They were frontier people, who dispersed their settlements based on kinship. They optimized the use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit. They were hierarchical and politically active. The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity, egalitarianism, and independent-mindedness. The emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the adaptation of traditional French methods, institutions, and ideas to the Indigenous North American methods, ideas, and political situations.Gregory M.W. Kennedy. Something of a Peasant Paradise? Comparing Rural Societies in Acadie and the Loudunais, 1604-1755 (MQUP, 2014) = Civil war = St. John (1645) - d'Aulnay defeats La Tour in Acadia With the death of Isaac de Razilly, Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war (1640‚Äì1645).M. A. MacDonald, Fortune & La Tour: The civil war in Acadia, Toronto: Methuen. 1983 Acadia had two legitimate Lieutenant Governors. The war was between Port Royal, where Governor Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay was stationed, and present-day Saint John, New Brunswick, where Governor Charles de Saint- √âtienne de la Tour was stationed. In the war, there were four major battles. La Tour attacked d'Aulnay at Port Royal in 1640. In response to the attack, D'Aulnay sailed out of Port Royal to establish a five-month blockade of La Tour's fort at Saint John, which La Tour eventually defeated (1643). La Tour attacked d'Aulnay again at Port Royal in 1643. D'Aulnay and Port Royal ultimately won the war against La Tour with the 1645 siege of Saint John. After d'Aulnay died (1650), La Tour re-established himself in Acadia. 'Homme Acadien' (Acadian Man) by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur =English colony (1654‚Äì1667)= In 1654, war between France and England broke out. Led by Major Robert Sedgwick, a flotilla from Boston, under orders from Cromwell, arrived in Acadia to chase the French out. The flotilla seized La Tour's fort, then Port-Royal. La Tour, nevertheless, managed to find himself in England, where, with the support of John Kirke, succeeded in receiving from Cromwell a part of Acadia, along with Sir Thomas Temple. La Tour returned to Cap-de-Sable where he remained until his death in 1666 at the age of 73. During the English occupation of Acadia, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's minister, forbade the Acadians from returning to France. As a result of the English occupation, no new French families settled in Acadia between 1654 and 1670. =Post Treaty of Breda= Dutch conquest of Acadia (1674), which they renamed New Holland. This is the spot where Jurriaen Aernoutsz buried a bottle at the capital of Acadia, Fort Pentagouet, Castine, Maine. The Treaty of Breda, signed 31 July 1667, returned Acadia to France. A year later, Marillon du Bourg arrived to take possession of the territory for France. The son of LeBorgne, Alexandre LeBorgne, was named provisionary governor and lieutenant-general of Acadia. He married Marie Motin-La Tour, the eldest child of the marriage between La Tour and d'Aulnay's widow. In 1670, the new governor of Acadia, the chevalier Hubert d'Andigny, chevalier de Grandfontaine, was responsible for the first census undertaken in Acadia. The results did not include those Acadians living with local First Nations. It revealed that there were approximately sixty Acadian families with approximately 300 inhabitants in total. These inhabitants were predominantly engaged in aboiteau farming along the shores of the present-day Bay of Fundy. No serious attempt was made to increase the population of Acadia. In the spring of 1671, more than fifty colonists left La Rochelle aboard the l'Oranger. Others arrived from Canada (New France) or were retired soldiers. During this time, a number of colonists married with the local First Nations. Some of the first to marry were Charles de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour, Martin, Pierr√© Lejeune‚ÄìBriard, Jehan Lambert, Petitpas and Guidry. The captain, Vincent de Saint-Castin, the commander at Pentagoet, married Marie Pidikiwamiska, the daughter of an Abenakis chief. In 1674, the Dutch briefly conquered Acadia, renaming the colony New Holland. During the last decades of the seventeenth century, Acadians migrated from the capital, Port Royal, and established what would become the other major Acadian settlements before the Expulsion of the Acadians: Grand Pr√©, Chignecto, Cobequid and Pisiguit. Although not common, on occasion epidemics ravished the population of Ile St.-Jean, Ile Royale and Acadia. In 1732/33 more than 150 people died of smallpox on Ile Royale. The history of the settlers of Ile St.-Jean prior to the expulsion includes extreme hardship. For almost every good harvest year it seems that there was one in which crops failed. In one or two instances widespread fires destroyed crops, livestock and farms. Famine and starvation were common and frequently occasioned desperate pleas for supplies from Louisbourg, Qu√©bec and even France itself. In 1756, famine on Ile St.-Jean prompted authorities to relocate some families to Qu√©bec. Prior to the founding of Halifax (1749), Port Royal/ Annapolis Royal was the capital of Acadia and later Nova Scotia for most of the previous 150 years. During that time the British made six attempts to conquer Acadia by defeating the capital. They finally defeated the French in the Siege of Port Royal (1710). Over the following fifty years, the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the capital.  Colonial Wars  Samuel Scott, 1751; earliest known image of Acadians There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars (Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War) before the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages. The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710. They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians. While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants, Acadians' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British. During the first colonial war, King William's War (1688‚Äì97), the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian. The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto (1696). During Queen Anne's War, Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pr√©, Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704. The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal (1707) and the final Conquest of Acadia. The Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek (1711). Samuel Scott, Annapolis Royal, 1751 During Father Rale's War, the Maliseet raided numerous vessels on the Bay of Fundy while the Mi'kmaq engaged in the Raid on Canso, Nova Scotia (1723). In the latter engagement, the Mi'kmaq were aided by Acadians. During King George's War, Abbe Jean-Louis Le Loutre led many efforts which involved both Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq to recapture the capital such as the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744). During this siege, French officer Marin had taken British prisoners and stopped with them further up the bay at Cobequid. While at Cobequid, an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have \\"left their [the English] carcasses behind and brought their skins\\".(William Pote's Journal, 1745, p. 34) Le Loutre was also joined by prominent Acadian resistance leader Joseph Broussard (Beausoleil). Broussard and other Acadians were involved in supporting the French soldiers in the Battle of Grand Pr√©. During Father Le Loutre‚Äôs War, the conflict continued. The Mi'kmaq attacked New England Rangers in the Siege of Grand Pr√© and Battle at St. Croix. Upon the founding of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Broussard and the Mi'kmaq conducted numerous raids on the village, such as the Raid on Dartmouth (1751), to try to stop the Protestant migration into Nova Scotia. (Similarly, during the French and Indian War, Mi‚Äôkmaq, Acadians and Maliseet also engaged in numerous raids on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, to stop the migration, such as the Raid on Lunenburg (1756).) ‚Ä¢ Le Loutre and Broussard also worked together to resist the British occupation of Chignecto (1750) and then later they fought together with Acadians in the Battle of Beausejour (1755). (As early as the summer of 1751, La Valiere reported, approximately 250 Acadians had already enrolled in the local militia at Fort Beausejour.) When Charles Lawrence took over the post following Hopson‚Äôs return to England, he took a stronger stance. He was not only a government official but a military leader for the region. Lawrence came up with a military solution for the forty-five years of an unsettled British conquest of Acadia. The French and Indian War (and Seven Years' War in Europe) began in 1754. Lawrence's primary objectives in Acadia were to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg. The British saw many Acadians as a military threat in their allegiance to the French and Mi'kmaq. The British also wanted to interrupt the Acadian supply lines to Fortress Louisbourg, which, in turn, supplied the Mi'kmaq. =French and Indian War= St. John River Campaign: A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross (present day Gagetown, New Brunswick) by Thomas Davies in 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians. The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia. ‚Ä¢ Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians did not sign because they were clearly anti-British. For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath, there were numerous reasons why they did not. The difficulty was partly religious, in that the British monarch was the head of the (Protestant) Church of England. Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime. A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq. As a result, signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in danger of attack from Mi'kmaq. In the Grand D√©rangement (the Great Upheaval), more than 12,000 Acadians (three-fourths of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled from the colony between 1755 and 1764. The British destroyed around 6,000 Acadian houses and dispersed the Acadians among the 13 colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia. The single event that involved the most deaths of Acadians was the sinking of the Duke William. Although there were no purposeful attempts to separate families, this did occur in the chaos of the eviction. Siege of Louisbourg (1758)  Acadian and Mi‚Äôkmaq resistance  Marquis de Boish√©bert - Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot (1753) With the Expulsion of the Acadians during the French and Indian War, the Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadian resistance intensified. After the Expulsion began, much of the resistance was led by Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot. The Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq again engaged victoriously in the Battle of Petitcodiac (1755) and the Battle of Bloody Creek (1757). Acadians who were being deported from Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, on the ship Pembroke defeated the British crew and sailed to land. There was also resistance during the St. John River Campaign. Boishebert also ordered the Raid on Lunenburg (1756). In the spring of 1756, a wood-gathering party from Fort Monckton (former Fort Gaspareaux), was ambushed and nine of them were scalped.Webster as cited by bluepete, p. 371 In the April 1757, a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a warehouse near Fort Edward, killing thirteen British soldiers and, after taking what provisions they could carry, setting fire to the building. A few days later, the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland. Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq; some bands of partisans fought the British, including a group led by Joseph Broussard, known as \\"Beausoleil\\", along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick. Some followed the coast northward, facing famine and disease. Some were recaptured, facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour (renamed Fort Cumberland) until 1763. Some Acadians became indentured servants in the British colonies. Massachusetts passed a law in November 1755 placing the Acadians under the custody of \\"justices of the peace and overseers of the poor\\"; Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Connecticut adopted similar laws. The Province of Virginia under Robert Dinwiddie initially agreed to resettle about one thousand Acadians who arrived in the colony but later ordered most deported to England, writing that the \\"French people\\" were \\"intestine enemies\\" that were \\"murdering and scalping our frontier Settlers\\". In 1758, after the fall of Louisbourg, over 3,000 Acadians were deported to northern France. Resettlement attempts were tried in Ch√¢tellerault, Nantes, and Belle √éle off Brittany. The French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland became a safe harbor for many Acadian families until they were once again deported by the British in 1778 and 1793. =Re-establishing in Nova Scotia= After the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand-Pr√©. Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day. Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes. Beginning in 1764, groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana (which had passed to Spanish control in 1762). They eventually became known as Cajuns. Beginning in the 1770s, many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin, who guaranteed Catholic worship, land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion (At this time, Nova Scotia included present-day New Brunswick). However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters, who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands. Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in most cases isolated and infertile lands. The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry. Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included: *1767 St. Pierre et Miquelon *1772 census *1774 Founding of Saint-Anne's church; the Acadian school at Rustico and the abbey Jean-Louis Beaubien; the Trappistines in Tracadie *1785 Displacement from Fort Sainte-Anne to the upper Saint John River valley (Madawaska)  Nineteenth century  Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included: * Jean-Mand√© Sigogne (6 April 1763 ‚Äì 9 November 1844) was a French Catholic priest, who moved to Canada after the Revolution and became known for his missionary work among the Acadians of Nova Scotia. *1836 Simon d'Entremont and Fr√©d√©ric Robichaud, MLAs in N.S. *1846 Amand Landry, MLA in N.B. *1847, Longfellow publishes Evangeline *1854, Stanislaw-Francois Poirier, MLA in P.E.I *1854, the seminary Saint-Thomas in Memramcook, New Brunswick, becomes the first upper-level school for Acadians *1859, the first history of Acadia is published in French by Edme Rameau de Saint-P√®re; Acadians begin to become aware of their own existence =Acadian renaissance= Le Moniteur Acadien - first Acadian newspaper (1867) *1864 founding of the Farmers' Bank of Rustico, the earliest known community bank in Canada, under the leadership of Rev.

More than 5,000 Acadians participated in the convention. It was decided that August 15, the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, would be chosen to celebrate Acadian culture as National Acadian Day. Other debates at the convention centered around education, agriculture, emigration, colonization, and newspapers, and these same issues would arise at subsequent conventions. *At the second convention, on August 15, 1884, in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island, the Acadian flag, an anthem - Ave Maris Stella, and a motto - L'union fait la force were adopted. *1885, John A.

First elected to the legislature in 1952, he became provincial Liberal leader in 1958 and led his party to victory in 1960, 1963, and 1967. Robichaud modernized the province's hospitals and public schools and introduced a wide range of reforms in an era that became known as the New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program, at the same time as the Quiet Revolution in Qu√©bec. To carry out these reforms, Robichaud restructured the municipal tax regime, expanded the government and sought to ensure that the quality of health care, education and social services was the same across the province‚Äîa programme he called equal opportunity, is still a buzzword in New Brunswick. Critics accused of Robichaud's government of \\"robbing Peter to pay Pierre\\" with the assumption being that rich municipalities were Anglophone ones and poor municipalities were Francophone ones. While it was true that the wealthier municipalities were predominantly in certain English-speaking areas, areas with significantly inferior services were to be found across the province in all municipalities. Robichaud was instrumental in the formation of New Brunswick's only French-speaking university, the Universit√© de Moncton, in 1963, which serves the Acadian population of the Maritime provinces. His government also passed the New Brunswick Official Languages Act (1969) making the province officially bilingual. \\"Language rights\\", he said when he introduced the legislation, \\"are more than legal rights. They are precious cultural rights, going deep into the revered past and touching the historic traditions of all our people.\\" 1977, official opening of the Acadian Historic Village in Caraquet, New Brunswick. = Antonine Maillet = Born 1929 in Bouctouche, Antonine Maillet is an Acadian novelist, playwright, and scholar. Maillet received a BA and MA from the Universit√© de Moncton, followed by a Ph.D. in literature in 1970 from the Universit√© Laval. Maillet won the 1972 Governor General's Award for Fiction for Don l'Orignal. In 1979, Maillet published P√©lagie-la-Charrette, for which she won the prix Goncourt. Maillet's character \\"La Sagouine\\" (from her book of the same name) is the inspiration for \\"Le Pays de la Sagouine\\" in her hometown of Bouctouche. Twenty-first century In 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, a proclamation was issued in the name of Queen Elizabeth II, as the Canadian monarch, officially acknowledging the deportation and establishing July 28 as a day of commemoration. The day of commemoration is observed by the Government of Canada, as the successor of the British Government. = Acadian Remembrance Day = The F√©d√©ration des Associations de Familles Acadiennnes of New Brunswick and the Soci√©t√© Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as \\"Acadian Remembrance Day\\" in remembrance of all Acadians who died as a result of the deportation. The date December 13 was chosen to commemorate the sinking of the Duke William and the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from √éle-Saint Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger, disease and drowning in 1758.Pioneer Journal, Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 9 December 2009. The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star. = Acadian World Congress = Beginning in 1994, the Acadian community gathered for an Acadian World Congress in New Brunswick. The congress has been held every 5 years since then: in Louisiana in 1999, in Nova Scotia in 2004, in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick in 2009. The 5th Acadian World Congress was hosted in 2014 by a gathering of 40 different communities located in three different provinces and different states in two countries. Northwestern New Brunswick and T√©miscouata, Quebec, in Canada as well as Northern Maine in the United States joined hands to host the 5th CMA.

Its story is loosely based on real events of the titular Sengoku period in the history of feudal Japan. Sengoku Basara is considered to be popular in Japan with the video games getting good reviews and sales, winning some awards, becoming a cultural phenomenon, being cited as an example of games as art, and gaining a huge and strong fanbase. While Sengoku Basara remains popular in Japan, it has gained some popularity in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Even though the franchise isn't known well outside of Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, it maintains a small but strong fanbase even outside of those countries (mainly the US, UK, Germany, Russia, and Italy). Every console and handheld Sengoku Basara game in Japan has gotten a B rating (Ages 12+) except for Sengoku Basara 3 Utage which got a C rating (Ages 15+) from CERO. The franchise started with the first Sengoku Basara video game releasing in Japan on July 21, 2005, for the PlayStation 2. The franchise's producer is Hiroyuki Kobayashi (who has been the producer for every console and handheld game in the series except for Sengoku Basara Sanada Yukimura-Den, and is the creator of the franchise) and its director is Makoto Yamamoto (who has been the director for every console and handheld game in the series except for Sengoku Basara Sanada Yukimura-Den). Sengoku Basara serves as one of Capcom's flagship series in Asia. As of December 31, 2019, the game series has sold 4 million units worldwide.CAPCOM  Game Series Sales Games =Console and handheld games= Sengoku Basara (Devil Kings) Sengoku Basara (Êà¶ÂõΩBASARA) is the first game in the series and released in Japan on July 21, 2005, for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) as a hack and slash, action game. Devil Kings, an English-language version of the game, featured altered gameplay and a completely different, supposedly more western audience-oriented fantasy story with original characters. It was never used again due to the negative response the localization received from fans, critics, and consumers. Sengoku Basara 2 Sengoku Basara 2 (Êà¶ÂõΩBASARA2) is a sequel to the original Sengoku Basara, released in Japan for the PS2 on July 27, 2006. The game was ported to the Wii in 2007. An expansion titled, Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes, was released in 2007. The game marks the series' first anniversary and is also considered to have started the \\"Sengoku Boom\\" throughout Japan, which is still happening even today. The Sengoku Boom is basically a time period that sparked a renewed interest in the history of Japan (mostly the Sengoku period of feudal Japan, hence the name) where people in Japan go to museums, castles, and battlefields to learn about their favorite Sengoku Basara character(s) real life history, buy merchandise related to the game series and the Sengoku period, and buy video games involving the Sengoku period (mostly Sengoku Basara). Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes Sengoku BASARA 2 Heroes (Êà¶ÂõΩBASARA2 Ëã±ÈõÑÂ§ñ‰ºù) is an expansion to Sengoku Basara 2, and is the first expansion in the series. The game was released in Japan for the PS2 on November 29, 2007, and ported to the Wii later the same year.

They called themselves Mƒìxihcah (pronounced [meÀà Éika î]). The capital of the Aztec Empire was Tenochtitlan. During the empire, the city was built on a raised island in Lake Texcoco. Modern-day Mexico City was constructed on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish colonization of the Americas reached the mainland during the reign of Hueyi Tlatoani Moctezuma II (Montezuma II). In 1521, Hern√°n Cort√©s, along with an allied army of other Native Americans, conquered the Aztecs through germ warfare (germ theory not being established until 1560 by earliest records, this was an unintentional result of Europeans coming to the New World), siege warfare, psychological warfare, and from direct combat. From 1375 until 1428, the Mexica were a tributary of Azcapotzalco. The Aztec rulers Acamapichtli, Huitzilihuitl and Chimalpopoca were, in fact, vassals of Tezozomoc, the Tepanec ruler of Azcapotzalco. When Tezozomoc died in 1421, his son Malazia ascended to the throne of Azcapotzalco. Maxtla (as Malazia was also known) sought to tighten Azcapotzalco's grip on the nearby city-states in the Valley of Mexico. In the process, Chimalpopoca, tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, was assassinated by Maxtla's agents while Nezahualcoyotl of Texcoco was forced into exile. Arrival in the Valley of Mexico In the Valley of Mexico (c. 1250 AD), there existed numerous city-states, including Chalco, Xochimilco, Tlacopan, Culhuacan, and Atzcapotzalco. The most powerful were Culhuacan on the south shore of Lake Texcoco and Azcapotzalco on the west shore. As a result, when the Mexica arrived in the Valley of Mexico as a semi-nomadic tribe, they found most of the area already occupied. In roughly 1248,Smith (1984) p. 173. In arriving at 1248, Smith averages together dates from Fernando de Alva Cort√©s Ixtlilxochitl (1245), the Annals of Tlatelolco (1257), the Annals of Cuauhtitlanzx (1246), Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc (1247), and Diego Duran (1245). they first settled on Chapultepec, a hill on the west shore of Lake Texcoco, the site of numerous springs. In time, the Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco ousted the Mexica from Chapultepec and the ruler of Barbara, Cocoxtli, gave the Mexicah permission to settle in the empty barrens of Tizaapan in 1299. There they married and assimilated into Culhuacan culture. In 1323, they asked the new ruler of Culhuacan, Achicometl, for his daughter, in order to make her the goddess Yaocihuatl. Unknown to the king, the Mexica actually planned to sacrifice her. The Mexicah believed that by doing this the princess would join the gods as a deity. As the story goes, during a festival dinner, a priest came out wearing her flayed skin as part of the ritual. Upon seeing this, the king and the people of Culhuacan were horrified and expelled the Mexica. Forced to flee, in 1325 they went to a small island on the west side of Lake Texcoco where they began to build their city Tenochtitlan, eventually creating a large artificial island. It is said that the Aztec god, Huitzilopochtli, instructed the Aztecs to found their city at the location where they saw an eagle, on a cactus, with a snake in its talons (which is on the current Mexican flag). The Aztecs, apparently, saw this vision on the small island where Tenochtitlan was founded. Another Mexica (meÀêÀà Éi îka î) group settled on the north side of this island: this would become the city of Tlatelolco. Originally, this was an independent Mexicah kingdom, but eventually it was absorbed by Tenochtitlan, and treated as a \\"fifth\\" quadrant. The famous marketplace described by Hern√°n Cort√©s and Bernal Diaz del Castillo was actually located in Tlatelolco. In 1376 the Mexica elected their first tlatoani, Acamapichtli, following customs learned from the Culhuacan. These customs required cleaning daily nonstop as a ritual. Aztec Triple Alliance The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan would, in the next 100 years, come to dominate and extend its power to both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific shores. From the beginning of the Triple Alliance, Tenochtitlan was mostly in charge of the military and conquest, whereas the other two cities had other responsibilities. This military dominance of Tenochtitlan gradually led to this city becoming the dominant power in the alliance. When the alliance received tributes 2/5 went to Tenochitlan, 2/5 to Texcoco, and 1/5 to Tlacopan.Ancient Mexico and Central America =The reign of Itzcoatl 1427‚Äì1440= The first Tlatoani of the Triple Alliance was Itzcoatl and he, along with his Texcocan co-ruler Nezahualcoyotl, began expanding the territory dominated by the alliance towards the south, conquering Nahua-speaking cities like Cuauhnahuac (now Cuernavaca), and towards Huexotla, Coatlinchan, and Tepoztlan in the modern-day state of Morelos which was then dominated by the Tlahuica. During this period the Nahuan cities immediately on the lakeside, such as Xochimilco, Culhuacan and Mixquic were also subdued. =Moctezuma I and Tlacaelel 1440‚Äì1469= Two of the primary architects of the Aztec empire were the half-brothers Tlacaelel and Moctezuma I. They were sons of Huitzil√≠huitl, the 3rd Hueyi Tlatoani, half-brothers to Chimalpopoca, the 4th Hueyi Tlatoani, and nephews of Itzcoatl, the 5th. Moctezuma I succeeded Itzcoatl as the 6th Hueyi Tlatoani in 1449. Tlacaelel became the power behind the throne and reformed both the Aztec state and the Aztec religion. Moctezuma I began the expansion in earnest. First he had to reconquer towns which were first conquered by Itzcoatl, but had since rebelled. He asked a number of smaller cities to contribute to the construction of a new Great Temple, and only Chalco refused, which caused Moctezuma to start a war against them which lasted for several years. He then conquered Huastec territory under a pretext of securing Aztec merchants in that area, and then he went to war against the Mixtecs of Coixtlahuaca. Coixtlahuaca was successfully conquered although the Mixtec ruler Atonal received military assistance from the Nahua states of Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco, by now enemies of the Aztecs. After the defeat of Coixtlahuaca many Mixtec artisans were relocated to the Aztec capital.According to Richard Townsends \\"The Aztecs\\" pp88. Thames and Hudson 1992. Later Moctezuma marched upon the Totonacan cities of Vera Cruz and conquered Xalapa, Cosamaloapan, Cotaxtla (modern day Cuetlachtlan), Ahuilizapan (Modern day Orizaba) and north into Huastec territory conquering Tuxpan and Xilotepec. Tlacaelel Tlacaelel was one of the primary architects of the Aztec empire. Rising to prominence during the war against the Tepanec in the late 1420s, Tlacaelel wielded power as something of a Grand Vizier during the reigns of four Hueyi Tlatoani, until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people and elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to the top of the pantheon of gods. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Dur√°n). During the reign of Moctezuma I, he instigated the flower wars in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. At the start of Tlacaelel's tenure, the Mexica were vassals. By the end, they had become the Aztecs, rulers of a socially stratified and expansionistic empire. =The reigns of Axayacatl 1469‚Äì1481 and Tizoc 1481‚Äì1486= Moctezuma I's son, Axayacatl, ascended to the throne in 1469. During his reign, Tenochtitlan absorbed the kingdom of Tlatelolco. Axayacatl's sister was married to the tlatoani of Tlatelolco, and, as a pretext for war, Axayacatl declared that she was mistreated. He went on to conquer the Matlatzinca and Mazahua cities of Tollocan, Ocuillan, and Malinalco west of the Valley of Mexico. At this point Tenochtitlan experienced a brief \\"civil war\\" when the small city of Tlatelolco, considered a part of Tenochtitlan by the Aztecs, rebelled under their Tlatoani Moquihuix, who sought to ally himself with the longstanding enemies of the Tenochca, the Chalca, Tlaxcalteca, Chololteca and Huexotzinca. The Tlatelolca were defeated and Axayacatl then ordered the execution of all the rulers who had aided him, including the ruler of Xochimilco. Continuing campaigns in the west in 1479, he suffered an unprecedented defeat by the Pur√©pechas at Tzintzuntzan. This was the Aztecs' first great defeat; once recovered he had to consolidate control of the Huasteca region which had already been conquered by his predecessor. In 1481 Axayacatl's brother Tizoc ruled briefly, but his rule was marred by the humiliation he received in his coronation war: fighting the Otomies at Metztitlan he brought home only 40 prisoners for sacrifice at his coronation ceremony.Townsend, Richard 1992. pp 96. After this defeat Tizoc had to fight principally to maintain control of the already conquered territories, and failing to subdue new towns he was replaced, possibly poisoned, by his younger brother Ahuitzotl. =The reign of Moctezuma II Xocoyotzin= Moctezuma II was, although many sources depict him otherwise, a notable warrior who extended the tributary system, and consolidated the conquests made by his predecessors as well as conquering new territories. His campaigns reached as far south as Tapachula in the Soconusco region and the Chontal Maya states of Xicallanco in Tabasco. Only the Aztec archenemies of Tlaxcala, Huexotzinco and the Pur√©pecha remained undefeated, as well as the Mixtec kingdoms of Tututepec and Yopitzinco which didn't interest the Aztecs. Thus the Aztec Empire had its largest geographical extent when the Spaniards arrived in 1519. In some sources, it claims that Moctezuma II, and the Aztecs, believed the arriving Spanish to linked to the supposed return of an exiled god, Quetzlcoatl, who was supposed to return pale and bearded. Fall of the Aztec Empire :For more on the conquest of Mexico by Spain, see also Spanish Conquest of Mexico, Siege of Tenochtitlan, and Hern√°n Cort√©s. The Aztecs were conquered by Spain in 1521 after a long siege of the capital, Tenochtitlan, where much of the population died from hunger and smallpox. Cort√©s, with 508 Spaniards, did not fight alone but with as many as 150,000 or 200,000 allies from Tlaxcala, and eventually other Aztec tributary states. It was not difficult for Cortes to find allies to fight with him, the Aztecs were not generally liked by the neighbouring city-states. Cuauht√©moc, the last Hueyi Tlatoani surrendered to Cort√©s on August 13, 1521. It took nearly another 60 years of war before the Spaniards completed the conquest of Mesoamerica (the Chichimeca wars), a process that could have taken longer were it not for three separate epidemics, including a rare strain of paratyphoid fever, that took a heavy toll on the remaining Native American population. The Spanish conquest of Yucat√°n took almost 170 years. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, most of the other Mesoamerican cultures remained intact. In fact, the conquest of the Aztec empire did not have an immediate impact on other Mesoamerican cultures. As allies of the Spaniards, the Tlaxcalans gained the most. The Spaniards would eventually break the alliance, but not until decades later.

Chapters  = The Spring Fair = Thorn, Gran'ma Ben, and the Bone cousins attend the spring fair: an annual market and festival that culminates in the Great Cow Race, which Gran'ma Ben always wins. Fone Bone is driven to jealousy when Tom, a handsome honey seller, flirts with Thorn. Phoney and Smiley Bone continue their work at the Barrelhaven Tavern, with Phoney sowing seeds of disquiet about Gran'ma Ben's fitness to compete in order to cheat the residents of their goods. = The Cave = Phoney Bone arranges bets placed on his \\"Mystery Cow\\" (Smiley in disguise), intending that the latter purposely lose to justify Phoney's seizure of livestock placed at stake; whereas Thorn has a vivid dream of herself as a young child surrounded by dragons. She tells Fone Bone the dream is recurrent, and stimulated by her seeing his map, and records a childhood memory. = The Mystery Cow = When Lucius Down convinces the townsfolk the Bones are deceiving them, Phoney and Smiley stage a charade to convince people that the Mystery Cow is indeed real. Fone Bone's attempt to write a love poem to Thorn is interrupted by the Two Stupid Rat Creatures (introduced in the initial book). = The Great Cow Race = At the beginning of the race, Lucius bets his tavern on Gran'ma Ben, against the other bets placed on Smiley; and Phoney, in panic, joins Smiley in his cow costume, in hope of thus winning the race. When Gran'ma Ben tries to unmask the duo, they arouse a Rat Creature patrol, and the Two Stupid Rat Creatures pursue Fone Bone through the same encampment. This converts the race into a stampede of cows, Rat Creatures, and Bones; but Gran'ma Ben wins the race. = Lonesome Road = After the race, Phoney and Smiley are forced to work off their debts washing dishes at the Barrelhaven Tavern and repairing Gran'ma Ben's farm. Lucius and Ben discuss the situation, and conclude that the Bones are not to blame. = Up on the Roof = A vignette centering on Smiley Bone and Lucius Down as they fix the roof of the farm house, wherein Lucius becomes frustrated by Smiley's clumsiness, and Smiley reflects that his \\"village idiot\\" role has not changed since leaving Boneville.  Video game  A video game adaptation of The Great Cow Race, developed by Telltale Games, is available for the PC, and is a follow-up to their earlier Bone: Out from Boneville title.

It marks the conclusion of the first part of the saga, titled \\"Vernal Equinox\\". The book was first published by Cartoon Books in its original black-and-white form in 1996. Paperback and hardback coloured editions were published in 2006 by Scholastic.  Synopsis  = Watch Duty = The two Stupid Rat Creatures, in hiding after The Great Cow Race, are congratulated by Kingdok for their role in its disruption. Thorn has a vivid dream where she, dressed in a regal gown, is beckoned by the Hooded One, who then assumes Fone Bone's appearance. = Moby Bone = The Great Red Dragon interrupts Fone Bone's nightmare. The following day, Fone Bone asks him about the dream, and the Dragon hints that he entered the dream on purpose. Later, the Bone cousins are absorbed in rebuilding Grandma Ben's farm. = Road Trip = Lucius, Smiley, and Phoney return to Barrelhaven, but are diverted by Rat Creatures, and plunge into a river. At the farmhouse, Thorn and Fone Bone shelter from the rain in a barn and discuss each other's dreams, and question Gran'ma Ben for having lied to Thorn about her past and the Dragons. Suddenly, both Fone Bone and Thorn find Gran'ma listening to their conversation. = Double or Nothing = While Phoney, Smiley, and Lucius continue to Barrelhaven through the rain, Phoney wagers that he can better operate Lucius' tavern than can Lucius himself. When they arrive at the bar, the taverngoers immediately attack Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone, but Lucius objects, on grounds that their fiscal debts have been paid and that they earlier humiliated themselves by belief in Phoney's confidence trick. He then orders the bet to commence. = Eyes of the Storm = Fone Bone and Thorn follow Gran'ma Ben into the woods, and she argues that Fone Bone had woken the Dragon by coming to the valley. The trio are attacked by the Rat Creatures, and Fone Bone calls out to the Great Red Dragon for help; but when the dragon has repelled the Rat Creatures, Gran'ma Ben warns that Fone Bone may be disappointed by him in the future. = Mending Fences = When Gran'ma Ben apologizes to Bone for accusing him of causing trouble, Fone Bone shows her the map discovered in the initial book by Smiley, and she reveals that Thorn's parents were the monarchs of the realm throughout the generation-long war with the Rat Creatures, and that Thorn was moved from the palace during the \\"Nights of Lightning\\" (a series of surprise attacks by the Rat Creatures), to safety with the Dragons; but the escort party was betrayed by an accompanying nursemaid, and Thorn's parents killed. It is revealed that a dangerous, disembodied intelligence called the Lord of the Locusts has reawoken, and has the Hooded One under its command. = Dreams= Fone Bone attempts to comfort Thorn after Gran'ma Ben's revelations. At the tavern, Smiley Bone draws all the customers to the Bones' side of the bar by giving beer for no cost; but Phoney Bone stops him. The crowd are about to attack them, when Smiley Bone wishes that Fone Bone's dragon was there to protect them, and they demand what he means by this. = Things That Go Bump in the Night = Tales of a dragon draw the townsfolk to Phoney's side of the Barrelhaven bar, and Phoney proclaims himself a dragon slayer. A hooded stranger wearing a pendant with a royal crest visits the Barrelhaven, bringing Lucius news that a huge army of Rat Creatures is approaching. Gran'ma Ben, hearing the news from Lucius via Ted the bug, and fearing for Thorn's safety, presents Thorn with her old sword and shield and insists on departure.

The park contains several muti-purpose sporting pitches, cricket nets and a number of fitness installations. There is a playground in the southern area of the park and seating for picnics. Public toilets are next to the sports field. In the centre of the park is the Wentworth Park Sporting Complex. History Wentworth Park was initially a creek and swamp, known from the 1830s as Blackwattle Cove Swamp. Between the 1830s and 1860s various toxic industries were established along the shore, including, in particular, abattoirs and boiling down works. The pollution from these works befouled the swamp so that even after the removal of these establishments from the area, the local council lobbied to have the area in- filled because of the stench that continued to arise from the water and mud. Infilling of the creek and head of the swamp commenced in 1876 and continued until 1880. Silt dredged from the Sydney Harbour was used to carry out the process and numerous sea walls and dykes were constructed as part of the program. When the area was filled trustees were appointed to manage the new park and a competition was announced to design the new facility. After numerous complaints regarding the management of the competition the construction commenced and by 1882 opinion had turned favourably to the new ovals, greens, paths, lakes and other facilities offered in the park; named in honour of William Wentworth. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s the park came to serve as a focus for community activities including concerts, celebrations, moving pictures and in particular the home of Glebe Dirty Reds and sport in general. During the 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand an Australasian team defeated Great Britain at the ground before a crowd of approximately 15,000. The commencement of hostilities for World War I led to a downturn in patronage of the park's amenities although community functions, such as stretcher drills and polling were carried out here. The main effect of World War I was the introduction of a large number of timber sheds used to store wool for the war effort. These sheds lingered on at the park for a number of years after the war. = NSW rugby league venue = Wentworth Park was originally a rugby league sports ground in the Glebe area, the home ground of the Glebe Dirty Reds who were a part of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership at the time of the competition's inception. The ground was also home to Annandale rugby league team throughout their existence from 1910-1920. After the Glebe Dirty Reds were removed from the competition at the end of 1929, Balmain Tigers continued to play some of their home matches at the ground. The final game of first grade rugby league played at Wentworth Park was in Round 2, 1931 when the Balmain Tigers played against University with Balmain Tigers winning 29-14. A question over the use of league or grounds gatemen led the League to decide to use other grounds. From 1928 until 1936, Wentworth Park was also used as a speedway and was known as Wentworth Speedway. The first racing took place on 21 April 1928 and continued until 28 November 1936. Motorcycle speedway was the first category to use the venue, with competitors including future Speedway World Champions Lionel Van Praag and Bluey Wilkinson. Wentworth Park was the site of Sydney's first ever Speedcar race on 5 October 1935. The final speedway meeting was to have taken place on 5 December 1936, but track damage and noise complaints saw the meeting cancelled. Sporting Complex Wentworth Park Sporting Complex is a multi-purpose sporting facility Over the years, the facility has been used for various sports including soccer, rugby union, rugby league, greyhound racing, and speedway. Wentworth Park is located from the Sydney central business district. Greyhound racing is conducted at Wentworth Park on Wednesday and Saturday nights as well as some special events. Greyhound races are conducted over . The track is a sand surface having been converted from grass in the 1990s. Hurdle racing was a feature of Wentworth Park until the early 1980s. It fell away and annual events were held in December for a number of years until the mid-1990s. The nearby University of Technology, Sydney and other educational facilities regularly hold student examinations within two levels of the grandstand. Tenants to the Wentworth Park complex include Language Testing Consultants (LTC), the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE), the Greyhound Breeders, Owners and Trainers Association (GBOTA) and Ladbrokes. The infield oval is used by local schools as well other community sporting groups for sporting events. Since the 1980s, the Greyhound Owners Breeders and Trainers Association (GBOTA) has been the primary tenant of Wentworth Park (previously sharing with the now defunct NSW National Coursing Association Club). Greyhound racing is held at the venue every Wednesday and Saturday nights from 7.30pm.Times and Location Wentworth Park Greyhoundsa The biggest event of the year at Wentworth Park is the Group 1 Golden Easter Egg which provides prize money of 1,000,000 across the Easter carnival. The Carnival attracts approximately 25,000 racegoers. The final night is held annually on Easter Saturday. Wentworth Park is also the home ground of semi-professional association football club Balmain Tigers FC who play in the NSW State League Division 1, the third division of football in New South Wales. On 5 January 2018, it was announced that the Glebe Dirty Reds would return to Wentworth Park to play pre-season games which would be the first time that rugby league has been played there in 90 years. The matches also featured The Newtown Jets and The Blacktown Workers Sea Eagles. On 17 February 2019, the Glebe Dirty Reds played in a pre-season trial game against the North Sydney Bears at Wentworth Park; and won, 24-12. This was the first time the two clubs had met since 1929. The day also featured two other matches with the Newtown Jets playing against the North Sydney Intrust Super Premiership NSW side and Ryde- Eastwood against Sydney University rugby league team.

The project was named MX-774. The project was canceled in 1947, but leftover funds were used to build and launch three of the planned 10 research vehicles designated RTV-A-2.Kennedy, Gregory P, ‚ÄúThe Rockets and Missiles of White Sands Proving Ground 1945-1958,‚Äù Schiffer Military History, Atglen, PA, 2009 , p 63 The design included several innovations; the gimbaled thrust chambers provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile and the first two on the Viking (rocket). Also developed as part of MX-774 was the Azusa guidance system which was not used on the Hiroc missile but did contribute to the Atlas missile as well as many other early guided missiles launched from Cape Canveral.Rosenberg, Max, ‚ÄúThe Air Force and the National Guided Missile Program 1944-1950,‚Äù USAF Historical Division Liaison Office, June 1964, p 48 Design The Hiroc missiles were long, had a fin span (the maximum width of the rocket, accounting for the fins) of , a diameter of , an empty weight including payload of and a gross liftoff weight (GLOW) of . The missile's propulsion system consisted of a XLR35-RM-1 composed of four thrust chambers, built by Reaction Motors, which produced of thrust each and could independently swivel up to ten degrees on one axis.Sutton, George P, ‚ÄúHistory of Liquid Propellent Rocket Engines,‚Äù American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Reston Virginia, 2005 , p 314 The gimbaling motion was used to control the flight path of the missile, replacing the system of the V-2 missile that used moving fins placed within a fixed engine. English translation 1954. The gimbal system adds complexity to the engine mounting but preserves more of the energy of the rocket exhaust during maneuvering. The engine had a specific impulse of sea level. The Hiroc missile used liquid oxygen as its oxidizer, and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile had separate tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by two bulkheads.Kennedy, Gregory P, ‚ÄúThe Rockets and Missiles of White Sands Proving Ground 1945-1958,‚Äù Schiffer Military History, Atglen, PA, 2009 , p 63 The airframe of the rocket was supported by nitrogen gas pressure inside the tank, which could contain propellant or nitrogen gas when stored.Waller, Chuck, and Powell, Jerome ‚ÄúAtlas the Ultimate Weapon,‚Äù Apogee Books, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, 2005 , p 17 Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the empty weight by requiring less metallic components for structural reinforcement, but made the missile fragile because it required continuous pressurization. The RTV-A-2 Hiroc had an airframe to propellant ratio three times better than the V-2. The nose cone, which contained instrumentation, would separate from the rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its instruments and recording camera had to be able to survive recovery, rather than the entire rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimbaled thrust chambers, and the internal pressure supported airframe, would go on to utilized in the Atlas rockets. Several were made in the Atlas, such as the aluminum used for the missiles airframe of the Hiroc, was changed to stainless steel in the Atlas. The early Atlas utilized the MX-774 project developed Azusa interferometry based guidance system which served Cape Canaveral during the early space age.Waller, Chuck, and Powell, Jerome ‚ÄúAtlas the Ultimate Weapon,‚Äù Apogee Books, Burlington,Ontario, Canada, 2005 , p 16 The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much more powerful, generating a total of of thrust, compared to the Hiroc's total of thrust. History In April 1946, Convair received a 1.9 million dollar contract from the US Government under Air Material Command designation Material, Experimental-774B (MX-774B) to investigate the development of ballistic missiles. This was one of a large number of missile projects being studied by the US Army at that time, which included both ballistic missiles and a variety of long-range cruise missiles as well. The original of MX-774B called for a missile that could deliver a payload , and which had an accuracy that allowed it to deliver it to within of the target. The MX-774B project was headed by Karel Bossart, who would go on to head the creation of the Atlas rockets. Although development of the specification MX-774B was inspired by the German V-2 the MX-774B introduced several significant innovations, such as an integrated propellant tank, swiveling engines, pressurized body, and detachable nose cone.Waller, Chuck, and Powell, Jerome ‚ÄúAtlas the Ultimate Weapon,‚Äù Apogee Books, Burlington,Ontario, Canada, 2005 , p 16 As a result of drastic defense cuts in 1946 and for 1947 the USAAF's missile budget was cut in half from $29 to $13 million in what became known as \\"the black Christmas of 1946\\". Many of the projects were canceled outright, but MX-774 instead continued with reduced funding. The project was eventually canceled in June 1947 as the Army concentrated their efforts on cruise missiles, which were more promising at that time. Convair arranged to use the remaining contract funding to launch three of the rockets, which were named RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The tests took place at White Sands Proving Grounds. The three tests took place on 13 July 1947, 27 September, and 2 December. These tests validated the concept of using gimbaled engines for propulsion and guidance. Hiroc was flown from a pad 600 feet north the White Sands blockhouse. Tracking was provided Askania Cine theodolite, cameras, Sky-screen observers and four tracking telescopes and tracking radar. White Sands Proving Ground provided housing and support for the launch program.Kennedy, Gregory P, ‚ÄúThe Rockets and Missiles ofWhite Sands Proving Ground 1945-1958,‚Äù Schiffer Military History, Atglen, PA, 2009 , p 64 On the RTV-A-2 (MX-774), a camera recorded the flight data displayed upon an instrument panel. Both the number of parameters recorded and the survivability of the film record were limited. Therefore, dependence upon the intact recovery of this camera was problematic. During the test on 13 July, the Hiroc reached a maximum height of , but lost thrust after 12.6 seconds and hit the ground at 48.5 seconds, from the launch pad. Due to a mistake in packing, the payload recovery parachute failed to open; a camera and a few other instruments survived, so the test was deemed a partial success. During the test on 27 September, the Hiroc reached an altitude of at 48 seconds and a maximum velocity of . The parachute failed again, this time due to a battery problem; the Hiroc began to freefall before its oxygen tank exploded at . This caused it to break up, but a camera and some instruments survived. During the test on 2 December, the Hiroc reached a maximum height of and reached a maximum velocity of . The parachute failed to open yet again, this time due to the nose cone damaging it after being ejected, while the Hiroc was at an altitude of and moving at a speed of . The camera was recovered, although it was partly damaged. The third Hiroc had its nose compartment extended 34 inches to allow more instrumentation.Kennedy, Gregory P, ‚ÄúThe Rockets and Missiles of White Sands Proving Ground 1945-1958,‚Äù Schiffer Military History, Atglen, PA, 2009 , p 66 All three Hiroc missiles had partially failed due to premature closure of the liquid oxygen valve. The cause of failure was determined from a light on the instrumentation coming on when the valve closed. The cause of the valve closing was traced to vibration of solenoids which caused pressure change in the hydrogen peroxide line which allowed nitrogen to vent from engine control lines with the resultant pressure drop closing the LOX valve.Kennedy, Gregory P, ‚ÄúThe Rockets and Missiles of White Sands Proving Ground 1945-1958,‚Äù Schiffer Military History, Atglen, PA, 2009 , p 66 In late 1948 the Air Force proposed the continuation of the MX-774 program with an additional 15 missiles for high altitude research but the proposal was refused by the Research and Development Board's Committee on Guided Missiles which decided that the more capable Navy Viking Missile RTV-N-12 was a superior high altitude research vehicle.DeVorkin, David H., ‚ÄúScience With A Vengeance,‚Äù Smithsonian Institution, /Springer-Verlag New York, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1992/1993, p 178-179Rosenberg, Max, ‚ÄúThe Air Force and the National Guided Missile Program 1944-1950,‚Äù USAF Historical Division Liaison Office, June 1964, p 50 Convair retained the core design team after program cancellation. That core led to Convair proposing a missile to meet the Air Force Request For Proposal MX-1593 which ultimately resulted in the Weapon System 107A, better known as the B-65/SM-65 Atlas, America's first ICBM.Waller, Chuck, and Powell, Jerome ‚ÄúAtlas the Ultimate Weapon,‚Äù Apogee Books, Burlington,Ontario, Canada, 2005 , p 21-22 References =Citations= =Books=    * * =Websites=  Category:Experimental rockets of the United States Category:Intercontinental ballistic missiles of the United States Category:Atlas (rocket family) Category:Ballistic missiles ","title":"RTV-A-2 Hiroc"},{"id":"4885930","text":"The Regius Chair of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow was founded in 1861 by Queen Victoria, and is the only Regius Professorship in the Faculty of Arts. History The first professor appointed was John Nichol, a graduate of the University and Snell Exhibitioner at Balliol College, Oxford, and son of John Pringle Nichol, former Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University. Nichol had formerly been a coach at the University of Oxford, where along with A. V. Dicey, Vinerian Professor of English Law, philosopher Thomas Hill Green and poet Algernon Charles Swinburne he formed the Old Mortality Society, a literary discussion society. Whilst at Glasgow, Nichol maintained his strong reputation in literary criticism, lecturing at the same time at Oxford as well as tutoring privately across the country. He was also a supporter of the higher education of women. He left the Chair in 1889 and died in 1894. In 1885, the Nichol Prize for the most distinguished woman student in the Ordinary class of English Literature was founded by his sister, Lucy Jack. Nichol was succeeded in 1889 by Andrew Cecil Bradley, a highly respected literary critic and noted scholar of Shakespeare, and brother of philosopher Francis Bradley. Bradley had studied at Balliol College, Oxford, and was at the time of his appointment a lecturer at University College Liverpool, now the University of Liverpool. In 1892, Bradley described his Glasgow students as \\"a set of savages whom it is a loathsome drudgery to teach,\\" although he remained at the University until 1900, and in 1901 was elected Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford. He delivered the 1907-1908 Gifford Lectures at the University. The Bradley Chair of English Literature was named after him, and his name was placed on the Memorial Gates erected to mark the University's quincentenary in 1951. The Gifford Lectures, a series of which Bradley delivered at the University, were instituted by the will of Adam Gifford, Lord Gifford, and it was his nephew, Walter Raleigh, who succeeded Bradley in the Regius Chair in 1900. Raleigh had studied at University College London and King's College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union, and was appointed the first Professor of English Literature at the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh, India.

It collects issues 20-27 of Jeff Smith's Bone comics. This volume marks the beginning of the second part of the Bone saga, entitled ‚ÄúSolstice‚Äù. The book was first published by Cartoon Books in its original black-and-white form in 1997. Paperback and hardback coloured editions were published in 2006 by Scholastic. This volume follows the deepening hostilities in between the inhabitants of the valley and the Rat Creatures and their allies. Further secrets from Thorn's past are revealed, and Phoney Bone appoints himself the town dragon slayer. This one has a much darker character than the previous books, evidenced in part by moments such as the one in which Thorn cuts off Kingdok's arm.  Synopsis  = Business = Following the message that a Rat Creature army is crossing the Eastern border, Fone Bone, Thorn, and Gran'ma Ben travel off-road to Barrelhaven. En route, Gran'ma Ben suffers an attack of her ‚Äúgitchy feeling‚Äù - a dizziness and her omen of impending trouble. At the Barrelhaven tavern itself, Phoney Bone's tales of dangerous dragons make his end of the bar the most popular. Lucius attempts to call off the bet, but Phoney declines. = Earth & Sky = After fending off their ambush, Gran'ma Ben captures one of the Two Stupid Rat Creatures and learns from him that the Rat Creatures are under orders to evacuate the valley. Kingdok attacks the party; but Thorn slices off Kingdok's right arm, whereupon Kingdok, in a haze of pain, identifies Ben and Thorn as the queen and crown princess of old, and retreats. Smiley Bone, hearing Fone Bone's cries of distress, rushes out with the townsfolk to look for him, but they only find the scene of the fight. = Council in the Dark = The two Rat Creatures find the senseless Kingdok and blame themselves for his wound. As Thorn dresses Gran'ma Ben's wounds, Ben reveals to Thorn that she is a ‚ÄúVeni-Yan Cari‚Äù: an individual empowered by innate control of ‚ÄúThe Dreaming‚Äù (the subconscious mental existence of intelligent creatures), and therefore desired by the Hooded One. Angered that her past has been concealed from her, Thorn leaves for the Barrelhaven alone. Fone Bone makes to follow her, and Gran'ma Ben gives him her sword and a pendant bearing the royal crest, with instructions to show it to Lucius. The minute Fone Bone leaves, she runs into the woods. When Thorn and Fone Bone arrive at Barrelhaven, Phoney Bone has taken control of the town and barricaded the roads. = The Straggler = The Hooded One brings news to the Lord of the Locusts that the armies of Pawa in the South have joined their cause, and the kingdom of Atheia has fallen to them. At Barrelhaven, Phoney Bone has stockpiled many of the townspeople's goods in payment for his ‚Äúprotection‚Äù. Late one night, Fone Bone finds a baby rat creature scrounging in the garbage. Staying at the inn that night, Thorn is once again visited by the Hooded One in her dreams; this time revealing its face like young Gran'ma Ben's. She is only saved when Fone Bone wakes her to tell her about the Rat Creature cub and presents it to her. Thorn becomes furious at the sight, remembering how her parents were killed by Kingdok and threatens to kill it if Fone Bone doesn't kick it out. = Deliver Us These Laws = Lucius Down, after searching for Gran'ma Ben for two days, returns to find the town barricaded, and orders the fences to be torn down; but the townsfolk, terrified of dragons, refuse him. In the barn, Smiley Bone adopts the Rat Creature cub as a pet. Fone Bone meets with Lucius, who fears that the Rat Creatures evacuating the valley could be a precursor to another sneak attack like the Nights of Lightning. Smiley is shocked to learn that Thorn is a princess. Meanwhile, the Hooded One addresses the Rat Creatures and men from Pawa and orders them to prepare for war. = The Midsummer Day's Plan= Phoney continues to press the townspeople for his ‚Äúdragon slayer‚Äù fees. Meanwhile, Thorn decides to leave the town and return to the farmhouse. In the mountains enclosing the valley, the Rat Creature army and the Pawan's have massed under the instructions of the Hooded One, in preparation for an invasion. = The Turning = Fone Bone and Smiley sneak the Rat Creature cub out of the walled compound to release it, but when Smiley strays out of sight with the cub, Fone is forced to go after them. Thorn tries to return to the farmhouse, but she collapses with exhaustion on the way, where four Veni Yan monks return her sword, which she left at the Barrelhaven. In her dream, she meets the Great Red Dragon, who convinces her not to run away. The next morning, Phoney Bone rallies the townsfolk to carry him and his fees into the mountains where he tells them, he will capture and kill a dragon. = On the Dragon's Stair = Phoney and the townspeople reach the Dragon's Stair, a pass high in the mountains, where Phoney arranges a dragon trap; a ruse as part of his plan to make off for Bonneville with his new wealth, but the plan becomes complicated when the Great Red Dragon deliberately walks into the trap, at the behest of Ted. The townspeople urge Phoney to kill the dragon; but just as he is about to reluctantly do so, Thorn stops him, and shows the townsfolk smoke from the Rat Creature army advancing toward Barrelhaven. A pack of Rat Creatures encounters the party. Thorn, with the four Veni Yan monks alongside her, drive the Rat Creatures back, and Phoney uses Thorn's sword to free the dragon. The dragon and Veni Yan monks chase the Rat Creatures away, and Thorn instructs the townsfolk to arm themselves, as they finally realize they are at war with the Rat Creatures.

First begun as a pilot program with the 2006 ARM-TRAIN conference hosted by the California State Railroad Museum, beginning in 2010 all Spring and Fall meetings scheduled for the future will be held jointly. In 2011, it was decided to merge the two organizations into a single organization, the Association of Tourist Railways and Railway Museums (ATR&RM;). In November 2012, a formal vote on the proposal was held, with the majority of the members voting in favor of the merger. In 2013, the Association of Railway Museums formally merged with the Tourist Railway Association, Inc. to become the Association of Tourist Railways and Railway Museums. The first Fall meeting of the new organization was hosted by the Orange Empire Railway Museum at Riverside, California in October 2013. It was quickly acknowledged that the name Association of Tourist Railways and Railway Museums while descriptive, was also ungainly. In 2017 it was decided to change the organization's name to the HeritageRail Alliance and update the branding and website accordingly.

It collects issues 33-37 of Jeff Smith's self-published Bone comic book series. It marks the conclusion of the second part of the saga, entitled Solstice. The book was published by Cartoon Books in its original black-and-white form in 1999, and in color by Scholastic Press in 2007. This book reveals more of the plotting between The Hooded One and the Lord of the Locusts, and follows the inhabitants of the valley as they pick up the pieces after the attacks by the Rat Creature army.  Synopsis  = Cranky Groundhog = Fone Bone is trying to climb a tree so he can see the whole valley while Smiley Bone is at the bottom to catch Fone Bone. A groundhog starts to complain that Smiley is in his hole. then Fone Bone falls into the groundhog's hole. Ted finds them and the groundhog gets scared about rumors going around that Fone Bone had killed Kingdok. Fone Bone is outraged by this, so he, Smiley, and Ted go to warn Thorn. = The Hollow Tree = The villagers are with Phoney Bone and Thorn, who save the other villagers before the rat creatures come. When they do come, they talk about \\"the one who bears the star.\\" Euclid, still mad about Phoney's dragonslayer scheme, starts to threaten Phoney. = Dragons in the Earth = Thorn has left in the night in search of Fone Bone, while Phoney Bone and three of the villagers head for Old Man's Cave, where they are met by Gran'ma Ben and Lucius. Meanwhile, Fone and Smiley have made it down from the mountains. They are ambushed by Rat Creatures, but Thorn scares the Rat Creatures off. Deep in the mountains, the Lord of the Locusts has doubts that ‚Äúthe one who bears the star‚Äù (Phoney Bone), with whom the Hooded One seems obsessed, is as powerful as the Hooded One believes, but allows the search for him to continue. = Protection Spell = Thorn, Fone, and Smiley lie low for a few days while planning an attack on The Hooded One. Thorn explains how she believes The Hooded One plans to use her and Phoney to speed the release of the Lord of the Locusts from the stone of the mountains. She also explains her mistrust of Gran'ma Ben - Thorn believes the tale of how her parents were betrayed by the nursemaid is a lie; she never had a nursemaid. Meanwhile, The Hooded One approaches Roque Ja and asks him to recapture the Bones. At Old Man's Cave, the survivors of the Rat Creature attack are gathered, along with a large group of Veni Yan warriors. Gran'ma Ben tells Phoney Bone that the dragons' Queen, Mim, kept the Dreaming in balance until the Lord of the Locusts drove her insane, and the other dragons were forced to turn Mim to stone. The Hooded One, she tells him, wants to sacrifice him to free the Lord of the Locusts. = Wolf Call = Thorn returns to the farmhouse to collect her belongings. She plans to take on The Hooded One alone; but the Bones convince her to trust Gran'ma Ben, and the three set off for Old Man's Cave. Meanwhile, a patrol of villagers and Veni Yan warriors, led by Lucius Down, scout the area for Rat Creatures. Lucius comes across The Hooded One, who assumes the appearance of the woman killed along with Thorn's parents: alive and not looking a day older, to distract Lucius from the Rat Creatures' attack. Later, at Old Man's Cave, with no word of Lucius Down and his scout party, Gran'ma Ben continues filling in Phoney on the history of the valley and the nature of the Dreaming. Soon after, Lucius' party arrives at the cave, many of them wounded, with a pack of Rat Creatures still in pursuit. = Blood Moon = Lucius Down relates to Gran'ma Ben that the Hooded One is her now-undead sister, Briar Harvestar. Gran'ma Ben tells him that despite pleading with the council of dragons at Deren Gard, they refused to get involved in the fight, meaning the valley folk must face her and her Rat Creature armies alone. The villagers argue over whether or not to hand Phoney Bone, ‚Äúthe one who bears the star‚Äù, over to The Hooded One to appease her, and in the confusion Phoney slips away, leaving his star-bearing shirt behind. Gran'ma Ben goes after him, but Roque Ja attacks her. Thorn and Fone enter the fray, but she and Phoney are captured. Fone Bone, knocked senseless, sees in his dreams the Great Red Dragon, who hands him the royal medallion and orders him to save Thorn. Some time later, at the ancient temple high in the mountains, The Hooded One prepares to sacrifice Phoney to the Lord of the Locusts. Phoney insists that there is a case of mistaken identity and that Briar has the wrong person, but she reveals a huge inflatable likeness of Phoney: the runaway balloon from his failed attempt to become Mayor of Boneville. With its fierce expression and the banner reading ‚ÄúPhoncible P. Bone will get you‚Äù (the end torn off; intact it read ‚Äú...will get your vote‚Äù, as Phoney explains), Briar took it as an omen that he would challenge her, and that she could sacrifice him to free the Lord of the Locusts. Gran'ma Ben confirms Briar's mistake, and the locusts that supported Briar's shriveled body leave her, as punishment by the Lord of the Locusts, and try to enter Thorn, but Fone Bone drives them away with the royal medallion, and Thorn then joins the others from the collapsing mountain temple.

It collects issues 38-43 of Jeff Smith's self-published Bone comic book series and marks the beginning of the third and final part of the saga, entitled Harvest. The book was published by Cartoon Books in black-and-white in 2001 and in color by Scholastic Press in 2008.  Synopsis  = End Times = At the besieged fortress of Old Man's Cave, the Headmaster of the Veni Yan summons Wendell, the village tinsmith, and explains that the current unrest is not the fault of the Bones. Thorn, he explains, may be sought by the Hooded One. The mountain erupts as the Lord of the Locusts stirs beneath it, and the armies massed outside the fortress begin their attack. The Lord of the Locust resurrects his servant Briar, and sends her to \\"seek out our missing powers and return them to us\\". The Bones, Thorn, and Gran'ma Ben flee the collapsing mountain, pursued by Kingdok. As they descend through the tunnel discovered in a previous volume, Fone warns everyone of possible hallucinations; and indeed, Fone and Phoney become costumed as Ishmael and Captain Ahab. Upon leaving the tunnel, they find the valley covered in ash and every tree flattened. = The Promise = Thorn leads the party across the valley, as the only one who can see and avoid the 'Ghost Circles': invisible pockets of unreality wherein nothing can live, and that separate the intact valley from the illusory wasteland. She and Fone brush the periphery of one, and are momentarily transported back into the forest as it stood before the devastation of the valley. Thorn explains that she can survive it, and even undo the spell, because she retains a piece torn from the Lord of the Locusts' soul. = Darker Truths = Thorn and Gran'ma Ben remain undecided whether to return to Old Man's Cave or press on to the old capital city of Atheia, but a troop of Rat Creatures blocks the route to Old Man's Cave. A scouting party of Rat Creatures discovers their camp and Thorn and Fone are separated from the others. As Ben fights off the Rat Creatures, her companions are rejoined by Bartleby (Smiley's tame Rat Creature cub). Thorn and Fone discover Briar leading the Rat Creatures to them. She reveals to Fone Bone that he too has a piece of the Lord of the Locusts' soul (a result of his and Thorn's stumbling into the Ghost Circle). Briar is about to kill Thorn, who is no longer necessary to her plans when Smiley and Bartleby come to the rescue. = Snap! Crackle! Pop! = Pursued by the Rat Creatures, the protagonists lure them into a massive field of Ghost Circles. At Old Man's Cave, Wendell hears the report that the villagers found Lucius Down alive. Wendell tells Lucius that his prot√©g√© Jonathan Oaks is alive, but Lucius deduces by the look on Wendell's face that Jonathan has died of his injuries. The Headmaster of the Veni Yan then asks Lucius where Gran'ma Ben and Thorn are, and Lucius believes them en route to Atheia, but the Headmaster distrusts him. = The Root Cellar = Bartleby warns Thorn's party that Smiley Bone has collapsed in hunger; Phoney Bone asks Thorn for food but hears that all outside the Ghost Circles is destroyed. She and Fone Bone, therefore, enter a Ghost Circle, and thence the root cellar of a farmer's family, where they obtain apples. Here, they hear voices of the farmer's family pleading for help and telling her there is a message from her mother, to \\"seek out the Crown of Horns\\" and to take the piece of the Locust from Fone Bone. Thorn does so, and withdraws herself, Fone, and the apples from the Circle. At Old Man's Cave, Wendell hears from Lucius that the latter was Briar and Rose's bodyguard in his youth but mistakenly became enamored of Briar. Wendell tells him that Euclid has been missing since the volcano erupted, and Lucius decides that they all go to Atheia together. = Prayer Stones = With the piece of the Locust inside her, Thorn grows rapidly weaker. With Phoney and Gran'ma Ben carrying Thorn, the party continues through the Dragons' burial grounds of Tanen Gard, and Thorn is revived by the sacrality thereof. They soon reach the ridge and find the valley beyond clear of the devastation of the Ghost Circles. The presence of Prayer Stones (idols left by Athenians for the Dragons) shows that the Old Kingdom is still alive. As they continue towards the city of Atheia, a lone Locust is seen on one of the prayer stones. At Old Man's Cave the villagers demand of the Veni Yan that they release Lucius and allow an exodus to Atheia. The Veni Yan initially try to stop them, but Lucius convinces them to accompany his party.

It collects issues 50-55 of Jeff Smith's self-published Bone comic book series. The book was published by Cartoon Books in 2004. The color version was published by Scholastic Press and released on January 21, 2009.  Synopsis  = The Dungeon and the Parapet = The chapter starts with Thorn's dream of Briar, Queen Lunaria, and Lunaria's husband the king at Dragon's Stair, where Thorn is given to her grandmother, Rose Harvestar/Gran'ma Ben, who delivers her to the Great Red Dragon; almost at the same moment, Thorn's parents are killed. Thorn rides the dragon underground into the cavern containing a bright light. The Great Red Dragon asks Thorn to look into the light, whereupon she mentions a frozen waterfall. After trying to see past this, she sees her mother, who asks her to seek the Crown of Horns. Thorn then wakes, and readers learn that Tarsil's soldiers had beaten and imprisoned Thorn and Fone Bone; each losing a tooth in the process. Meanwhile, Gran'ma Ben, on the city walls, throws an interfering Vedu off the wall and two Veni-Yan monks immediately recognize her and re-enter her service. Briar's army arrives at the main gate and Tarsil defies them. In their conversation, Tarsil reveals his facial injures, received from fighting dragons, to Briar, who responds by making her face an image of his former appearance and cuts him into two halves (possibly a reference to the manner of her own death), and declares the attack. Gran'ma Ben immediately takes charge of the city's army and orders the defense. In the dungeon, Fone Bone hears the fight and shouts for the guard; but learns that Smiley and Phoney are in the next cell, while all the guards have all gone to fight. At the wall, Gran'ma Ben oppose the invading hordes of Pawa soldiers and Rat Creatures when the Venu warn her of an attack on the weaker left flank, whereupon she orders them there as reinforcements. She is then pinned down by Pawan soldiers. Thorn tries to break the iron bars imprisoning herself and her friends, but fails. Fone mentions that in using the Crown of Horns, Thorn might destroy both the Locust and herself; whereupon she promises not to use the Crown of Horns. Taneal, a prophetess-like child featured in the previous collection, brings them a hammer by which to break their shackles while she tries to break the bars of their cell. Her brother then frees Phoney and Smiley. Tarsil's soldiers gather, causing Taneal to hide. When they have gone, Taneal, her brother, Phoney, and Smiley find Thorn comatose as a result of overwhelming visions. As Smiley tries to break the bars, Taneal tells the others that Tarsil was killed and Gran'ma Ben is getting overwhelmed by the Pawa soldiers. Hearing this, Thorn awakes and manages to break out of the cell with her bare hands. On the wall, the dream masters use illusions to scare off the Rat Creatures and the Pawas from climbing over the wall. Thorn, Fone Bone, Phoney, and Smiley rejoin Gran'ma Ben. They watch as the attacking army retreats, and Thorn reveals that ghost circles are surrounding the city. = Mim = This chapter is a short story of 5 pages, taking place in Thorn's dream, wherein the Red Dragon then tells the story of the Queen of Dragons, Mim, wherein she was subject to demonic possession by the Lord of the Locust. This caused a battle that generated the valley that forms the story's setting. = Gaps = Gran'ma Ben, Thorn, and the Bones climb a tower, where Thorn may locate the \\"ghost circles\\" surrounding the city. Thorn perceives Roque Ja in the hills, and then has sudden visions of the valley exploding, and of the Lord of the Locusts. While the others tend to Thorn, Phoney and Smiley open the well where the city's treasure is hidden, thinking to take the treasure and escape. Thorn's visions tell her that the Lord of the Locusts has re- inhabited Mim, Queen of the Dragons, in whose form he is approaching the city. Phoney and Smiley return to the city's gate with their hay cart (having Smiley's Rat Creature Bartleby and the treasure hidden in the hay), when the farmer who had formerly lost the cart, knocks it over. Bartleby, Phoney, and Smiley climb the ladder (which accidentally knocks out the farmer) Fone and Thorn are descending, where Phoney expresses his disappointment at having lost the treasure. Hearing the words from the arguing Fone and Phoney, Thorn asks Phoney the location of the Crown of Horns, who deduces it is in the sacred burial grounds of the dragons. Thorn leaves the group to search for the Crown of Horns and Fone, refusing to leave with Phoney and determined to protect Thorn, follows her with Bartleby's help. = Escape from the City = When Fone Bone looks for Thorn on Bartleby's back, they see her as she hides from the invaders in ghost circles. To find Thorn while themselves hidden from the Rat Creatures, Fone hides underneath Bartleby, clinging to his stomach fur (suggesting the trick used by Odysseus to conceal his men from Polyphemus). Beyond the Rat Creatures' location, they encounter Thorn as she emerges from a ghost circle. All three climb the mountains. At the city, the Pawans ram the gates, until Rose orders a sortie. Smiley captures the two stupid Rat Creatures who pursue the Bone cousins throughout the series. Fone and Thorn sneak past Roque Ja to reach the dragons' graveyard; Roque Ja sees them, but lets them pass unharmed. Thorn alone faces an army of their enemies and flies over them, forcing Fone Bone to hide under Bartleby again. They continue to the dragons' graveyard, which Bartleby refuses to enter. = Chamber of Horns = Smiley has the idea that if he bakes large quantities of quiche for the two Rat Creatures, they will think that the siege will fail. Phoney and Rose are in a tunnel at Briar's hideout, where they might capture Briar by surprise. Fone descends into the dragon's graveyard, and perceives the Rat Creatures in pursuit. Thorn reaches the Crown, whereupon the Rat Creatures' chieftain Kingdok orders Thorn to kill him, so as to free him from the Lord of the Locust. When Thorn refuses, Kingdok holds her leg in his teeth, and she kills him, but fails to escape. Fone Bone attempts to touch the Crown of Horns himself, but because Thorn took the piece of the locust out from him earlier, nothing happens. Briar strikes down Rose, and is about to kill Rose when Lucius grabs her; simultaneously, Fone takes Thorn's hand and touches the Crown of Horns again, allowing Thorn's piece of the Locust to touch the Crown. This kills Briar, Lucius, and the Lord of the Locust. All of the other dragons awaken and are angry at Fone Bone and Thorn for trespassing and violating the Crown of Horns. However, the Red Dragon rescues Fone and Thorn from his compatriots. = Homecoming = With Briar and the Lord of the Locust dead and the opposing army slowly being decimated, the capital declares victory. Ted tells the Red Dragon to help Gran'ma against the surviving enemy. The dragon makes short work of them, but an out-of-control Mim is approaching. The other dragons burst out of the earth and envelope Mim, and return to Tanen Gard with her. The capital restores the rule of the royal family and dragons, but at Thorn's coronation, Fone Bone questions whether to return to Boneville or to stay in the Valley with Thorn. As the Bone cousins, Thorn, and Gran'ma Ben leave for Barrelhaven to bury Lucius, Phoney is given the hay wagon he lost earlier in the volume, with all of the hidden treasure still in it. After Lucius' burial, Phoney and Fone find that the winter's snow has prevented their leaving the valley, so they stay until the snow melts. = Solstice = The chapter is a story originally featured in the Bone Holiday Special, and show the Bone cousins, Gran'ma Ben, and Thorn celebrating a \\"Winter Solstice\\". As they dance and play instruments, Fone presents the two stupid Rat Creatures with a quiche made by himself. = River Crossing = After winter, Fone Bone decides to return to Boneville. The Great Red Dragon guides them to the Dragon's Stair. Fone Bone says goodbye to Gran'ma, to the Red Dragon, to the insect Ted, and to Thorn. Before Fone, Smiley, Phoney, and Bartleby leave on their wagon, Phoney discovers that Smiley has exchanged the treasure for the small cakes of stale bread he prefers. Gran'ma gives Phoney some gold coins, which Smiley had stamped with Phoney's image on the latter's orders, arguing that no one wants them (except Phoney himself). As the Bones and Bartleby enter the desert, Phoney Bone claims to despise the bread cakes, to which Smiley replies that he will grow to like them (since it is the only food they have for the journey). Phoney asks for one; at this, Smiley asks to be given a gold coin as payment. When Phoney refuses, Fone insists. This parallels the joke sequence in Out from Boneville, wherein they had similarly discussed a dollar.

It was built around 1180 by Hugh de Plais, and comprised a three-storey tower, a substantial hall, and a service block, with a separate kitchen positioned near the house. A moat was later dug around the site in the 13th century. The house was not fortified, although it drew on architectural features typically found in castles of the period, and instead formed a very large, high-status domestic dwelling. It was probably intended to resemble the hall at Castle Acre Castle, owned by Hugh's feudal lord, Hamelin de Warenne. Weeting Castle ceased to be used in the late 14th century and fell into decay. The ruins formed an ornamental feature in the grounds of nearby Weeting Hall from 1770 onwards, and passed into the ownership of the state in 1926 when the government acquired the surrounding estate. The site is now managed by English Heritage and open to visitors. 10th‚Äì13th centuries Plan of the castle: A - ice house; B - moat; C - service block; D - hall; E - chamber block Weeting Castle is located around north of the village of Weeting in Norfolk, England.

Hugh acquired the estate following his marriage to Philippa Montfichet, where he then constructed a very large, stone manor house.; ; ; The new building was probably intended to resemble the hall at the centre of Castle Acre Castle, then being redeveloped by Hugh's feudal lord, Hamelin de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey.; Hugh's manor house was around across and comprised three sections running south to north: a chamber block, the main hall, and a service wing. The chamber block, or tower, was three storeys tall, with thick walls made from flint rubble and ashlar.; The ground floor formed an undercroft, supporting a solar ‚Äî a set of private chambers ‚Äî above. The chamber block would have been entered by an external staircase at the first floor, and an internal newel staircase in the north-west corner linked the different floors.; Although not fortified, the tower drew on the architectural traditions of earlier castle keeps and great towers.; The two-storey tall hall was in size internally, with two wooden arcades running down each side, forming narrow aisles along which benches would have run.; ; A raised dais at the northern end, framed by blind stone arcading, would have supported the great table, with similar arcading facing it at the opposite end of the hall.; The hall was probably linked by doors to the service block to the north, which was internally in size and contained a pantry and a buttery.; ; A separate kitchen building stood beyond the service block, positioned across a small, enclosed courtyard to reduce the fire risk to the main building.; ; A wide moat was dug around the site in the mid-13th century, creating an island approximately across internally, accessed by a bridge to the west. The moat was not intended to actually defend the site, but would have aesthetically framed the view of the house within it for anyone approaching the property, highlighting the wealth of its owners.; 14th‚Äì21st centuries Left to right: the fragments of the service block, the remains of the hall and the chamber block The male line of the Plais family died out in the late 14th century, and Weeting Castle passed to Sir John Howard, the Earl of Norfolk, through his marriage to Margaret Plais.; The manor house was left to fall into ruin, until in 1770 it became an ornamental feature in the grounds of the nearby Weeting Hall, a country house rebuilt by Charles Henry Coote, the Earl of Mountrath.; ; In 1926, the Ministry of Labour purchased Weeting Hall for use as a residential work camp, and acquired Weeting Castle as part of the estate.; As part of their instruction, the trainees were deployed to clear the castle of undergrowth. Weeting Hall was demolished in 1954, but its ice house still survives on the island, comprising a brick and earthen mound, around across, which was originally used to store ice harvested from the moat.; ; Archaeological excavations were undertaken at the site between 1964 and 1966 by the Ministry of Public Works, and the remaining stonework was consolidated. Some of the rubble core of the chamber block and the hall survive today, along with fragments of the ashlar stone; parts of the service block's foundations have also survived, but nothing remains of the kitchen above ground.; The moat still partially floods in winter, and the site is now accessed by an earth causeway in the north-west corner, possibly dating to the creation of the nearby hall in the 18th century. The castle is managed by English Heritage and is open to visitors. The historians Brian Cushion and Alan Davison consider the castle's design to form \\"a very fine example of an early medieval house\\", and the heritage agency Historic England notes that the site is \\"a rare surviving example of a high status 12th century manor house\\"; it is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.; See also *Castles in Great Britain and Ireland *List of castles in England Notes References Bibliography   * External links *English Heritage visitors' page Category:Castles in Norfolk Category:English Heritage sites in Norfolk Category:Ruins in Norfolk Category:Ruined castles in England ","title":"Weeting Castle"},{"id":"4885963","text":"A Ship of the Line is an historical seafaring novel by C. S. Forester. It follows his fictional hero Horatio Hornblower during his tour as captain of a ship of the line. By internal chronology, A Ship of the Line, which follows The Happy Return, is the seventh book in the series (counting the unfinished Hornblower and the Crisis). However, the book, published in 1938, was the second Hornblower novel completed by Forester. It is one of three Hornblower novels adapted into the 1951 British-American film Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.. Plot summary Hornblower has recently returned to England from the Pacific in the frigate HMS Lydia, having gained widespread fame (but no financial stability) as a result of sinking the superior ship Natividad in battle. As a reward for his exploits, he is given command of HMS Sutherland, once the Dutch ship Eendracht, and which is, in Hornblower's estimation, \\"the ugliest and least desirable two-decker in the Navy List\\". He is assigned to serve under Rear Admiral Leighton, Lady Barbara Wellesley's new husband. Throughout, Hornblower is torn between his love for Lady Barbara and his sense of duty and loyalty to his frumpy wife, Maria. His feelings for Maria are complicated by the previous loss of both of his children to smallpox. Hornblower's first orders are to escort a convoy of East Indiamen off the Spanish coast. He successfully fights off simultaneous attack on the convoy by two fast, manoeuvrable privateers. Since he has been forced to sail with an understrength crew, and had to make do with \\"lubbers, sheepstealers, and bigamists\\", he breaks Admiralty regulations and presses twenty men from each Indiaman just before they part company. With his ship now fully manned, Hornblower wreaks havoc on the French-occupied Spanish coast. He captures a French brig, the Amelie, by surprise, storms a French fort and takes several more vessels in its harbour as prizes, repeatedly fires upon several thousand Italian soldiers marching along a coastal road, and saves his Admiral's ship from certain ruin by towing it away from a French battery during a severe storm. When Hornblower encounters a squadron of four French ships of the line that have broken through the English blockade of Toulon, he attacks them despite the odds of four to one, and manages to disable or heavily damage all of them. However, with many of his men killed or wounded, including Bush, who loses a leg, and his ship dismasted, he is then forced to strike his colours and surrender. This novel ends as a cliffhanger.

The practice of calling it 'Brown Windsor' did not emerge until at least the 1920s, and was usually associated with low- quality brown soup of uncertain ingredients. Although originally an elegant recipe among famous chefs of the 19th century, the 'Brown Windsor' variety became an institutional gruel that gained a reputation as indicative of bad English food during the mid-20th century and a later source of jokes, myths and legends. Origins and heyday sup Brown Windsor Soup. In 1834 Henderson William Brand ‚Äì chef to King George IV and the inventor of what would become A.1. Sauce ‚Äì published a cookbook containing a recipe for Vermicelli Soup, a la Windsor. It is a white meat broth and noodle soup that Brand said was a favorite of George III and IV. Another similar Windsor soup recipe was published 11 years later in the influential 1845 cookbook The Modern Cook by British-Italian Charles Elm√© Francatelli, who was Queen Victoria's head chef from 1840-1842. He called it Calf's Feet Soup, a la Windsor (or Potage a la Windsor) and it was made from calf's feet or oxtail consomme creating a thick gelatine body,Before gelatin became widely available as a commercial product, the best gelatin for use in soups and deserts was derived from boiling calves' feet. and includes white wine and cream, chicken and noodles ‚Äì it is a white soup. The Modern Cook was an influential guide- book for Victorian women who wanted to emulate the Queen, it was a cooking bible in many households ensuring its currency at home and in upper-end restaurants. Contrary to beliefs that Queen Victoria ate the soup frequently, it rarely appeared on the Royal menus, and never as a \\"brown\\" soup. Variations on Francatelli's recipe appeared throughout the 19th century. Typical recipes called for calf's feet and Madeira wine, and was sometimes darkened to a deep brown with caramel coloring and spiced with cayenne pepper, as in a recipe by the Waldorf Astoria's head chef Oscar Tschirky. A 'white' version that uses Windsor beans was published in 1855. Some were made from mutton, beef and rice. Agnes Marshall had a simple barley and meat version, and French chef Auguste Escoffier created a creamy Windsor soup at the Savoy Hotel restaurant in the 1890s, a favorite eatery for English royalty including the Prince of Wales. Decline and fall Batcherlor's Windsor Soup (1942) By the 1920s, enthusiasm for Windsor soup was perceptibly waning. As Evelyn Waugh noted in 1924, \\"things were not as good as they used to be ‚Äî including Windsor soup\\". Windsor soup was transforming into an icon of dreary British cuisine. Michael Bateman states \\"In the 1930s, the art of soupmaking sank to an all-time low and every hotel offered disgusting brown soups (so-called Brown Windsor soup)\\". The so-called \\"brown Windsor soup\\" first appeared in the 1920s, when it was served aux masses in cafes and cafeterias. Examples include Cadena Cafes (Portsmouth) which advertised \\"Soup - Tomato or Brown Windsor\\" on its menu dated 24 February 1926.The Portsmouth Evening News, 24 February 1926.

Last accessed February 2015 via British Newspaper Archive. The easy availability of tinned and packet soups was driving soup in new directions, for example there was a \\"Batchelor's Windsor Soup\\" sold in a tin can during the 1940s. With wartime rationing, some towns kept stocks of canned Windsor. P. D. James reminisced that during the war, \\"brown Windsor soup featured largely on the menus of British Restaurants set up under the aegis of the Ministry of Food.. the soup tasted of gravy browning.\\" Author Eric Wright recalled being indigent in 1945 and eating free Windsor soup at a cafeteria run by the Asiatic Petroleum Company. After the war, food rationing continued into the 1950s. Leftovers would be pureed or mixed into brown mystery soups whose connection with the original Windsor recipe may have been in name only. Or soup may have been nothing more than a watery, tasteless gruel made from bullion powder and starch thickener. Or leftover cans, \\"I can remember cans of Windsor in my grandmother's larder, which she kept from the war. Humorously thought of as only to be used in the event of an invasion.\\" Satirists began poking fun at Brown Windsor in the 1950s because on the one hand it was rubbish served in shabby establishments, on the other it had a pretentiously posh name. Annie Gray notes that despite the jokes it was in fact \\"a real soup\\", but one \\"largely associated with shabby boarding houses trying to sound posh.\\" Nicholas Parsons confirms \\"It was very much part of the culture when I was young. Nearly every cheap hotel had Brown Windsor Soup. I think hotels used all the remains of their meat.. and it was always on the menu. It was such a staple item you either laughed at it or ignored it. It was an object of ridicule and humor.\\" For example in a play published in 1958, John Osborne asserts \\"the only fit place for it is the sink.\\" Satirists often say they had only ever had it once, for example Jane Garmey recalled \\"having tasted it once I knew better than to risk the experience again\\", and Nicholas Parsons jokingly said he only ever had it \\"the once\\". Except for those fool enough, as Honor Tracy observed, \\"Anyone fool enough to eat in a provincial English hotel, for whatever reason, deserves no sympathy - this nation seems hooked on Brown Windsor soup.\\" By 1984, it was becoming legendary, as R. W. Apple Jr. noticed \\"Slowly, ever so slowly over the last twenty-five years, good restaurants have come into being in almost all parts of the kingdom. Brown Windsor soup, thanks heavens, is an endangered species.\\" Myths and legends A number of myths, legends and assumptions grew around the soup. Some sources assert that Brown Windsor soup was not popular in reality, and was primarily a joke meme that originated with the 1953 Ealing Studios film comedy The Captain's Paradise. By this argument, the soup's name was repeated in the memoirs of many authors over the following decades who misremembered (intentionally or otherwise) the popularity or even existence of the soup, to artistic or humorous effect. As noted by John Lanchester, \\"There is a sinister genius in the very name Brown Windsor Soup\\". One researcher found a number of recipes for 'brown soup' that is a bone-based broth with some similarities to Windsor soup, and hypothesized there might have been a commingling of 'Windsor soup' and 'brown soup' in the memories of later commentators. This connection was made in a 1958 New Yorker restaurant review, \\"The cold meat was quite good, and the flavour of the fine brown soup recalls the war,\\" to which another reviewer responds, \\"A fine brown soup-formally listed on British menus as a \\"Brown Windsor Soup\\" is as hard to imagine as a fine kind of dislocated elbow.\\" A number of authors have noted the similarities with \\"Brown Windsor soap\\", which was well known in the Victorian era, and suggested there might be a connection. Etymologist Michael Quinion incorrectly reports the earliest known reference is from 1943, in The Fancy, by Monica Dickens. In 1915, author Edith Siepen says the soup originated in France, probably a misunderstanding due to the early French name in The Modern Cook. Windsor and/or Brown Windsor has been associated with the British Railways by a number of authors, although historians have had trouble verifying it ever existed. Malcolm Timperley, a researcher in the National Railway Museum's library and archives, reported that their team specifically researched the existence of brown Windsor soup in British dining cars. After checking scores of menus dating back to the nineteenth century they failed to find any mention of it. Nevertheless, according to author Paul Spicer, Brown Windsor was popular on British railways, and \\"was often said to have built the British Empire\\". Author Jane Garmey, writing about it in 1981, said Brown Windsor was \\"continually served by British Railways in their dining cars\\", and from her childhood memories she \\"assumed it was the only soup that could be served on a train\\" due to its ubiquity. Fictional barrister Rumpole of the Bailey mentioned eating it on the Great Western Railway in a book of short stories dated 1978 although Quinion questions whether this is an endorsement of the soup, \\"the extract confirms that the soup was at one time a staple of the restaurant menus of British Railways.\\" In popular culture British magazine The Poke advertised a satirical can of Brown Windsor soup as part of a \\"Jubilee Collection,\\" available for about ‚Ç§40, complete with silver spoon and reportedly made \\"directly from the sewage outflow of Windsor Castle.\\" Brown Windsor soup is identified in the film Carry On Regardless (1961) by Kenneth Connor as the dish he is splashed with having knocked over a waiter's tray on a train and in Carry On Abroad (1972) by Kenneth Williams in a scene in the hotel's restaurant, where the soup is mistakenly referred to as \\"Brown Bristols\\" by the Spanish hotel manager, played by Peter Butterworth. In an episode of The Goon Show entitled \\"The Macreekie Rising of '74\\", Brown Windsor soup is used as a weapon and mocked as \\"deficient in calories\\" by the impressively stout Neddy Seagoon. In Hancock's Half Hour, episode \\"Air Crew Only\\", the in-flight meal starts with \\"Brown Windsor soup just burnt enough to leave that attractive brown ring sticking round the edge of the plate\\", a line re-used from the radio episode \\"The End of the Series\\". Hancock also mentions it in \\"The Espresso Bar\\" (1952). In the Agatha Christie's Poirot episode \\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\\", Poirot laments to a waiter that the Brown Windsor soup he has been served \\"doesn't look very... delicieux\\".Agatha Christies Poirot (1989) Episode Scripts In \\"Basil the Rat,\\" the last episode of Fawlty Towers, the upper-class couple who have the rat under their table order a Windsor soup as their starter.

It is currently owned and published by Marion County Media. Name It has been listed as one of the 14 Wonderfully Odd American Newspaper Names. The origin of the paper's unusual name is not certain since the original publisher did not leave any clues. However, four theories have arisen as to the origin: #An early editor dropped several pieces of type on the floor, and upon returning them to his composing stick, randomly spelled out the word \\"jimplecute\\". #A mythical creature developed to frighten superstitious slaves during the American Civil War. #A slang term meaning \\"sweetheart\\" or \\"slim\\" (the word \\"jimp\\" is defined as such in some dictionaries) #An acronym for the motto \\"Join Industry, Manufacturing, Planting, Labor, Energy, Capital (in) Unity Together Everlastingly.\\" is the most widely accepted theory. This is the motto which exists in the newspaper heading. History Regarded as one of the nation's historic newspapers, archived editions are available at the Library of Congress. In 2015, the Jimplecute's entire staff quit at once in a dispute over pay and announced plans to start a rival newspaper. The Jimplecute remained in business and continued to produce its weekly print edition with a replacement staff each week since.

The album was recorded over one day in 2000 with songs written impromptu by band leader Scott McCaughey and sold at concerts in a limited edition of 1,000. McCaughey decided that the album should see a wider distribution, so he approached Yep Roc because he had had pleasant experiences with releasing albums from them in the past; he recorded new songs for this edition. Critical reception The editorial staff of AllMusic Guide gave this album four out of five stars, with reviewer Mark Deming calling it \\"pretty darned satisfying\\" due to McCaughey's clever songwriting, calling the album \\"both tight and loose just when it needs to be\\". Dennis Tyhacz of PopMatters echoes the catchy songwriting, writing that McCaughey's \\"gift for melody is a breath of fresh air\\". Joe Tangari of Pitchfork Media gave the release a 7.6 out of 10, writing that this album contains some of McCaughey's best work in his 15-year career, characterizing the album as \\"a hugely welcome blast of pure pop mayhem from one of its finest practitioners\\", writing \\"most of these songs are short and to the point, laced with McCaughey's trademark wit and served with a short stack of harmony vocals and a lot of fuzzy guitar\\" In Exclaim!, Vish Khanna considers In Rock an \\"inspired, loose (though not as loose as one might suspect) collection of songs that contribute to the band's fun-filled reputation\\".

The aircraft entered service in March 1935 with a production run of 48 aircraft. Four were exported to Belgium for SABENA, while seven others were produced by SABCA. The main customer was the Italian airline Ala Littoria. Design and development The aircraft was developed in only four months, thanks to the use of the S.55 wing, combined with a much more conventional fuselage. Developed in parallel with a bomber version (the SM.81 Pipistrello) the prototype S.73 first flew on 4 July 1934 from Cameri, with Adriano Bacula as test pilot. The prototype had a four-blade wooden propeller on the central engine, and two-blade wooden propellers on each wing engine. Later all aircraft were fitted with three-blade metal propellers. The S.73 was a mixed-construction (a skeleton of steel covered by wood and fabric for the fuselage, wood for the three-spar wing) monoplane with a braced tailplane and fixed undercarriage. There were two generators, one in each side of the fuselage; the batteries were 24 V and were rated at 90 A. The pilot and co-pilot were seated side-by-side in an enclosed cockpit, with a compartment for a radio operator and a mechanic. A passenger compartment could house 18 passengers in two rows. It had eight metallic fuel tanks, all in the wings, with a total capacity of . The prototype had French Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9Kfr Mistral engines, but further aircraft had Piaggio Stella P.X, Wright R-1820, Walter Pegasus III MR2V, Alfa Romeo 125 or Alfa Romeo 126, driving ground adjustable, three-bladed, aluminium-steel propellers. It could be used from small airports, had reliable handling and was not too costly. With the Wright R-1820 engine the S.73 had cruise/max speeds of , range, and ceiling. With the AR.126 the S.73 had a maximum speed of , range, and ceiling. The SABCA license- produced aircraft had Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K Mistral Major engines for a total of , comparable to the last models of S.79s or the CANT Z.1018. The S.73 had an unremarkable flight test programme with few modifications recommended by the Regia Aeronautica. It was easy to fly, rugged, and easy to operate on the ground, including the ability to fly from short airfields in treacherous terrain, in spite of being under-powered and the lack of leading edge slats. Its mixed construction and fixed landing gear were its main shortcomings, when contemporary aircraft in the US and Germany were of all-metal construction with retractable undercarriages. Some of these had better performance, but the S.73 remained competitive for some years. Operational history S.73 at Milan Linate airport In December 1935, an S.73 was used for a journey from Italy to Asmara, delivering over 200,000 letters, with 6,600 km (4,100 mi) traveled in four days, followed by the return trip to Rome on 6 January 1936. A commercial line was established covering a 6,100 km (3,790 mi) journey. SABENA had a similar route to Congo, with four days and 44 flying hours. The S.73 flew in passenger service with airlines such as SABENA, Ala Littoria, Czechoslovak Airlines and Avio Linee Italiane. At the outbreak of World War II the aircraft was already obsolete, but some of the aircraft were pressed into service with the Regia Aeronautica for operations in Abyssinia and Spain. Five S.73s were present in Eastern Africa and used as military transports. Owing to the poor military situation, with British Commonwealth forces on the brink of capturing Addis Ababa, the Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy of Italian East Africa, ordered the remaining three S.73s to be evacuated. After several days of preparation, they took off from Addis Ababa on 3 April 1941 with 36 men on board, planning to fly to Kufra in Libya, away, requiring additional fuel tanks in the fuselage. All three aircraft force-landed in the desert, but refuelled at Jeddah, before resuming their journey. After several days of difficulties, including sand storms that clogged up the air filters, they took off again. Initially, it was planned to make another landing in Beirut but in the meantime Erwin Rommel had conquered Benghazi, so this was the final destination of the three aircraft. Two aircraft, after 10 hours of flying and the men inside almost killed by fumes of the fuel auxiliary tanks, landed at Benghazi, after and over a month of travel. Seven Belgian S.73s were flown to the United Kingdom in May 1940 and were pressed into service by the Royal Air Force. The RAF examples were used in North Africa where four later served with the Regia Aeronautica. Some Italian aircraft were pressed into military service in East Africa while those still in Italy were used to equip 605 and 606 Squadriglie.

Brill, Leiden, page 34, A Qalandar is a person who has excelled in seeing things and advances stage by stage into the Being. He even rises above the Administrative System and witnesses the core of Oneness in detail and after enjoying the Unity of the Being returns without losing his grades and then reaches back into his humanly status, so much so that his rise and fall becomes one and the same thing for him.. He witnesses part in the whole and sees the whole in the part and, then, after detaching himself from all this, plunges into a state of ecstasy. The status of a qalandar is even higher than the loved ones because duality remains there even in that state, i.e. one is the loved one and the other is the loving. In qalanderiyat there is no duality.From Qalandar is a title given to a saint who is at a very high level of spirituality. They are different from other saints and have very strong feelings of love for God's creation. Qalandars, among the saints, are those persons who may enjoy freedom from the ties and bounds of time and space. It is claimed that all living things are given in their charge and command, every part of the universe may be at their disposal but these holy people are far above temptation, greed or lust. When people request them they feel duty-bound to listen and rectify the cause of miseries of people because they have been appointed by God for this very purpose. Qalandars have always spread the message of love and humanity, they are always in the state of ecstasy and their actions are with the will of God. They are Wali Allah. Among contemporary people who hold the title of qalandar are Shams Ali Qalandar of Punjab, Pakistan, Shahbaz Qalander, Nathar Vali, and Baba Fakruddin.

The project  Planning for the Googong site began in the early 2000s, with approval to begin the re-zoning process granted in 2006.CIC Australia website, accessed 4 July 2014 The findings of the Independent Queanbeyan Land Release Inquiry, issued by the NSW Minister for Planning in September of that year recommended the site as the future residential growth area for the City of Queanbeyan. In November 2007, the NSW Department of Planning issued a Section 65 certificate enabling the public exhibition of the draft Local Environmental Plan which was available for public comment until February 2008. The re-zoning of the site to allow residential development was approved in December 2009. At that time it was announced that Googong will have five neighbourhoods, a town centre and four local shopping centres, as well as 183 hectares of open space to provide recreational, ecological and visual amenity. As part of the project, the developers undertook a Voluntary Planning Agreement to dedicate land and undertake construction works valued at over $300 million. These included road and intersection upgrades on local access roads and the construction of community facilities including a library, community centre, indoor sports and aquatic centre, sporting fields and open spaces and a neighbourhood clubhouses containing an indoor swimming pool, tennis courts, gym and meeting rooms.

His music career began in the 1970s with the duo Les S√©guin, with his twin sister Marie-Claire. The duo achieved considerable popular success in Qu√©bec. Their folk reprise of Felix Leclerc's Le train du nord enjoyed huge radio play and record sales, along with other titles. Richard S√©guin has led a solo career since 1979, frequently collaborating with his sister Marie Claire on many of her own solo albums. S√©guin has received several prizes, including Felix Awards from the Qu√©bec music industry association ADISQ. Some of his albums were certified platinum (sales of over 100 000 copies). S√©guin's songwriting features a delicately intertwined tapestry of blues, folk and rock music influences, feeding from the works of many musicians from Qu√©bec and abroad, a reflection of the artist's wide-open range of inspiration. S√©guin's lyrics abound with powerful, striking metaphors, illustrating how power relationships not only modify social structures, but personal life as well. A few of his songs have been translated and recorded in English by Gary \\"U.S.\\" Bonds. In addition to his lifelong involvement in songwriting, S√©guin has also developed considerable skills as a visual artist. His wood engravings borrow altogether from traditional Qu√©bec folk art, Native American Art, German Expressionism and Arte Povera. Some of his work may be seen on his website. In his recent work, Seguin has been largely borrowing and incorporating fragments of poems by Gaston Miron. The mixture reveals to be intricate and complex, and strongly and coherently integrated to the visual patterns of Seguin's work, a brilliant remark of how Miron's poetry may not be dissociated from Qu√©bec's life environment. At many occurrences in the course of his career, Seguin has expressed his complete support for Quebec independence, either within his song lyrics, or in public appearances. On September 12, 2016, Seguin was the recipient of the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the Francophone SOCAN Awards held in Montreal.

This is usually done for brief amount of time to avoid weather or turbulence. Regulations Each nation has specific and often different rules that govern when a pilot is permitted to fly VFR OTT. Most countries have requirements that specify weather minima, aircraft equipment and pilot qualifications. In some countries pilots are required to get an air traffic control (ATC) clearance, or in absence of a controller, advise the nearest flight service station or center. Pilots are required to adhere to VFR minima when climbing and descending over the clouds. Flight in cloud is not permitted. National differences The rules for flying VFR OTT vary greatly from country to country. Some rules, such as those contained in the US Federal Aviation Regulations, are quite simple to understand and easy to comply with. Others, such as the Canadian VFR OTT regulations contained in the Canadian Aviation Regulations, are much more complex and more difficult to comply with. =United States= The US rules require the aircraft to be fitted with the instruments required for IFR flighthttps://faraim.org/faa/far/14CFR/vol2/part91/69/page-69.pdf, and Student Pilots and Sport Pilots must maintain visual reference with the surface. Other operations (such as commercial, turbine powered, and fractional ownership) include special limitations. (Note that 14 CFR 91.507 applies only to fractional operations; see 91.501.) =Canada= The Canadian rules specify that an aircraft may be operated in VFR OTT flight during the cruise portion of the flight during the day, at a vertical distance from clouds of at least 1000 feet. When the aircraft is operated between two cloud layers, the vertical distance between the layers must be at least 5000 feet. The flight visibility at the cruising altitude of the aircraft must be at least 5 miles and the weather at the destination aerodrome must be forecast to have a sky condition of scattered cloud or better, a ground visibility of 5 miles or greater with no forecast of precipitation, fog, thunderstorm or blowing snow, and that these conditions must be forecast to exist for one hour before to two hours after the estimated time of arrival when a terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) is available or from one hour before to three hours after the estimated time of arrival if a TAF is not available. The VFR OTT rating requires ground training and a minimum of 15 hours of instrument training, 5 of those can be in a simulator. Commercial pilots automatically receive the OTT rating. =Germany= In Germany VFR OTT (Fl√ºge nach Sichtflugregeln √ºber Wolkendecken) is allowed and regulated in ¬ß32 LuftVO.¬ß 32 Fl√ºge nach Sichtflugregeln √ºber Wolkendecken The requirements are: # minimum height of above ground or water, minimum weather requirements for airspace E met # pilot is capable of keeping the planned course # approach and landing at destination in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) # pilot possesses radiotelephony license Additionally the aircraft must be equipped with a VOR receiver or basic RNAV equipment.¬ß 4 air traffic control equipment for operations under visual flight rules See also *VFR-on-top References External links * Canadian VFR OTT rules ‚Äì CAR 602.116 * US FAA VFR rules ‚Äì FAR 91.155 *German VFR OTT Rules ‚Äì ¬ß32 LuftVO Category:Aircraft operations ","title":"VFR over-the-top"},{"id":"4886068","text":"Dealing with Dragons is a young adult fantasy novel written by Patricia C. Wrede, and is the first book in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles series. The novel chronicles the adventures of the princess Cimorene, who escapes her tediously ordinary family to become a dragon's princess. It received the 1991 Minnesota Book Award for Fantasy and Science Fiction. Plot summary Princess Cimorene is frustrated by her life and persuades the castle staff to teach her fencing, magic, cooking, Latin, and other interesting subjects that are considered very \\"improper\\" for princesses to learn. The King and Queen take Cimorene on a state visit to a neighboring kingdom. Cimorene learns that they plan to arrange her marriage to an annoying prince named Therandil. Faced with the prospect, Cimorene runs away. She meets a group of dragons, and volunteers to become the \\"captive\\" princess of the dragon Kazul. Kazul assigns Cimorene to cook for her and organize her library and treasure hoard. Cimorene likes her position and becomes friends with Kazul, but finds she must constantly deal with knights and princes who want to rescue her. She hopes that a sign on the road to the cave will keep would-be rescuers at bay. While posting the sign, Cimorene encounters a wizard. The wizard tries to stop her from returning home, but Cimorene does not fall for his tricks. Annoyed, the wizard leaves using complicated magic, and Cimorene guesses that he is a powerful wizard. Cimorene tells Kazul about her meeting with this suspicious character, and Kazul explains that the dragons and the wizards disagree about the wizards' access to the Caves of Fire and Night. The wizards' staves absorb magic from any magical sources nearby ‚Äì including dragons. Cimorene and Alianora, princess to the dragon Woraug, find another wizard gathering herbs near the dragon caves. Cimorene brings a sample of the herb back to Kazul. Panicking, the dragon burns it up immediately, but the inhalation of the smoke causes Kazul to fall ill. The plant is dragonsbane, poisonous to dragons. Kazul sends Cimorene to warn another dragon that the wizards are gathering dragonsbane. This news comes too late as the King of the Dragons has already been fatally poisoned. Although Kazul is still ill, she must leave to compete in the trials to choose the next King of the Dragons. (The King is a King regardless of gender.) Cimorene hurries through the dragon caves on errands for Kazul, where she meets a prince turned into a living statue. Based on information from the Stone Prince and Alianora, Cimorene realizes that the wizards poisoned the King with the help of Woraug. The wizards plan to interfere with the trials to allow Woraug to win the title of King. In exchange, Woraug will give them access to the Caves and magical items held by the dragons. Alianora discovers a way to melt wizards: Soapy water mixed with lemon juice. With this discovery, and the help of her friends, Cimorene foils the wizards' plan. Meanwhile, Kazul wins the trials fairly and becomes the King of the Dragons.  Reception  Reception to the novel has been positive. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"Smoothly written and ingenious fantasy\\", praising its non-stereotypical female protagonists. In 1991, Dealing With Dragons appeared on the ALA Best Book for Young Adults list (now ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults), the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year list, and the New York Public Library Best Book for the Teen Aged list.

Similar to the Doctor V64 and the Z64 units for the N64, it is most commonly used for playing backups of Nintendo 64 games. Since it has a built-in communications port that is accessible from the N64 program, it can also be used as a rather versatile development/debug device. Design The CD64 sits underneath the N64 unit, making use of the EXTension port on the bottom of the console. Once connected and plugged in, a game cartridge is taken out of the N64 and one is placed into the slot on the face of the system, just underneath the N64 and just above the CD-ROM drive, to act as a kind of boot disk. When the unit is turned on, via the N64 power button, a GUI is shown where you can choose to launch the game in the slot, or run the ROM file on the CD in the CD-ROM. The ROM file is loaded into the PC RAM found within the system. The first version of the unit was solid black, like the N64 itself, and had only 128Mb of RAM. While upgradeable, the RAM was usually glued into place with a hot glue gun. The second version, known as the CD64+ (or 'Plus') was apparently more stable than the first and was transparent grey. This unit came with 256Mb installed, again glued in place, but still capable of being upgraded. Earlier CD64 models were able to power themselves directly from the N64's expansion bus, but later models require an external power adaptor. Features The inserted cart acts as a 'boot' cartridge. The N64 boots the CD64 BIOS using the 6102 CIC in the boot cartridge. The CD64 then boots a program from its cartridge emulator memory using a built-in boot emulator. This presents problems for running programs which have secondary protections against boot emulators, because unlike the V64 and V64Jr, and due to the necessity of the CD64 BIOS to launch a program, it is impossible to use a cartridge with a different boot CIC than the 6102 with the CD64. The CD64 supports .v64 and .z64 files. After burning the ROM files onto a disc they can be launched from the GUI. There is an embedded cheat and hex editing function, the former of which uses Gameshark format codes, the latter requiring a search of the ROM's code for implementation of cheats. The CD64 unit has SRAM support and can connect with a PC to dump the ROM image from the inserted cart and transfer save files and ROM files back and forth.

Some units include the ability to add Game Genie codes and various other cheats and saved games.  Hardware revisions  The original Z64 has a hardware set limit of 128 megabits. Because it is not capable of addressing any RAM above 16 megabytes, the user can not upgrade the RAM in order play bigger games. Once 256 megabit games became more prevalent, the parent company released hardware version 2.0 which includes a fully addressable 32 megabyte RAM chip, allowing the larger games to play.

It was their second album for Arista Records in the US and was expected to capitalise and build on the success of 1988's Starfish. The album saw considerable promotion upon its release, but despite moderate success in the US, with the single \\"Metropolis\\" reaching the top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the release failed to deliver mass commercial appeal. Following their tour for the Starfish album in 1988, the band members went home for a four-month break before reconvening to begin work on the next album.Robert Dean Lurie. No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and the Church. Portland OR: Verse Chorus Press, 2009, p.198 Arista demanded demos of all the tracks before the official recording process could begin. These demos were recorded in Sydney at Fat Boy Studios by a young engineer by the name of Cameron Howlett. The band was tired of the material by the time the recording sessions commenced in late 1989. Further difficulties arose when the band wanted ex-Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones to produce, but the record label wanted to team the band again with L.A. session musician Waddy Wachtel and engineer Greg Ladanyi, not wanting to change what had been a winning formula. Arista feared a Jones/Church collaboration might turn out too arty and non-commercial and vetoed the venerable musician in favour of the safer (and commercially tested) Wachtel, although Ladanyi was left out. Band members repeatedly noted how much they had disliked recording Starfish. That album's song \\"North, South, East And West\\" had been an indictment of Los Angeles' shallower aspects. The recording sessions for the album were particularly fraught and in-band tensions led to drummer Richard Ploog being ostracised. While some of the bare, open sound that characterised Starfish punctuates the recording, the use of programmed drums instead of Ploog's live performances on all but four tracks resulted in the album being criticised as somewhat stiff and cold. According to biographer Robert Dean Lurie, the demo recordings for Gold Afternoon Fix were more successful than the finished album, despite their roughness.Richard dean Lurie. No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church. Portland OR: Verse Chorus Press, 2009, pp. 201-02. Ploog left the group for good following the recording and former Patti Smith Group drummer Jay Dee Daugherty was brought in for the tour. Despite the album's title, Steve Kilbey was not yet using heroin at this point. He only started smoking (not fixing) the drug after the subsequent tour, having been introduced to it by Grant McLennan of the Go-Betweens.

Portland OR: Verse Chorus Press, 2009, Footnote 14, p. 211 The album is unique among the Church's releases in the absence of any 12-string electric guitar. The missing trademark sound was due to guitarist Marty Willson-Piper's 12-string Rickenbacker having been stolen during the previous tour.

Burnham and John W. Root, circa 1890 Burnham and Root was one of Chicago's most famous architectural companies of the nineteenth century. It was established by Daniel Hudson Burnham and John Wellborn Root. During their eighteen years of partnership, Burnham and Root designed and built residential and commercial buildings. Their success was crowned with the coordination of the World's Columbian Exposition (World's Fair) in 1893. The two men met when they worked as apprentice draftsmen in the offices of Drake, Carter, and Wight in 1872. A year later they established their own architecture office and began work by building private residences for the wealthy elite of Chicago's meat industry. Both of them married into wealthy families which allowed them to establish a basis for their business. \\"Daniel Hudson Burnham was one of the handsomest men I ever saw,\\" said Paul Starrett who joined Burnham and Root in 1888 (later he designed the Empire State Building). \\"It was easy to see how he got commissions. His very bearing and looks were half the battle\\". While Burnham was the pragmatic designer and impressive salesperson, Root became the creative genius of the company. When Burnham and Root were together, one woman said \\"I used always to think of some big strong tree with lightning playing around it\\". Louis Sullivan, the famous architect, called Burnham \\"a colossal merchandiser\\" obsessed with building the biggest and costliest structures of the city. The most significant buildings designed by Burnham and Root were built in the late 1880s and early 1890s. That is when Root's designs actually paved the way for modern day skyscrapers. Until then, buildings relied on exterior masonry for support, limiting their height to 12 stories. The invention of steel support beams gave him the possibility to build higher and to add more windows. The Rand McNally Building, completed in 1890, was the first ever steel-framed skyscraper in the world.Condit, Carl W. The Chicago School of Architecture: A history of commercial and public buildings in the Chicago area 1875‚Äì1925. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1964, page 99. Another characteristic of his designs that revolutionized modern architecture is his invention of the urban office block floor plan as we know it. As commissions multiplied, Burnham and Root had the opportunity to experiment and refine their style to create and entirely new aesthetic that was free of historical or European influences. Such buildings as the Great Northern hotel (1892), the Argyle and the Pickwick demonstrate Root's singular style. In 1890, when Chicago was named the site for the Columbian Exposition World's Fair, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the United States, Root was given the important task of coordinating the event.Peisch, Mark L. The Chicago School of Architecture : Early followers of Sullivan and Wright. London: Phaidon Press, 1964, page 20. After deciding on the location of the Fair and doing the preliminary plans of the site, he decided that \\"No one architect should design these buildings, but a number of the best architects in the United States, all working together as one commission.\\"Peisch, Mark L. The Chicago School of Architecture : Early followers of Sullivan and Wright. London: Phaidon Press, 1964, page 18. Hence, the greatest architects of the time were invited to participate in the design of the World's Columbian Exposition. Root died in 1891, leaving his greatest project incomplete. Daniel Burnham, despite only having practical experience and no formal training in the field of architecture, was then given the responsibility to finish coordinating the fair. When it opened for six months, from June to November 1893, it was a complete success. The Exposition was home to many innovations, among which the first Ferris wheel, which was the result of a challenge set out by Burnham to design \\"a structure of comparable ingenuity and novelty.\\" Following his success and the loss of his business partner, Burnham continued to operate under the name D. H. Burnham and Co. The projects begun by Root were completed, including the Masonic Temple in 1892, which was for a short period the tallest building in the world at 22 stories.Condit, Carl W. The Chicago School of Architecture: A history of commercial and public buildings in the Chicago area 1875‚Äì1925. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1964, page 104. It is then that Burnham's architectural talent became the driving force of the business, resulting in such iconic buildings such as the Flatiron Building in New York City.The Chicago School of Architecture : Early followers of Sullivan and Wright. London : Phaidon Press, 1964, page 24. Burnham was unable to maintain the architectural progress made by Root, but he demonstrated great versatility in his style. Burnham died in a car accident in 1912 while vacationing in Germany.Peisch, Mark L. The Chicago School of Architecture : Early followers of Sullivan and Wright. London : Phaidon Press, 1964, page 25.

Its national headquarters were located near the campus of the University of Chicago. The SPU was founded by Ken Calkins, who had gained notoriety when his pelvis was fractured when he sat in front of a truck during a pacifist demonstration against nuclear weapons at the first Atlas Missile site 20 miles northwest of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He had returned to Chicago and became educational director for the local American Friends Service Committee. As part of his duties in that position he conducted a number of peace seminars at local Chicago high schools, where he developed a number of contacts with local students. By the spring of 1959 this network had been organized in the Student Peace Union and by the end of the school year had about 100 members. In 1960 it merged with the Fellowship of Reconciliation-affiliated College Peace Union, which had several campus chapters in the Northeast. By December 1961 the group had 1,500 members at dozens of campuses in the Midwest and Northeast, and a year later would expand to 3,500 members, with inroads on the West Coast and in the South.Isserman, Maurice If I had a hammer New York, Basic Books 1987 pp.195, 198 From the beginning, the Young People's Socialist League, then under the influence of the Shachtmanites, poured its members into the group and tried to give it a \\"Third camp\\" direction‚Äîrejecting both Western capitalism and Soviet communism as equally imperialist.Isserman, p.196 The SPU organized a number of protests and vigils at the White House. The first was in November 1961 against the resumption of nuclear testing. To their surprise President Kennedy displayed some sympathy for the group, having his disarmament advisers confer with picket leaders and receiving their petitions. A second protest, the \\"Washington Action\\" drew 5,000 students in February 1962. Kennedy sent them an urn of coffee on the first day of the protest, which was held during a snowstorm. The event was co-sponsored by Student SANE, the Students for a Democratic Society (which at the time had a tenth of the membership of SPU) and a Harvard affiliate of the SPU called TOCSIN, which was led by Todd Gitlin. TOCSIN was able to initiate some contacts with senators and State Department officials, combining the protest march with lobbying efforts.Isserman, pp.197-198 The SPU continued its protests against nuclear testing that spring, when they engaged in the first confrontation between police and anti-war protesters of the decade in New York. During the Cuban Missile Crisis that October, the group sponsored demonstrations across the country, including a march in front of the White House that drew 2,000 people. When the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in the wake of the crisis it was a mixed blessing for the SPU. While they had always been against nuclear testing, so much of its identity was bound up with anti-nuclear war activism that it struggled to find a new footing.Isserman, pp.198-199 Furthermore it was undermined by the factional struggles within the YPSL between the Shachtmanite \\"realignment tendency\\" -- which favored socialist entry into the Democratic party‚Äîand the more non-electoral \\"labor party tendency\\" led by Mike Parker. The Shachtmanites tried to dilute the labor party tendency's control of SPU by urging a merger with Student SANE, but this fell through.

It was officially opened on 12 September 1912 by the Governor of New South Wales, Frederic Thesiger. Pratten Park was named after Herbert Pratten, an alderman and then mayor of Ashfield. The first ever rugby league match at Pratten Park was Western Suburbs vs Annandale on 24 August 1912, with a crowd of 500 people. Annandale won the match 15‚Äì6. The park is best known as the original home of the Western Suburbs Magpies rugby league team, who played there from 1912 to 1966 and then sporadically from 1971 to 1973 and in 1977 and 1985. The final first grade rugby league match played at the park was on 18 August 1985, where Wests played Penrith, who won the match 42‚Äì16. In total, 353 first grade games were played at Pratten Park. http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/pratten-park/results.html?page=2 Pratten Park has also hosted National Soccer League matches and was the home ground of Sydney Olympic FC for a brief period in the 1980s. The ground has also been used for lower league NSW Soccer matches. Its highest attendance for a rugby league match was 12,407 in a 1964 New South Wales Rugby Football League season game between Western Suburbs and St George, and 13,556 for a soccer game in 1984 between Sydney Olympic and APIA Leichhardt FC. The ground is still home to the Western Suburbs District Cricket Club. Over the years, the club has had Michael Clarke and Bob Simpson among its playing ranks.  Facilities  Pratten Park has very basic facilities. There is a small grandstand in the north-western corner with the rest of the ground surrounded by grass hills. Over a number of years the grandstand fell into disrepair and was eventually closed, but restoration work saw it re-opened in late 2007.

The Politburo met in an \\"expanded session\\" (Kuoda Huiyi) between July 2 and August 1, followed by the 8th Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from August 2 - 16\\\\. The major topic of discussion was the Great Leap Forward. The Lushan Conference saw the political purge of the Defence Minister, Marshal Peng Dehuai, whose criticism of some aspects of the Great Leap Forward was seen as an attack on the political line of Chairman Mao. The Conference also marked the first time since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 that disagreement over the direction of policy spilled into open conflict between party leaders. Mao's response to Peng was also seen as an indication that for the first time, his personal authority trumped the principles of collective leadership of the Central Committee and the Politburo. The conference's name is derived from the meeting place, a resort on Mount Lu in the district of the same name in Jiangxi Province, in southeastern China. Original objective The original objective of the conference was to review the events in China during 1958 and solve some practical issues brought forth by those events. Mao Zedong also intended to use the conference to contain the \\"leftist tendency\\" (zuoqing) elements in the Great Leap Forward. Unexpected twist On July 14, Peng Dehuai, then PRC's defense minister, wrote a private letter to Mao criticizing some elements of the Great Leap Forward. In the letter, he cautiously framed his words and did not deny the \\"great achievement\\" of Mao, but meanwhile showed his disapproval for elements like the \\"winds of exaggeration\\" (i.e., over-reporting of grain production), the communal dining and also the establishment of commune militia which he felt would undermine the strength of the People's Liberation Army. He expressed his \\"confusion\\" towards \\"rather large losses\\" and \\"epidemic of bragging\\" in the Great Leap Forward. For this reason, Mao extended the conference for more than ten days. Downfall of Peng Dehuai On July 23, Mao showed Peng's letter to his comrades and asked them to express their views on the issue. However, not long afterwards, Mao bitterly criticised Peng as being part of a group wavering in the face of difficulties and who were \\"only 30 kilometres away from the rightists\\".Bernstein, T. (2006). Mao Zedong and the famine of 1959-1960: a study in wilfulness. The China Quarterly, 186, p. 431 He was subsequently dismissed, arrested and replaced by Lin Biao. Although the criticism of Peng Dehuai resulted in a victory for Mao Zedong, it also led the leadership to conclude that he had been treated unfairly and that the party's norms had been violated. Consequences of the conference The Lushan Conference marked a key point of departure in Mao's rule. Criticism of party actions and policies were now equated with criticism of Mao. Mao's speech at Lushan was incredibly passionate and bellicose. He defended himself by saying that he, like all of the great writers, Confucius, Karl Marx, and Lenin had made mistakes and that focusing on them would not help the situation. Moreover, he insisted that not one commune had collapsed yet. His personal victory over Peng Dehuai at the Lushan Conference gave Mao confidence and led him to proceed with the Cultural Revolution. More than 3 million officials within the party were indicted and, for the first time, \\"class struggle\\" was brought into the upper echelon of the Party apparatus.

Having recently pacified the peninsula, constantly in revolt, he had decided to make a move to more centralised government. The assizes established the large Sicilian bureaucracy and sought to maintain the feudal system under strict royal control. It contained forty clauses that touched on all possible topics of contemporary legal concern: private property, public property, the church, civil law, royal finances, and the military. The work was advanced for its day, deriving its precepts not only from Norman and French, but also Muslim and Byzantine (especially Justinian) legal theories. The first half of 1140 was spent by Roger in Palermo preparing the Assizes. They were certainly well-planned. Despite having written the legislation in his capital, in July, he traveled in state to Salerno, the capital of the duchy of Apulia, and thence to Abruzzi, where he examined the conquests of his sons: Roger and Alfonso. These men, now duke of Apulia and prince of Capua respectively, had consolidated Norman rule over the peninsula and made it possible for the great feats of legislation that year. The Assizes affirm that the king is the only lawgiver in Sicily, that he is both judge and priest (as he holds the legatine powers from the pope), and all Sicilians were equal and under the same laws, whether Latin, Greek, Jew, or Muslim, Norman, Lombard, or Arab. It punished treason with death. It was also detailed in other crimes of violence: cowardice in battle, arming a mob, or withholding support from the king or his allies. Ecclesiastically, Christian heretics and apostates lost their rights. Bishops were excused from attendance at courts, though the king was granted override on this, as on everything, and there could be no appeals. Militarily, the knightly class was closed. Nobody could become a knight if had no knightly lineage. Finally, the assizes did not ignore the commoners and demanded that they be treated with justice and be burdened not unduly by their lords. Roger's final act at Ariano was the issuance of a low-quality coinage standard for the entire realm, the ducat, taking its name from the duchy of Apulia. The coin, mostly copper and some silver, not gold as in later issuances, rapidly grew in importance. The Assizes survive in two manuscripts, slightly differing from one another, though what are omissions and what additions is unknown. These were found in 1856 in the Vatican archives and those of Monte Cassino. The Assizes are the legislations promulgated by King Roger II of Sicily. Once his kingdom was consolidated he issued a series of laws, although it is unknown where or when he did this. It is presumed that the laws were issued around 1140, for it was only after this date that officials can be found all over the kingdom; before then they only appear sporadically. At this time, Ariano was only an assembly of bishops and nobles and not a 'general assembly' in which all free men played a part. Important issues such as the military, obligations of vassals and the recognizance of the countries, and legislation was issued. The Assizes survive in only two composite juridical manuscripts. The fullest text is that contained in Codice Vaticano Latino 8782, which can be dated back to the end of the twelfth century and which contains forty four assizes, as well as a prologue. The second the Codex 468 of the library of Montecassino dates from the first half of the thirteenth century. It transmits only an abbreviated version of the laws, although it also contains some additions and another seven assizes which are lacking in the Vatican manuscript.Assizes of Ariano in Latin pp 379-386 The Assizes provide the first example of territorial legislation based upon Roman (Justinaic) law, as \\"they precede, and were more important in practice than, the purely academic rediscovery of Roman law.\\" Roger's recourse to the example of the Roman emperors is indicative how ambitious his intentions were. The Assizes touch on only some aspects of the law: ecclesiastical, public, marriage and criminal. Alongside them customary law remained in force, unless it actual contradicted what was in the Assizes. The reason for this was \\"because of the variety of different people subject to our rule.\\"Assizes of Ariano in Latin p 371 Therefore, the legislator was clearly very conscious of ruling over a multi- ethnic state; he respected the individual character of the various groups, although only insofar as this did not conflict with his overriding supervision.

As one of the principal military survey units in Australia, the role of the Royal Australian Survey Corps was to provide the maps, aeronautical charts, hydrographical charts and geodetic and control survey data required for land combat operations. Functional responsibilities associated with this role were: theatre wide geodetic survey for ‚Äì artillery, naval gunfire and close air support ‚Äì mapping and charting ‚Äì navigation systems ‚Äì command and control, communications, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems; map production and printing for new maps and charts, plans, overprints, battle maps, air photo mosaics and photomaps, rapid map and chart revision; map holding and map distribution; production, maintenance and distribution of digital topographic information and products. RA Svy survey and mapping information was, and still is, a key information source for geospatial intelligence. The operational doctrine was that the combat force deployed into the area of operations with topographic products adequate for planning, force insertion and initial conduct of tactical operations, that new products and broad area updates of the topographic base would be provided by the support area and communication zone survey forces, and that the combat support survey force in the area of operations would update the topographic base, add tactical operational and intelligence information and provide the value-added products required by the combat force.Coulthard-Clark, CD, 2000, Australia's Military Mapmakers ‚Äì The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915‚Äì96, Oxford University Press, The Historical Collection of the Survey Corps is maintained by the Australian Army Museum of Military Engineering at Holsworthy Barracks, south-west Sydney, New South Wales.

All of these are available to the public and some are on-line. History =Origins= Australia's first surveyor, Lieutenant August Alt, was an Army officer of the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot, which arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in January 1788.Reilly, SE, Soldiers and Surveyors, 1983; The Australian Surveyor, March 1983, Vol 31, No 5, p 315 Eighteen years before him, Lieutenant James Cook, Royal Navy, used his knowledge and skills of topographic survey by plane-table for his surveys and charting of the east coast. This graphical method of topographic survey, first used before 1600, was the mainstay of the Australian Survey Corps for the first 20 years and used in the two world wars and occasionally much later. Cook had learned surveying in Canada from Royal Engineer Samuel Holland who then (1758) was the first Surveyor-General of British North America.Mundle, Rob Cook From Sailor to Legend Harper Collins Publishers, 2013 For 113 years after the arrival of the First Fleet, much of the mapping of Australia, mainly for colonial exploration, settlement and development, was supervised and conducted by naval and military officers. These officers included the well known explorers and surveyors: Captain Matthew Flinders, Royal Navy; Lieutenant William Dawes (Royal Marines officer), (New South Wales); Lieutenant Philip Parker King, Royal Navy (mainly Tasmania, Western Australia and Northern Territory), Lieutenant John Oxley, Royal Navy, (New South Wales); Lieutenant Colonel Sir Thomas Mitchell (New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland); Captain Charles Sturt (New South Wales and South Australia); Lieutenant John Septimus Roe, Royal Navy (Western Australia), and Colonel William Light (South Australia). After 100 years of settlement some topographic maps had been produced for both public and private use but only a few maps were of any real military utility. The colonial part-time Defence Forces prepared small-area training manoeuvre maps and some colonies had produced small systematic topographic surveys for defence of the main ports of trade and commerce in the 1880s and 1890s. That is not to say that the need for topographic mapping was not a government and public concern but there were only minor attempts to allocate appropriate public resources.Lines, John D Australia on Paper ‚Äì The Story of Australian Mapping, Fortune Publications, 1992, After Federation in 1901, the Defence Act 1903 made provision for military survey but nothing was immediately done to address the matter. Most recently a royal commission into the way the British Army had conducted itself in South Africa (Boer War) found that the troops had to fight without adequate topographic information. Indeed, accurate maps of the Boer republics did not exist. The Times' history of the Boer War 1899‚Äì1902 included: 'The chief deduction to be made in the matter is that no efforts during a war will compensate for the lack of a proper topographical survey made in peace time. Maps are a necessity to a modern army, and the expense of making them is very small compared with the cost of a campaign.' Amery, The Times History of the War in South Africa 1899‚Äì1902, vol 6, p350 In early 1907, Colonel William Bridges then Chief of Intelligence and the senior Australian military officer recommended to Defence Minister Sir Thomas Ewing, member for Richmond, New South Wales, that a Chief of the General Staff should be appointed in place of Chief of Intelligence and that a General Staff be established. The Minister, who was a licensed surveyor, was unimpressed by the advice preferring to continue for the time being with the arrangements of a Military Board. He was concerned that there were no plans for mobilization, or local defence, noting that \\"there were few reliable maps, even of the most important localities\\". These were the important national defence issues that Ewing recommended to Bridges for his immediate attention.Mordike, J, An Army for a Nation, 1992, Allen and Unwin, p 193 The Department of Defence and the Government considered a number of options to address the important and urgent need for a military survey, finally deciding in late 1907 to raise the Australian Intelligence Corps (AIC) manned by part-time Citizen Military Force (CMF) officers who were trained in surveying or draughting and whose duties included the preparation of strategic and tactical maps and plans. In Victoria the military survey was the responsibility of Lieutenant-Colonel John Monash who was then the senior AIC militia officer in the 3rd Military District. By 1909 the limitations of this arrangement were evident, and after advice from a senior British Army Royal Engineer Survey Officer, it was decided to embark on a systematic military survey conducted full-time by a Survey Section, Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) (Permanent Forces), allotted for duty under the supervision of the AIC. The Section was to be commanded by an Australian survey officer and staffed by Australian warrant officer draughtsmen and non- commissioned officers (NCO) topographers and four NCO topographers on an initial two-year loan from the British Army Royal Engineers. The Royal Engineer topographers (Corporal Lynch, Lance-Corporals Barrett, Davies and Wilcox) arrived in Melbourne on 11 April 1910 and on 16 April 1910, draughtsman Warrant Officer John J Raisbeck was the first Australian appointed to the Survey Section and soon after he was joined by draughtsman Warrant Officer Class 1 George Constable. Raisbeck was a survey draughtsman from the Department of Mines, Bendigo, and a Second-Lieutenant in the CMF 9th Light Horse Regiment. He relinquished his commission to enlist in the Permanent Military Forces. He was granted the Honorary rank Second-Lieutenant and was retired with the rank Lieutenant-Colonel 33 years later at age 63 years having served in France in World War I and in World War II. Fitzgerald said that JJ Raisbeck was the 'pioneer of military mapping in Australia'. The first officer appointed to the position Lieutenant Survey Section RAE (Permanent) was Lieutenant William Lawrence Whitham, a licensed surveyor from South Australia, having been highly recommended by the Surveyor-General South Australia. He assumed his appointment on 1 July 1910 at which time there were seven members of the Section. All men were professional surveyors and draftsman. CMF officers of the AIC in the Military District Headquarters supervised the work of the Section. In 1912 the Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia State Governments each agreed to loan a Lands Department Survey Officer to the Survey Section RAE for two years to supervise the work of the Section in each State. Each Survey Officer was a militia officer in the AIC. The Section was divided into two sub-sections and employed in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia producing scale one-mile-to- one-inch military maps ('one-mile' map) mainly of areas around cities and key infrastructure. By mid-1913 the Section had completed topographic field sheets by plane-tabling for eight maps around Newcastle, Melbourne and Canberra. The initial method of using parish plans to position the topographic detail was soon found to be inadequate and a geodetic subsection was established in 1914 to provide surveys by geodetic triangulation as spatial frameworks for the field sheets produced by the topographers. The triangulation work started at Werribee south-west of Melbourne and proceeded west along the coast to Warrnambool. This work included the 1860 Geodetic Survey of Victoria where appropriate ‚Äì much of which was produced by Royal Engineer officers. The AIC was disbanded in 1914 but the work of the Survey Section continued under the supervision and control of the Intelligence Section of the General Staff under the general direction of the Chief of the General Staff (CGS).Sargent, Clem, Lieutenant-Colonel RA Svy, 1990, The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915‚Äì1990Royal Australian Survey Corps Association Bulletin 1965 to 1989School of Military Survey,1985, The Chronology of RA Svy Corps, Edition 2 =First World War= The outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914 did not, at first, seriously affect the work of the members of the Section as the highest priority and urgent work of the Permanent Forces was military survey for defence of the major cities and ports in Australia. Indeed, the Section gained an increase in personnel and equipment.Quinlan, Cecil Verdon, Major, Survey Section RAE 1913‚Äì15, Australian Map Makers, The Australian Surveyor, Sept 1, 1943 At that stage it was understood that the British Army would provide the maps required for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) war fighting. However, by 17 August the Draughting sub-Section of the Survey Section RAE in Melbourne had prepared a map of the north-east frontier of France for reproduction of 1,000 copies by photo-lithography by the Victorian Lands Department for issue to the Australian Imperial Force.Chief of the General Staff War Diary 17 August 1914 ‚Äì Letter to Secretary of the Department of Lands, Victoria On 3 July 1915, Military Order 396 of 1915 promulgated that His Excellency the Governor-General has been pleased to approve of: 'A Corps to be called the Australian Survey Corps being raised as a unit of the Permanent Military Forces. All officers, warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men now serving in the Survey Section of the Royal Australian Engineers being transferred to the Australian Survey Corps with their present ranks and seniority.' The effective date of the foundation of the Corps was 1 July 1915 ‚Äì on that day there were two officers and seventeen warrant officers and NCOs of the Corps (at that stage there were no sappers in the Corps). The Australian Survey Corps was placed fourth in the Order of Precedence of Corps after the Royal Australian Engineers. Raising the Australian Survey Corps had nothing to do with supporting the AIF then at Gallipoli, but provided for the key tasks of military survey of the high defence priority areas of Australia without direction or control of Intelligence Staff or the Royal Australian Engineers. The first Officer Commanding Australian Survey Corps was Honorary Captain Cecil Verdon Quinlan who had been appointed Lieutenant Survey Section RAE in March 1913 after Lieutenant Whitham resigned. Quinlan later gave credit to the creation of the Australian Survey Corps to the then General Staff Director of Military Operations ‚Äì Major Brudenell White (later General Sir, Chief of the General Staff). Survey Corps members started to enlist in the AIF in November 1915, with three Warrant Officer draughtsmen (Murray, Shiels and MacDonald) working with the Headquarters of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force by late 1916. Then in late 1917, General Headquarters in France/Belgium requested survey personnel for topographic surveys in that theatre and a volunteer Australian Survey Corps AIF draft of four officers and seven NCOs arrived in France early in 1918. Military Survey in Australia then came to a virtual standstill when the AIF members departed for the Middle East and the Western Front. 2nd Lieutenant Raisbeck, Sergeants Anderson and Clements and Corporal Watson served with the Australian Corps Topographic Section (not a unit of the Australian Survey Corps) in France/Belgium and Lieutenants Vance and Lynch, 2nd Lieutenant Davies, Sergeants Clews and Rossiter and Corporals Blaikie and Roberts served with General Headquarters Royal Engineer Survey Companies employed amongst other things on evaluating the suitability of the French triangulation networks for the purposes of military survey and mapping. In late 1916, Warrant Officer Class 1 Hector E McMurtrie was enlisted into the Corps as a draughtsman for duty with the survey staff (not Australian Survey Corps) working on land title surveys for the military administration by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in the New Guinea area. In 1919 he died from a service related illness, and is commemorated on the Australian War Memorial Roll of Honour. He was the first Australian Survey Corps member to die in war. In early 1918 fourteen Corps members were serving with the AIF and eight were in Australia working on the military survey. One Survey Corps member (Warrant Officer Class 1 Alan Stewart Murray) and one Topographic Section Topographer Corporal Stafford were awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for mapping under enemy fire, Topographic Section Topographer Sergeant Finlason was recommended for a Military Medal but was awarded the French Croix De Guerre, Topographic Section Draughtsman Sergeant Wightman was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal. the Officer Commanding the 1st ANZAC Topographic Section in 1917 and the Australian Corps Topographic Section in 1918 Lieutenant Buchanan was awarded the Belgian Croix De Guerre and Topographic Section Lithographer Sergeant Dunstan was awarded the French Croix De Guerre. Warrant Officer Murray's citation for his work in Sinai and Palestine read \\"for conspicuous gallantry and dedication to duty. For a prolonged period this Warrant Officer was engaged on surveying the area between the lines repeatedly working under machine gun fire and sniping. In order not to attract attention he usually worked alone with his plane table and instruments. Owing to his energy and coolness he has mapped a piece of country accurately and his work has been most valuable.\\" In March 1919 Warrant Officer Class 1 Norman Lyndhurst Shiels was mentioned in the despatches of the General Officer Commanding Egyptian Expeditionary Force, possibly for his work with the Royal Air Force in mapping from aerial photography.National Archives of Australia, World War I personnel service records =Between the World Wars= When the AIF members returned to Australia in 1919 they were discharged and most were re-appointed to the Survey Section RAE (Permanent) or the Australian Survey Corps (Permanent). Military reorganisation after World War I, and the general reduction in military capability, saw the numbers reduced to fourteen all ranks. In 1920 the Corps was suspended and reverted, in title, to the Survey Section, RAE (Permanent). Mapping continued, mainly the 'one-mile' maps, albeit at a reduced rate consistent with the allocated resources, with priority given to areas around Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. By 1929 the Section had produced fifty-four 'one-mile' maps including five revised maps. Technical developments provided for improved efficiencies. These included use of single photographs and strips of air photographs to supplement ground surveys by plane-table for topographic detail. The first military map produced with a significant component of aerial photography flown by the Royal Australian Air Force was the Albury 'one-mile' map published in 1933. Compilation of this map highlighted inconsistencies in State triangulation systems and once again demonstrated the need for a national geodetic survey which had been identified by colonial survey officers in the 1890s. In 1932, the Army decided that the Order in Council which created the Corps in 1915 had never been broken and so the title of the military survey unit was once again the Australian Survey Corps (Permanent Forces) with the personnel establishment of fourteen all ranks as it had been for twelve years. Recruiting recommenced and in 1935 the Corps establishment was raised to twenty-five all ranks. Increments allowed for a Survey (Topographic) Section to be based in each of three states, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, a Survey (Geodetic) Section and the Survey (Draughting) Section in Melbourne. Then in 1938, with war clouds once again on the horizon, a three-year Long Range Mapping Programme was approved, with additional funding bringing the total to ninety-seven all ranks. These extra resources would provide for a total of about thirty-five new '1 mile' maps each year. However, at the outbreak of the Second World War there were only fifty members in the Australian Survey Corps. Most of the men were professionally qualified, and the Corps was very knowledgeable of emerging technical developments which would improve efficiencies in map production. That there were no militia units of the Corps was due mainly to the fact that little progress in the mapping programme was achieved with part-time effort. The Corps was well equipped for the range of field survey and office mapping tasks with the exception of printing presses. Maps were printed by the Victorian State Government Printer. At this stage, just before the Second World War, the total coverage of military 'one-mile' maps was eighty-one maps or about or only about 40% of the identified military mapping requirement at that stage.Raisbeck, JJ Captain, Australian Survey Corps, A Short History of the Military Survey of Australia, 1907‚Äì1936, The Australian Surveyor, Sept 1, 1937Vance, TA Major, Mapping a Continent, The Australian Surveyor, Sept 2, 1940 Sections (all Permanent Forces) from the end of the First World War to pre-Second World War were: * Survey Section, RAE * No 1 Survey (Draughting) Section (Melbourne) * No 1 Survey (Topographic) Section (Queensland, South Australia and Victoria) * No 2 Survey (Topographic) Section (Victoria) * No 3 Survey (Topographic) Section (New South Wales) * No 4 Survey (Geodetic) Section (triangulation Southern Queensland ‚Äì New South Wales ‚Äì Victoria ‚Äì South Australia) =Second World War= Soldiers from the Australian 2/1st Corps Field Survey Company, near the Turkish‚ÄìSyrian border, December 1941, mapping the topography using a plane- table. In July 1939 'Instructions for War ‚Äì Survey' were issued. This outlined the military survey organisation required to undertake an Emergency Mapping Programme to complete the outstanding Long Range Mapping Programme and be the nucleus for expansion to war establishment. The Emergency Mapping Programme was initially for strategic mapping at scale eight-miles-to-one-inch of inland Australia, four-miles-to-one-inch ('four-mile maps') covering a coastal strip 200 miles (300 km) inland from Townsville to Port Augusta and 100 miles (200 km) inland from Albany to Geraldton and key strategic areas in Tasmania and around Darwin and 'one-mile' maps of populated places. Map production was from existing State Lands Department's information and conducted jointly between State Lands Departments and Survey Corps units. The programme expanded to include more of Australia, New Guinea, New Britain and New Ireland and although many maps were of a preliminary standard only, providing general coverage critical at the time. Initially, the Australian Survey Corps continued its mapping for the defence of Australia, proceeded with basic survey triangulation and provided training cadre for new field and training units. In January 1940, Field Survey Units RAE (Militia) were established in 1st Military District ‚Äì Queensland, 2nd Military District ‚Äì New South Wales and 3rd Military District ‚Äì Victoria to accelerate the mapping effort. Deputy Assistant Directors ‚Äì Survey were appointed to Military District Headquarters to advise on survey needs and to liaise with State agencies. In April 1940 the 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE was raised as part of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force for service overseas and a Survey staff was appointed to the formation (Corps) headquarters. In September 1940 significant expansion of the Australian Survey Corps was approved by Cabinet to include a Survey Directorate on Army Headquarters (AHQ) and higher formation headquarters, an AHQ Survey Company, an AHQ Cartographic Company, regional command field survey companies, a Survey Section 7th Military District (Darwin) and a Corps Survey Mobile Reproduction Section. Four militia Field Survey Companies RAE were established in the regional commands (1 Field Survey Coy RAE ‚Äì Queensland, 2 Field Survey Coy RAE ‚Äì New South Wales, 3 Field Survey Coy RAE ‚Äì Victoria, 4 Field Survey Coy RAE ‚Äì Western Australia) absorbing the Australian Survey Corps Sections and the Field Survey Units RAE (M) in the Commands. In early 1941, 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE, sailed with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, to provide survey and mapping to the Australian Corps in the Middle East theatre including Greece, Egypt, Cyrenaica and the border zones of Palestine, Syria, Trans-Jordan and Turkey. In response to the Japanese late-1941 and early-1942 offensives in South-East Asia and the Pacific the 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE returned to Australia in early 1942 with a large part of I Aust Corps. Over the next four years fifteen survey units with various roles relating to production of topographic maps provided survey and mapping support to military operations in the South West Pacific Area theatre of the war including Northern Territory, Papua, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, Dutch New Guinea, Borneo and the States of Australia in particular northern Australia. Women of the Australian Women's Army Service served in Survey units and formation headquarter sections in Australia and in New Guinea. In June 1943 all topographic survey related units were concentrated in the Australian Survey Corps being transferred from Royal Australian Engineers. Acknowledgement of the value of survey support organic to the combat forces increased as the war progressed. Early doctrine was that survey support was at Army Corps level, but additional support was added at Army and Force levels and by the end of the war survey sections of 5th Field Survey Company were assigned to both 7th Australian Infantry Division and 9th Australian Infantry Division for the large scale amphibious landings at Labuan and Balikpapan in Borneo. Later, the General Staff of Headquarters 1 Australian Corps said \\"...never in this war have Australian troops been so well provided with accurate maps, sketches and photo reproductions...\\" More than 1440 new maps of the theatres of war (Middle East 28, Australian mainland 708, New Guinea area 364, Borneo 147, Mindanao Philippines 200), printing more than 15 million copies of the maps. The highly valued efforts of the survey units did not go unnoticed by senior commanders. On 13th November 1942, Lieutenant-General Edmund Herring, General Officer Commanding New Guinea Force, wrote to Director of Survey Advanced Land Headquarters thanking him for the noteworthy efficiency and splendid cooperation in having an urgently needed of Buna, Papua, sent to 2/1st Army Topographic Survey Company RAE in Toowoomba QLD for printing and then returned for issue to forward troops 48 hours later. On 1st June 1943, Lieutenant-General John Northcott, Chief of the General Staff, wrote a letter of appreciation of the work of the Survey units in New Guinea to the Director of Survey, Advanced Land Headquarters. On 19th October 1943, soon after the successful assaults on Lae and Finschhafen in New Guinea, General Douglas MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief, South West Pacific Area wrote a letter of high commendation of the performance of 2/1st Aust Army Topographic Survey Company, 3rd Aust Field Survey Company and 8th Field Survey Section to General Thomas Blamey, Commander, Allied land Forces, South West Pacific Area. At Morotai, the 1st Mobile Lithographic Section was given the privilege of preparing the Instrument of Surrender signed by Commander, Second Japanese Army and countersigned by General Blamey, Commander-in-Chief, Australian Military Forces. The unit then printed thousands of copies of the surrender document for souvenirs. At the end of the war more than half of the Corps strength of 1700 were on active service outside Australia. Colonel Fitzgerald noted that 'One of the most satisfying tasks followed immediately after the cessation of hostilities. It was the preparation of maps to assist in the recovery of our prisoners of war in SWPA. It was an urgent commitment readily undertaken.' The achievements of the Corps during the Second World War were its greatest contributions to the nation than at any other time during its existence. This was duly recognised in 1948 when King George VI granted the title 'Royal' to the Australian Survey Corps. Sixteen members of the Australian Survey Corps, or soldiers serving with Corps units, died during the war and are commemorated on the Australian War Memorial Roll of Honour. Four members of the Corps were formally recognised with awards and nineteen members were mentioned-in-despatches.Australian Government Gazette, 6 March 1947 Australian Survey Corps units (from June 1943, earlier being RAE units) during the Second World War were: * 2nd/1st Australian Army Topographical Survey Company, formerly 2nd/1st Corps Field Survey Company RAE ‚Äì Middle East, Papua, New Guinea, Hollandia and Morotai * No 6 Aust Army Topographical Survey Company, formerly No 2 Army Topographical Survey Company, absorbed Army/Land Headquarters Survey Company ‚Äì Victoria, Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland, New Guinea, New Britain * Land Headquarters Cartographic Company, formerly Army Headquarters Cartographic Company ‚Äì Melbourne and Bendigo, Victoria * No 2 Aust Field Survey Company ‚Äì absorbed the 2 MD Field Survey Unit RAE(M) and Australian Survey Corps (P) No 3 Survey Sect ‚Äì New South Wales, Queensland, Dutch New Guinea, New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville * No 3 Aust Field Survey Company ‚Äì absorbed the 3 MD Field Survey Unit RAE(M) and Australian Survey Corps (P) No 1 Survey Sect ‚Äì Victoria, Papua, New Guinea, Queensland * No 4 Aust Field Survey Company ‚Äì Western Australia * No 5 Aust Field Survey Company, formerly 1 Aust Field Survey Company which absorbed the 1 MD Field Survey Unit RAE(M) ‚Äì Queensland, Dutch New Guinea, Labuan and Balikpapan in Borneo * No 7 Field Survey Section, formerly 7th Military District Survey Section, Northern Territory Force Field Survey Section and 1 Aust Field Survey Section ‚Äì Northern Territory * No 8 Aust Field Survey Section, formerly New Guinea Field Survey Section and No 2 Field Survey Section ‚Äì Papua, New Guinea * No 1 Mobile Lithographic Section, formerly 2 Army Survey Mobile Reproduction Section ‚Äì Melbourne, Brisbane and Morotai * No 11 Aust Field Survey Depot ‚Äì Bendigo, Victoria * No 12 Aust Field Survey Depot ‚Äì Queensland and Morotai * No 13 Aust Field Survey Depot ‚Äì Sydney, New Guinea * Field Survey Training Depot ‚Äì Bacchus Marsh and Melbourne, Victoria In addition there were Survey Directorates and Survey Staff on formation headquarters: * General Headquarters South-West Pacific Area * Advanced Land Headquarters ‚Äì Melbourne, Brisbane, Hollandia and Morotai * Headquarters First Australian Army - New Guinea * Headquarters I Australian Corps ‚Äì Middle East, Morotai * Headquarters II Australian Corps - New Guinea * Headquarters New Guinea Force * Headquarters Northern Territory Force * Headquarters of Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania Lines of Communication areas * Headquarters Kanga Force - New Guinea * Headquarters Merauke Force - Dutch New Guinea At the end of the Second World War, which by the nature of the total war demanded the best collective capability that the nation could assemble, the Australian Survey Corps was the best organised, best manned and best equipped geodetic and topographic survey and mapping organisation in Australia. The Director of Survey expected that the organisation would play a major role in the future survey and mapping of Australia. =Post Second World War = Defence survey and mapping programmes (not including Defence international cooperation) After the Second World War the Corps reverted to its peace time role of the military survey of Australia retaining a capability in the Permanent Force Interim Army in 1946, and the Australian Regular Army from 1947 with a desired Corps strength of 460 all ranks, although a strength of 400 was not reached until the early 1960s. By 1950 the all ranks numbers were down to 210 as civilian employment opportunities significantly improved. The Australian Survey Corps structure and size was both the force-in-being and the base for expansion in war. In the early post- war years the Corps continued mainly with the 'one-mile' map military survey programme and provided Defence assistance to nation building projects for water conservation and settlement in the Burdekin River basin in Queensland (194x‚Äì1949), investigative surveys for the Snowy River Diversion Scheme (1946‚Äì1949) in New South Wales and Victoria, surveys for water flows between the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers near Urana, New South Wales (1946), production of maps for the 1947 Australian Census and survey and mapping projects for the Woomera Rocket Range (1946‚Äì1953) in South Australia and Western Australia and the atomic test range at Maralinga in South Australia. Corps units were established in each of the regional military districts, except Tasmania and Northern Territory, and a survey school was established in Victoria.Jensen, Peter A, Lieutenant-Colonel RA Svy/RAE, Post-World War II Topographic Mapping by the Royal Australian Survey Corps paper presented at the Mapping Sciences Institute of Australia Conference 2011 ‚Äì 100 years of National Topographic Mapping, Feb 2011 In 1956 Australia adopted decimal/metric scales for mapping, largely for military interoperability with major allies and the global trend. After the 'one-mile' military maps were discontinued in 1959, and although Defence preferred 1:50,000 maps for tactical operations, it recognised the resources needed for such a programme over large regional areas of Australia and accepted the 1:100,000 map as a practical substitute with 1:50,000 maps over specific areas of interest and military training areas. Then in 1983 Defence endorsed a program for more than 2600 scale 1:50,000 maps in Defence priority areas in north and north-west Australia, its territories and the main land communication routes. By 1996 the Corps had completed more than 1900 of these maps by ‚Äì field surveys using mainly US TRANSIT and GPS satellite positioning systems and aircraft mounted laser terrain profiling, new coverage aerial photography, aerotriangulation, compilation and cartographic completion on computer assisted mapping systems and produced both digital and printed topographic products. Production of the military specification Joint Operation Graphics scale 1:250,000 is mentioned in the section \\"National Survey and Mapping Programmes\\" below. In addition, there was a miscellany of surveys, maps and information produced by the Corps for units of each of the Armed Services. These included: production of air navigation charts for the Royal Australian Air Force covering Australia and a large area of its region totalling about eight percent of the earth's surface; printing hydrographic charts for the Hydrographer Royal Australian Navy; joint and single service training area special surveys, maps and models including live fire requirements; vital asset protection maps; safeguarding maps for ammunition depots; digital terrain data and models for command and control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, simulation, weapons and geographic information systems; photomaps using air and satellite photography.The Royal Australian Survey Corps ‚Äì Products Catalogue 1993, DEF/MISC/6307, 1993 Corps units, officers and soldiers were deployed on operations and conflicts of various types including: * 1946 ‚Äì staff posted to British Commonwealth Occupation Force, Japan * 1955‚Äì1960 ‚Äì Malayan Campaign, officers posted to Force Headquarters * 1965 ‚Äì 1st Topographical Survey Troop raised in Sydney NSW based at Randwick * 1966‚Äì1971 Detachment 1st Topographical Survey Troop deployed with the 1st Australian Task Force in Vietnam, in 1967 re-designated A Section 1st Topographical Survey Troop * 1975 ‚Äì Cyclone Tracy ‚Äì rapid response production of orthophotomaps and a senior Corps officer seconded as Staff Officer to the Army General commanding the emergency operations * 1987 ‚Äì Operation Morris Dance ‚Äì rapid response mapping of Fiji * 1988 ‚Äì Operation Sailcloth ‚Äì rapid response mapping of Vanuatu * 1990‚Äì1991 ‚Äì Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Corps officers posted in United States and United Kingdom mapping agencies and units on operations * 1992 ‚Äì support to ADF elements of UN peacekeeping force in Western Sahara * 1993 ‚Äì support to ADF elements of UN peacekeeping force in Somalia * 1993 ‚Äì Corps soldiers posted to UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia * 1995 ‚Äì Corps officers posted to UN Protection Force Headquarters in Bosnia-Herzegovina Defence international cooperation Commencing in 1954, the Corps was again involved in surveys and mapping the New Guinea area, initially in cooperation with the United States Army Map Service for two years, and again as solely an Australian force from the early 1960s. The 1956 survey (Project Cutlass) of ship-to-shore triangulation included a 300 kilometre theodolite and chain traverse on New Ireland. From 1962 the Corps resumed geodetic surveys as part of the National Geodetic Survey, linking to the global US HIRAN survey and the high order Division of National Mapping traverse and triangulation through the PNG highlands. There was a continuous Survey Corps presence in Papua New Guinea (PNG) from 1971 to 1995, with 8th Field Survey Squadron raised in PNG and based at Popondetta, Wewak and Port Moresby for geodetic surveys, topographic surveys, map compilation, field completion of compiled maps, to support the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and to provide advice to PNG National Mapping Bureau. During this period the Corps completed the national/defence mapping programme of scale 1:100,000 topographic maps covering the entire country, the derived 1:250,000 Joint Operations Graphic ‚Äì Ground and Air charts, large scale military city orthophotomaps and participated with the Royal Australian Navy in beach surveys of most of the coastline. In the 1970s up to 60% of the Corps' capability was engaged on PNG surveys and mapping.Laing, A.W. Colonel (Retd) RA Svy, The End of an Era ‚Äì A short history of the Royal Australian Survey Corps' involvement in mapping, charting and geodesy in Papua New Guinea in the period 1942‚Äì1995 unpublished 1995 This mapping programme was based on high altitude (40,000 feet) air photography, acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force using Canberra bombers fitted with Wild RC10 mapping cameras (Operation Skai Piksa), supported by Survey Corps surveyors and photogrammetrists to plan the photography requirements and for quality control to ensure that the photography met the high technical standards for the subsequent mapping processes. Under the Defence Cooperation Programme, the Corps completed many cooperative and collaborative projects with nations in Australia's area of strategic interest. These projects included ground surveys, definition of geodetic datums, air photography, assistance with definition of Exclusive Economic Zones, mapping, provision of equipment and technology transfer and training of officers and technicians. Projects commenced in 1970 in Indonesia and expanded over 25 years to include Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Nauru, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa. Technical Advisers were posted to national survey and mapping organisations in Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. All field survey operations outside of Australia, and indeed in Australia, would not have been possible without essential support of most other Army Corps (Engineers; Signals; Aviation ‚Äì Cessna, Porter, Nomad, Sioux, Kiowa; Chaplains, Medical, Dental, Transport, Ordnance, Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Pay, Catering, Service), the Royal Australian Navy (Hydrographic Service, Landing Craft, Patrol Boats) and at times the Royal New Zealand Navy (Hydrographic Service), the Royal Australian Air Force (Canberra, Hercules, Caribou, Iroquois) and civil charter fixed wing and helicopters for aerial survey work and transport. Two members of the Australian Defence Force died on military survey operations in the 1970s in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and are commemorated on the Australian War Memorial Roll of Honour. Associations with other Armies commenced during the First World War and for more than 50 years after the Second World War the Corps participated in mapping, charting and geodesy projects for standardisation and interoperability with major allies including Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. From the 1960s, the Corps participated in cooperative and collaborative geodetic satellite programs with the United States, firstly astro-triangulation of passive satellites Echo and Pageos being observed with Wild BC4 cameras at Thursday Island in Queensland, Narrabri in New South Wales, Perth in Western Australia and Cocos Island, a TRANET fixed station at Smithfield in South Australia in the global network observing US Navy Navigation Satellites (TRANSIT) from 1976 to 1993 and the first observations of US Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites in Australia, at Smithfield, during the development and early operational phases of the system from 1981 to 1994. The Corps managed bi-lateral Defence and Army map exchange arrangements with major allies and regional nations. Personnel exchange programs included Canada, United Kingdom and United States. Participation in national survey and mapping programmes In 1945 the National Mapping Council (NMC) of Australia, comprising Commonwealth and State authorities, was formed to coordinate survey and mapping activities after the Second World War. Despite the huge wartime mapping achievements of producing 224 'four-mile' strategic maps and 397 'one-mile' tactical maps, there was much to be done for a basic coverage of reliable topographic maps for national development and defence. In 1947 a National Mapping Section in the Department of Interior was established and together with the Survey Corps commenced work on the 1954 Cabinet approved general purpose (national development and defence) national topographic map programme, initially the 'four-mile' map then soon after scale 1:250,000 maps (series R502). Army agreed that when not required for solely military purposes, Survey Corps units would be available to work in the Defence priority areas in the Government approved national geodetic survey and topographic mapping programmes. This programme involved control surveys by astronomical fixes, theodolite and chain triangulation and traverse by theodolite and electro-magnetic distance measurement and all aspects of map compilation from aerial photography, final cartography and map printing. The Corps' geodetic surveys were integrated with other Commonwealth and State Government surveys to create the NMC sponsored Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66) and the associated Australian Map Grid 1966 (AMG66) of Australia and Papua New Guinea and the Australian Height Datum 1971 (AHD71). By 1968 the Corps had completed its commitment of about half of the 540 series R502 maps and it then embarked on the Defence priority part of the 1965 Cabinet endorsed national programme of general purpose scale 1:100,000 topographic maps. This programme required densification of the national geodetic and height survey networks with mapping quality control surveys of Cape York, Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Northern Territory and north-west Western Australia using mainly airborne electromagnetic distance measurement systems (Aerodist). The Corps completed its commitment of 862 of these maps in 1982. In areas of higher defence interest the Survey Corps replaced the series R502 1:250,000 maps with the military specification 1:250,000 Joint Operation Graphic (JOG) Ground and the companion Air version using materials from the 1:100,000 and Defence 1:50,000 mapping programmes and from other suitable sources.

In 1996 the School was integrated into the School of Military Engineering as the Geomatic Engineering Wing now at Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney, New South Wales * Joint Intelligence Organisation Printing Section Re-integration with the Royal Australian Engineers The Survey Corps was subject to many Government and Defence reviews since the 1950s, with seven from the early 1980s. Review outcomes led to many reorganisations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s efficiency reviews led to an Army direction that the non-core strategic mapping functions of the Corps were to be tested as part of the Defence Commercial Support Program. Army decisions as part of that review were that: the combat support survey force (1st Topographical Survey Squadron) would be increased significantly; the non-core work, mainly systematic mapping of Australia would be performed by a new Army agency with civilian personnel; and, that the core strategic mapping would be retained by Army until it could be transferred to Defence Intelligence. This last component was achieved in 2000 when the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (now Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation) was formed. These changes meant that the majority of Survey Corps staff positions would be removed, and so in September 1995 the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) decided that the remaining combat support force and training force functions of the Corps would be once again integrated with the combat force and training force of the Royal Australian Engineers. At the integration parade of the two Corps on 1 July 1996, 81 years after the formation of the Australian Survey Corps, the CGS said that \\"Since 1915 the Survey Corps has not just been a major contributor to the tactical success of the Australian Army in two World Wars and other conflicts, it has played an outstanding role in the building of this nation ‚Äì the Commonwealth of Australia ‚Äì and the building of other nations such as Papua New Guinea\\". In 2014 the 1st Topographical Survey Squadron RAE came under the command of the 1st Intelligence Battalion. In 2018 the Army geospatial capability, less the field surveying capability, was transferred from RAE to Aust Int Corps, 1st Topographical Survey Squadron RAE was transferred to Australian Intelligence Corps and retitled 5 Company 1st Intelligence Battalion and Geomatic Engineering Wing was retitled Geospatial Intelligence Wing and transferred from School of Military Engineering to Defence Force School of Intelligence.

Lemon (January 1991 ‚Äì June 1996) The high reputation and esteem in which the Corps was held within the Australian Defence Force, the surveying and mapping profession and amongst Australia's military allies and friends was based on its achievements largely possible only by the quality of its people. This was greatly enhanced by the camaraderie and espirit-de-corps of the members of the Corps, knowing the high military value and high quality of the work that they produced. After World War II eight Corps officers were later appointed Surveyors-General or Directors of Survey/Mapping/Lands in the States or Commonwealth organisations. Many personnel went on to leadership positions in professional institutions. The first five members of the Institution of Surveyors, Australia, recognised for outstanding service to the profession and awarded a special gold medial, had all been officers of the Survey Corps. From the 1960s, most Corps officers were tertiary educated with many at the post-graduate level in either mapping or computer disciplines and military command and staff training. This was the key to understanding the potential, application and implementation of emerging technologies and techniques across all aspects of Corps capability. Corps soldier training was both broad within a trade, across Corps trades and specific to specialised equipment with military training for various levels of leadership. Officers and soldiers posted outside Corps positions were highly regarded. Until the 1970s the Corps sponsored and trained soldiers in trades other than the mapping related trades essential to its operations. These included drivers, storemen and clerks. After some rationalisation the Corps retained career and training responsibility for all mapping related trades, and also photographers (non-public relations), illustrators and projectionists who were posted mainly to training institutions and headquarters. More than 6,300 people served in the Survey Section (RAE), Australian Survey Corps units and Royal Australian Survey Corps units from 1910 to 1996, including more than 580 women from 1942 to 1996. A Survey Corps Nominal Roll 1915-1996 may be accessed from the front page of the website of the Royal Australian Survey Corps Association linked on External Links below. The Corps participated in the national service scheme in the 1950s, training and maintaining two Citizen Military Force topographic survey companies in Sydney and Melbourne from 1951 to 1957, mainly for national servicemen to complete their obligations. National servicemen then served with the Survey Corps in Vietnam from 1966 to 1971. The Army Audio Visual Unit was the only Corps unit not to have a mapping related role. Equipment, Technology and Techniques RA Svy had the enviable military, international and national reputation of leading innovation, development and implementation of many generations of state-of-the-art technology and techniques across all areas of surveying, mapping and printing, striving to improve efficiencies. Significant examples of these include:Royal Australian Survey Corps Annual Report 1989/90, unpublishedRoyal Australian Survey Corps Annual Report 1991/92, unpublished * 1910‚Äì1915: established the standard for the Australian Military Map Series, based on United Kingdom Ordnance Survey maps; mainly 'one-mile-to-one-inch' maps (known as the 'one- mile' map) produced from field survey sheets 'one-mile-to-two-inches' using plane-tabling and parish plans for position, scale and orientation, final map compilation by ink fair drawing at 'one-mile-to-two-inches' using a polyconic projection and lithographic draughting for colour separation (seven colours) and photographic reduction to 'one-mile-to-one-inch' for printing by the Victorian Government Printer. The Military Survey sheet numbering system was that of the International Map Congress of 1912. Standard map sheet extent was 30 min longitude x 15 min latitude. Standard height contour interval was 50 feet.Topographical Survey of Australia, Report on a Conference Between Surveyors-General of the States and a Representative of the Department of Defence ‚Äì held at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, 19‚Äì21 November 1929, unpublished * 1914: commenced geodetic triangulation (angles by theodolite, azimuth by astronomy and scale by baselines measured with metal tapes) replacing parish plans as the basis for topographic mapping * 1923‚Äì1927: used No 1 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force air photography to complement topographic survey by plane-tabling * 1930‚Äì1933: the first map produced from a significant use of air photography for topographic compilation using graphical methods of perspective rectification ‚Äì Albury, New South Wales, '1 mile' map. Work on this map highlighted the disparity between the Victoria and New South Wales state survey triangulation networks. The grid on this sheet was most likely the first instance of cartographic scribing in Australia, done by Warrant Officer Harry Raisbeck engraving the emulsion of a glass plate negative using one tip of a broken ruling pen for the thicker 10,000 yard grid lines and a steel needle to scribe the 1,000 yard grid. This was 23 years before the first map was fully scribed. * 1933: adopted Sydney Observatory as the geodetic datum for the eastern states, the Clarke 1858 reference ellipsoid and a British modified map grid based on the Transverse Mercator map projection with Australian zones. The first map with the British modified grid, for artillery purposes, was Albury '1 mile' although it was on the polyconic projection. This grid system was used for Australian topographic mapping until 1966. * 1934: commencement of a geodetic survey triangulation program to connect Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia into one coherent network. All theodolites were Cooke, Troughton and Sims Tavistock 5 1/2 inch reading direct to half-second for first order work and 3 1/2 inch reading direct to one second for second order work. Baselines of four to six miles in length were placed every 200 to 250 miles and measured with invar tapes standardised by steel bands and the method of temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of measuring tapes. This method was first used near Millicent, South Australia after development by Professor Grant of University of Adelaide, research which was acknowledged as world class science and development. * 1936: the first map produced on the Transverse Mercator projection and the British modified grid ‚Äì Helidon, Queensland 'one-mile' * 1936: the first map compiled entirely from overlapping strip of air photography and graphical methods of rectification ‚Äì Sale, Victoria 'one- mile'. * Second World War: many innovative adaptions of equipment and processes for surveying, aerial photography for topographic compilation, cartography, photo-lithography, various printing methods and battlefield terrain modelling in base and field mobile situations to provide rapid response military survey/mapping support under adverse conditions of extreme heat, cold, high humidity, dust and rain in desert and jungle environments and at times under enemy attack * 1952: topographic mapping by multi-projector (Multiplex anaglyph) stereoplotting from overlapping air photography, replacing graphical methods of rectification for map compilation * 1953: large format Klimsch Commodore cartographic camera (remained in continuous use until December 1978) * 1956: changed to decimal (also known as metric) scale mapping, largely as part of standardisation with allies in the South East Asia Treaty Organisation and adoption of an improved Australian spheroid of reference for mapping, first map Mildura 1:50,000. The 'one-mile' map was discontinued in 1959. * 1956: cartographic scribing of map detail replaced fair drawing with ink, first map Mildura 1:50,000 * 1957: helicopter transport of survey parties revolutionised transport in remote areas * 1957: Geodimeter light-based electromagnetic distance measurement (EDM) equipment * 1958: Tellurometer MRA1 microwave EDM (and later models) man-portable systems improved geodetic survey efficiencies for rapid network extension and densification replacing triangulation with EDM and theodolite traverse sometimes using Bilby Towers to extend line lengths * 1960: adoption of the '165 Spheroid' in Australia (same as World Geodetic System 1960 spheroid) * 1961: manual hill-shading of 1:250,000 maps by photographing carved wax terrain models from the north-west corner on the Klimsch camera * 1962: Wild A9, B9, B8 optical/mechanical photogrammetric plotters for topographic compilation from super-wide angle (focal length 88.5mm) Wild RC9 air photography started to replace Multiplex plotters; presensitised lithographic printing plates * 1963: Zeiss (Jena) Stecometer analytic stereocomparitor for air photography; block aerotriangulation by digital computer; Aristo coordinatograph for grid production; radar airborne profile recorder (Canadian Applied Research Ltd, Mark V, Airborne Profiler Recorder) * 1964: vehicle mounted Johnston ground elevation meter; Tellurometer MRC2 microwave airborne EDM system for geodetic surveys for mapping over long distances by trilateration to replace traverse requiring survey station intervisibility * 1966‚Äì1971: adopted the Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66)/Australian Map Grid 1966 (AMG66)(Transverse Mercator projection ‚Äì Universal Transverse Mercator Grid) and the Australian Height Datum 1971(AHD71)for all mapping of Australia and Papua New Guinea. The local datum AGD/AMG66 was used for surveying and mapping until it was replaced by the local datum AGD84 and later the geocentric datum World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)/Geodetic Datum Australia 1994 (GDA94). * 1970: Calcomp 718 digital coordinatograph flat-bed plotter for grids, graticules and base compilation sheets with aerial triangulated model control * 1971: Wild RC10 super wide angle air survey cameras with virtual distortion free lenses for supplementary, spot and special photography * 1972: Tellurometer MRB3 microwave computer assisted second generation airborne EDM * 1972‚Äì1973: IBM 1130 computer; OMI/Nistri AP/C-3 analytical plotter with coordinatograph and OP/C orthophoto projector and Zeiss Planimat D2 stereoplotters with SG-1/GZ-1 orthophoto projectors for orthophoto production from colour and monochrome film air photography * 1974‚Äì1975: Magnavox AN/PRR-14 portable Doppler satellite (US Navy Navigation Satellite System - TRANSIT) receivers and computing system provided independent three-dimensional point positions anywhere in the world, anytime, in any weather accurate to about 1.5metres with precise satellite ephemerides (station coordinates computed using program DOPPLR at Directorate of Survey - Army in Canberra ACT), to replace geodetic astronomy for absolute positioning and airborne EDM; the Australian developed WREMAPS II airborne laser terrain profile recorder to replace terrain heighting by barometry for 1:100,000 mapping; grid and graticule production on Footscray Ammunition Factory's Gerber flatbed plotter * 1975: AUTOMAP 1 computer assisted cartography and mapping system (Input Sub-System of four Wild B8s and three Gradicon digitising tables, Optical Line Following Sub-System ‚Äì Gerber OLF, Verification Sub-System ‚Äì Gerber 1442 drum plotter, General Purpose Sub-system ‚Äì HP21MX computer and Output Sub-System ‚Äì Gerber 1232 flatbed plotter), the first map was published in 1978 (Strickland 3665-3, 1:50,000) * 1977: PDP 11/70 computer and OMI/C-3T and AP/C-4 analytical plotters * 1978: new cartographic specifications (SYMBAS Symbolisation All Scales) for map and air chart production by digital cartographic methods * 1982: Schut's Bundle analytic adjustment was set up on the PDP 11/70 to augment the Schut polynomial strip adjustment of block air photography triangulation; Magnavox MX1502 second generation TRANSIT receivers for relative positioning * 1983: Kongsberg flatbed plotter for air triangulation output and associated grids * 1983‚Äì1984: AUTOMAP 2 second generation computer assisted cartography and mapping system as a precursor to collection of digital geographic information and creation of geographic information systems in support of emerging digital military systems.

The associated map grids remain based on the Transverse Mercator projection. * 1990: Heidelberg Speedmaster 102 five colour printing press; AUTOMAP 2 upgrade to increase storage capacity and computer memory to speed-up data processing, to process all forms of remotely sensed imagery, to install the inhouse developed automated masking and stippling system, to enhance production of Digital Elevation Models, and to further develop the aeronautical chart database; large format film colour processor; large format automatic printing plate processor for positive and negative processing; investigated techniques for rapid kinematic GPS surveys * 1990‚Äì1992: participation with military allies, Canada, United Kingdom and United States, in research and development of digital geospatial product standards to produce the Digital Chart of the World (DCW) and associated standards which became the baseline for international exchange of digital geospatial information * 1991: Wild RC10 air mapping camera, pod mounted in a chartered Air Scan Aust Pty Ltd 35A Lear Jet, operated by the RA Svy Aerial Photography Team; established a digital topographic data Portable Demonstration System; Optical Disk Storage and Retrieval System for mainly AUTOMAP 2 data; desktop and laptop computers with mapping software for field survey, topographic survey and military geographic information sections; printing quality control stations; large format plan printers for topographic survey sections; air photography film processors for field units * 1993‚Äì1995: high capacity large format process print press for rapid response map printing and print on demand Acknowledgement of Corps History On 1 July 2015, on the occasion of the Centenary of the Royal Australian Survey Corps Wreathlaying Ceremony at the Australian War Memorial, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd), Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, delivered the commemorative address. He acknowledged the essential nature of mapping for military operations, the work that the Survey Corps did for conflicts around the world and also for the nation building of Australia. He said \\"But it is the active service, the sacrifices and the contributions made by the men and women of the Royal Australian Survey Corps that we commemorate here today. On this 100th anniversary, we pay tribute to those whose skill and passion for surveying became integral to the work of the Australian military. And of course we offer our deepest respects to the 20 men who have given their lives serving with the Survey Corps or as members of the ADF on military survey operations. It was their duty to serve and it is our duty to remember them‚Äîand that is what we do today, and every day.\\" On 9 July 2007, His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, unveiled a plaque at the Australian War Memorial to commemorate Royal Australian Survey Corps units which served in war. In his address the Governor-General praised the efforts of all personnel of the Corps over its 81 years of service to the nation in both war and peace.Address by His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia on the occasion of the unveiling of a memorial plaque commemorating the Royal Australian Survey Corps units which served in war, at the Australian War Memorial 9 July 2007 On the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the Corps in 1990, the Survey Corps' contribution to the effectiveness of the ADF was acknowledged in a Notice of Motion from the Senate of the Australian Parliament. Moved by Senator MacGibbon on 31 May 1990, the Notice states: \\"I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That the Senate ‚Äì (a) notes that 1 July 1990 marks the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Royal Australian Survey Corps which produces maps and aeronautical charts required by Australia's defence forces; (b) notes that from the time of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor General NSW, who as a Lieutenant on Wellington's staff served as a surveyor in the Peninsular War, military surveying has played a vital role in the mapping of and development of Australia; (c) acknowledges the Corps' contribution to the knowledge of Australia's geography, topography and environment; (d) notes that the Royal Australian Survey Corps with its high level of professionalism, has served Australia well in war and in peace; (e) acknowledges the valuable mapping service rendered to New Guinea, Indonesia and the south west Pacific by the Survey Corps as part of Australia's overseas aid program; and (f) congratulates the Royal Australian Survey Corps on its meritorious achievements through the 75 years of existence.\\" Parliament of Australia, Senate Hansard, 31 May 1990, page 1505 Also on the 75th anniversary, Australia Post issued a commemorative first day issue prestamped envelope of the Royal Australian Survey Corps. In his official history of the Royal Australian Survey Corps as part of the Australian Army History Series, the much published author and highly regarded military historian, Chris D. Coulthard-Clark, concluded that \\"Australians as a whole might still be blissfully unaware and hence unappreciative of the debt of gratitude owed to the generations of surveyors who have helped make possible the enviable standard of living generally enjoyed today across the country. Should that situation ever change, and the story receive the wider recognition that it deserves, then the part within that tale occupied by military mapmakers is worthy of special acclaim by a grateful nation.\\" Gallery ‚Äì Corps badges and unit colour patches centre On the left is the coloured badge of the Australian Survey Corps 1915‚Äì1948.

The Liberal Party was founded in 1932 as a formal disaffiliation between two political parties which composed the political coalition known as the Alianza (Alliance). Founding  Antonio R. Barcel√≥, founder of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico The Alianza (also called the Coalition) was a coalition between the pro-independence Union Party led by Antonio R. Barcel√≥ and the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico led by Jos√© Tous Soto. Differences between Barcel√≥, Tous Soto and F√©lix C√≥rdova D√°vila, the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, as to the goals of the alliance became apparent. Barcel√≥ requested that Herbert Hoover, the newly elected President of the United States, retain Horace Mann Towner temporarily as governor of the island. Hoover, consulted C√≥rdova D√°vila instead of Barcel√≥ in regard to his intentions of naming Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. to the post.El Nuevo Dia C√≥rdova D√°vila in turn notified Tous Soto, instead of Barcel√≥, as to Hoover's decision. Barcel√≥ was offended and convinced his followers, in the Unionist sector of the alliance, to disaffiliate themselves from the \\"Alliance.\\" Because of legal reasons Barcel√≥ was unable to use the name \\"Union Party\\" and in 1932, founded the \\"Liberal Party of Puerto Rico.\\" The Liberal Party's political agenda was the same as the original Union Party's agenda and urged independence as a political solution for Puerto Rico.Antonio Barcelo Among those who joined him in the \\"new\\" party were Felisa Rinc√≥n de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini. By 1932, Luis Mu√±oz Rivera's son, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, had also joined the Liberal Party. During the elections of 1932, the Liberal Party faced the Alliance, then a coalition of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico and Santiago Iglesias' Socialist Party. Barcel√≥ and Mu√±oz Mar√≠n were both elected senators. The Liberals generally supported the policies of the New Deal and sought to translate the programs to Puerto Rico. It was the strongest single party between 1932 and 1940. It was prevented from taking a majority of seats by the Coalici√≥n. Decline By 1936, differences between Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and Barcel√≥ began to surface. While Barcel√≥ dedicated himself to the local political activities of the party in Puerto Rico, Mu√±oz Mar√≠n was in Washington, D.C., where, with the help of news reporter Ruby Black, he became known among the politicians of the United States. Among his successes in Washington was the implementation of the \\"Plan Chardon\\" in the New Deal of the Roosevelt Administration, which he did without consulting Barcel√≥. The successes of Mu√±oz Mar√≠n convinced many in the island that he was the true leader of the Liberal Party, thereby creating a faction within the party between those who considered Mu√±oz Mar√≠n the true leader and those who considered Barcel√≥ as their leader.\\"Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcelo, 1868-1938\\"; by: Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia; Page 292; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); After the assassination of police colonel Francis Riggs in San Juan as an indirect result of the R√≠o Piedras massacre, which involved the police and students of the University of Puerto Rico, U.S. Senator Millard Tydings presented a legislative proposal in 1936 to grant independence to Puerto Rico. Barcel√≥ and the Liberal Party favored the bill, as did other Puerto Rican parties of the time, because it would give Puerto Rico its independence; Mu√±oz Mar√≠n opposed the bill because he thought it had unfavorable economic conditions. In 1936, a party assembly was held in San Juan where Mu√±oz Mar√≠n stated that he was not interested in being considered for the position of Resident Commissioner and that Barcel√≥ should be the Commissioner. This move would leave the presidency of the party empty and open for Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. Barcel√≥ refused to be named Commissioner and to relinquish his presidency. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and his followers founded a group within the party called \\"Accion Social Puertorrique√±o\\" (Puerto Rican Social Action) who believed in the immediate independence of Puerto Rico. After the Liberal Party was defeated in 1936 elections, an assembly was held in Naranjales on May 31, 1937, in which Mu√±oz Mar√≠n presented his ideas as to how the party should be run; however, the majority of the party members objected and blamed him for their defeat. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n considered this action the same as having been expelled from the party. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and his followers, among which were included Felisa Rincon de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini, held an assembly in the town of Arecibo, founded the Clear, Net, Authentic, and Complete Liberal Party (Partido Liberal, Neto, Aut√©ntico y Completo), claiming to be the true Liberal Party. The Partido Liberal, Neto, Aut√©ntico y Completo, an independence political party, later became the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), which would end up promoting the \\"Estado Libre Associado\\" (Free Associated State) status that Barcel√≥, as president of Union Party, had asked for in 1923 under Campbell Bill and which Mu√±oz Mar√≠n had always opposed, instead of independence. Maria Antonia Josefina Barcel√≥ was elected president of the Liberal Party, upon the passing of her father in 1938, thus becoming the first woman to preside a political party in Puerto Rico. In the years that followed, the Liberal Party lost its base of support to the PPD. The Liberal Party only survived as an electoral force until 1944.

They manufactured wooden toys in a building on North Spring Street. His business expanded rapidly, soon recruiting over 25 employees, and still having trouble filling demands for their popular toys. The corporation documents confirm the president of the toy company was Torrence Dietz and that Rene Grove was the chief designer and one of five partners. The company was capitalize with an initial stock offering of twenty-five thousand dollars. The original partners were Torrence Dietz, president (and salesperson), O.H. Watts, manager and treasurer, Clifford Funk, initially the secretary, and Rene Grove, principal artist and designer, and Elias Klahr, investor. (source financial records) The company had a catalog of around 40 different toys, all of them distributed by the George Borgfeldt Company, including its most popular doll, a black and white mouse named Micky (US Patent #D70,840, received on August 17, 1926). Rene Grove's younger brother, Larry Grove worked at the factory. After the mouse was created, Performo had a \\"Name the Mouse\\" contest. Larry submitted the name Micky and won the contest. Mickey Mouse vs. Micky Mouse debate Performo Toy's Micky: August 17, 1926 Mickey Mouse is one of the most loved cartoon characters in the history of animation industry. The similarities between both mice have led to speculation that Walt Disney stole his most successful idea from the Performo Toy Company. The wooden mouse was very popular in New York City (where Performo's distributor was located) in 1928. Coincidentally, at about the same time, Disney thought of the idea for his animation studio's new character and began drafting cartoons, which then aired as shorts, padding the time between one film and the next, and were extremely popular. Other shorts included newsreels, which showed film of events from around the world, much as does a nightly news broadcast in the heyday of television broadcasting. There is a well known legend in Middletown about how Performo Toy Company sued The Walt Disney Company, which included some coverage in the local paper. A conspiracy theory might have arisen from this story, however, History Detectives, a television program on PBS, conducted an extensive investigation on the topic.302_mousetoy.pdf The historians and researchers of the PBS program conducted a nationwide search, finding that there are no records nor evidence of any legal action between the two parties. Inquiries to Disney historians and archivists resulted in a letter stating that no such action had ever existed between the companies. Hence the legend is dismissed as local gossip made urban myth. Part of the program showed that Performo's Micky, while very close to Walt Disney's, actually grew more that way after the cartoon's success. Performo's Micky Mouse, without the \\"e\\", suddenly developed red shorts with white buttons, as was shown by a Mickey collector who had both products in his multi-room collection. The program's investigating historian concluded that it was a series of generic mice that featured in Felix the Cat (1922), Milton Mouse from Aesop's Film Fables (1920) or Ignatz Mouse from Krazy Kat (1914), which provided the inspiration for Mickey Mouse. When viewed side by side and in sequence of appearance, an evolution of the many mice in cartoons of the era is striking, if not conclusive. Further, in 1932 the sales of Mickey Mouse toy paraphernalia out-grossed the revenues for the films themselves, the first time that happened in the experience of Hollywood. At nearly the same time, Performo came onto hard times despite its rapid growth and filed for bankruptcy in 1933. The PBS historian concludes it became a victim of the depression like many other toy companies and other luxury goods producers while the movie tie-in enabled Disney's nascent toys and novelties business to weather the hard times of the Great Depression. The Simpsons episode \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" bears a remarkable similar story line to the Grove‚ÄìDisney debate. Bankruptcy In the July 15, 1933 edition of the Press and Journal, the Performo Toy Company announced they were filing for bankruptcy. It is believed that the Great Depression forced them to padlock their doors.

The print magazine is published eight months per-year, while the magazine also operates a website, Tennis.com. History The magazine was established in May 1965, published out of Chicago with a regional focus. The tennis boom of the 1970s resulted in a rapid expansion of the magazine, both in scope and circulation. In addition to top tennis stars, celebrities like Johnny Carson and Farrah Fawcett appeared on the cover. It was owned by Golf Digest / Tennis Magazine and sold to the New York Times Company. Miller Publishing bought the magazine in 1997 from The New York Times Company. It brought on two retired champions as part owners and contributors: first Chris Evert in 2000 then Pete Sampras in 2003. In the early 2010s the circulation was 600,000 subscriptions, the majority of which were purchased by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for its members. In 2014, publisher and USTA board member Jeff Willams purchased controlling interest in Tennis Media Company, owner of the magazine and its offshoot website. In 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of Tennis Channel, acquired Tennis Media Company for $8 million, seeking to build synergies between the properties. Content Aside from articles about the most recent events and most active players, the magazine also includes the recent ranking for both ATP and WTA, as well as brief summaries of the future tournaments, their participants and the past winners. Chris Evert has her own personal section in the magazine‚Äîusually the first page‚Äîwhich is called \\"Chrissie's Page\\". Aside from Evert, other famous players and coaches also contribute to the magazine, Pete Sampras, Paul Annacone, former coach of Sampras, is the Senior Instruction Editor and Brad Gilbert, former coach of Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick, is Touring Instruction Editor. \\"The 40 Greatest Players of the Tennis Era\\" (2005) In celebration of its 40th anniversary (1965‚Äì2005), Tennis published a series rating the 40 best players of those four decades.culminating in the November/December 2005 issue # Pete Sampras # Martina Navratilova # Steffi Graf # Chris Evert # Bj√∂rn Borg # Margaret Court # Jimmy Connors # Rod Laver # Billie Jean King # Ivan Lendl # John McEnroe # Andre Agassi # Monica Seles # Stefan Edberg # Mats Wilander # John Newcombe # Serena Williams # Boris Becker # Roger Federer # Ken Rosewall # Roy Emerson # Martina Hingis # Evonne Goolagong # Guillermo Vilas # Venus Williams # Jim Courier # Arantxa S√°nchez Vicario # Ilie NƒÉstase # Lindsay Davenport # Arthur Ashe # Justine Henin # Tracy Austin # Hana Mandl√≠kov√° # Lleyton Hewitt # Stan Smith # Jennifer Capriati # Gustavo Kuerten # Virginia Wade # Patrick Rafter # Gabriela Sabatini \\"The 50 Greatest Players of the Open Era\\" (2018) In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Open Era in tennis (1968‚Äì2018), the magazine published a series rating the 50 best players of those five decades (25 men and 25 women). *Active players are marked in boldface.

Atlanta Amtrak Station Reid was born in Jacksonville, Alabama, in 1885. He moved to Macon, Georgia, with his family in 1890.Mitchell, William. J. Neel Reid Architect. Golden Coast Publishing. p.18. After an apprenticeship with architect Curran Ellis, Reid moved to Atlanta to continue his career at the suggestion of his mentor. Reid specialized in elaborate homes, but he also designed commercial, transportation, educational, medical, and university buildings. Many of these buildings survive today, primarily centered in the Buckhead and Ansley Park sections of Atlanta and in Athens, Georgia. The blueprints of Reid's designs are held as part of the Hentz, Reid and Adler Drawing Collection at the Archives and Special Collections of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Reid lived in Mimosa Hall (built by Major John Dunwoody c. 1840) in Roswell which he bought in 1916 and extensively renovated including designing the gardens. Reid died of brain cancer on February 14, 1926, at the age of 40 and was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.

She was built in 1944 as SS Cape Kumukaki for the United States Maritime Commission for use in World War II. The ship was sold in 1947 and then operated in scheduled service under the name Flying Enterprise. History Cape Kumukaki was built by Consolidated Steel Corporation of Wilmington, California and launched on 7 January 1944. Delivered on 18 March 1944, she was owned by the United States War Shipping Administration and registered at Los Angeles. After the end of World War II, she was sold in 1947 to the Isbrandtsen Company. At this time, her name was changed to the Flying Enterprise and re-registered in New York. For the next five years, she was used as a general cargo freighter in the North Atlantic. On 21 December 1951, under the command of Henrik Kurt Carlsen, she left Hamburg, Germany bound for the USA. Among her cargo was of pig iron and of coffee, rags, peat moss, twelve Volkswagen cars, antiques and antique musical instruments, typewriters, of naphthalene as well as ten passengers. There is speculation that the cargo also included gold and zirconium. Four days later, on Christmas night, she encountered a storm in the Western Approaches to the English Channel. Afterwards, it was discovered that she had suffered structural damage and a crack was found across the weather deck from a rogue wave. The cargo then shifted. An SOS was issued on 28 December, by which time she was listing 45 degrees to port. British flagged vessel MV Sherborne and USS General A. W. Greely responded, Sherborne being first to arrive, early in the morning of 29 December. Carlsen, however, was reluctant to evacuate passengers and crew to a British ship. Sherborne was asked to remain on station in case the situation deteriorated before an American ship arrived. The situation did deteriorate, just as USS General A W Greely arrived mid-afternoon and both ships sent lifeboats to pick up passengers and crew. The crew and passengers were evacuated with the loss of one life (a male passenger). Captain Carlsen remained on board. After passengers and crew had been evacuated, MV Sherborne was released and continued her voyage to Manchester. By 2 January 1952, the USS John W. Weeks had arrived and relieved the merchant ships. The following day, the tug Turmoil arrived, guided by the searchlights from USS John W Weeks, but found it impossible to take the Flying Enterprise in tow. The tug's mate, Kenneth Dancy, was then transferred to the Flying Enterprise on 4 January, by which time the list had increased to 60 degrees. The ship was taken in tow on 5 January, when she was some from Falmouth, Cornwall. On 6 January, USS Willard Keith relieved the John W Weeks and the French tug Abeille 25 also joined the rescue effort. The tow line parted at 01:30 on 10 January, with Flying Enterprise south of The Lizard and from Falmouth. Later that day, the Turmoil was joined by the Trinity House vessel Satellite and the tugs Dexterous and Englishman. Carlsen and Dancy finally abandoned ship at 15:22 hrs and were picked up by Turmoil. The Flying Enterprise sank at 16:10 hrs to whistle, siren and foghorn salutes from the flotilla. The salvage attempts were criticised as the ship might have been saved by heading for the nearest safe harbour, Cork, rather than Falmouth. A public house in Cork, Ireland is named the \\"Flying Enterprise\\" after the ship. Salvage In 1960, some $210,000 of the $800,000-worth of cargo was salvaged from Flying Enterprise by the Italian company Sorima. Under a confidentiality clause in the salvage contract, further details of the recovered cargo were not released. Flying Enterprise & Kurt Carlsen was published in Danish. 29 November in an English version. Before Carlsen died he told journalist and author Bjarne Bekker his life story in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The burial at sea over Flying Enterprise happened 8 February 1990 after a journey to Japan in a safety box on SS Jutlandia. Wreck discovery and diving On June 22, 2001, the Danish expedition company No Limit Diving and the Danish filmmaker Lasse Spang Olsen (who was making a documentary, The Mystery of Flying Enterprise), using a team of Danish and British divers, rediscovered the lost shipwreck of Flying Enterprise almost 50 years after she had sunk. Deep wreck diver Leigh Bishop had researched the whereabouts of the sinking and obtained information from British government departments on the wreck's approximate location. Photographs taken by Leigh Bishop were enough to positively identify the wreck as that of the Flying Enterprise. Later Leigh Bishop worked with US divers John Chatterton and Richie Kohler to film the wreck for a 2005 episode of the History Channel's Deep Sea Detectives. This became the deepest wreck dived of the 56 episodes made.History Channel. Deep Sea Detectives: \\"Captain's Last Stand\\" (Season 5, Episode 8, 24 April 2005) The wreck now lies resting on her port side in a depth of on the seabed of the western approaches to the English Channel. Leigh Bishop recovered artifacts from the site, which went on display for many years to the general public in the Cornish Maritime Museum. Speculation into the sinking and cargo Speculations about a shipment of zirconium, intended for use in the first nuclear submarine USS Nautilus (SSN-571), but registered as pig iron, were discussed in a 2002 Danish television documentary Det Sk√¶ve skib (English title: The Mystery of Flying Enterprise). According to this documentary, information regarding the cargo is still (in the year 2002) regarded as confidential and details are not available from the CIA, FIA, Coast Guard and/or US Navy. On the other hand, there appears to have been no secret that the US Atomic Energy Commission was acquiring zirconium, so it is not clear why any of these organizations should actually have information related to the Flying Enterprise. In the interview with Bekker, Carlsen tells him that yes the ship had a zirconium cargo and that it came from the German nuclear energy project. While there seems to be no reason to doubt the first statement, the origin of the zirconium is questionable as the German nuclear energy program was not very advanced. It has been speculated that the zirconium instead came from Philips in Eindhoven, the company that had the first patent on a process to obtain high purity zirconium, and that the buyer was one of the companies intending to bid for a contract with the US Atomic Energy Commission. Passengers and cargo The passengers on board Flying Enterprise were Nicolai Bunjakowski, Nina Dannheiser, Maria Duttenhofer, Rolf Kastenholz, Leonore von Klenau, Curt and Elsa M√ºller and their children Liane and Lothar, and Frederick Niederbr√ºning. All survived except Bunjakowski, who drowned during the rescue. An exceptionally rare violin by Vincenzo Rugeri was lost to the sea when the ship sank. Honours Captain Carlsen was awarded a Lloyd's Silver Medal for Meritorious Service in recognition of his efforts to save Flying Enterprise, and received a ticker-tape parade in New York City on January 17, 1952. Kenneth Dancy was awarded the Order of Industrial Heroism medal by the Daily Herald and an illuminated citation from the American Institute of Marine Underwriters. He died on 3 August 2013, aged 88.

The Chords were one of the first acts to be signed to the Atlantic Records subsidiary label, Cat Records.

The track was covered by the Crew-Cuts who took the song to the top of the charts, to arguably register the first US rock and roll number one hit record. The Chords initial euphoria was diluted when Gem Records claimed that one of the groups on its roster was called the Chords, and therefore the singers of the big hit quickly changed their name to the Chordcats.

Triaxial cable, often referred to as triax for short, is a type of electrical cable similar to coaxial cable, but with the addition of an extra layer of insulation and a second conducting sheath. It provides greater bandwidth and rejection of interference than coax, but is more expensive. Applications =Television production= The most common use of triaxial cable is in television industry as a connecting cable between a camera and its camera control unit (CCU). The outer sheath is commonly used as a protective earth conductor. The core provides both power and signal connections, with the return for the power being provided through the inner screen. Through frequency-division multiplexing, the camera can send audio and video signals along the triax while the CCU can send camera control information, such as exposure settings, intercom, return audio and video (usually that of the program), and tally (a signal alerting the operator that their camera is on the air). Venues that host television productions fairly often, such as sports arenas, will usually have triaxial cables run from the location of the TV truck to common camera locations throughout the building. This is convenient for visiting television crews, who can simply plug into existing cable runs instead of having to run their own cables and remove them after the broadcast. *In 1992 N.V. Philips, Breda received the Outstanding Achievement in Technical/Engineering Development Award from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for Triaxial cable Technology for Color Television Cameras. Also see Norelco and BTS =Decline of triax in television= With the increasing bandwidth requirements of developments such as 4K/UHDTV, HFR (high frame rate) and HDR (high dynamic range) the use of triax is declining in the TV industry. Most of the recently developed broadcast cameras from the leading manufacturers have hybrid single-mode fibre and copper power cores which supersede the older triax connectivity. The advantages of the hybrid copper/fibre over triax cable are noise immunity due to the optical isolation and extremely high bandwidth. =Current measurements= Another application for triaxial cables is in taking precision low-current measurements where the leakage current through the insulator between the core and shield would normally alter the measurements. The core (known as the force) and the inner shield (known as the guard) are kept at approximately the same electrical potential by a voltage buffer/follower, thus the leakage current between them is zero for all practical purposes, despite the imperfections of the insulation. Instead, the leakage current occurs between the inner and outer shields, which does not matter since that current will be supplied by the buffer circuit rather than the device under test and will not affect measurements. This technique can provide almost perfect elimination of leakage current but becomes less effective at higher frequencies as the buffer cannot follow the measured voltage.

Pomerance was a mathematician at the University of Georgia at the time Aaron (a member of the nearby Atlanta Braves) broke Ruth's record, and the student of one of Pomerance's colleagues noticed that the sums of the prime factors of 714 and 715 were equal.Aaron Numbers -- Numberphile Examples If only distinct prime factors are counted, the first few Ruth‚ÄìAaron pairs are: :(5, 6), (24, 25), (49, 50), (77, 78), (104, 105), (153, 154), (369, 370), (492, 493), (714, 715), (1682, 1683), (2107, 2108) (The lesser of each pair is listed in ). Counting repeated prime factors (e.g., 8 = 2√ó2√ó2 and 9 = 3√ó3 with 2+2+2 = 3+3), the first few Ruth‚ÄìAaron pairs are: :(5, 6), (8, 9), (15, 16), (77, 78), (125, 126), (714, 715), (948, 949), (1330, 1331) (The lesser of each pair is listed in ). The intersection of the two lists begins: :(5, 6), (77, 78), (714, 715), (5405, 5406). (The lesser of each pair is listed in ). Any Ruth‚ÄìAaron pair of square-free integers belongs to both lists with the same sum of prime factors. The intersection also contains pairs that are not square-free, for example (7129199, 7129200) = (7√ó112√ó19√ó443, 24√ó3√ó52√ó13√ó457). Here 7+11+19+443 = 2+3+5+13+457 = 480, and also 7+11+11+19+443 = 2+2+2+2+3+5+5+13+457 = 491. Density Ruth-Aaron pairs are sparse (that is, they have density 0).

It was later animated as a 3 episode anime OVA series. Both the manga and the OVA have been licensed by Media Blasters for distribution in the USA. It follows the story of a humanoid created by a robotics expert named Dr. Otoi for his grandson, Nobuhiko. But in the process of writing and applying the programming, an unfortunate mishap takes place! Nobuhiko sneezes. Now, whenever Nobuhiko sneezes, the humanoid (named Signal) transforms from a temperamental adult robot into a chocolate-loving baby version of himself. Despite this little error, the days spent with the Otoi crew are usually fun. Animals, people, and robots all can live in harmony. Until one day, Signal is attacked by Pulse, a robot created by Dr. Otoi some time ago. Much like a prototype for Signal. Pulse is incredibly nearsighted, but makes up for what he lacks in vision with firepower. Dr. Otoi's mysterious rival has packed him to the brim with amazing weaponry, with the intent of stealing the Doctor's most recent robo technology. Characters ;Signal : :The namesake of the series, Signal is the newest HFR (Human Form Robot) to be created by Professor Otoi. He is unique because of the MIRA and SIRIUS technology in him, which sometimes makes him a target of those wishing to steal his data. He is programmed to be a fighter and an older brother to Professor Otoi's grandson, Nobuhiko. Due to an accident in the lab during his creation, when Nobuhiko sneezes, it transforms Signal into a much smaller version of himself. He is referred to as 'Chibi Signal', is very hyper, and adores chocolate. ;Nobuhiko Otoi : :The grandson of Professor Otoi. Signal's 'little brother'. Because Nobu interrupted Signal's programming by sneezing, he ended up causing a glitch in MIRA. Every time Nobuhiko sneezes, Signal transforms into a 3-year-old chibi signal. ;'''''' : :Nobuhiko's grandfather. ;Mini Signal : ;Chris Sine : :The one and only super smart robot scientist\\" as she would say. She's somewhat loud and obnoxious but yet still a likeable character. However despite her claims of being such a genius and beautiful robot scientist, Kris is a bit of a flop. Her robots often end up failing, or going berserk, or just simply getting smashed by Signal. But she wishes to create a super robot more powerful and impressive than any other, despite her failures. She soon becomes the apprentice of Dr. Otoi and appears to be friends with Pulse. ;Pulse : :The prototype for Signal made by Otoi-sensei and Masanobu. Originally he was seen with silver hair and a grey styled outfit. He was a very kind and gentle robot but then one day Masanobu made some changes, upgrading him into a highly skilled combat robot. His look then changed to black long hair and dark clothes with two massive blades connected to his arms. It also appears that he conducts electricity through his hair and then charges that power through his eyes like a laser. These changes were not entirely for the best. Now he seems to be VERY nearsighted and if he should get too worn down he passes out. His laser also decreases energy. He has what appears to be robotic narcolepsy. He and Signal constantly fight and tease each other, but Pulse seems to have a soft spot for Chibi Signal and often talks with him. It also appears he was/is friends with Kris. ;Elara (also Erala) : :A somewhat ditsy little robot that really can't cook and tends to find herself in a lot of trouble.

It drains a large coastal watershed that includes the city of San Luis Obispo, emptying into the Pacific Ocean at Avila Beach. Geography The creek as it flows past the Mission in downtown San Luis Obispo. San Luis Obispo Creek begins in the Santa Lucia Mountains, at Cuesta Pass in the Los Padres National Forest. It flows south down a steep canyon below the Cuesta Grade of U.S. Highway 101 and turns to the west after receiving Reservoir Canyon Creek from the left. Entering the city of San Luis Obispo it turns southwest, flowing through residential areas and past San Luis Obispo High School. The creek flows in a man-made channel as it approaches downtown west of Johnson Street. At Osos Street it enters a concrete tunnel about long passing beneath downtown San Luis Obispo. After emerging from the tunnel it flows past Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, and then receives Stenner Creek from the right just upstream of Marsh Street. Below Marsh Street, the creek flows south in a natural channel along the east side of Highway 101, then flows through industrial areas and farmland in the southern part of the city. Near Los Osos Valley Road, it receives Prefumo Creek and Froom Creek from the right, before leaving the city limits of San Luis Obispo. It enters a canyon along the east side of the Irish Hills, receiving the East Fork of San Luis Obispo Creek and Davenport Creek from the left, then turns sharply to the west and receives See Canyon Creek from the right. Approaching its mouth, the creek forms a small estuary before emptying into the Pacific Ocean at San Luis Obispo Bay, just west of Avila Beach. Watershed The San Luis Obispo Creek watershed covers . Most of the watershed consists of rangeland and open space, with some farmland and orchards. About 11 percent of the watershed, mostly in the city of San Luis Obispo, is urbanized. The watershed experiences a moderately wet Mediterranean climate, with a mean annual rainfall of . The East Fork of San Luis Obispo Creek is the largest sub-basin, and drains most of the southern part of the city of San Luis Obispo. Stenner Creek, the second largest sub-basin, drains northern San Luis Obispo and includes the tributaries Brizzolara Creek and Old Garden Creek. Brizzolara Creek flows through the Cal Poly campus. The third largest sub-basin, Prefumo Creek, drains Laguna Lake, one of the only natural lakes in San Luis Obispo County, as well as much of the Irish Hills Natural Reserve and the eastern end of Los Osos Valley. Ecology Various barriers to fish migration have been created on San Luis Obispo Creek and its tributaries, since the city of San Luis Obispo developed. Stage Coach Dam on the upper reaches of the creek was removed in 2002. It had been built in the early 1900s to create a water supply reservoir, but was filled in with sediment. Other barriers have been removed as well, often by creating notches in the middle to concentrate low flows or adding rock weirs to back up the water over an obstacle or provide a more gradual change in elevation. North American beaver (Castor canadensis) have been thought to be non-native to San Luis Obispo Creek but Bolton recorded in \\"Anza's California Expeditions\\" that in April 1774, Father Cavaller of Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa gave Juan Bautista de Anza \\"thirty-odd beaver skins\\" along with other local gifts including fine Indian baskets and \\"the skins of eight bears, the animals for which the region was renowned\\".

It extends for just under from an intersection with NY 26 in the Lewis County town of Lewis to a junction with NY 46 in the Oneida County village of Boonville. The route serves the hamlet of West Leyden at its western terminus and the community of Redmond Center in the Oneida County town of Ava. NY 294 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Route description First reassurance marker on NY 294 eastbound in West Leyden NY 294 begins at an intersection with NY 26 in the Lewis hamlet of West Leyden in southern Lewis County. Leaving a small strip of businesses and residences along NY 26, the road heads east into a mostly rural area. NY 294 crosses into Oneida County from NY 26 and passes through the Oneida County Reforestation Area, where the highway becomes surrounded by dense woods. After exiting the reforestation area, NY 294 heads across expansive farmlands before reaching a junction with County Route 67 (East Eva Road), which intersects from the south. The highway continues east, traveling past occasional farmhouses as it gradually turns toward the northeast. It passes another farm before entering a more developed corridor, although the transition is subtle. NY 294 passes several residences on its way into the village of Boonville, located about from the route's western terminus, where the highway becomes Ford Street. The highway serves Adirondack High School on its way to entering the heavily developed center of Boonville. Here, it becomes lined with dozens of closely situated houses and resumes an eastward direction for the remainder of its length. The route passes Boonville Elementary School on its way to the center of Boonville, where it ends at a junction with NY 46 (Post Street). History Sometime prior to 1923, the east‚Äìwest highway connecting West Leyden to Boonville was selected to become a state highway by New York State Department of Highways Commissioner Frederick Stuart Greene, who had drawn up a map of proposed state highways in Oneida County and presented it to the New York State Legislature for approval. The mileage for the route came from part of either modern NY 12 or NY 12D, a segment of which had been designated a state road before it became part of Route 27, a legislative route, in 1908. By law, the mileage of any road previously designated as a state highway and later included as part of a legislative route would be reassigned to another highway, allowing the West Leyden‚ÄìBoonville road to become state-maintained. The plan fell through when the legislature ultimately adopted another version of the state highway map that did not include the West Leyden‚ÄìBoonville road. In 1923, Boonville Town Supervisor Clarence R. Sperry visited Albany to lobby Commissioner Greene and the state legislature to add the road to the state highway system. Although Greene still favored the inclusion of the highway, the road had still not been added to the state highway system by 1926. Despite this fact, the road was designated as NY 294 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was finally accepted by the state and rebuilt to state highway standards by 1932.

The film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers, the oil industry, the federal government of the United States, the California government, batteries, hydrogen vehicles, and consumers in limiting the development and adoption of this technology. After a premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, it was released theatrically by Sony Pictures Classics in June 2006 and then on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on November 14, 2006. A follow-up documentary, Revenge of the Electric Car, was released in 2011. Topics addressed The film deals with the history of the electric car, its modern development, and commercialization. The film focuses primarily on the General Motors EV1, which was made available for lease mainly in Southern California, after the California Air Resources Board (CARB) passed the zero- emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 1990 which required the seven major automobile suppliers in the United States to offer electric vehicles in order to continue sales of their gasoline powered vehicles in California. Nearly 5000 electric cars were designed and manufactured by Chrysler, the Ford Motor Company, General Motors (GM), Honda, Nissan, and Toyota; and then later destroyed or donated to museums and educational institutions. Also discussed are the implications of the events depicted for air pollution, oil dependency, Middle East politics, and global warming. The film details the California Air Resources Board's reversal of the mandate after relentless pressure and suits from automobile manufacturers, continual pressure from the oil industry, orchestrated hype over a future hydrogen car, and finally the George W. Bush administration. A portion of the film details GM's efforts to demonstrate to California that there was no consumer demand for their product, and then to take back every EV1 and destroy them. A few were disabled and given to museums and universities, but almost all were found to have been crushed. GM never responded to the EV drivers' offer to pay the residual lease value; $1.9 million was offered for the remaining 78 cars in Burbank, California before they were crushed. Several activists, including actresses Alexandra Paul and Colette Divine, were arrested in the protest that attempted to block the GM car carriers taking the remaining EV1s off to be crushed. The film explores some of the motives that may have pushed the auto and oil industries to kill off the electric car. Wally Rippel offers, for example, that the oil companies were afraid of losing their monopoly on transportation fuel over the coming decades; while the auto companies feared short-term costs for EV development and long-term revenue loss because EVs require little maintenance and no tuneups. Others explained the killing differently. GM spokesman Dave Barthmuss argued it was lack of consumer interest due to the maximum range of 80‚Äì100 miles per charge, and the relatively high price. The film also showed the failed attempts by electric car enthusiasts trying to combat auto industry moves, and save the surviving vehicles. Towards the end of the film, a deactivated EV1 car #99 is found in the garage of Petersen Automotive Museum, with former EV sales representative, Chelsea Sexton, invited for a visit. The film also explores the future of automobile technologies including a deeply critical look at hydrogen vehicles, an upbeat discussion of plug-in hybrids, and examples of other developing EV technologies such as the Tesla Roadster (2008), released on the market two years after the film. Interviews The film features interviews with celebrities who drove the electric car, such as Ed Begley Jr., Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks, Peter Horton, and Alexandra Paul. It also features interviews with a selection of prominent American political figures including Jim Boyd, S. David Freeman, Frank Gaffney, Alan C. Lloyd (Chairman of the California Air Resources Board), Alan Lowenthal, and Ralph Nader. Included are interviews with Edward H. Murphy (representative of the American Petroleum Institute), and James Woolsey (former Director of Central Intelligence), as well as news footage from the development, launch and marketing of EVs. The film also features interviews with some of the engineers and technicians who led the development of modern electric vehicles and related technologies, such as Wally Rippel, Chelsea Sexton, Alec Brooks, Alan Cocconi, Paul MacCready, Stan and Iris M. Ovshinsky, and other experts such as Joseph J. Romm (author of Hell and High Water and The Hype about Hydrogen). Romm gives a presentation intended to show that the government's \\"hydrogen car initiative\\" is a bad policy choice and a distraction that is delaying the exploitation of more promising technologies, such as electric and hybrid cars which could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase America's energy security. Also featured in the film are spokespersons for the automakers, such as GM's Dave Barthmuss, a vocal opponent of the film and the EV1, John Wallace from Ford, and Bill Reinert from Toyota. Production and release The film was written and directed by Chris Paine, and produced by Jessie Deeter, and executive produced by Tavin Marin Titus, Richard D. Titus of Plinyminor and Dean Devlin, Kearie Peak, Mark Roskin, and Rachel Olshan of Electric Entertainment. The film features a film score composed by Michael Brook. It also features music by Joe Walsh, DJ Harry and Meeky Rosie. Jeff Steele, Kathy Weiss, Natalie Artin and Alex Gibney were also part of the producing team. The documentary was featured at the Sundance, San Francisco, Tribeca, Los Angeles, Berlin, Deauville, and Wild and Scenic Environmental film festivals and was released in theaters worldwide in June 2006. The suspects The film features the symbolic EV1 funeral held at Hollywood Forever Cemetery as a protest to General Motors' decision to terminate all EV1 leases and crush the electric cars. The later portion of the film is organized around the following hypothesized culprits in the downfall of the electric car: =American consumers= While few American consumers ever heard of the electric cars in California, those who did were not necessarily critical mass for this new technology. Thanks to lower gas prices and infatuation with sport utility vehicles (SUVs), few people sought out this new technology. While some were fans (as chronicled in the film), many more needed time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of these new cars; whether freedom from oil or with the perceived limitations of a city car with a 100-mile range. Although allegations are made about consumers by industry representatives in the film, perhaps explaining the film's \\"guilty\\" verdict, the actual consumers interviewed in the film were either unaware that an electric car was ever available to try, or dismayed that they could no longer obtain one. =Batteries= In a bit of an unexpected turn, the film's sole \\"not-guilty\\" suspect is batteries, one of the chief culprits if one were to ask the oil or auto industries. At the time GM's EV1 came to market, it came with a lead acid battery with a range of 60 miles. The film suggests that since the average driving distance of Americans in a day is 30 miles or less, for 90% of Americans, electric cars would work as a daily commute car or second car. The second generation EV1 (and those released by Honda, Toyota, and others) from 1998 to the end of the program, featured nickel-metal-hydride or even lithium- ion (Nissan) batteries with a range of 100 or more miles. The film documents that the company which had supplied batteries for EV1, Ovonics, had been suppressed from announcing improved batteries, with double the range, lest CARB be convinced that batteries were improving. Later, General Motors sold the supplier's majority control share to the Chevron Corporation and Cobasys. As part of the not-guilty verdict, the famed engineer Alan Cocconi explains that with laptop computer lithium ion batteries, the EV1 could have been upgraded to a range of 300 miles per charge. He makes this point in front of his T-Zero prototype, the car that inspired the Tesla Roadster (2008). =Oil companies= The oil industry, through its major lobby group the Western States Petroleum Association, is brought to task for financing campaigns to kill utility efforts to build public car charging stations. Through astroturfing groups like \\"Californians Against Utility Abuse\\" they posed as consumers instead of the industry interests they actually represented. Mobil and other oil companies are also shown to be advertising directly against electric cars in national publications, even when electric cars seem to have little to do with their core business. At the end of the film, Chevron bought patents and controlling interest in Ovonics, the advanced battery company featured in the film, ostensibly to prevent modern NiMH batteries from being used in non-hybrid electric cars. The documentary also refers to manipulation of oil prices by overseas suppliers in the 1980s as an example of the industry working to kill competition and keep customers from moving toward alternatives to oil. =Car companies= The film features the \\"Don't Crush Campaign\\" protest Crushed EV1s in a junk yard are shown in the film With GM as its primary example, the film documents that car makers engaged in both positive and negative marketing of the electric car as its intentions toward the car and California legislation changed. In earlier days, GM ran Super Bowl commercials produced by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for the EV1. In later days it ran \\"award winning\\" doomsday-style advertising featuring the EV1 and ran customer surveys which emphasized drawbacks to electronic vehicle technology which were not actually present in the EV1. (As a side note, CARB officials were quoted claiming that they removed their zero emission vehicle quotas in part because they gave weight to such surveys purportedly showing no demand existing for the EV1s.) Other charges raised on GM included sabotaging their own product program, failing to produce cars to meet existing demand, and refusing to sell cars directly (it only leased them). The film also describes the history of automaker efforts to destroy competing technologies, such as their destruction through front companies of public transit systems in the United States in the early 20th century. In addition to EV1, the film also depicted how Toyota RAV4 EV, and Honda EV Plus were being cancelled by their respective car companies. The crushing of Honda EV Plus only gained attention after appearing quite by accident on an episode of PBS's California's Gold with Huell Howser. In an interview with retired GM board member Tom Everhart, the film points out that GM killed the EV1 to focus on more immediately profitable enterprises such as its Hummer and truck brands, instead of preparing for future challenges. Ralph Nader, in a brief appearance, points out that auto makers usually only respond to government regulation when it comes to important advances whether seat belts, airbags, catalytic converters, mileage requirements or, by implication, hybrid/electric cars. The film suggests Toyota supported the production of Toyota Prius hybrid in part as a response to Bill Clinton's Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and other U.S. Government pressure that was later dropped. Though GM cited cost as a deterrent to continuing with the EV1, the film interviewed critics contending that the cost of batteries and electric vehicles would have been reduced significantly if mass production began, due to economies of scale. There is also discussion about electric cars threatening dealer profits since they have so few service requirements‚Äîno tuneups, no oil changes, and less frequent brake jobs because of regenerative braking. =U.S. government= While not overtly political, the film documents that the federal government of the United States under the Presidency of George W. Bush joined the auto- industry suit against California in 2002. This pushed California to abandon its ZEV mandate regulation. The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies. By failing to increase mileage standards in a meaningful way since the 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars. =California Air Resources Board= In 2003, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), headed by Democrat Alan Lloyd, finally caved to industry pressure and drastically scaled back the ZEV mandate. CARB had previously defended the regulation for more than 12 years. While championing CARB's efforts on behalf of California's with its 1990 mandate (and other regulations over the years), the film suggests Lloyd may have had a conflict of interest, as the director of the California Fuel Cell Partnership. The ZEV change allowed a marginal amount of hydrogen fuel cell cars to be produced in the future, versus the immediate continued growth of its electric car requirement. Footage shot in the meetings showed Lloyd shutting down battery electric car proponents while giving the car makers all the time they wanted to make their points. =Hydrogen fuel cell= The hydrogen fuel cell was presented by the film as an alternative that distracts attention from the real and immediate potential of electric vehicles to an unlikely future possibility embraced by auto makers, oil companies and a pro-business administration in order to buy time and profits for the status quo. The film corroborates the claim that hydrogen vehicles are a mere distraction by stating that \\"A fuel cell car powered by hydrogen made with electricity uses three to four times more energy than a car powered by batteries\\" and by interviewing Joseph J. Romm, the author of The Hype about Hydrogen, who lists five problems he sees with hydrogen vehicles: High cost, limits on driving range due to current materials, high costs of hydrogen fuel, the need for entirely new fueling compounds, and competition from other technologies in the marketplace, such as hybrids. The price of hydrogen has since come down to $4‚Äì6/kg (without carbon sequestering) due to reduction in the price of natural gas as a feedstock for steam reforming owing to the proliferation of hydraulic fracturing of shales. A kilo of hydrogen has the same energy yield as a gallon of gasoline although production currently creates 12.5 kg CO2, 39% more than the 8.91 kg CO2 from a gasoline gallon. Response from General Motors General Motors (GM) responded in a 2006 blog post titled \\"Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?\\"Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car? blog post copy in PDF format written by Dave Barthmuss of GM's communications department. In his June 15, 2006 post‚Äîpublished 13 days before the film was released in the U.S.‚ÄîBarthmuss claims not to have seen the film, but believes \\"there may be some information that the movie did not tell its viewers.\\" He repeats GM's claims that, \\"despite the substantial investment of money and the enthusiastic fervor of a relatively small number of EV1 drivers ‚Äî including the filmmaker ‚Äî the EV1 proved far from a viable commercial success.\\" He submits it is \\"good news for electric car enthusiasts\\" that electric vehicle technology since the EV1 was still being used. It was used in two-mode hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicle programs. Barthmuss also cites \\"GM's leadership\\" in flex- fuel vehicles development, hydrogen fuel cell technology, and their new \\"active fuel management\\" system which improve fuel economy, as reasons they feel they are \\"doing more than any other automaker to address the issues of oil dependence, fuel economy and emissions from vehicles.\\" Responding to the film's harsh criticisms for discontinuing the EV1, Barthmuss outlines GM's reasons for doing so, implying that GM did so due to inadequate support from parts suppliers, as well as poor consumer demand despite \\"significant sums (spent) on marketing and incentives to develop a mass market for it.\\" Barthmuss claimed he personally regretted the way the decision not to sell the EV1s was handled, but stated it was because GM would no longer be able to repair it or \\"guarantee it could be operated safely over the long term,\\" with lack of available parts making \\"future repair and safety of the vehicles difficult to nearly impossible.\\" He also claimed that \\"no other major automotive manufacturer is producing a pure electric vehicle for use on public roads and highways.\\" In March 2009, however, outgoing CEO of GM Rick Wagoner said the biggest mistake he ever made as chief executive was killing the EV1 car and failing to direct more resources to electrics and hybrids after such an early lead in this technology.Neil, Dan. \\"The Rick Wagoner vehicles: Hits and misses\\", LA Times, March 31, 2009 GM has since championed its electric-car expertise as a key factor in development of its 2010 Chevrolet Volt, Chevy Spark EV, and the Chevrolet Bolt. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 89% approval rating based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 7.19/10.[url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/who_killed_the_electric_car/ Who Killed the Electric Car?], Rotten Tomatoes, accessed December 28, 2010 Metacritic, another review collator, reported a positive rating of 70, based on 28 reviews polled.MetaCritic review Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, \\"It's a story Mr. Paine tells with bite. In 1996 a Los Angeles newspaper reported that 'the air board grew doubtful about the willingness of consumers to accept the cars, which carry steep price tags and have a limited travel range.' Mr. Paine pushes beyond this ostensibly disinterested report, suggesting that one reason the board might have grown doubtful was because its chairman at the time, Alan C. Lloyd, had joined the California Fuel Cell Partnership.\\"Dargis, Manohla. \\"'Who Killed the Electric Car?': Some Big Reasons the Electric Car Can't Cross the Road\\", The New York Times, June 28, 2006 Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter noted Alan Lloyd's conflict of interest in the film.Rechtshaffen, Michael. Hollywood Reporter Review, The Hollywood Reporter Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat commented, \\"Boasting a particularly articulate and colorful bunch of noncelebrity talking heads, including former president Jimmy Carter, energy adviser S. David Freeman and Bill Reinert, the straight-shooting national manager of advanced technologies for Toyota who doesn't exactly sing the praises of the much- touted hydrogen fuel cell, the lively film maintains its challenging pace.\\"Vonder Haar, Pete. \\"WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?\\" Film Threat, January 25, 2006 Matt Coker of OC Weekly stated, \\"Like most documentaries, 'Who Killed the Electric Car?' works best when it sticks to the facts. Showing us the details about the California Air Resources Board caving in to the automakers and repealing their 1990 Zero Emissions Mandate, for example, is much more effective than coverage of some goofy mock funeral for the EV1 with Ed Begley Jr. providing the eulogy. As most of the lazy media, prodded by the shameless oil men in the White House, spin their wheels over false 'solutions' like hybrids and biodiesel and hydrogen and ethanol and ANWR, Korthof and his all- electric army continue to boost EV technology.\\" Coker also interviewed EV activist Doug Korthof, who stated, \\"We don't deserve the catastrophe in Iraq, and the two madmen arguing over oil supply lines seem intent on martyrdom for Iraq in a widening war. With EV, we need not get involved in seizing and defending the oil supplies of the Mideast; nor need we maintain fleets, bomb and incarcerate people we can't stand, give foreign aid to oily dictators, and so on. It's not anything to laugh about.\\"Coker, Matt. \\"Baby You Can Still Drive My Electric Car\\", OC Weekly, May 16, 2006 The film won the 2006 MountainFilm in Telluride (Colorado, USA) Special Jury Prize, the Canberra International Film Festival Audience Award, and also nominated for Best Documentary in the 2006 Environmental Media Awards, Best Documentary in Writers Guild of America, 2007 Broadcast Film Critics Association Best Documentary Feature.

The couple had three sons named Daniel, Gerard and Jan who all trained under their father to become painters.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 431‚Äì439 Robin Blake, Anthony Van Dyck, Ivan R.

He remarried in 1586 to Paulina Cuypers (alias Boschmans), who was a relative (possibly the sister) of the mother of Anthony van Dyck. The couple had 10 children of whom three sons became painters. The Virgin Mary and angels singing the Magnificat Snellinck became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1577.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 1, Antwerp, 1864, pp. 266, 299 During his initial years in Antwerp Snellinck relied more on his art dealing than on his art making to make a living. In 1577 he received his first pupil and the next one would follow only five years later. Of the 16 pupils he would receive during his very long career, only Abraham Janssens would make a name for himself. Snellinck became a poorter (burger) of Antwerp on 27 June 1597. Snellinck gradually established a reputation as evidenced by the commissions he received from Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld-Vorderort, an Imperial and Spanish army commander of German origin and Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1592 to 1594, and from the Archdukes Albrecht and Isabella, who were also governors of the Spanish Netherlands from 1598 to 1621. His appointment to court painter of the Archdukes may have been related to his work on a commission by the government of Antwerp for the manufacture of a set of seven tapestry works, which were to serve as decorations on the occasion of the joyful entry in Antwerp of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia as the new governors of the Spanish Netherlands on 10 December 1599. The tapestries together with the cartoons painted by Snellinck were later gifted to the Archdukes.Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor at the Metropolitan MuseumTriumphs and battles of Archduke Albert Series at Flemish tapestries in Spain The tapestries were then given by Archduke Albert to King Philip III before 1621 or sent to King Philip IV after the death of Archduchess Isabella in 1633. They remained in the royal tapestry collection. Snellinck also received commissions for altarpieces in Antwerp, Mechelen and Oudenaarde. Jan Snellinck died on 1 October 1638 in Antwerp. His wife died five days later. Jan Snellinck left an extensive art collection. An early 17th-century painting depicting an art collection or art gallery (Attributed to Hieronymus Francken II, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) was identified by art historian Simone Speth-Holterhoff as a representation of the art gallery or collection of Jan Snellinck. The identification was made on the basis of the presumed similarities between certain figures in the composition and contemporary portraits of known persons. It is no longer believed that this painting depicts Snellinck's collection or gallery or that of any other historic person but is rather an imaginary depiction of an art collection.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5‚Äì25 Work A masked ball in an Italianate courtyard Jan Snellinck is known for his landscapes, religious and allegorical compositions. His religious subjects are often crucifixion scenes. Snellinck also painted battle scenes and elegant companies.Jan Snellinck (I), The Battle of Moncontour, 30 October 1569 at Christie's He was also active as a painter of tapestry cartoons and a designer of prints.Hans Mielke, Antwerpener Graphik in der 2.

Bd., H. 1 (1975), pp. 29-83 Snellinck was described by contemporary art historian Karel van Mander as a battle painter and was thus the first Flemish war artist. Nine paintings of sieges by Jan Snellinck (I) were listed in the collection of Juan de Echauz in 1687.Marcus B. Burke, Peter Cherry, Collections of Painting in Madrid, 1601‚Äì1755 (Parts 1 and 2), Getty Publications, 1997, p. 105 However, very little is known about his work in this area. Like many of his fellow painters from Mechelen Snellinck painted often in watercolors and this may be the reason few of his works have been preserved. Assault on the town of Calais A Masked ball in an Italianate courtyard, depicting a ball in the courtyard of a palace seen from a high perspective (Auctioned at Christie's on 7 December 2011, London, lot 106) and an Elegant company listening to music (Auctioned at Christie's on 7 December 2011, London, lot 106), depicting elegantly dressed men and women listening and dancing to harpsichord music, show another aspect of his work. This theme of elegant balls was introduced in Flemish art by members of the Francken family of artists such as Hieronymus Francken I.Ursula H√§rting. \\"Francken.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press. Web. 7 November 2017 Snellinck is known to have painted the cartoons for a number of tapestry sets woven in Flanders. He worked on a set of seven tapestry works, which were commissioned by the city of Antwerp to be used as decorations during the celebrations during the joyful entry of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia in the city on 10 December 1599. The tapestries, together with the cartoons, were gifted to the Archdukes after the event. While the tapestries later ended up in the Royal Collection in Spain, the cartoons remained in Brussels where they were later destroyed by fire or lost. The tapestry series is entitled the Battles of the Archduke Albert and depicts the military successes of Archduke Albert in Calais, Ardres and Hulst. The designs were made by Otto van Veen while Snellinck painted the full-size cartoons. The tapestries were woven in the workshop of Maarten Reymbouts the Younger in Brussels in the period from 1597 to 1599. The central panel of each tapestry depicts a military action including portraits of some of the military leaders involved in the action including the Archduke. The borders of each tapestry are filled with war trophies, victory palms, maces and clubs while the corners are decorated with Medusa heads. Sellinck also provided a series of cartoons for armorial tapestries, with the coat-of-arms of Ambrogio Spinola (c. 1605-1619). These tapestries were also woven in the workshop of Maarten Reymbouts the Younger in Brussels.Armorial tapestry, with the coat-of-arms of Ambrogio Spinola at Sotheby's Non glorietur fortis in fortitudine sua et non- glorietur dives in divitiis sui, from the 'Parvus Mundus' Snellinck's designs were used in various publications, some of which were published by his father- in-law Gerard de Jode, a prominent publisher of his time. One of these publications was the illustrated bible Thesaurus veteris et novi Testamenti published by Gerard de Jode in 1585. The prints were designed by at least 14 Flemish artists including Maerten de Vos, Crispijn van den Broeck, Pieter van der Borcht the Elder and Marten van Cleve. To Jan Snellinck have been attributed the design of about 50 prints in this illustrated bible. De Jode relied for the Thesaurus largely on existing prints and likely ordered missing designs from his son-in-law Snellinck. Snellinck also provided the designs for the emblem book ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒøŒ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÇ. Parvus Mundus (the Small World) by Laurentius Haechtanus. This book was published by Gerard de Jode in 1579. Seven design drawings of Snellinck for the publication are in the collection of the Rijksmuseum were they are attributed to Crispijn van den Broeck. Two further designs are in the British Museum were they are attributed to Karel van Mander.
